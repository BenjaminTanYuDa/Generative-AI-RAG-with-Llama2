A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Tom Barbato, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. You may begin.\nThomas Barbato: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your time and your interest in Transcat. With me here on the call today is our President and CEO, Lee Rudow; and our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Doheny. We will begin the call with some prepared remarks and then, we will open the call up for questions. Our earnings release crossed the wire after markets closed yesterday. Both the earnings release and the slides that we will reference during our prepared remarks can be found on our website transcat.com in the Investor Relations section. If you would please refer to Slide 2, as you are aware, we may make forward-looking statements during the formal presentation and Q&A portion of this teleconference. These statements apply to future events, which are subject to risks and uncertainties as well as other factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially, from where we are today. These factors are outlined in the news release as well as in the documents filed by the company with the SEC. You can find those on our website where we regularly post information about the company, as well as on the SEC's website at sec.gov. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or correct any of the forward-looking statements contained in this call, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Please review our forward-looking statements in conjunction with these precautionary factors. Additionally, during today's call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe will be useful in evaluating our performance. You should not consider the presentation of this additional information in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We've provided reconciliations of non-GAAP to compare GAAP measures in the tables accompanying the earnings release. With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.\nLee Rudow: Thank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone. Transcat continues to make excellent progress on key initiatives across our entire business portfolio. The operating results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 have been outstanding. Turning specifically to the third quarter, consolidated revenue grew 14% to $65.2 million, driven by strong demand for our broad suite of services. Consolidated gross margin expanded 350 basis points to 32.1% and was driven by margin expansion in both our Service and Distribution segments. Adjusted EBITDA grew 39% from prior year to $9.1 million. Let me spend a few minutes on each of our operating segments, we'll start with Service. Consistent revenue growth continues to be fostered by recurring revenue streams in highly regulated markets, strong customer retention, and a differentiated value proposition. Transcat has built a very strong reputation for execution and delivering services that consistently meet the needs of our demanding customers. We continue to reside where the cost of failure is high and our services are critical component to our customers' processes. Today approximately 60% of our service business comes from the highly regulated life science sector, because of the criticality of our services, this is not an easy place to be, but it's where we want to be, it's where our tagline Calibrated by Transcat resonates, the most. In the third quarter, we grew overall service revenue by 15%, 9% was organic growth. This represents the 59th straight quarter of year-over-year service revenue growth. We have grown in the high-single digits or better for each of the last two years and we anticipate doing the same in fiscal 2024. In addition to revenue growth, we continue to focus on margin expansion. Strategically, we focus on operational excellence, which includes increased levels of automation, robotics, and process improvements. In the third quarter, service gross margin increased 250 basis points versus prior year to 32.5%. And it’s always margin gains are supported by strong organic growth and the associated operating leverage that's inherent in our Service segment. Turning to Distribution. The growth of our rental business further accelerated by the Axiom acquisition, drove gross margin expansion of 530 basis points from prior year third quarter. In fact, the transformation of our distribution segment by growth in rentals has driven approximately 1000 basis points of gross margin expansion since 2016, and a continued mix change towards rentals provides further opportunities to improve distribution margins as we enter fiscal 2025 and beyond. Internally, we say all roads lead to calibration, and our distribution and rental businesses continue to be an important generator of leads for our calibration services business. Overall, as we mentioned in the earnings release, we are extremely pleased with our performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Our adjusted EBITDA increase of 39% highlights Transcat's ability to deliver on the high expectations our shareholders have for consistent revenue and margin growth. Furthermore, the strong performance of recent acquisitions demonstrates the effective allocation of capital. We have successfully identified, acquired, and integrated dynamic companies that align with our strategy, and our disciplined approach drives differentiation, our integration process enables new acquisitions, such as the recent deal with Axiom to very quickly be accretive to the overall company. We ended the third quarter well positioned financially with strong operating cash flow generation and balance sheet capacity, both of which allow us to actively pursue the M&A opportunities that comprise our current, robust, acquisition pipeline. With that, I'll turn things over to Tom, for a more detailed review of our third quarter financials.\nThomas Barbato: Thanks, Lee. I'll start on Slide 4 of the earnings deck posted on our website, which provides detail regarding our revenue on a consolidated basis and by segment for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. The third quarter consolidated revenue of $65.2 million was up 14% versus prior year, on service segment strength and growth -- our distribution business. Looking at it by segment. Service revenue growth remained very strong at 15%, with 9% of the growth coming organically and the other 6% from acquisition. As Lee mentioned, demand remains strong in the Services segment, as our differentiated value proposition continues to resonate well with our customers. Turning to Distribution. Revenue of $23.7 million grew 10% from the prior year. We continue to see growth in the higher margin rental business, which also benefited from the Axiom Test Equipment acquisition. Turning to Slide 5. Our consolidated gross profit for the third quarter of $20.9 million was up 28% from the prior year and our gross margin expanded 350 basis points in the third quarter. Service gross margin expanded 250 basis points. The service margin increase further reflects our ability to leverage organic service growth, higher levels of technician productivity in our differentiated value proposition. Distribution segment gross margin of 31.5% was up 530 basis points, driven by a larger mix of higher margin rental revenue including impacts from the previously mentioned Axiom acquisition. Turning to Slide 6. Q3 net income of $3.3 million increased 109% from prior year driven by strong operational performance and also benefited from a material reduction in interest expense. As a reminder, early in the third quarter, we completed what we believe to be a successful secondary offering, which allowed us to pay down our revolving credit facility in full, which drove the significant reduction in interest expense. Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.38, up 81% versus the same period in the prior year. We report adjusted diluted earnings per share as well to normalize for the impacts of upfront and ongoing acquisition-related costs. Q3 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.56 increased $0.21, or 60% from the prior year. Flipping into Slide 7, where we show our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. We use adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP -- which is non-GAAP to gauge the performance of our business because we believe it is the best measure of our operating performance and ability to generate cash. As we continue to execute on our acquisition strategy, this metric becomes even more important to highlight as it does adjust for one-time deal related transaction costs, as well as increased levels of non-cash expenses, that will hit our income statement from acquisition purchase accounting. With that in mind, third quarter consolidated EBITDA of $9.1 million was up 39% from the same quarter, in the prior year and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 250 basis points. Both segments had adjusted EBITDA growth compared to last year. As always, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to operating income and net income can be found in the supplemental section of this presentation. Moving to Slide 8, operating free cash flow significantly improved from last year as cash from operations was $12.9 million higher than prior year. Third quarter capital expenditures were $800,000 higher than prior year and continued to be centered around service segment capabilities, technology, including automation, investments in our rental asset pool, and further growth projects. Slide 9 highlights our strong balance sheet. At quarter end, we had total net cash of $30.5 million, with a leverage ratio of 0.12x, and the full $80 million available under our credit facility. Lastly, we expect to file our Form 10-Q on January 31. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Lee.\nLee Rudow: Thanks, Tom. The future remains bright for Transcat. Transcat's portfolio of services is both deep and broad and positions Transcat as a true leader in a highly regulated industries we serve. Our focus on the customer experience is a top priority as we strive to increase our long-term competitive advantage. As we work our way through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we continue to be positioned to deliver high-single digit to low double-digit organic service growth for the full fiscal year. Over time, we also expect continued and sustainable gross margin expansion. We believe the Service segment has a substantial runway ahead for growth both organically and through acquisition. Our active and diverse acquisition pipeline enables strategic accretive acquisitions that drive synergistic growth opportunities and will be a key component of our go-forward strategy. As I closed last quarter's earnings call by saying at Transcat, we expect to get bigger and we expect to get better, that's the Transcat way. And with that, we can open the call for questions, operator.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question.\nGreg Palm: Hey. Hi. Good morning to everyone. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the results here.\nLee Rudow: Thank you.\nThomas Barbato: Hey. Thanks, Greg.\nMark Doheny: Thanks, Greg.\nGreg Palm: I wanted to start with gross margins, particularly in Distribution. Can you quantify maybe the mix tailwind from rentals and also trying to get a sense for what the positive impact was from, whether it's exiting or de-emphasizing some of the lower margin reseller sales as well. So I don't know, if you can quantify either of those or talk about that in a little bit more detail.\nThomas Barbato: Yeah, Greg. I mean we are not prepared to go into that level of detail. What we will say though is that, the focus on rentals continues to pay returns for us. The acquisition of Axiom that we did back in August has really gone well. The integration has gone well. And I think we are kind of, I guess, ahead of the integration curve on that one a bit. But as mix continues to change going forward and mix continues to shift more towards rentals, we'll expect to see margins continue to move up into the right, in the Distribution segment.\nGreg Palm: Okay. I mean any reason not to extrapolate what you saw this previous quarter to what you expect going forward, I mean that distribution margin was obviously well ahead of kind of what you've been expecting, but I'm not sure if there's anything one-time in there or if it's just sort of the benefit of everything that you've been maybe sort of working for over the past couple of quarters.\nLee Rudow: Yeah, Greg. I don't -- I wouldn't characterize it as any one-time event that drove it. I mean, when you think about rentals, you think about mix and in any given quarter, 90-day incremental time, you're going to have a positive or sometimes a bit of drag based upon that mix. So we had a positive mix this past quarter. We may have a positive mix in next quarter. But I think Tom's point is over time as the rental mix becomes a higher percentage of our overall distribution, we expect margins to continue to expand, that's what we expect. Quarter-to-quarter you may see another quarter like this one, we may be closer to 30%, but I think the bigger most -- more important pictures overtime rentals will continue to drive margins up as that becomes a greater part of our distribution mix. And just for a lot of new shareholders, we have, I mean the strength of our brand is really an anchor for all of this and when we started the rental business back in 2016, I mentioned, the 1000 point gain on margin, but we have the perfect infrastructure, we had the perfect position in the marketplace, and it was sort of the colocation of all these factors that help us -- helped us launch and drive this business. Now, it's a more mature business and we understand it and there's acquisition opportunities. So you've got a combination of organic and inorganic. So I think we're positive for our outlook, but the quarter-to-quarter timing, we don't want to get too specific. We just don't have that kind of insight.\nGreg Palm: Understood. It makes sense. And as it relates to M&A, can you talk about how the pipeline is evolved over the last few years? And I'm really curious, if your appetite around the type, the kind of acquisitions, the size. Has that changed you know meaningfully recently maybe last couple of quarters?\nLee Rudow: Yeah. I mean, I think that's an accurate way to look at it. We guided the market a few years ago softly. We hired a Vice President of Business Development to be more aggressive, looking for these types of opportunities that would be strategically a good fit for the business. We have integration teams in place, due diligence teams in place and so we are geared up and ready to kind of pick up the pace and even the size of deals. We showed that a little bit with Axiom. I think the pipeline that exists today also reflects that sort of an outlook. So I would expect the potential there, as we go into the future to see bigger deals, but this is not something that should be a surprise. And this is something we've been talking about, I think for years, you know building up to the point where we are today. [Multiple Speakers]\nGreg Palm: All right, I will…\nThomas Barbato: I just kind of emphasize what Lee said. That we've got a really good process, right. And we make good decisions and we've demonstrated that consistently over time and our intent is to continue to stick to our process and the deals will happen, when the deals happen.\nGreg Palm: Yeah. Okay. I will leave it there. Best of luck going forward. Thanks.\nLee Rudow: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Buck with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your questions.\nScott Buck: Hey. Good morning, guys. Appreciate the time. Lee, a little bit more on M&A. I'm curious, what you're seeing in terms of pricing when you guys talk to folks. And maybe what you're seeing from competitors in the market. Are they getting more aggressive on the acquisition front as well?\nLee Rudow: Right. Scott, we have seen in the last couple of years, more activity on the PE side in terms of outreach to potential acquisitions, but literally, I think I'm comfortable saying this to date (ph), it's very hard for us to point towards an acquisition that we wanted to make, that we weren't able to make whether it'd be price or some other factor. PE is in this space, but we understand it. This is all we do, right. So we are intimate with these companies. We know the owners. We know the process. I think it's very differentiated which is what I tried to allude to in my earnings call. So far it hasn't had an impact on any company that we can point to that we wanted to acquire. So, I don't see that changing anytime soon. There are some companies that had been acquired in this space, but the ones that we left behind because they didn't meet the criteria of our disciplined process.\nScott Buck: Great. That's helpful. And then my second one, could you talk a little bit about what drives customers to the rental business versus acquiring equipment and whether, or not how sustainable that really is, or whether we are just kind of in a peak macro environment that drives people to make that decision rather than another?\nLee Rudow: Right. Some of the factors include and I'd say, first and foremost, an urgent unexpected need. When you think about rentals, you're thinking about someone needs equipment right now and didn't necessarily see it coming, so they turn to the rental market. That would be a primary mover. You also have the difference between CapEx and OpEx. And as you go through different economic cycles, the macros we also this things cycle in and out as well a little bit, but those two sometimes balance each other off. I think the third factor is, the way we market rentals. I mean we are -- we have become over the last, I'm going to say half a decade, last three years to five years really adept at marketing. Getting into the digital world, with our brand, with our offerings, with our diverse value proposition and rentals is part of it. So I think rentals connects to service, service connects to rentals, distributions in between both. So it's that combination -- a unique combination that we bring to market. I think we factor all three of those in, the macros, the urgent, unexpected need, and the way we go about trying to grow our rental business, those are the three factors. And I see them -- I don't see any major changes on the horizon that would change me -- our way of thinking in terms of the consistency of that business.\nScott Buck: Great. I appreciate that. That's it from me, guys. Congrats again on the quarter.\nLee Rudow: Okay. Thanks, Scott.\nThomas Barbato: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I have two. First on CapEx. You referenced the need to increase for rental assets. So the CapEx in 3Q, as a pickup quarter-over-quarter is that associated with your expansion on the rental business? And then, do we see -- should we see that as the goal for a run rate, or another step up as a more normalized CapEx after the acquisition?\nThomas Barbato: Yeah. I think Martin, some of that -- I was specifically referencing the year-over-year increase that we saw in Q3, and certainly rentals played a role in that. As we continue to grow the rental business, we'll continue to see additional investment required in that space, it's just the nature of that business, right. You've got to have the assets in order to grow the business. But it will be done in a very well thought out kind of methodical way and with a focus on assets that are going to drive the highest returns.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you, Tom. My next question is on the lead generation potential between rental and distribution. Is one more effective than the other, for example as rental business a better lead-gen tool than distribution?\nLee Rudow: I wouldn't characterize it that way, Martin. And I'm not sure we are prepared to rank the two. I would clearly with distribution, people are buying test equipment. At some point, we'll have a need to have that test equipment service. So it is just such a natural connection there. And some of them need the calibration done right upfront in order to put into service. So that's hard to get better than that but with our rental customers to the degree that they're picking up test equipment users that we wouldn't otherwise have as a customer, if we didn't have a rental program, yes, that will be incremental. To the degree that our rental customers are a byproduct of our distribution customers our installed base, then it would be not incremental and I'm not sure if any better than our core distribution. So I think they're both important, but you just got to love the connection between the distribution and it is a really close connection from distribution to rentals.\nMartin Yang: Thank you, Lee. Just a quick follow-up. So the -- for both rental and the distribution, are the equipment in both services recalibrated before you deliver to your customers?\nLee Rudow: One of the things that makes us unique in our rental program is, when we get equipment in from our rental customers recalibrate everything, of course, and that's easy for us to do, and I think it's easier than other some of our competitors. But yeah, all equipment’s checked, calibrated, before it goes out to next customer. And in some cases, our customers who are renting equipment need -- need equipment that is accredited. So we go through the uncertainty calculations as well. So that would all be part of our service.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you, Lee. That's all for me.\nLee Rudow: Okay. I appreciate it, Martin.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nLee Rudow: So this is Lee, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your continued interest in Transcat. Feel free to check in with us really at any time, otherwise, we’ll talk to everyone after we send out the fourth quarter results. Thanks again for participating.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."

Good morning, everyone, thank you for joining us on the call today. Transcat delivered strong performance across our entire business portfolio again in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Consolidated revenue was up 11% to $62.8 million as demand for Transcat services continued to be strong. Consolidated gross margin expanded 230 basis points to 32% as margins expanded in both our Service and Distribution segments. Adjusted EBITDA, a key metric for us given our successful acquisition strategy, grew 24% from the prior year to $9.3 million. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was $8.5 million and $16 million year-to-date. Turning to our second quarter Service segment performance. Our differentiated suite of services continued to support performance at a very high level. We recorded our 58th straight quarter of year-over-year service revenue growth. Service revenue grew 17% including double-digit organic service growth of 10%. Recurring revenue streams and a differentiated defendable value proposition continue to foster durability and resiliency in our service growth model. And we continue to benefit from strong demand throughout multiple regulated service industries that include pharmaceutical, medical device, biomedical and as well aerospace and defense. Service gross margin was 34% in the second quarter, which represents 140 basis point increase over prior year. Margin expansion was primarily driven by leverage on double-digit organic growth, increased productivity from automation and significant process improvements throughout our network of calibration labs. Turning to Distribution for the second quarter, gross margins expanded 340 basis points from prior year driven by growth and an increase in mix of our high-margin rental business. Both core distribution and rentals continue to drive a significant number of leads and opportunities into our Service segment, supporting consistent strong organic growth. The combination of products, rentals, along with calibration and NEXA's cost control and optimization services remains unique. We've executed well expanding our addressable markets and our value proposition has never been stronger. Overall, strong performance for Transcat in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The 24% increase in EBITDA is due in part to our ability to achieve our revenue and cost synergy objectives on the companies we acquire. We start by identifying and acquiring companies that are good strategic fit for Transcat, but those are only the first two steps. Whether we acquire an adjacent company to expand our markets, a geographic footprint addition, or classic bolt-on to our core calibration services, it is through integration that Transcat drives differentiation. And we are very proud of the work our team has done on this front. You could see it, you could see it in the results, the results of their work as margins and profits increase. And of course, acquisitions will continue to be an important part of our overall growth strategy. In the second quarter, we acquired Axiom Test Equipment rentals, the largest acquisition in Transcat's history, and SteriQual a life science service company specializing in commissioning, qualification and validation services. Axiom is a great synergistic fit with Transcat's traditional rental business that was launched organically in 2015. Growth synergies between Axiom and Transcat's traditional rental business include go-to-market selling and market -- go-to-market selling and marketing strategies with complementary inventories and customer base. We expect the combined rental business to perform well, as we capitalize on what we consider a one plus one equals three opportunity. SteriQual expands our addressable market within the NEXA cost control and optimization space. SteriQual also fortifies NEXA's differentiated single-source solutions model NF3. In addition to the two acquisitions in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, perhaps what stands out most is the completion of a public offering of our common stock, which was used to repay our credit facility. The highly successful offering displayed robust demand for Transcat stock among institutional investors who recognize, understand and value our long-term demonstrated track record of profitable revenue growth, expansion of addressable markets and sustainable margin improvement. And with that, I'll turn things over to Tom for a more detailed view of our fiscal 2023 second quarter results.\nThomas Barbato: Thanks, Lee. I'll start on slide four of the earnings deck posted on our website, which provides detail regarding our revenue on a consolidated basis and by segment for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Second quarter consolidated revenue of $62.8 million was up 11% versus prior year on Service segment's strength and slight growth in our Distribution business. Looking at it by segment, Service segment revenue growth remained very strong at 17% with 10% of the growth coming organically, and the other 7% from acquisition. As Lee mentioned, we continue to see high levels of demand in our Services business. Turning to Distribution, revenue of $21.4 million grew 1% from the prior year. We continue to see growth in the higher-margin rental business, which also benefited from the Axiom Test Equipment acquisition, which closed in mid second quarter. Turning to slide five, our consolidated gross profit for the first quarter of $20.1 million was up 20% from the prior year. And our gross margin expanded 230 basis points in the second quarter. Service gross margin expanded 140 basis points. The service margin increase further demonstrates our ability to benefit from the inherent leverage in our operating model as well as higher levels of technician productivity, supported by continuous improvement initiatives like automation and process streamlining within our networks of labs. Distribution segment gross margin of 28.3% was up 340 basis points from the prior year, driven by a larger mix of higher margin rental revenue. Turning to slide six. Q2 net income of $0.5 million decreased from the prior year due to a non-recurring, non-cash charge of $2.8 million for the previously disclosed amended NEXA earn-out. The NEXA earn-out agreement was amended to recognize the expanded scope of the NEXA portfolio, which includes the acquisition of SteriQual, and this change is based on current expectations of future business performance. Diluted earnings per share came in at $0.06, the one-time earn out charge reduced earnings per share by $0.35. We report adjusted diluted earnings per share as well to normalize for the impacts of upfront and ongoing acquisition related costs. Q2 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.60 increased $0.16 or 36% from the prior year. A reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share can be found in the supplemental section of this presentation. Flipping to slide seven where we show our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. We use adjusted EBITDA, which is non-GAAP to gauge the performance of our business because we believe it is the best measure of our operating performance and ability to generate cash. As we continue to execute on our acquisition strategy, this metric becomes even more important to highlight as it does adjust for one-time deal-related transactions cost as well as the increased level of non-cash expense that will hit our income statement from acquisition purchase accounting. With that in mind, second quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $9.3 million was up 24% from the same quarter in the prior year. And adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 160 basis points. Both segments had adjusted EBITDA growth compared to last year. As always, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to operating income and net income can be found in the supplemental section of this presentation. Moving to slide eight, operating free cash flow significantly improved up $10 million versus the prior year. We've generated $16 million in operating cash flow in the first half of the fiscal year. Q2 capital expenditures were $600,000 higher than prior year and continued to be centered around Service segment capabilities, technology, including automation, and future growth projects. Slide nine highlights our strong balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, we had a total net debt of $52 million with a leverage ratio of 1.37x, and $32 million available from our credit facility. Subsequent to the end of the quarter the revolving credit facility was paid off using the funds from the secondary offering, which closed early in the third quarter. Lastly, we expect to file our 10-Q on November 1st. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Lee.\nLee Rudow: Thanks, Tom. Transcat has consistently delivered exceptional results throughout the past decade and through various economic cycles. We expect profitable growth and sustainable margin improvement to continue as we increase shareholder value. We expect our successful and unique acquisition strategy to drive synergistic growth opportunities and expand our addressable markets. We expect to leverage continuous process improvement and automation including robotics, which we're in the very early stages of developing as key enablers to future margin expansion. In other words, we expect to get bigger and we expect to get better. That's the Transcat way. As we work our way through the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we are still expecting high single-digit to low double-digit organic service growth for the full fiscal year. And we expect gross margin expansion as well. Perhaps most importantly, we expect to develop, recruit, and retain superior management and leadership throughout our organization. It's the people of Transcat that continue to move the needle and push the company to new heights. We expect to continue that as we journey into the future. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed.\nGreg Palm: Yes, thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted to start with service gross margin on an absolute basis was really strong. And I think the improvement on a year-over-year basis was the highest in some time. So I guess, it's kind of a continuation of what you've been seeing over the years, but in terms of kind of the greatest positive impacts, where are you seeing that? And should we assume that level of year-over-year improvements for the remainder of the year? Was there something kind of one-time in nature that drove some of that strength specifically in the quarter?\nLee Rudow: Okay. Well, thanks. I'll take that call -- that question, Greg. It's a combination of things that we alluded to, no surprise that strong organic growth is going to always help our margins, you know, it's inherent leverage in this business model. We talked about that through the years, and I think volume helps, volume will continue to help. So to the degree that we continue to grow organically at the rates that we have, you'll see margins improve from that. So also automation, you know, we are now probably in our third or fourth year of focusing on automation, we introduced it some years back. And we're picking up some momentum as well. There's no question in our minds as we track the data that, that's a contributing factor, and that will also contribute -- continue to contribute as you know we're certainly not at the end of our opportunities there. And process improvement in general, we've done a lot of work leaning out these labs, working on our processes from, you know, the moment that product comes into our facilities and the moment it leaves, and I just think that when we look at these processes and some of the improvements we made they're a contributing factor. So when you look forward, and most of those things are going to continue, but you know, I'm always hesitant to guide quarter-by-quarter on margins because there's different factors, you know, you get CBLs that can start up and have a short-term drag. There's other factors as well. So yes, margins will continue to improve. We expect that over time and over the next few years and it will be pretty consistent. I don't want to get into a quarter-by-quarter guidance on that, but much of what you've seen in the past, I think you'll see in the near future.\nGreg Palm: Yeah. Okay, fair enough. And then if I could just switch gears to distribution, and talk a little bit about Axiom. You know, what kind of overlap is there? Maybe you can dive into a little bit of the potential revenue synergies that could play out. And then just in terms of rentals as a mix of total distribution revenue, where does that get you now, and maybe you can just remind us of the margin structure of rental versus equipment sale.\nLee Rudow: Well, I'll start -- I'll let Tom talk about Axiom as a percent of total distribution revenue. I'll talk -- but I'll talk to the synergies, Greg. So there's some really great synergies with this deal, and that's why we're excited from the outset. And we've got inventories of potential rental equipment on their side of the business that very much will help us with our core customer base, and it goes both ways. Our inventory and their inventory, there is some overlap, but not a lot. And so, we expect to sell our respective inventories to each other's customer base. And that's a big one. The way we go to market, Transcat is more driven by -- our sales are driven by marketing, robust marketing plans, you know, domain authority on the web, link equities that we have where people recognize us from a digital world, they do a lot of traditional selling. So again, this is a synergy because we're going to use our marketing expertise to help them grow their business, and they're going to be using their feet on the street, so to speak, salespeople to help us with our, so two great synergies. And the customer bases themselves are different. And so, I'd just -- we like this deal for all those reasons. As far as -- you want to address, Tom.\nThomas Barbato: Yeah, so I think Greg, I mean, if you think of the combined distribution business now, you know the rentals is 20%, 25% -- 20% to 25% of the combined distribution now when we take what we had and add the Axiom business to it.\nGreg Palm: And just remind us on the margin structure of rentals versus equipment sale.\nThomas Barbato: Yeah, I mean, we had -- when we acquired Axiom, we had kind of disclosed it, you know the margins were 55% or better on the rental business, the combined rental business.\nGreg Palm: Okay, great. All right, I will leave it there. Thanks. Best of luck.\nLee Rudow: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ted Jackson with Northland Securities. Please proceed.\nTed Jackson: Thank you very much and congrats on a very, very solid quarter.\nLee Rudow: Okay. Thanks, Ted.\nThomas Barbato: Thanks, Ted.\nTed Jackson: I'm going to go into some weeds, sorry about that, but I always do. You did -- with the transaction closing and the money that you raised, I mean, it clearly wasn't in the current quarter, you're paying off the credit facility. So how much money did actually come in with the deal? I mean, I think, it was supposed to be 62 -- I mean $65 million or so. And then last quarter, the credit facility was at $42 million, $43 million. So when I look at your balance sheet, you know, as we kind of think about that, how much cash is on your balance sheet? And am I correct be just take the, you know, call it, 65 and subtract out 43. And so with this and your debt is down by 43, and you know, and then the differential is on in cash on your balance sheet.\nThomas Barbato: Yeah, So Ted, it's Tom, right. So we -- the net proceeds were about $75 million, right, because we did the initial deal at $78 million.\nTed Jackson: Oh, yeah this deal, that's right.\nThomas Barbato: And then there is another 10.5 under the greenshoe that was done, right. So we netted about $75 million. I'm going to talk around numbers, 50 of that went to pay off our credit facility. And we've got about $25 million net cash subsequent to the revolver being paid off. We've got about $4.5 million to $5 million of term debt that remains, and roughly 4% interest. So that will be the only interest expense we have until we kind of tap into that cash balance.\nTed Jackson: Okay. That was very helpful. Any chance you can give me just kind of the breakdown in services between service third party and freight, at least on a percentage basis, just to let me clean up my model?\nLee Rudow: Yeah, it's in the queue, which we'll be filing tomorrow. I don't have that -- I don't have that off top of my head, Ted, I apologize.\nTed Jackson: That's okay. Then with regards to going back into the margins, gross margins were really were fabulous. I mean, are we -- when we -- you know when I think about in particular on the distribution side of margins and you know the strength you had there. Is it just fair to say that you know, with the new mix in the rental business that, that's kind of the new baseline for rent -- for distribution margin on a go-forward basis?\nLee Rudow: Yes, I mean, when we -- when we did the acquisition of Axiom and we said that we expected go-forward once we got kind of into steady state that the distribution margins would be in the 20% to 30% range. So we're kind of already at the low end of that range and we still feel comfortable with that range for distribution in total.\nTed Jackson: And then on OpEx, I mean, you actually had some little better leverage in there than I expected. Just in terms of the different acquisitions and everything that's happened as of late. How should we think about OpEx with regards to at least kind of like a step up from second quarter to third quarter and you know like kind of how I -- how should we think about how that scales out as we go forward?\nThomas Barbato: Yeah, I mean, I think we should expect some continued investments, we've talked about some of the heavy lifting being behind us. But I think we're -- you know, we should expect some moderate increases going forward. We continue to invest in sales, we continue to make some investments in IT and cyber security, which you just need to do. But we believe a lot of the heavy lifting is behind us with the increases that we saw in last year, the year before.\nTed Jackson: Okay. And then one last question and then I'll get out of line. On the customer base lab front, can you talk a little bit about kind of pipeline and activity on that front?\nLee Rudow: Yeah, I'll take that one, Ted, this is Lee. Yeah, the CBL pipeline is pretty solid. In fact, that I would say it's very solid, as solid as it's ever been. We expect that to continue. I mean as long as the labor market is tight, and you know, I'm not going to suggest we're the only company that services CBLs, but it's certainly where we have an expertise level in that, that is different than our competition. I think we're really well-positioned to do well in that space. So I would expect throughout the remainder of this year and into next, that the pipeline we have will support strong growth there.\nTed Jackson: Okay. I'll get out of line. Again congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions.\nLee Rudow: Thank you, Ted.\nThomas Barbato: Thank you, Ted.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.\nMartin Yang: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question, Lee and Tom. Can you maybe talk about NEXA, give a sense of how the business has grown by itself and what are the synergies, especially revenue synergies you have seen between NEXA and your calibration in distribution business thus far? And finally maybe outlook for the NEXA combined with SteriQual, how that overall consulting business can grow in the longer term? Thanks.\nLee Rudow: Okay, so we acquired NEXA seems like about 2.5 years ago, roughly. So, the business has done really well. We acquired at the time business that since doubled in size, more than doubled in size in that period of time. And we think it's performing -- we think it's performing very well. There's a lot of synergies, Martin, that we've been able to leverage, take advantage of between Transcat and NEXA mostly, but there's two avenues of synergies that we've performed well. And one is, we've given NEXA access to our customer base, and some of that growth, since they more than doubled comes from Transcat traditional customers who are interested in NEXA services. And that's been very clear and evident -- that's been a clear and evident synergy for us. The second one has been when Transcat goes to the table and is trying to win a new opportunity, whether it be a CBL or a traditional onsite or a traditional body of work, we have NEXA sitting at the table with us often. And so, not only are we talking about winning an opportunity that we currently don't have, that our competition has or an in-house lab is running, and with NEXA sitting by our side, we're able to strengthen our value proposition. Our chances of winning increase significantly. We've won deals that we would have otherwise not won on the traditional Transcat side, because NEXA partnered with us in our proposal. So I think it goes both ways, the synergies and we've done a really nice job. And I see that continuing and maybe improving as we go forward and get to you know how to work with -- work with each other better, get to know each other's companies. This is just the early read, and the early read has been strong. SteriQual folds up really nicely under the NEXA suite because NEXA didn't offer commissioning services, and now -- now they can. And they do validation as well, which is something that NEXA did offer, but advances that value proposition. As far -- working together, we expect growth to obviously be at a higher rate, since we have more to offer, and we're not going to guide beyond that at this point other than to say that the outlook, you know, with NEXA and SteriQual together is stronger than just NEXA by itself, because the suite of services has expanded. And SteriQual is a really nice small boutique company. I think we can help them with some of the traditional ways we run and grow the business, will be beneficial to them. And it's also been beneficial to NEXA. So we expect that trend to continue for those reasons as well. Does that answer your question, Martin?\nMartin Yang: Yes, sorry, I was on mute. Thanks, Lee. So, one more question from me is on gross margin, Axiom. Can you talk about the positive benefit on gross margin due to Axiom's integration last quarter? And then do you expect a meaningful contribution or gross margin uplift from the full integration of Axiom in fiscal 3Q?\nThomas Barbato: Yeah, so Martin, the impact, you know, the impact in this past quarter was not significant. We only had seven weeks in the quarter. So it did positively impact distribution margins. But we'll see more of a full-quarter impact in this upcoming -- this upcoming quarter. But you know our intent is not to really talk about the specifics of margin in distribution and break it down into the individual pieces kind of on a go-forward basis. So we expect, as we've said before that, going forward we expect distribution margins in total to be in that 28% to 30% range. And we're already in the low end of that range. So I think, you kind of take it from there.\nMartin Yang: Thank you, Tom. That's all from me.\nOperator: And our final question is a follow-up question from Ted Jackson with Northland Securities. Please proceed.\nTed Jackson: Great, thanks. Hey, I just wanted to touch base on both automation and kind of what's going on within Ireland with, you know, kind of the acquisitions you had in that front. You brought up -- excuse me, automation as one of the drivers for margin. I know it's been an area, Lee, that you've been focused on, and you kind of, been kind of slow and methodical with it. So maybe kind of an update on, you know, kinds of things that you're automating and kind of, you know, where things stand with regards to that effort. And then behind that, kind of, you know, the -- a progress report with regards to the penetration of the Irish market. Thanks.\nLee Rudow: Okay. First I'll talk about automation and a small subset of that will be robotics. So automation is a very difficult initiative to execute. We knew that going in, but we also knew that once we did it, and for each, you know, when we made progress each element of progress that we make would (Technical Difficulty) going and arduous. But the results in the last few quarters, you could just see the margins and we can track it back to the number of technicians that we have, how efficient they are, we have productivity ratings for each technician, how often are they on the bench, how effective are they when they're on the bench, how much automation are they using, how many calibrations are they doing that are redundant to the time they spent doing automated cal, these are type of KPIs we're tracking. So we know it's working and will continue to work. What inning are we in? If I had to characterize it, I used to say we're the first, second inning. We're probably in the fifth inning of that game that we've progressed from the first, second, third inning to the fifth inning. There's still plenty of work to do. Robotics is a subset of that, you know, the Irish company we bought is a robotics company. And we are now doing mass calibrations for example in Philadelphia in our LA labs, we have two robots in each lab. In Ireland, that robotics team, they're now working on digital multi-meters, and I think on deck is temperature and pressure after that. So, again not a fast process, but robotics is actually faster than traditional automation. And like I said, we've already got robots running. And so, these are things that are going to help us get to that high 30s from the mid-30s and beyond. And that's our ultimate goal. So we're pleased with that progress. The Irish market itself, as far as developing it, for the calibration business, we bought that very, very small company, we've got some interesting plans in the works to try to grow that organically. It's really early for us to get into too many details on that. But we intend on growing our calibration business in the Irish market. And really kind of exclusively in the Irish market as far as Europe because that's where our cal lab is, that's where we'll do work, and that's where we'll grow organically. Unlike the NEXA business that's more scalable throughout Europe, because it's just easier to grow that business and to follow our customers throughout the European footprint, calibration will be in Ireland. And you know, it's early days there, but we intend on growing it organically for sure. Hope that -- I hope that's helpful, Ted.\nTed Jackson: It was. Thanks very much.\nOperator: There are no more questions in the queue. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.\nLee Rudow: Okay.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. I'd like to start with Transcat's overall performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We delivered better-than-expected revenue, margins and earnings across our entire business portfolio. Consolidated revenue was up 11% to $61 million, driven by strong demand from our unique suite of diverse complementary services including calibration, [indiscernible], instrument rentals and NEXA’s cost control and compliance services. Consolidated gross margin expanded 150 basis points to 30.9% and was driven by margin expansion in both our Service and Distribution segments. Adjusted EBITDA, a key metric for us given our successful acquisition strategy grew 16% to $8.5 million and expanded 60 basis points over prior year. Turning to our Service segment. First quarter service revenue totaled $40 million, up 18% from prior year. Organic growth was up 11% as we continue to benefit from recurring revenue streams in highly regulated markets, our unique and differentiated value proposition and growth synergies between our combined business channels. The service growth in the first quarter represents our 57th consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. That's every quarter year-over-year for a little over 14 years. We also reported a service gross margin of 32.5%, which represents a 50 basis point increase over prior year. The margin expansion, which exceeded our expectations was a result of double-digit organic growth combined with increased productivity in our lab operations. Lab operations continue to drive automation and continuous process improvement throughout our traditional and client-based lab network. Moving to distribution. First quarter gross margins expanded 270 basis points from prior year, driven in part by 15% growth in the high-margin rental business. We continue to see strong demand for our rental offering, which is an important differentiator as it enhances Transcat's ability to offer solutions to challenges our customers face. Our distribution segment, including our rental channel, continues to foster organic service growth by generating a significant number of leads and strengthening our overall value proposition. Looking at the entire business portfolio in the first quarter fiscal 2024, we benefited from our differentiated value proposition that is resonating throughout our expanded addressable markets. We also demonstrated the inherent operating leverage in our service business as we generated strong incremental gross margins from our double-digit organic service growth. The NEXA business continues to see good growth benefiting from synergies with Transcat's core calibration business. And the pipeline of synergistic opportunities is compounding at an impressive rate. While the traditional calibration service market continues to be fragmented, we're seeing similar market attributes in the spaces where NEXA competes. Early in July, we were able to capitalize on the opportunity to acquire SteriQual who specializes in instrument commissioning, qualification and validation services to pharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostic manufacturers. SteriQual also provides process engineering, quality assurance and project management to recent clients like [indiscernible], Pfizer, [Manza] (ph), [indiscernible] and others. We view the acquisition of SteriQual as another important differentiator as NEXA delivers our single-source solution platform, which complements Transcat’s calibration services. At the start of the first quarter, we also acquired the bolt-on acquisition of St. Louis based TIC Metrology Services. The newly acquired calibration operation will be integrated with our current lab in St. Louis within the next year, and we anticipate the operation will support solid revenue growth and the realization of various cost synergies as we consolidate the labs into one. Overall, our balance sheet remains strong and our current leverage ratio is 1.5 times. We've done an excellent job managing our working capital. And in the first quarter, we generated $7.5 million of free cash flow. Over the course of fiscal 2024, we expect to continue to deploy capital to margin and revenue-enhancing initiatives, along with the execution of our ongoing acquisition and integration strategy. And with that, I'll turn things over to Tom for a more detailed look at the financials for the first quarter.\nThomas Barbato: Thanks, Lee. I'll start on Slide 4 of the earnings deck posted on our website, which provides detail regarding our revenue on a consolidated basis and by segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. First quarter consolidated revenue of $60.6 million was up 11% versus the prior year on service segment, strength and solid revenue performance in our distribution business. Looking at it by segment, service revenue growth remained very strong at 18% with 11% of the growth coming organically and the other 7% from acquisition. As Lee mentioned, demand in our service business remained strong in the quarter. . Turning to distribution. Revenue of $20.7 million was consistent with prior year. Within the Distribution segment, we continue to see excellent performance in the high-margin rental business. Turning to Slide 5. Our consolidated gross profit for the first quarter of $18.7 million was up 17% from the prior year. And our gross margin expanded 160 basis points to 30.9% in the first quarter. Service gross margin expanded 50 basis points. The service margin increase further demonstrated our ability to leverage higher levels of technician productivity and our differentiated value proposition, which continues to drive high levels of demand. Distribution segment gross margin of 27.7% was up 270 basis points, driven by strong performance in the previously mentioned rental business. Turning to Slide 6. Q1 net income of $2.9 million decreased 4% from prior year, and our diluted earnings per share came in at $0.38. Net income was negatively impacted by a shift in stock-based tax benefits from Q1 of last year to Q2 of this year, as well as higher interest expense. The combined year-over-year impact of these two items was $0.11 per share. We report adjusted diluted earnings per share as well to normalize for the impacts of upfront and ongoing acquisition-related costs. Q1 adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.52. Flipping to Slide 7, where we show our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. We use adjusted EBITDA, which is non-GAAP to gauge the performance of our business because we believe it is the best measure of our operating performance and ability to generate cash. As we continue to execute on our acquisition strategy, this metric becomes even more important to highlight as it does adjust [indiscernible] related transaction costs as well as the increased levels of noncash expenses that will hit our income statement from acquisition purchase accounting. With that in mind, first quarter consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $8.5 million was up 16% from the same quarter in the prior year, and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points. Both segments had adjusted EBITDA growth compared to last year. As always, a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to operating income and net income can be found in the supplemental section of this presentation. Moving to Slide 8. Operating cash flow was $7.5 million in the first quarter, which was up significantly year-over-year. Q1 capital expenditures were $400,000 higher than prior year and continue to be centered around Service segment capabilities, technology, including automation and future growth projects. At quarter end, we had a total net debt of $46.2 million with a leverage ratio of 1.5 times. We had $37.5 million available from our credit facility as previously announced, we acquired SteriQual for $4.25 million just after the end of the first quarter, paid 100% in the company stock. Lastly, we expect to file our Form 10-Q on August 2 after the market closes. With that, I'll turn it back to you, Lee.\nLee Rudow: Okay. Thanks, Tom. I'll wrap things up by pointing out that Transcat has continued our track record of consistent performance over many, many years and over various economic cycles. We generated profitable growth and has proven to be a very resilient business model. And perhaps most important, we've assembled a very skilled leadership team, which we believe is the ultimate competitive advantage. As we look forward, we expect to deliver strong performance throughout the balance of fiscal 2024. We expect organic service growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range, and the gross margins will continue to increase over time. We will continue to execute our acquisition strategy to add capabilities and expertise, expand our geographic footprint into important regional markets and bolt-on opportunities that leverage our current lab infrastructure. From both an organic and acquisitive perspective, our focus will remain on our diverse strategic channels, including calibration, pipettes, instrument rentals and NEXA suite of cost control and compliance services. As in the past, we will leverage the highly regulated markets where the cost of failure is high and our unique value proposition resonates the most. Our go-to-market strategy remains the same that is to demonstrate to our demanding regulated customer base that Transcat can be trusted as their risk-mitigating service partner. We do this by leveraging our core competencie, which allows them to focus on theirs. In other words, we win together. As we work -- as we work our way through the second quarter of fiscal 2024, our acquisition pipeline remains strong and our initiatives designed to drive organic service growth and margin improvement continued to gain traction. Effective allocation of capital has always been a hallmark of Transcat and at the heart of our growth strategy. We expect our balance sheet to remain strong and supportive as we drive sustainable, long-term shareholder value. We like the trajectory of our business and the leadership team calling shots. In many ways, as we discuss internally amongst our leadership team, we feel like we're just getting started. And with that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please go ahead.\nGreg Palm: Awesome. Thanks. Congrats on the great results everyone.\nLee Rudow: Thanks, Greg.\nGreg Palm: I want to just maybe start with the quarter. It wasn't that long ago quite a couple of months ago since you gave an update, you nicely exceeded expectations. But more surprisingly, you raised the outlook for the full year, so -- at least on the service side for organic growth. So I'm just curious, did you see an uptick in June specifically? Or what are you seeing in July that makes you confident that one quarter out of the gates you raise the outlook for the year?\nLee Rudow: Okay. Yes, Greg, I appreciate where that question is coming from. We talk a lot about it internally, as you can imagine. It's really quite simple. We've had three consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. We like the pulse going into second quarter or at least we're almost halfway through second quarter. When we just look at our pipeline and look at the business activity, in general, we think the pulse supports being in the range that we stated. So not a major change, more of a subtle one, but I think appropriately timed.\nGreg Palm: Yes, makes sense. Any specific end markets or areas that are maybe outperforming relative to what your expectations were a couple of months ago?\nLee Rudow: I wouldn't point to anything specific other than to say, we like the way some of the synergies are working between NEXA and Transcat. I think these two businesses continue to complement one another. And by complement, I'm referring to the business activity levels that are on the increase as a result of working together versus working separately or before the acquisition. So I think that's gained traction and momentum probably as much or more than anything.\nGreg Palm: Okay. And then just shifting gears to distribution, what really caught us surprised in a positive way was the gross margin there? And I guess it’s somewhat a byproduct of strength in rental. So any way you can give us a sense of what rentals growth was and maybe ballpark where rentals is in terms of mix as a part of distribution overall?\nThomas Barbato: Yes, Greg, it's Tom. I'll take that one. I would just -- I would characterize the rental growth as stronger than -- it's at a higher level than what we're seeing on the service side for the rental [standalone] (ph) business. And it continues to perform well with -- as we've kind of said in the past, the margins are significantly favorable to the overall distribution business. So I'll also point out that we have been able to continue to do some kind of advanced buys, which continue to benefit the margins overall and the distribution side as well. So it's not only the rentals, but we see that kind of moderating as we get into the second half of the year as well.\nGreg Palm: Okay. But just to be clear, I mean, that margin in distribution specifically was, I don't know if it was a record, but certainly one of the best that we've seen since we've been tracking the company. I'm assuming that's not sort of a normalized rate going forward, but maybe you can help us figure out what the normalized run rate is, just given rentals is a bigger part of the mix because that we used to think of it as kind of a low to mid-20s, but obviously, you had a good year in fiscal 2023 and really an outsized result here in fiscal Q1.\nLee Rudow: I was going to say one thing real quick. What you're seeing on the margin side is intentional from our perspective. We've done a lot of focus on allocating dollars to where we'd like to see the mix -- where we would like to see the growth mix come from. And so, as long as we continue to invest in the higher margin mix over time and it becomes concentrated more over time, we may see this business pick up from more of the low margins, low 20s to the high 20s over time. And I think we're seeing some of that transpire as we speak in this past quarter, but I don't think it's an anomaly. I think as the mix changes by design and we allocate capital towards higher-margin channels, you're going to see that continue to increase. I mean, Tom, do you see any different.\nThomas Barbato: No. And I think -- the other thing I'll just add is that, we're making a conscious decision to kind of shed some of the lower end margin business, the traditional distribution business as well. And the growth in rentals is kind of giving us the opportunity to kind of step away from some of that less desirable business.\nLee Rudow: And we're in a nice position to do that now, Greg, versus a couple of years ago.\nGreg Palm: Yes. Understood. All right. Well, congrats again. Best of luck. Thanks.\nLee Rudow: Take care.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gerry Sweeney with ROTH Capital Partners LLC. Please go ahead.\nGerard Sweeney: Good morning, Lee and Tom. Thanks for taking my call.\nLee Rudow: Hi, good morning.\nGerard Sweeney: I wanted to spend just a little bit of time on NEXA and strategy isn't the right word, but maybe I want to see if you could talk a little bit more about the opportunity behind NEXA and sort of that entire market. I'm not sure market size opportunity, acquisitions, it's been a great purchase for you. Obviously, you're following it up with SteriQual. But just wanted to get a better feel for what really lies out there on that side of the business.\nLee Rudow: Right. Well, first, I mean, just to take one small step back to describe the different models. On the traditional Transcat side, we do calibration services. On the NEXA side, they don't perform calibration services at all, but they do everything around that, around the calibration process, they are in the calibration ecosystem. And we use the words cost control and compliance because most of their work is done in large life science companies where they're doing CMMS work, where the data is being consolidated from one system to a next, where they're looking at ways to be more efficient to lower their costs over time through anything from efficiencies of usage of the instruments, uptime, reliability could be interval adjustments involved. So they essentially improve calibration programs, we do the calibration work. And so you can see the natural complementary nature between the two. We can bring them into our clients, which we have over 30,000 when we see an opportunity to where cost is a factor or efficiency is a factor, they can bring us into opportunities when they see a problem at one of their clients because the calibration vendors performing effectively. So there's just a natural good fit and when we go together, sit at the same table, and this is probably the biggest point, Gerry. And we're sort of pitching our value prop to a customer together it is really effective. It's difficult to compete against us when all the stars aligned in that way. And that's where we're seeing the growth both from an organic Transcat perspective and also from NEXA perspective, it just kind of working well, and we think it's going to continue.\nGerard Sweeney: And certainly get that, and I apologize, maybe it wasn't 100% clear. But I was curious how big of a market maybe that cost control and outsourcing efficiency market that is NEXA. How big is that opportunity?\nLee Rudow: That's something we're working on to try to come up with a range that would be meaningful to our shareholders. I'm not going to be able to give you that size of the market other than -- today, other than to say it's significantly larger than just calibration. The calibration world is a $1.5 billion to $2 billion market in North America. It's going to be significantly larger than that because their business is driven -- well, in a sense, now that SteriQual, in particular, as part of the NEXA value prop, you get commissioning, you get startups in plants and so on and so forth. And so as capital spend to build facilities around the country, and there are certain estimates about life science capital spend that we take a close look at. But while -- that market is getting bigger and bigger for us as we expand the services within that ecosystem. So we'll try to work on a figure, but I will say it significantly could be 10 times larger in that range from the traditional calibration business. So they'll help us gain share and then we'll gain share inherently by the nature of their business and the channels that they serve.\nGerard Sweeney: So it suffice to say, it dramatically expands your addressable market and while you're pretty small nascent in that market, a lot of runway, lots of synergies and strength in both sides of the house.\nLee Rudow: Yes, we think so. And then we're doing business in Ireland as well, but the nature of their business is, it's not that difficult on their side of the equation to scale their business, even beyond [indiscernible] some work. I think we said last quarter, in Belgium and Germany because you have the same customer as another facility in Europe and in different country, it's not a big leap to service them to do an on-site visit, go back to Ireland, do 80% of the work behind the computer, so to speak, and periodic visits. So it's unlike calibration, which we will scale and have scale, it's a little bit easier as you cross border. So that's another attribute of the business that we like.\nGerard Sweeney: Got it. And how is the market fragmented? Or similar to what calibration market is, I mean, in calibration there is a couple of larger players then a bunch of small players, but how does the market look from that perspective?\nLee Rudow: Well, we're learning more and more about the market as each quarter goes by, but my answer to that question is, we think so. And part of the script in this particular release was to say that we're discovering as we do our development work on the acquisition side that is fragmented. It may be equal to or even more fragmented than the calibration business. So it lends itself to those acquisition and integration opportunities that we see with traditional Transcat. We like that, and that's why we mentioned it in the earnings script.\nGerard Sweeney: Got it. One last question. And I think this is all positive. This is what just trying to get by the way. Maybe I should notice, but what does the margin profile look like [indiscernible] actually talked about it's easier to leverage. So there -- it sounds like there are some either margin components or at least leverage opportunities on the NEXA side. Maybe just...\nThomas Barbato: It's Tom. I mean what we've said in the past, right, is that the gross margins for NEXA are generally higher than they are for the overall services [indiscernible] we'll just -- we'll kind of leave it at that.\nGerard Sweeney: Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot. Appreciate it.\nLee Rudow: You are welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ted Jackson with Northland Securities. Please go ahead.\nTed Jackson: Good morning, guys. Congrats on the quarter.\nLee Rudow: Good morning, Ted.\nTed Jackson: Just I'm going to kind of keep it to two questions and let things go forward. One is, I want to talk a little bit about the customer-based labs. In the first half of the guess calendar year, we know there was some discussion about some impact with margin with regards to some of that new stuff coming online. So I'm curious what we could expect to see with regards to kind of an operating margin in the back half of this calendar year as we roll through and that moves behind and then tied into that is what the pipeline looks like with regards to new opportunities there? And then I've got a follow-up.\nLee Rudow: Okay. I get it. So yes, CPLs, we have won a handful of CPLs early in the year or at the latter stages of last year and as is typical when you land a CPL, the first couple of quarters tend to have a bit of a drag on service gross margins just for reasons that make a lot of sense. Your new staff that lay the land, learning the processes of the lab that you're operating. So there is definitely a couple of quarters where you're not at peak efficiency. That tends to correct itself routinely over time. And I think when you look at some of the margin expansion in the first quarter, we didn't necessarily anticipate coming out of fourth quarter, some of it -- I can't put a number on it. I don't think any guy can, but some of it definitely is a byproduct of getting up and running the CBLs over a quarter or two since they started. So there's always going to be that factor. And we know how to overcome it in a relatively short period of time, but the margin drag does exist at the outset. So yes, we've made some progress there. As far as the pipeline, which is the second part of your question, the pipeline is pretty solid. It's as solid as it's ever been. And I think from a CBL perspective, from a client base lab perspective, I think that continues to be a product of the difficulty the market has signing technicians. And so, even our customers that would normally run an in-house lab, when they start to find technicians, it's not like we don't struggle, but they struggle in a different way. They don't have a technician school Transcat University that you set up. They don't have the networks that we have. And quite frankly, there's no way in the world when they hire three technicians a year and we hire hundreds or 100 technicians a year that they're going to be as proficient in. So we've got the text. We've got the backup. We can move people around like we always have. And that adds a lot of value to these client base lab, at any given time be struggling. So I think -- those types of labor type environment is always going to be a good thing for us growing our CBL business, our client base lab business and that's playing out this year as well.\nTed Jackson: Okay. So let me move on to my next which is going around NEXA and kind of the M&A pipeline. I mean -- the last time we spoke, I mean, it was clear that the pipeline for opportunities with M&A was robust, and there was a fair amount of discussion around opportunities within M&A on accentuating, adding to the NEXA portfolio and then to behold you made first acquisition on that front. What's the pipeline look like in general? How does it look like with regards to the consulting services? When you look into that kind of area on the consulting side, which I'm a little bit more interested in. I mean, where do see the opportunities? And then like kind of where do you feel like would be like the areas within kind of your NEXA business that you [indiscernible]\nLee Rudow: Well, I think we look at some of our growth -- strategic growth opportunities across calibration. We'd say this from pipettes, rentals, we say it NEXA as well. And we're always looking for acquisition opportunities that meet our sort of stringent criteria. We're very disciplined, so we don't have a track record like we do in terms of success versus lack of success unless you're very disciplined at the outset in upfront. We remain disciplined in that way. We've got a great process and a great team that does this sort of work. So just having said that sort of a foundational comment, we are looking at the NEXA space that cost control and compliance services space because we think it is a good fit. They are called an example of that. So I feel pretty comfortable saying SteriQual won't be the last acquisition we ever made under NEXA, although the Transcat way is let's walk before we run. They want to prove this out. Let's make sure that it is as well as we think it's going to fit that their leadership team can integrate this as well as we pay on integrating. I like to see things proven. And so I get the question, yes, there will be more acquisitions likely in this space. We would expect that. But we're not going to rush it until the opportunity hits us that we think fits and that our leadership team has proven that on that side of the equation, they could do well with acquisitions. I have every reason to believe and every confidence that they will, but it's just a Transcat way to prove it before we jump in too far. So I kind of want to make that comment. But again, it's the same way with all of our acquisitions. Our pipeline is diverse because we want to be able to support all these areas, and it just made sense, SteriQual is the next up the fit and there will be others in time.\nTed Jackson: Thanks. Can I just sneak in one quick last one, which is around the distribution side of the business. And you clearly are seeing some really big growth in the rental side of the equation there. Probably as you mentioned answering the prior question on the equipment actual sales side, you're exiting some of the lowering stuff where there is low margins, a lot of competition and stuff. Nothing of a secret there, how should we think about in kind of an aggregate going forward? In the past, we've kind of always [indiscernible] call it, a GDP growth line item kind of -- but I mean, as you're kind of sort of retooling that business and kind of walking away from things that you should walk away from things where there's really not much of a profit margin in [indiscernible] squeeze. Does that change that calculus in terms of how we should think about the longer-term growth for distribution?\nLee Rudow: I'm not sure I would characterize it exactly the way you did, in that we're not directly exiting the distribution business. I think it's [Multiple Speakers]. I totally get it. I'm thinking more in line with allocation of future incremental capital. As we have capital spend and we look at both get the service business over here with recurring revenue streams and driven by regulations. We got the NEXA business with cost control and how that plays between some of our other channels. We've got rentals, which is kind of like a bridge to everything. When we look at how we allocate capital, the core distribution allocation is decreasing as a percentage on a go-forward basis. And by the way, it has for the last five years and we’ve had investors over time that says, can you double the size of your distribution business? Can you make it $150 million? And we say, well, we could, but we won't, because that's not our strategy. And so as we go forward, think about we like the rentals mix more than the old line distribution mix because the margins are better and it has more of a recurring nature to it by customer. And so we incremental spent more dollars. And that's been for the last three, four, five years running, that's how we got these margins. That's why they're sustainable. This is not an overnight thing. This is something that's evolved over the last half a decade, and it continues to pick up momentum. That’s how I characterize it. So if we continue -- if you kind of draw the line out, it continues that pattern of allocation, you're going to see similar growth results, I think, in that margin over time and that profile over time. Tom, would you straight away or Mark or...\nThomas Barbato: Yes. I mean, I think ultimately, Ted started with a question of is it GDP-like growth rate. What we should expect going forward. And I would just say yes. And again, there's -- we expect to continue to perform well here. The only caution I would say is that, we have been getting some benefit from these advanced buys that we've been doing. And I think that's the piece of it that will kind of moderate as we get into the second half of the year and kind of change the trajectory on the margins a little bit. But still, I think we're talking about a mid-20s kind of market business versus a low 20s margin business that we had three or four years ago. It's more sustainable.\nLee Rudow: It's more sustainable.\nThomas Barbato: It's more sustainable. Yes.\nTed Jackson: Okay. And Tom, I did catch that comment with regards to the advanced buys. So -- but thanks for reiterating. And again, congrats on the quarter.\nLee Rudow: Thank you, Ted. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Lee Rudow for closing comments. Please go ahead.\nLee Rudow: Well, thank you all for joining us on the call today. We certainly appreciate your continued interest in Transcat. We will be participating at the Oppenheimer Conference, which is on the 26th – excuse me, which is the 26th annual tech conference for them on August 9. We'll be participating. Feel free to call us there or join us. If not, feel free to check in with us at any time. We look forward to speaking with everybody again at the end of next quarter. So again, thanks for participating.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a good day."
