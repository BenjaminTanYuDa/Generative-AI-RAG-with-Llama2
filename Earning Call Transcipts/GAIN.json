At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Gladstone. Thank you, Mr. Gladstone. You may begin.\nDavid Gladstone: Thank you, Cath. That was a good beginning and this is David Gladstone, Chairman of Gladstone Investment and this is the third quarter that we're going to be taking about for year ending December 31, 2023. Our fiscal year ends in a couple of months. Earnings conference call is for all the shareholders and analysts that follow us and we're listed on NASDAQ under the symbol GAIN and it's for capital gains, gain and then thatâ€™s the common stock and there is GAIN and GAINZ and GAINL all of these are different registered notes, so you can buy those if you wish as well. We won't be talking much about them today. Thank you for calling in. We're always happy to provide an update to our shareholders and analysts that provide are view of the current business environment. So there's really two goals here to help you understand what has happened. And even though we don't have a crystal ball, we'll give you our current view of the future.\nErich:\nErich Hellmold: Thank you and good morning everyone. Today's call may include forward-looking statements under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including those regarding our future performance. These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties and other factors, even though they're based on our current plans which we believe to be reasonable. Many factors may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements including all the risk factors listed in our Forms 10-Q, 10-K and other documents that we filed with the SEC. These can all be found on the Investors page of our website at www.gladstoneinvestment.com or the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please also note that past performance or market information is not a guarantee of future results. Please take the opportunity to visit our website, www.gladstoneinvestment.com, and sign up for our email notification service. You can also find us on Twitter @GladstoneComps and our Facebook keyword The Gladstone Companies. Today's call is simply an overview of our results through December 31, 2023. So we ask that you review our press release and Form 10-Q, both issued yesterday for more detailed information. Now I'll turn it over to Dave Dullum, President of Gladstone Investment.\nDavid Dullum: Thanks, Erich and good morning, everyone. We are happy to report that GAIN produced very good results for the third quarter of fiscal year '24 which follows on the previous solid first two quarters of fiscal year '24, which of course ends in March. We ended the third quarter of fiscal year '24 on 12/31/2023 with adjusted NII of $0.26 per share and total assets of $918 million. You'll learn more about this from Rachael Easton, our CFO, when she describes the details around that. Again, those are good results. In regards to activity for the quarter, we did invest $65 million, which helped us to fund an add-on acquisition in one of our existing portfolio companies. And again, obviously, we are always looking and doing new deals, making new investments and new acquisitions, and that continues to be our goal and objective. However, doing add-ons to certain of our existing portfolio companies is really an important aspect of our value building process, because it allows us to increase our investment in companies where we know the management team, the business itself, and where we have a strong belief in its future and it continues to allow us to really build very good value in these fundamental businesses. So we'll continue to do that as necessary and then in certain specific cases, obviously, while pursuing our main business, which is adding new acquisitions as we go along. We also, as we have in our buyout strategy, exits and we did have a very successful exit with one of our portfolio companies where we actually generated pretty meaningful realized capital gain for us of about $43.5 million. We were able to maintain our monthly distribution to shareholders at $0.8 per share or $0.96 per share on an annual basis, and we paid an aggregate supplemental distribution of $1.00 per share during November and December of 2023. Again, this large supplemental distribution is a result of the buyout strategy and is our ability to continue rewarding our shareholders with these meaningful distributions from realized capital gains, which are generated on the equity portion of our exits, in addition, of course, to the income that we continue to generate for the monthly distributions, and which is obviously very important for the basis of distributions to our shareholders on a monthly basis. Our balance sheet continues to be strong with very low leverage and a very positive liquidity position with additional availability on our credit facility. So we will continue providing support to our portfolio companies, both for add-on acquisitions, interim financing if the need arises, while actively growing our assets through new buyouts. Turning to the outlook, the deal flow, as we call it, appears to be picking up somewhat as the sellers who have been holding back over the past six months or so are testing the market. And we do hear from the merger and acquisition groups, the investment bankers who are our primary sources for new acquisition opportunities, that the backlog of new opportunities has been building. It seems like the last six months or so of last year were fairly slow somewhat, and deals were coming to the market and they were being taken back, et cetera. Now, it looks like there's continue to be a bit of an increase in this regard, maybe somewhat as a result of interest rates perhaps coming down, et cetera. But in any event, we continue working on a few new possible buyout deals, and we're currently in that early phase of the process. There does continue to be very significant liquidity in the market, meaning that our competitive situation is, of course, being challenged all the time. So we're going to remain value sensitive while we aggressively compete for new acquisitions. So in summing up the quarter and looking forward, we believe the state of our portfolio is very good. We have a strong and liquid balance sheet, an active level of buyout activity, and continued prospects of very good earnings and distributions over the next year. So I'll turn it over to Rachael Easton, our CFO and she can give more details on the finances of the quarter. Rachael?\nRachael Easton: Thank you and good morning everyone. Looking at our operating performance in the third quarter of fiscal year '24, we generated total investment income of $23.1 million. That was up from $20.3 million in the prior quarter. This increase was primarily due to increased interest income, which was driven by new debt investments made in the quarter, as well as higher dividend and success fee income resulting from fees received associated with an exit during the quarter as compared to not receiving any of these fees in the prior quarter. Net expenses as of December 31, 2023 were $13.3. This was down from $22 million in the prior quarter. This decrease is primarily due to a $10.4 million decrease in accrued capital gains based incentive fees due to the net impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses as required under U.S. GAAP. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in borrowing costs. This resulted in net investment income for the quarter of $9.7 million compared to net investment loss of $1.7 million in the prior quarter. This fluctuation is primarily due to the large accrued capital gains based incentive fees recognized during the prior quarter. Adjusted net investment income, which is net investment income or loss exclusive of any accrued capital gains based incentive fees for the quarter, was $9.1 million or $0.26 per share, up $0.02 from $8.1 million or $0.24 per share in that prior quarter. We continue to believe that adjusted net investment income is a useful and representative indicator of our ongoing operations. Consistent with the prior quarter at December 31, 2023, we continued to have three portfolio companies that are on nonaccrual status and we will continue working with those companies to get back on accrual status when possible. We believe that maintaining liquidity and flexibility to support and grow our portfolio are key elements of our success. With our three public note issuances, we have long-term fixed rate capital in place. And as announced yesterday, we have amended and expanded our credit facility, increasing the capacity to $200 million. And as of yesterday's release we had over $120 million available of that capacity. Additionally, during the quarter, we were very successful on our common stock ATM program, raising approximately $21 million in net proceeds, as well as an additional $7.7 million in net proceeds raised in January with all sales being accretive and above then-current NAV. We anticipate continuing to be active in the ATM program. Overall, our leverage remains relatively low with an asset coverage ratio at December 31, 2023 of 207%, providing plenty of cushion to the required 150% coverage. Our NAV decreased $13.01 per share for the quarter compared to $14.03 per share at the end of the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by a $1.36 per share in net unrealized depreciation on investments and $1.24 per share of distributions paid to common shareholders during the quarter of which $1 per share related to supplemental distributions. These decreases were partially offset by $1.27 per share of realized gains on investments and $0.28 per share of net investment income. Consistent with prior quarters, distributable book earnings to shareholders remained strong. We started the fiscal year with $32 million or $0.95 per share in spillover, and our monthly distribution remains consistent at $0.08 per share per month for an annual run rate of $0.96 per share. During this past quarter in November and December 2023, we paid an aggregate dollar per share of supplemental distributions. We look to continue funding future supplemental distributions as we recognize realized capital gains on the equity portion of our exits. Using the monthly distribution run rate of $0.96 per share per year and $1.24 per share in supplemental distributions paid so far in the fiscal year 2024, our aggregate estimated fiscal year distributions would total at least $2.20 per common share, or a yield of about 16% using yesterday's closing price of $13.96 [ph]. This covers my part of today's call. Back to you, David.\nDavid Gladstone:\nErich,: I just think Gladstone Investment is an attractive investment for investors at this point in time. You've got monthly distributions and then you've got supplemental distributions from the potential capital gains and other income. The team hopes to continue, of course, to show you a strong return and rather than keep talking about it, let's get some questions from the analysts and shareholders that are on the line. So, operator, if you'll come on and manage that, that'd be good.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mickey Schleien from Ladenburg Schlein from Leidenberg Capital. Please proceed.\nMickey Schleien: Yes, good morning, everyone. Dave wanted to understand from you how your portfolio companies are progressing in terms of their revenues and margins outside of consumer. We're all aware that the consumer facing companies have headwinds, but are you seeing any trends in the rest of the portfolio?\nDavid Dullum: Hey, Mickey. Good morning. Nice to talk to you. Not truly, not really. We're seeing, I would say, pretty consistent, not decline, but little slower, call it growth, but things are holding up pretty well across the board. Cost of materials in some cases, and distribution costs, which impacted some of our industrial companies, et cetera from the supply chain side, I would say those have eased a bit. So that's obviously held on that end. But frankly, all-in-all, we're seeing, I would say a fairly, just again, moderate go slow, but nothing dramatic one way or the other. Interestingly, some of our consumer products companies actually are doing reasonably well, even though, as you said, the consumer side tends to be a little bit slower right now, but generally, I'd say pretty stable.\nMickey Schleien: That's good to hear. Dave in terms of deal flow, we're hearing that part of what we're seeing, I'm not sure that's the case with you, but part of what we're seeing is private equity funds conducting dividend recaps for their stronger performers in order to extract some results for themselves and for their shareholders. Is that something you're considering doing in the near future for some of your better performing companies which also may help optimize their balance sheets?\nDavid Dullum: Right. Nothing, honestly, right now, as you know, we have done a couple of dividend recaps over the last couple of years. One company in particular we did a couple, actually, with that company and then one other one, we did one last year, and those were for all the reasons you mentioned. But as of right now, it's not something, we are always looking at it because it is a good way, especially if it's a good business that we like and we're able to sort of stay involved in a very meaningful way, as you say, extract some value for shareholders and for the management teams. By the way, of those companies, anytime we've done it, it's always been in sync with the management teams of our portfolio companies, which, as you know, is something that's really important to us. So right now I don't see that necessarily. And then my only other commentary on the market in general, as I mentioned briefly, is there seemed to been really kind of a weird last half of last year where a fair number of deals were in the market, then they got pulled, et cetera, and they seemed to be slowly coming back right now. So we are seeing a bit of, again, of a pickup, at least in the, \"deal flow\". I will tell you that the ones that we're looking at and we're serious about, as usual, we're going in with values that make sense for us and that seems to be working reasonably well. Others, frankly, there's still some crazy values that are at least being paid and we can't compete in those, are not going to compete in those. But generally, I'd say the outlook looks reasonably good.\nMickey Schleien: Oh, okay. That's interesting and helpful. Dave, my last question. The more liquid markets for credit have reopened, as we all know. Are you concerned about refinancing risk for some of your better performing investments? In other words, could some of these investments go to other suppliers of debt capital at cheaper rates than you're offering them and you'd be taken out?\nDavid Dullum: Yes, no, that's a great question, and obviously something we always look at and have looked at over many, many years. And frankly, I can only think of one company where that actually happened was an unusual circumstance. I would say the fact that our capital is really, as you know, is a combination of the debt and the equity right in the transaction. So the effective yield, so to speak, is comparison to say what just pure debt might be even with this environment where debt is coming down. I would say we're still very competitive in that regard. The relationship with the portfolio companies is probably as important as anything. And then the other aspect to that is while as you point out, the spreads might be getting a bit tighter, meaning interest rates are coming down. The availability still, I think, at least from what we're seeing, is not just all of a sudden that flood gates have opened, so to speak. Right? And you can get all the capital you need at low rates. So right now, honestly, I'm not seeing any challenges for our portfolio companies in that regard. Could it happen? Sure. But I'm not seeing anything right now and so I'm not overly concerned we're going to get taken out in any situations that we may not want to be taken out of.\nMickey Schleien: I understand. Those are all my questions this morning. I appreciate your time. Thank you.\nDavid Dullum: Thank you.\nErich Hellmold: Okay, any questions? Any further questions from people?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Joseph from Jefferies. Please proceed.\nKyle Joseph: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to get your thoughts on leverage. Obviously, you guys have a lot of dry powder right now, and it sounds like you're getting more optimistic about deal flow into '24. But just talk about where you're comfortable taking leverage to if we do get that deal flow or is it really just more of a function of the market and what deals get done?\nRachael Easton: Hey Kyle, good morning. You know, I think what you said, a function of the market and what deals we get done. So, as you know, we keep a pretty conservative leverage profile, I think, compared to the greater BDC peer group. And that's something we do believe is really important. But it's also to provide us the flexibility to support that potential new deal flow. So we want to be able to be in a position where if we need to fund new deals, we have the ability to take on additional borrowings, and it doesn't threaten breaking that 150% test.\nDavid Dullum: And Kyle, I might just briefly add to that, and as Rachel said in her part of the call, we've had a fairly successful ATM program, of course, which we sort of put in place, being able to, and we're very rigorous on what the cushion is, if you will relative to NAV, and we're going to stick with that. So we're not going to do anything crazy there, but it gives us the ability to especially looking forward in the expectation, hopefully we can start doing some newer deals and obviously using some of this leverage that we're likewise providing the support from the equity side to, as Rachel said, be able to maintain a level of the coverage ratio that's not going to put us at risk in that regard.\nKyle Joseph: Got it, very helpful. And then one followup from me, just talking about the competitive environment of essentially lower middle market private equity. Obviously you expect deal flow to pick up, but on the other side would be competition. And has the market really changed as we've seen, rates go from essentially zero to substantially higher, even with some potential cuts this year?\nDavid Dullum: Yes, I would say the market really what we're seeing and what kind of got reflected, I think near the end of last year, at least from our perspective, it may not be across the board, but I can only speak from our vision is that the rates coming, going up, of course, helped to slow down the ability for not only the cost, but also the amount of leverage was being available. So those deals I think that were getting done were to some extent perhaps being over equitized, if you will, to get the deals done. We're seeing that might change a little bit, but not to the point where I think it's again going to be all of a sudden leverage goes back to really high multiples of EBITDA. I think it's still going to be fairly cautious and careful. And again, I think again, as I said, even though there are some deals we're seeing where the relative enterprise value might be one or two turns higher than we think it's worth, clearly there are folks willing to do those deals, and if they are, I think they are having to do a little bit more equity than debt. I don't think the debt side of the equation has gotten to the point yet where we're back to much higher leverage per transaction even at these higher values. Does that make any sense?\nKyle Joseph: Yes, very helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDavid Dullum: Yes sir.\nErich Hellmold: Okay, next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryce Rowe from B. Riley Securities. Please proceed.\nBryce Rowe: Thanks a lot. Good morning.\nDavid Dullum: Hey, Bryce.\nBryce Rowe: Hey Dave. Hey, how are you?\nDavid Dullum: Good, awesome.\nBryce Rowe: Hey, I wanted to ask about the upsized credit facility you've had. I guess some changes. I think you took the available amount down last quarter and obviously it's moved back up. So maybe there was a bit of a process to get to that higher level. Could you just, if you can kind of talk about that process and did you add some banks to the facility? Just any kind of detail there would be helpful, thanks.\nRachael Easton: Yes, absolutely. Good morning, Bryce. So yes, we were really excited to announce yesterday that we have expanded the credit facility up towards $200 million. When we went through our regular amendment process, which closed in October at the beginning of the quarter and we weren't able to announce in our last earnings call, we had taken it down to $135 million and that was a result of just losing a couple of banks during that process. We were working on this expansion. Unfortunately, we couldn't get the two to close at the same time. So, we were able to increase the facility by bringing in a new bank. We brought in Fifth Third, and we were also able to increase one of the other bank's commitments as well to get back up to that $200 million amount. And we believe this additional capacity is really important in providing flexibility as we contemplate future pipeline in the deal flow process.\nBryce Rowe: Got it. That's helpful context, Rachael. And then maybe one for Dave. You had this add-on opportunity for an existing portfolio company here this quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about that? And then maybe other opportunities in the pipeline for your existing portfolio companies to do add-on acquisitions. Thanks.\nDavid Dullum: Sure. So, that particular one, Bryce, was a company that we've had in the portfolio for a few years. It's somewhat of an industrial based business. We've been really improving it all around, both from the overall management level, et cetera. And we had an opportunity to acquire a fairly substantial sized business to bring into it, which was really integrated very nicely with the product. And it not only gave us additional capacity, manufacturing capacity, but also distribution and access, actually in Europe and other parts of the country. So we took our company from order magnitude. Now, I'm not going to give you specifics, but order magnitude, about $40 million to $50 million in revenue to over $100 million in revenue, and very significant increase in the EBITDA. And I would say that the integration has come along really well. So we've clearly enhanced the overall value. So I feel really good about that transaction without, by the way, getting it that particular company in a very highly leveraged situation, relatively speaking, so really, really good opportunity. So we'll continue and yes, some of our existing portfolio companies are seeing some opportunities like that, and we continue. Some of them are on the smaller end. Some of them do not require additional financing from GAIN per se because their own balance sheets are strong enough to handle some smaller add-ons where it really makes some sense, whether it be a product line or what have you. And so yes, we continue to do that because frankly, as I said in my remarks, and you appreciate, if we can keep adding value to an existing portfolio company again, where overall we know it and it's accretive, we're happy to do that. One other company, another one of our portfolio companies actually, where they made a fairly good sized acquisition and we were able to go back in as well and help to add to that particular investment as well. And so the short answer is yes, we're going to continue looking at those opportunities.\nBryce Rowe: That's great. I appreciate the time.\nDavid Dullum: Yes, sir. Thank you.\nErich Hellmold: Question?\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to David Gladstone for closing comments.\nDavid Gladstone: Thank you. That was a good quarter and I think when we put the numbers together for the year end of March 31, one of our best years ever, I think we'll probably be over $1 billion in assets by then. But anyway, I don't have a crystal ball, so I have no idea what's really going to happen. But we're guessing that things are back strong and growing. A lot of people in the investing world are thinking that business development companies like this one are a place to put some money. But thank you all and that's the end of this presentation.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Please proceed, sir.\nDavid Gladstone: Thank you, Latonya and good morning to everybody. This is David Gladstone, Chairman of Gladstone Investment and this is the second quarter end in our fiscal year that in March of 2024.

You can also find us on Twitter at Gladstone comps and our Facebook keyword there is, the Gladstone Companies. Today's call is an overview of our results through September 30, '23 so we ask that you review our press release and Form 10-Q, both issued yesterday for more detailed information. And with that, I'll turn it over to Dave Dullum, President of Gladstone Investment.\nDave Dullum: Thanks, Mike. So good morning, everyone. We are happy to report that Gladstone again produced very good results for the second quarter of fiscal year '24. This ends March 31, '24 and this is following on the previous really solid first quarter of this fiscal year. We ended this second quarter with adjusted NII of $0.24 per share, total assets of $928 million which is up from about $847 million at the prior quarter end. So deal activity is obviously important to us. And for this quarter, we invested approximately $65 million and that was between 1 new buyout investment and we made an add-on acquisition to 1 of our existing portfolio companies. As we've said before and we'll continue forward, we will continue to seek these add-on opportunities, as they do allow us to increase, obviously, our investment in companies where we know the management team, we know the business and we have a strong belief in that company's future and therefore, we can and do generally build incremental equity value. It's a good way of continuing the growth of our assets and the underlying fundamentals of the business. So actually in this regard and subsequent to the quarter end, we invested an additional $65 million to fund another add-on acquisition to another 1 of our existing portfolio companies. So following in the same vein and we find that this sort of activity these days is actually a good area for us to look at, as we continue to build overall incremental value in the portfolio. We also, though, did have a successful exit of 1 portfolio company and this generated a meaningful realized capital gain of around $43.5 million [ph]. So again, we continue to make new acquisitions, add-on to our existing portfolio companies and likewise, exit companies when it makes sense and that, of course, generates some capital gains. We also maintained our monthly distribution to shareholders at the $0.08 per share which is $0.96 per share on an annual basis and then paid a supplemental distribution of $0.12 per share in September of this year 2023. Subsequent then to the quarter end, we declared aggregate supplemental distributions of -- per share to be paid incrementally in November and December. So in aggregate, it will be $1 [ph] being paid between those 2 months. Now this fairly large supplemental distribution highlights the strength of our buyout strategy and our ability to reward our shareholders with a meaningful supplemental distributions from these realized capital gains which are generated on the equity portion of the exits. So in addition, of course, to the income which we generate on a monthly basis to be able to fund the monthly, at least currently $0.08 per share. The balance sheet, of course, is important and that continues to be strong. We have low leverage, pretty positive liquidity position with additional availability on our credit facility. So we obviously continue to provide support to our portfolio of companies for these add-on acquisitions -- and also any interim financing if the need arises, of course, why we continue to actively grow our assets through new sales. In that regard and looking forward, currently, deal flow seems to be picking up sellers who have been holding back in the past 8 months, I believe, are starting to test the market. And we do hear from a lot of the merger and acquisition and the sell-side investment bankers that we deal with that the backlog of new opportunities seems to be building. There is -- obviously, continues to be significant liquidity with buyout funds that we compete with which reinforces a strong competitive environment, so we must remain value-sensitive, while aggressively competing for new acquisitions. One thing we should note in this environment, of course, with interest rates being relatively high with somewhat lack of liquidity in the debt side from the commercial banks which generally provide the leverage to the traditional private equity fund, who we compete with, we have the benefit of providing both the debt and the equity when we make an acquisition. So we believe that looking ahead that we have somewhat of a competitive edge because we are the supplier of the debt and the equity when we do compete for a specific new potential add on -- a new potential investment. So in summing up the quarter and looking forward, we believe the state of our portfolio is very good. We have a strong liquid balance sheet. We have an active level of buyout activity and continued prospects of very good earnings and distributions over the next year. So with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Rachael Easton, for some more details.\nRachael Easton: Thank you, Dave and good morning. Looking at our operating performance. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we generated total investment income of $20.3 million, consistent with the prior quarter. while total investment income in the aggregate did not change quarter-to-quarter, there were fluctuations components, including increased interest income driven by new debt investments -- and increased SOFR as well as lower dividend and success fee income which is variable in timing and did not reoccur in the current quarter. Net expenses as of September 30, 2023, $22 million, up from $11.9 million in the prior quarter. This was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in accrued capital gains-based incentive fees due to the net impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses as required under U.S. GAAP as well as an increased margin. This resulted in a net investment loss of $1.7 million for the quarter, primarily due to the large accrued capital gains-based incentive fees recognized during this period. Adjusted net investment income which is net investment income or loss exclusive of any accrued capital gains-based incentive fees for the quarter was $8.1 million or $0.24 per share, down just a penny from $8.5 million or $0.25 per share in the prior quarter. We continue to believe that adjusted net investment income is a useful and representative indicator of our ongoing operations. Consistent with the prior quarter, at September 30, we continue to have 3 portfolio companies that are on nonaccrual status. And we will continue working with those companies to get back on accrual status. We believe that maintaining liquidity and flexibility to support and grow our portfolio are key elements of our success. With our 3 public note issuances, we have long-term fixed rate capital in place. And as of yesterday's release, we had approximately $66 million available on our newly amended and extended $135 million credit facility. Additionally, during the quarter, we raised approximately $4 million in net proceeds under our common stock ATM program, all sales of which were above NAV. We anticipate continuing to be active in the ATM program. Overall, our leverage remains relatively low with an asset coverage ratio at September 30, 2023, of -- providing plenty of cushion to the required 150 coverage. Valuation to the aggregate were up $48.7 million, driven by unrealized gains at a portfolio company that was marked up to reflect the fair value of the expected exit which took place in October as well as higher valuation multiples across the portfolio and increased performance at many of our portfolio companies. Our NAV increased to $14.03 per share compared to $12.99 per share at the end of the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by $1.44 per share of net unrealized appreciation of investments, partially offset by $0.36 per share of distributions paid to common shareholders during the quarter, of which $0.12 per share related to a supplemental distribution and $0.05 per share of net investment loss. Consistent with prior quarters, distributable book earnings to shareholders remains strong. We started the fiscal year with $32 million or $0.95 per share in spillover and our monthly distribution remains consistent at $0.08 per share for an annual run rate of $0.96 per share. During this past quarter, in September 2023, we paid a $0.12 [ph] per share supplemental distribution. And as you heard in October, we declared an additional aggregate $1 per share supplemental distribution to be paid in November and December 2023. We look to continue funding future supplemental distributions, as we recognize realized capital gains on the equity portion of our exits. Using the monthly distribution run rate of $0.96 per share per year and $1.24 per share in supplemental distributions [indiscernible] in the fiscal year 2024. Aggregate estimated fiscal year distributions would total at least $2.20 per common share or a yield of about 16% using yesterday's closing price of $13.74. This covers my part of today's call. Back to you, David.\nDavid Gladstone: Okay. Thank you. Very nice, Rachael. Well, actually wonderful news for everybody, a very nice report by Dave and Michael, information for shareholders. I think this completes everything in terms of the past. This call and the 10-Q filed by the SEC yesterday -- to the SEC should bring everyone up to date. So for the quarter ending September 30, 2023, the company paid a regular distribution of $0.08 per share per month or $0.24 per share for the quarter. Now skipping ahead and looking at the quarter ending December 31, 2023, the company also has declared but not yet paid 2 more supplemental extra distributions. The November 17 distribution is $0.12 per share and December 15 distribution is $0.88 a share. So aggregate supplementals for the quarter ending December 31 will be $1 per share. And then if you include the distribution declared -- is $0.24. That's $1.24 for the quarter. So please be aware that the record date for the November supplemental distribution is November 7. So you have to buy before then. And the same thing is true for the December supplemental distribution, is December 5. So you need to own the stock before those dates in order to get the supplemental distributions. So get busy and get out and buy some shares so that you get those supplemental distributions. The team has reported solid results for the quarter ending September 30, 2023 including buyout investments, exit activity and associated net realized gains. We believe the team is in a great position to continue these successes through the remainder of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. And I'll say this again, I keep saying it and for those of you who have listened to me, you've gotten some real good extra dividends. We believe Gladstone Investment is an attractive investment for investors seeking continuous monthly distributions and the supplemental distributions from potential capital gains and the other income that we generate. The team hopes to continue to show you a --but I'm going to stop at this point and let's get some questions from our analysts. Some of you teed up really early this morning so we're ready for you. So -- would you come in and tell them how they can ask a question.\nOperator: We will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mickey Schleien with Ladenburg.\nMickey Schleien: I want to start by congratulating you on the sale of Counsel Press which is a very impressive outcome and I'm sure shareholders are going to be very pleased with the dividends that are related to that. Dave, I wanted to ask you about a couple of investments. First, E3 operates in the oil and gas sector which is obviously cyclical. So I want to know what is it about this company and the deal structure that gives you comfort ahead of a potential slowdown in the economy and making an investment in a cyclical sector?\nDave Dullum: Mickey, good. Thanks for the question. Yes, you're right, E3 is a little better the norm for us in that regard. What they do, though, they mainly provide a -- I call it, a product that goes mainly to the guys that do the fracking. So if you understand where you go from the well to the pipeline coming out from a fracking situation, you have times when these valves that they have will basically -- the pressure gets too high and they sought to blow, right? And the way they mechanically do it, have done it for many, many, many years, is literally have somebody take and go internal ranch and relieve a valve and it can be very dangerous. What these guys have developed over the last number of years is a system that sits on a skid about the size of a decent-sized table, if you will, that actually control electronically. So it understands pressure building and has a relief. And they've got some technology in the valve system itself that allows for; I'd call it, some proprietariness to the system. So they are really in a position where as long as you're doing some of the fracking and unless that business completely went to 0, they're going to have -- still have a very substantial opportunity. They rent their product. The payback literally is like less than 4 months on what they rent and they are building them as fast as they can make them. So that's kind of a high level. And you're right, it can be cyclical but given the profitability, given the level of cash that they have, we believe even if we had somewhat of a slowdown, we would be in really good shape going forward. It's a pretty unique situation, frankly and by the way, run by very experienced folks and we went out and brought in some very experienced management to the deal guy came in from Halliburton, who is the actually CEO. We brought him in. So I think we've got a really great management team that knows the industry.\nMickey Schleien: That sounds really interesting, Dave. My other question is about SSCG which is, as you know, an electrical manufacturer and that can also be cyclical. But in this company, you're in the second lien. So tell us the nature of the add-on acquisition, what's giving you comfort to be in a second lien in a cyclical business and also who owns the first lien that's ahead of you.\nDave Dullum: Okay. SFEG, I want to be sure we're on the same page, it's not an electrical business really. It really is a combination of a couple of other companies that provide product like welding devices, cutting and so on, going to pipelines and what have you which is broader than certainly oil and gas as well. So we had the base business, SFEG which is based in Houston and we acquired a company called Climax which is actually based in Portland, Oregon that has operations, frankly, throughout the world. And that's SFEG -- by the way. We made an acquisition with them in France about 2 years or so ago that expanded our product line. We also have operations in the U.K. So the combined entity today, by the way, is something in excess of $100 million in revenues and a very significant EBITDA sort of close to 20% EBITDA margins. So collectively, they have a very broad suite of products going to mainly pipeline both in terms of field operations as well as in the manufacturing process, PAUSE and again, a very strong management team. And so we like the whole thing. It's very strong. We put in a significant amount of money. It's a big investment for us. We have significant ownership. And in our general structure, even though we might have a second lien, a lot of times, the first lien is going to be the lender, the bank who we bring in as a revolving line of credit. And so that's not unusual, frankly, that we would have someone in a first lien position above our debt which looks -- the language might look more like a mezzanine or what have you. But again, of course, we own a significant portion of the equity. I don't know if that helps or not.\nMickey Schleien: Just to make sure I understand the first lien then is a bank revolver probably with accounts receivable and inventory, as the collateral and you have claims on the rest of the company's assets. Is that correct?\nDavid Gladstone: Correct. Yes.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it.\nDave Dullum: And again, that's not unusual, right, for us -- certain bigger companies.\nMickey Schleien: Sure. I understand. That's all my questions. And again, congratulations on a very good quarter.\nDave Dullum: Great to see you recently, by the way. Thanks for coming.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryce Rowe with B. Riley.\nBryce Rowe: And congratulations on the exit, David. I wanted to first ask about PAUSE the level of spillover. Rachael, you did hit on what spillover was as of the end of the last year. Can you give us an update as to where that sits now? And if you could give it to us pro forma for the dividends declared for the December quarter as well as this gain that you just realized.\nRachael Easton: Thank you for your question. So that is correct we -- I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we started the year with that $32 million or about -- share. In spillover, we do not provide updates during the quarter. But I think given that we plan to declare a regular monthly distribution of $0.08 per month, coupled with the dollar that we declared supplemental and an additional $0.24 in supplemental. We have well made our way through that spillover that we started the year with. I can tell you that is the amount we are comfortable with, rolling into next year but I cannot, unfortunately, give you update kind of mid-quarter and where we are.\nBryce Rowe: Understood. Let's see. In terms of the fair value marks within the portfolio in the quarter here, Dave. I mean, obviously, they reflect the council press exit. But also, as you noted in your prepared remarks, good upside from several different investments in the quarter. You mentioned higher multiples as well as better comp performance. Could you maybe expand on that comment a bit?\nDave Dullum: I'll take a shot and then certainly, Rachael, please feel free because you -- I would say that of all of the portfolio companies there are, the majority of them were benefited by a little bit of up in multiple -- as well as up in EBITDA. And then some of the others which are still fundamentally very strong companies just quarter-to-quarter, even though they were slightly off EBITDA-wise, slightly up with multiple. And so there were some changes in probably 6 or so of the portfolio companies where we had a slight, again, change downwards from the prior quarter but nothing where I am certainly concerned about from just a valuation perspective. Rachael, you got any you want to add to that?\nRachael Easton: I don't think so. And if there's something specific you'd like to call out. I think we saw some really great unrealized depreciation at companies like educators, Brunswick Bowling -- which Dave, you touched on earlier.\nDave Dullum: Okay. That's good color and helpful.\nDavid Gladstone: Yes, I think, Bryce, again, without going through each company per se, what have you, I don't see any significant change, as you know, quarter-to-quarter, month-to-month, just because, again, as you know, somewhat it gets magnified, right? If you have 7 or 8x multiple and you get a modest change in EBITDA, that multiple can have a little bit of $1 million as an example. I'm making that up of a reduction in a valuation on something that might be worth $30-plus million. I mean, so again, I don't see any significant concerns relative to the few that we did have on a slight decline valuation-wise.\nBryce Rowe: Okay. That's helpful. And then last 1 for me, just looking at the balance sheet structure. You're using the credit facility a bit more with portfolio growth. And if I heard you correctly, $65 million into SFEG would likely kind of call into using that even a bit more unless you access other sources of capital. So if you could just speak to your comfort with the capital structure at this point, would you look to add more notes like you've done here recently? Are you comfortable with where the balance sheet structure is or the capital structure is at this point?\nDave Dullum: Yes. Well, again, I'll have Rachael add in here. But that amount that we have currently available on our line, of course, is the net amount currently based upon the cash coming in from, say, consoles, et cetera, the new investment, et cetera. So as of where we are today, that certainly is available capital for anything net new that we plan to do. We also, obviously, as I mentioned -- generally, we're in the market sometimes looking to exit certain of our portfolio companies and is some of that might occur over the next, say, 6 months or so, that cattle likewise will obviously come in. So short answer is right today, yes, we feel pretty good about where we are. We always will continue obviously exploring the idea of going out and doing another, say, baby bond. And as we look forward to our deal flow and the opportunities coming forward, we certainly would look to potentially access that market and have the availability then on our line to provide the ups and downs. So today, I think we feel we're in good shape, Rachael.\nRachael Easton: I completely agree, Dave. I think 1 other thing to add to that is continuing to use our ATM program when...\nDave Dullum: Right. Certainly supplemental but we don't certainly concern about anything from a ratio perspective in terms of the fixed asset or the asset coverage ratio. And again, we are pretty active in keeping in touch with what's going on in the market. So if we need to do something, we'll do it. But right now, we feel pretty good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derek Sun [ph] with Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: I wonder if you could shed a little more light on the macro picture as we approach year-end and David budget projections for '24. Are any sectors seeing more headwinds than others? Or any sectors or end markets seeing pushback and passing price through to customers.\nDave Dullum: Sure. No surprise perhaps the companies that we own that are in the say, consumer product space. I would say we've obviously seen a little softness in some of those, nothing of any great significance at this point. But -- and we certainly have been able to pass through any cost increases that we were having, a lot of it, as you know, coming from the earlier increases in supply chain transportation costs, et cetera. We've seen that come down pretty significantly and that's been a positive thing. So in terms of us forward, even though in a few cases, we might be seeing some softness at the retail PAUSE level in terms of revenue. Likewise, we're able to offset that to some degree with lowering our own costs. So from a margin perspective, we've actually seen a few cases where margins have improved even though overall volume has gone down. So net-net, I think we're not seeing any now any big issues but clearly anticipating there could be a bit of a slowdown in some of the consumer-type product areas from the -- some of the business service areas and we have a fairly significant investment in that category as you might know, most of those companies are pretty much operating according to plan. One or two might see a little bit of a slowdown depending on what the sectors are in. But again, everything seems to be holding up fairly well. And as we look forward, obviously, with our portfolio companies, we're trying to be curative. They're wanting to be sure that they maintain margin, not just look to the top line. So all in all, I think we feel reasonable again, in good shape going forward.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. Mr. Gladstone. I'd like to turn it back to you for closing comments.\nDavid Gladstone: All right. Thank you all for calling in. It was a good quarter, last quarter and this quarter that we're in, it looks like a super quarter. So we're all feeling good today and see you next time. That's the end of our comments.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And thank you for your participation and have a great day."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, David Gladstone, Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Sir. You may begin.\nDavid Gladstone: Thank you, Latanya. This is David Gladstone. This is our first quarter fiscal year 2024. It ends June 30 and the yearend is nine months or so away, earnings conference call, and this is for shareholders and analysts of Gladstone Investment. We're listed on NASDAQ, trading symbol G-A-I-N for the common stock and then we have three other listings, GAINN and GAINZ and GAINL. These three different registrations are preferred stock or in some cases, miniature bonds as they call them. Thank you all for calling in. We're always happy to provide an update to our shareholders and analysts, providing a view of the current business environment. The two goals of this call, as it always is, is to help you understand what happened in the last quarter and to give you our current view of the future and now we hear from our General Counsel and Secretary, Michael LiCalsi.\nMichael LiCalsi: Good morning, everybody.

You can also find us on Twitter @GladstoneComps and on Facebook, keyword, The Gladstone Companies. Today's call is simply an overview of our results through June 30, '23. So we ask that you review our press release and Form 10-Q both issued yesterday for more detailed information. And with that, I will turn it over to Gladstone Investment President, Dave Dullum. Dave?\nDave Dullum: Thanks, Mike and good morning to everyone on the call. I am pleased to report that we did have a very good first quarter of fiscal year '24 and that, in fact, follows on the previous very solid fourth quarter we had of fiscal '23 We ended this first quarter on 6/30/23 with adjusted NII of $0.25 per share and total assets of $847 million and those assets -- that amount of assets is up from $766 million which was at the end of the prior quarter. So the deal activity for this quarter actually was pretty good, in that, we invested an aggregate of approximately $50 million in one new buyout investment and add-on acquisition to one of our existing portfolio companies and we were able to make an investment to facilitate a dividend recap of another of our current portfolio companies. This recap actually helped to produce both a realized capital gain and other income for the quarter. We actually find that these add-ons and these dividend recap opportunities, they are important to pursue and they do allow us to increase the investment in an existing company and in fact one where we would know the management team well, we know the business and we have a strong belief in the future, so we can build incremental value in that particular company. So a dividend recap is a positive thing and we might do it again from time to time as may come up. We were also able to maintain our monthly distribution to shareholders at $0.08 per share or $0.96 per share on an annual basis. We also paid a supplemental distribution of $0.12 per share in June and then subsequent to this quarter end, we declared another supplemental distribution of $0.12 per share, which will be paid in September 2023. We currently right now anticipate being able to fund future supplemental distributions, as we continue to recognize realized capital gains on the equity portion of future exits and potentially from other recap positions. Our buyout focused strategy, which does differentiate us from other BDCs continues to successfully generate both the income for the monthly distributions as mentioned and also capital gains on the equity when comes from along the supplemental distributions. During the quarter, we also successfully issued $74.8 million in new public-to-traded 8% notes and those go along the other two public-to-traded notes that we have currently and these notes will mature in 2028. Our balance sheet continues to be strong. We have low leverage and a very positive liquidity position, including additional availability on our credit facility. So we will continue being able to provide support to our portfolio companies for add-on acquisitions, which is one of the areas we've been focusing on as also interim financing if the need arises, why we actively grow the assets from new buyouts? So looking ahead, the deal flow, first it seems to be picking up somewhat. The sellers who had been somewhat holding back over the past six months seem to be testing the market. We of course are in the market all the time and what we can gather from the merger and acquisition groups in the sell-side investment bankers is that the backlog of new opportunities seems to be building and we may be seeing an increasing supply of buyout opportunities going into the end of the year. So there continues therefore the significant liquidity in buyout funds which does reinforce a strong competitive environment that we face. As a result of that, we will remain value-sensitive, while we aggressively compete for new acquisitions that really do fit our criteria. We are currently in the due diligence phase on a few new buyout opportunities. So we will see how that plays out over the next few quarters as far as adding to our portfolio, which obviously continues to be our main objective and goal as we grow the assets of Gladstone Investment Corporation. So in summing up the quarter and looking forward, we believe the state of our portfolio is very good. We have a strong and liquid balance sheet, an active level of buyout activity, and a continued prospect of very good earnings and distributions over the next year. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to our CFO, Rachael Easton, so she can give you a bit more detail on that. Thank you, Rachael.\nRachael Easton: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Looking at our operating performance in the first quarter of fiscal year '24, we generated total investment income of $20.3 million, up from $19.9 million in the prior quarter. This increase was primarily due to increased interest income, which was driven by an increase in the weighted average yield on our debt investment to 14.7% from 14.3%, which was directly correlated to increased LIBOR. This increase in total investment income was limited as our dividend and success fee income, which is variable in timing, was not as high as the prior quarter. Net expenses as of June 30, were $11.9 million, up from $10.2 million in the prior quarter. This was primarily due to an increase in capital -- accrued capital gains-based incentive fees due to the net impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses, as required under US GAAP, as well as an increase in interest expense, which was primarily due to the new 8% notes issued during the quarter. This resulted in net investment income for the quarter of $8.4 million, or $0.25 per share, down from $19.6 million, or $0.29 per share. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $8.5 million or $0.25 per share, down a $0.01 from $8.6 million, or $0.26 per share in the prior quarter. We continue to believe that adjusted net investment income, which is net investment income exclusive of any capital gains-based incentive fees, is a useful and representative indicator of our ongoing operations. Consistent with the prior quarter, at June 30, 2023, we continue to have three portfolio companies that are on non-accrual status, and we will continue working with those companies to get back on accrual status, if possible. We believe that maintaining liquidity and flexibility to support and grow our portfolio are key elements of our success. As Dave mentioned, during the quarter, we successfully issued $74.8 million in new publicly traded 8% notes maturing in 2028. With these new notes and our prior two public issuances, we have long-term fixed-rate capital in place. And at June 30, 2023, we had over $133 million available on our $180 million line of credit. Additionally, in July, we raised approximately $4 million in net proceeds under our common stock ATM program, all sales of which were above NAV. We anticipate continuing to be active in the ATM program. Overall, our leverage remains relatively low, with an asset coverage ratio at June 30 of 211%, providing plenty of cushion to the required 150% coverage. Valuations in the aggregate remained relatively flat this quarter, resulting from offsetting fair value fluctuations. This was led by higher valuation multiples across the portfolio and was offset by decreased EBITDA at a few portfolio companies. Our NAV decreased to $12.99 per share, compared to $13.09 per share at the end of the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by $0.36 per share of distributions paid to common shareholders during the quarter, of which $0.12 per share was related to a supplemental distribution. This was partially offset by $0.25 per share of NII generated during the quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, distributable book earnings to shareholders remained strong. We started the fiscal year with $32 million, or $0.95 per share in spill over, and our monthly distribution remains consistent at $0.08 per share for an annual run rate of $0.96 cents per share. During this past quarter in June 2023, we paid a $0.12 per share supplemental distribution, and in July we declared an additional $0.12 per share distribution to be paid next month in September. We look to continue funding future supplemental distributions as we recognize realized capital gains on the equity portion of exits. Using the monthly distribution run rate of $0.96 per share per year and $0.24 per share in supplemental distributions paid or declared so far in the current fiscal year, our aggregate estimated fiscal year distributions would total at least $1.20 per common share, or a yield of about 8.9% using yesterday's closing price of $13.46. This covers my part of today's call. Back to you, David.\nDavid Gladstone: All right. Thank you, Rachael. That was a very nice presentation by Rachael, and also a good one from Dave and Michael. This is good information for our shareholders. This call and the 10-K filed with the SEC yesterday should bring everybody up to date. The team has reported solid results for the quarter, including the buyout investment activity and there's exit activity associated with the net realized gains that's been increasing. We believe the team is in a great position to continue these successes through the remainder of our fiscal year ending March 31, 2024. I just say it again, I believe Gladstone Investment is an attractive investment for those investors seeking continuous monthly distributions and supplemental distributions from potential capital gains and other income. Team hopes to continue to show you strong returns on your investment and 8.9% yield on a current basis is pretty good. So now I'm going to stop and ask our analysts and shareholders if they have some questions, they'd like to ask us. Latoya?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Mickey Schleien with Ladenburg. Please proceed.\nMickey Schleien: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Dave, I'd like to follow up on your investment and degree [ph]. I see that this quarter you invested $30 million as a follow-on, and then subsequent to the quarter you announced you're providing funding to support MSouth acquisition of Exposition Holdings, and that will be joined with Nth Degree. So, I'm a little confused, could you describe ultimately what the structure of these investments will be, and will you merge Nth Degree with Exposition?\nDave Dullum: No. So, a very brief history, Mickey. We sold Nth Degree in 2019, at the end of 2019, to MSouth. When we exited, we actually retained a small ownership percentage, I think it was around 10%, with an investment cost of about $1 million. We did that for some structural reasons in the nature of selling the business. Obviously, we sold it, as you, I think, might recall, a very, very nice capital gain. Subsequently, 2020 came along, that business went down pretty dramatically. They were able, though, then to come back out of it very nicely in the '21 period and going into '22. They started ramping up their EBITDA, and as a result of that, they were able to make this company came along, Expositions, and actually to really add significantly to Nth Degree. So, Nth Degree acquired Expositions, and what we did was we were able to provide some capital, both debt and equity, into Nth Degree as the current structure is, and in fact, that increased our equity ownership percentage in the business up to, I think, roughly around 15% of Nth Degree. So not only have we now got a reinvestment of debt at a really nice rate, but we now have a stake, again, in the company. Obviously, we really like the management team. They now, with this acquisition, are somewhere in the $50 million, almost EBITDA range. So it's a significant business now, and one that, frankly, gives us the opportunity to have a second shot at a great company. So we're very pleased with it.\nMickey Schleien: So I make sure, I'm on the same page, Dave. There's no additional capital required in this transaction at this moment?\nDave Dullum: No.\nMickey Schleien: Okay, and so the cash that's on the balance sheet, which is high for you, the use of that is going to be toward other investments, not this one?\nDave Dullum: Correct. Absolutely. Yes.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. I also wanted to ask you about trends in your portfolio's company's performance in terms of revenues and EBITDA, and what part of the portfolio caused the decline in the average risk rating of the portfolio this quarter?\nDave Dullum: I'm going to -- I'll turn that over to Rachael. Let her have a chance to weigh in.\nRachael Easton: Sure. From a performance perspective, we did see multiples across the portfolio increase. And as I said in my prepared remarks, EBITDA across much of the portfolio did increase as well, but that was offset by EBITDA, which was down from a handful of our portfolio companies. We remained relatively flat on an aggregate basis, quarter-over-quarter, from a fair value perspective. From an internal risk rating perspective, this is the risk rating that we use internally to estimate the probability of default on our debt securities and any expected loss. Overall, there was a slight decrease in the weighted average balance, but nothing that we remain concerned about.\nMickey Schleien: And in terms of the underperformers, can you tell us what sort of sectors you're seeing those trends develop?\nDave Dullum: Mickey, I'd just say sort of across the whole portfolio, there are none that we're seeing any significant decline, and a couple of them that are in the consumer type products businesses, we had a very modest decline and keeping in mind that a small change in EBITDA times a fairly good size multiple, can have an impact in terms of our quote valuation, if you will, right? So again, I would say it was around a couple of the companies that are in the consumer-oriented products area, nothing again that we are overly concerned about in any of those companies. They're all in good shape and doing well. So yeah, and the other sectors have all performed pretty well, actually. And so that's how I would respond to that.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. And my last question, Dave, how long do you think it might take to invest the cash that's on the balance sheet?\nDave Dullum: Well, as I mentioned in my remarks, we've got a couple of deals that we're working on right now that are in the due diligence phase. And so we'll keep hitting the whip, and hopefully we'll find a couple of those that might get done here in the next couple of months.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. That's it for me this morning. I appreciate your time. Thank you.\nDave Dullum: Thanks, Mickey. Good to talk to you.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Mr. Gladstone, there are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn it back to you for closing comments.\nDavid Gladstone: Okay. Thank you so much and thanks to all of you for calling in. We're doing so well, it makes the call pretty boring because we don't have anything much to talk about except our successes. Appreciate all of you calling in, and we'll see you next quarter. That's the end of this call.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a great day."
