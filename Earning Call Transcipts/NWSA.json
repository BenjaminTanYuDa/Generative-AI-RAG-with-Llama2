At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, Operator. Hello, everyone. And welcome to News Corp’s fiscal second quarter 2024 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago and it’s now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks and then we’ll be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp’s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp’s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements, such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings releases for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I’ll pass over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. For the second quarter in succession, News Corp has achieved growth in both revenue and profitability, and we believe there are strong prospects for further growth as difficult, inauspicious macro conditions ease in some of our markets. We saw particularly robust results across the three core pillars of our company, Dow Jones, Book Publishing and Digital Real Estate Services, where there was resounding improvement in Australia in Q2 and there are early signs of recovery in the U.S. residential sector after the most sluggish market conditions in almost three decades. Given the potential of our world-leading brands, we remain intent on creating long-term value for investors, and, as part of that commitment, our diligent, concerted review of the company’s structure continues apace. Looking at the topline results, News Corp’s second quarter revenues rose 3% to $2.6 billion and profitability surged 16%, marking the third consecutive quarter of profit growth in testing economic times. Our net income for the quarter rose to $183 million from $94 million in the same quarter last year, while our reported EPS was $0.27 against $0.12 for the same period last year. The company’s digital progress and prowess are increasingly evident. Halfway through fiscal 2024, digital now comprises approximately 52% of all revenues. That is more than an e-evolution, it is an e-revolution, one that has touched and transformed every element of every business and we are far from satisfied, far from complacent, far from completion. We are seeing the collective benefit of our conscious strategic shift away from potentially volatile advertising revenues to growth in circulation and subscription revenues. In fiscal 2014, nearly half of News Corp revenues were from advertising, with 31% from circulation and subscriptions. There has been a fundamental metamorphosis. In the first half of the fiscal year, advertising had receded to 16%, with circulation and subscriptions surging to 44%. Overall, News Corp, as of Q2, had over 7 million subscriptions to our news brands, including the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, The Times and Sunday Times, The Australian and other publications. And we have an additional 4.3 million paid subscribers at Foxtel in Australia, which includes our popular streaming services Kayo and BINGE. And those figures don’t include the growing number of loyal subscribers at our professional information business at Dow Jones, where the average retention rate is comfortably above 90%. Artificial intelligence, with all its permutations and perturbations, will play an increasingly important role at most businesses. We expect to be a core content provider for generative AI companies who need the highest quality, timely content to ensure the relevance of their products. The Corny, Kellogg, Cliché is that AI companies are selling the picks and shovels during this seeming gold rush. Well, we are selectively reselling gold nuggets and those crucial negotiations are at an advanced stage. It is reassuring that certain digital companies appreciate the value of integrity, quality and creativity. And while certain other media companies prefer litigation, we prefer consultation, as the former is merely creating a gold rush for lawyers. Courtship is preferable to courtrooms. We are wooing, not suing. But let’s be clear. In my view, those who are repurposing our content without approval are stealing. They are undermining creativity. Counterfeiting is not creating and the AI world is replete with content counterfeiters. I would like to compliment Sam Altman of OpenAI, who has shown a clear understanding of the social importance of journalism. He also appears to have emerged unscathed from his first visit to Davos, where there is always attitude at altitude. We are hopeful that again, News Corp will be able to set meaningful global precedents with digital companies that will assist journalists and journalism, and ensure that gen AI is not fueled by digital dross. We speak of the AI hallucinating, yet we as a society are hallucinating, if we don’t focus firmly on provenance at a time when even the very words misinformation and disinformation have themselves become sources of misinformation and disinformation. Too many media companies are scanning the landscape and presuming that they have a glimpse of the future, and yet they cannot distinguish between trendiness and actual trends. Too many media companies, for too long, have been guilty of the Abilene Paradox. Before I return to the results in detail, I must mention once again our colleague Evan Gershkovich, who continues to be unjustly detained in a Moscow prison. He has been incarcerated for almost a year, solely for being a highly professional journalist. We at News Corp, and of course, Evan’s family and many friends, hope that justice will prevail and that he will be released immediately. I would like to personally thank all those who publicly and not so publicly have been working diligently to secure his emancipation. Turning now to Dow Jones, which yet again achieved its highest level of quarterly revenues and profitability since News Corp’s acquisition. That result is thanks to solid performance across the business, most notably in the increasingly successful professional information business, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to profitability at Dow Jones this fiscal year. The professional information business is seeing robust growth due to the integration of OPIS, which was completed ahead of schedule, and CMA, which is near complete. I would like to compliment in particular the News Corp finance team for masterminding, executing and delivering the OPIS and Base Chemicals deals, which have been so critical to Dow Jones burgeoning growth. Executives at Dow Jones are far from smug and are building a bevy of new and compelling products. For example, OPIS’ Analytics Pro utilizes a database of more than 130,000 fuel stations to track visits and help customers assess their pricing strategies and market trends, as well as compile customer loyalty rates and demographics, among other valuable actionable data points. Meanwhile, risk and compliance’s financial instruments product, in partnership with BigTXN, provides a feed of R&C sanctioned profiles mapped to commonly used financial instruments, which is crucial compliance cartography in a heavily regulated world. And DJ Integrity Check, a partnership with SAPIEN, provides generative AI-driven insight into companies and relevant, potentially problematic individuals. Subscriptions at the news business are continuing to grow and during the month of January, average daily digital subscriptions to Dow Jones portfolio, including the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, MarketWatch and Investor’s Business Daily, reached over 4.9 million, which represents more than double the pre-COVID average level of 2.4 million digital subscriptions in Q2 fiscal 2020. The acceleration of digital subscription growth has been driven, in part, by the team’s bundling of products, which is designed to increase reader engagement and reduce long-term churn. While we have purposefully shifted emphasis to recurring revenues at Dow Jones, we are happy to report that although we face some challenges in print advertising, digital advertising grew year-over-year for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2023. This positive result has been driven primarily by growth in the tech and automotive sectors, and most notably at wsj.com. Digital Real Estate Services had a strong quarter, thanks largely to the prospering of REA, where there was 22% revenue growth year-over-year, fueled by an 8% increase in listings, with heightened activity in the core Melbourne and Sydney markets and higher pricing. REA India continues to expand rapidly and reported over 19 million monthly average unique visitors in December, solidifying its lead as the foremost digital housing platform in the world’s most populous country, where strong economic growth and political stability have created a platform for further expansion. At Move, Realtor.com continued to be affected by the high U.S. interest rates that have undermined activity in the market, but mortgage rates are beginning to moderate and in recent weeks there have been early signs of an increase in all important leads. The National Association of Realtors announced that the index for pending home sales increased just over 8% in December versus the prior year, the largest increase since June 2020. Realtor.com’s latest housing report revealed that January marked the third consecutive month of year-over-year inventory growth, with a 2.8% increase in newly listed homes for sale compared to January 2023. Unique users at Realtor have also stabilized, with December ComScore data signaling a return to growth. During the downturn, the Realtor.com team has been assiduously improving the user experience, broadening the portfolio of products for our customers and bolstering the back-end technology so we are poised to take full advantage of the incipient recovery in the U.S. housing market. HarperCollins had stellar results for the second successive quarter. This was thanks to strength in both the front list and the back list, notably in the blossoming audio books category. We saw 15% digital revenue growth in the quarter, fueled by a 29% audio book sales increase due to a flourishing market and our new partnership with Spotify. Spotify appears to be expanding demand for audio books and opening the category up to new consumers. I would like to commend our thoughtful partner, Daniel Ek, for his commitment to creativity. In Q2, we saw success with bestsellers like The Pioneer Woman Cooks Dinner’s Ready by Ree Drummond, The Little Liar by Mitch Albom, Ann Patchett’s Tom Lake and Barbara Kingsolver’s Demon Copperhead. We also saw strong sales for Christian books, including The Great Disappearance by Dr. David Jeremiah, who is Rapture Ready, and the Bible itself. Looking ahead to Q3, we have great expectations for, among others, A.J. Finn’s End of Story and I Am More Than by LeBron James. At Subscription Video Services, our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbl, is expected to launch next month and improve the search experience for our cherished customers seeking entertainment and sports. We believe Hubbl would be the most effective conduit between consumer and content, and add to the Foxtel success story. In a volatile world, Foxtel has achieved eight consecutive quarters of revenue growth in constant currency, while being acutely and astutely cost-conscious in managing the transition to streaming. At Kayo, we are looking forward to the upcoming winter sports season for Australian Rules Football and Rugby League, the two dominant sports, and at BINGE, there has been early success with advertising at the basic tier, while continuing ad-free service for premium customers. In News Media, our news brands have seen improvement in traffic in recent weeks, a turnaround after convulsions in the first half, where there were algorithmic aberrations. Gratifyingly, we experienced digital subscription growth during the quarter. Rebecca Brooks and her team at News U.K. have overseen continuing progress at the Times and Sunday Times, which set a new record for the quarter in digital subscriptions at 575,000, and saw significant digital ad growth, up 21% on a reported basis and over 15% in local currency. We expect the success of the Times to continue beyond Britain’s borders with the imminent digital launch of the Times in the U.S. We are confident that it will resonate with discerning readers, hungry for objective news coverage in a market saturated with narrative non-journalism. Our News Corp Australia, news.com.au, was again the country’s leading news website, with nearly 13 million monthly uniques in December, according to metrics from Ipsos. And the New York Post is again on course to be profitable and has expanded its positive political influence in these vexed and vexing times. With the strong results in Q2 and Q1, we are off to a sterling start in fiscal year 2024, which follows the three most profitable years for the new News Corp. We can sense that investors are beginning to appreciate keenly the value of our brands and the potential of our portfolio. On behalf of all our investors, we have transformed free cash flow generation, bolstered our balance sheet, initiated a dividend and are continuing our $1 billion buyback plan. For that transformative success, I would like to pay tribute to the strategic support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, and to our highly engaged directors, and to the commitment of our employees around the world. I am now pleased to turn to my talented colleague, Susan Panuccio, who will elaborate on these buoyant results.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon to everyone. As Robert mentioned, we had a strong second quarter, resulting in first half year-over-year improvements in both profitability and revenues. We continue to transform the company and move towards higher, recurring and digital revenues, together with exercising strong capital allocation discipline and balancing reinvestment across the portfolio with ongoing fixed cost reductions. Our second quarter total revenues were $2.6 billion, up 3% compared to the prior year, an increase from the 1% growth delivered in the first quarter. Adjusted revenues grew 2% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $473 million for the quarter, up 16% compared to the prior year, driven by strong performances across our three key growth pillars, Book Publishing, Digital Real Estate Services and Dow Jones, which all posted double-digit profit gains. In fact, in the aggregate, those key segments delivered 24% profitability growth this quarter. Our second quarter total segment EBITDA was also the highest in two years. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 14% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.27, compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.26 in the quarter, compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $419 million, up 9%, a notable improvement from the first quarter rate and a return to revenue growth for the first time since the fourth quarter of financial year 2022. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues rose 8%. Segment EBITDA rose an impressive 15% to $147 million due to a higher contribution from the REA Group partially offset by revenue headwinds at Move. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 16%. REA had another very strong quarter with revenues rising 22% year-on-year on a reported basis to a quarterly record of $292 million with minimal impact from foreign exchange. Growth was again primarily driven by residential yield increases, improved growth in national listings, favorable geographic mix and customer contract upgrades. Overall, new buy listings rose approximately 8% with Melbourne up 24% and Sydney up 22%. Please refer to REA’s earnings release and their conference call, which will commence directly after hours, for more details. Moves revenues of $127 million were down 13% compared to the prior year, with declines moderating from recent quarters. For the quarter, Real Estate revenues fell 14% driven by lower lead and transaction volumes, reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 7% year-over-year, with December improving to down just 2%, benefiting from a combination of easier comparisons as well as recent declines in mortgage rates. Average monthly unique users for the quarter were flat compared to the prior year at 66 million. The U.S. housing environment remains tough, with existing home sales hitting 30-year lows, although we are hopeful the market will start to show improvement in the second half given recent declines in mortgage rates. That said, irrespective of any market considerations, we are determined to strengthen Realtor.com’s product and content offering so it’s best positioned for success when the housing market improves. To that end, the Realtor.com team is focused on executing several key strategic priorities, which include modernizing the technology platform to help with unifying the customer experience across all platforms, creating unique and scaled data for proprietary content to assist with increased personalization, leveraging News Corp’s network in relation to AI initiatives and capturing audience share and accelerating the diversification of revenues with a greater focus on the sell-side offering. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues for the quarter were $470 million, up 2% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 3% versus the prior year. Streaming revenues accounted for 29% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 26% in the prior year. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group were over 4.3 million at quarter end, flat with the prior year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 2.8 million, increasing 4% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially due to seasonality at Kayo, tougher financial conditions caused by the inflationary environment for consumers and a weaker sports cycle. Foxtel ended the quarter with 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn was flat at 12.9% despite the final migration off cable in October, while broadcast ARPU rose 3% to approximately AU$86, helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $77 million was down 14% versus the prior year, driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements and $10 million related to the upcoming launch of Hubbl, partially offset by higher revenues and lower technology and marketing costs. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. Moving on to Dow Jones. As Robert mentioned, the second quarter results delivered the highest quarterly revenue and segment EBITDA performance since the acquisition of Dow Jones over 15 years ago. Dow Jones delivered revenues of $584 million, up 4% year-over-year, which made Dow Jones the highest segment revenue contributor for the quarter for the first time since it was re-segmented. Digital revenues accounted for 78% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented almost 76% of total revenues, up approximately 2 percentage points from the prior year, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. We saw very strong growth at PIB, with revenues rising 13% year-over-year, including 16% growth at risk and compliance to $72 million and 15% growth at Dow Jones Energy to $62 million. Factiva again posted growth, benefiting from a new licensing deal. Total PIB retention rates remained very strong at over 90%. We are continuing to review our disclosures, with the primary focus on increasing transparency to help the market appropriately value Dow Jones. To that end, we are now providing revenues for both risk and compliance and Dow Jones Energy in the 10Q. Within the Dow Jones consumer business, circulation revenues were flat versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 15% year-over-year or by 135,000 sequentially, driven by an increased focus on the Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement. Bundling accounted for over 70% of the incremental digital-only volume growth in quarter two. Advertising revenues declined 4% to $126 million, relatively stable with the first quarter rate, although digital returned to year-over-year revenue growth for the first time since the first quarter of financial year 2023, rising 1% driven by strength in the technology and auto categories. Print declined 11% due to weaknesses in financial services. Digital represented 62% of advertising revenues, up 59% last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 17% to $163 million and was the largest segment EBITDA contributor, with margins improving 320 basis points to 27.9%, driven by the strong B2B performance, which remains on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. Costs declined about 1%, driven by headcount reductions and lower newsprint production and distribution costs, in addition to phasing of sales and marketing expenditure. At Book Publishing, financial performance again meaningfully exceeded our expectations, particularly in profitability. Revenues were $550 million, up 4%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $85 million compared to the prior year. Margins increased by almost 600 basis points to 15.5%. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key front list titles, as Robert mentioned, and saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian Publishing. Return rates again improved materially due to better sell-through compared to last year, while inventory levels appear to have normalized across our distribution network. Inflationary costs moderated, with lower manufacturing costs, helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 60% of revenues, up from 57% last year, while digital sales rose 15% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. Downloadable audio accounted for nearly 50% of digital sales, a record high, and we are pleased with the early positive signs from our partnership with Spotify, which generated incremental digital revenues and EBITDA this quarter. As way of background, Spotify is a usage-based model, not a pooled model. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 2% and segment EBITDA rose 65%. Turning to News Media, performance in the segment was more challenged. Revenues were $563 million, down 3% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 5%. Advertising declined 9% and was down 11% in constant currency, while circulation and subscription rose 5% and was up 2% in constant currency, benefiting from cover price increases. Advertising remained particularly challenged, with digital advertising trends again negatively impacted by the lower traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms. That said, as Robert noted, encouragingly, we are seeing some recovery in recent weeks, particularly at the Sun in the U.S. Segment EBITDA of $52 million declined $7 million, which was due to the lower revenue partly offset by lower print volume and newsprint expense and lower spend at TalkTV. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 15%. As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, it is challenging to forecast in the short-term, albeit economic conditions vary across markets. Looking at each of our segments, at Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for January grew 12%. Please refer to REA for more specific outlook commentary. At Move, we hope to see continued improvements in lead volumes, with January up 1% year-over-year, given recent declines in borrowing costs, albeit off low prior year comparisons. As we mentioned last quarter, we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing and product development in the second half, increasing from depressed levels last year, which will be partially offset by cost reductions elsewhere. In Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year. Ongoing inflationary pressures, fewer new releases across entertainment due to the writers and actors strike, and a weaker summer sports schedule has created some softness in streaming revenues, which may impact full year profitability in local currency. At Dow Jones, we expect strong revenue and profitability performance, underpinned by the transformation of our B2B offerings, and as mentioned previously, continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year. At Book Publishing, overall industry revenue trends remain relatively stable and we are encouraged by the strength in the downloadable audio. We continue to expect margins to improve versus the prior year. At News Media, advertising revenue trends remain challenging, particularly in Australia and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. Finally, given the current spot rate for the Australian dollar versus the U.S. dollar, we do expect some negative translation in the third quarter. With that, let me hand it over to the Operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan.\nDavid Karnovsky: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I’ll ask the AI topic. Robert, you noted in the release you expect to be a core content provider for gen AI companies. Maybe you can speak a bit to current negotiations. What are the key sticking points, key priorities for you or even the red lines for News Corp as you engage on this?\nRobert Thomson: Yes. David, obviously, these are confidential negotiations and so I can’t go into too much detail. I mean, it is fair to say that we’ve been leading the intellectual debate among media companies on AI, and also fair to say that we’re probably leading the commercial discussions. I mean, 17 years ago, when prestige-craving media executives were sashaying with Silicon Valley, we were raising doubts, doubts about provenance, but also about the baleful impact on vulnerable young people, the smartest engineers on the planet, creating compulsive, addictive experiences. Anyway, we’re certainly not naive as well about the potentially positive and negative impacts of AI on our journalism, our creativity, our content. We’ve had almost two decades of distribution dominating creation and almost 60% or so of journalists have lost jobs in the U.S. And candidly, unfortunately, a certain percentage of that is down to journalistic pomposity and prize consciousness, not audience consciousness and relevance consciousness. But AI is a hyper-effective form of or gen AI is a hyper-effective form of derivative distribution. It’s retrospective, not prospective, and the thoughtful AI companies understand that fact, and so that’s why on this occasion, I would like to highlight the thoughtfulness of Sam Altman. Thoughtful people do understand that counterfeiting is not creating, and crucially, in this exceedingly erratic era, we have deep facts, not deep fakes.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, David. Leila, we’ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evans & Partners.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. Maybe if I can pick up on the generative AI question as well. I appreciate there’s only so much you can say, but how do you think about the potential payments which could come for the value of your content relative to what you’re currently receiving from the digital platforms? Is it a similar sort of quantum, could it be even a greater quantum over time? At least on a relative basis, I’d be interested in how you’re thinking about it. And longer term, do you expect that those payments from the digital platforms will continue to come through? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Entcho, I’m sorry to be a basic, but I simply can’t comment on the content of the negotiations. But I can say they’re at an advanced stage and we are dealing with willing partners.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Entcho. Leila, we’ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kane Hannan from Goldman Sachs.\nKane Hannan: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Maybe just Dow Jones. I think the costs were down about $3 million in the quarter. We can talk a bit more about the Dow Jones cost base, whether we can extrapolate that sort of performance going forward. And maybe to follow on to that, just the professional information services within Dow Jones. I mean, obviously, appreciate the extra disclosure. Did that business see margin expansion in the quarter or is the strong margin expansion for Dow Jones overall more of a mix and cost out in the other businesses?\nSusan Panuccio: Hi, Kane. Welcome back. Just in relation to the cost, we did see a pretty good cost performance for the first half of Dow Jones and I think like all our businesses, they are pretty cost focused. So they do constantly have a look at transformation opportunities within the business and they certainly participated in the 5% headcount reduction and they’re getting the benefit of that. But like all the businesses, we do like to invest in them. So we do see variable costs going up as the revenue scales. They’ve had inflationary costs in relation to headcount and will continue to invest in headcount given the growth in that business. And the second half of the year, we would expect to see some phasing and additional costs coming through for marketing. We do tend to have seasonally higher net ads in the second half than we do in the first half and so that typically warrants some additional marketing costs. So that’s sort of in relation to the cost base. And then in relation to PIB, we don’t give out the margins, as you know. But the PIB margins did improve for the quarter, which was really pleasing to see as they continue to scale that business. And as we said in our prepared remarks, for the full year, we’re continuing to expect to see the majority of the profit come from the PIB segment.\nRobert Thomson: Yeah. And just to supplement Susan’s answer, obviously, PIB is a priority for Dow Jones and for News Corp. And we are providing more visibility overall about Dow Jones because it’s such a positive story, and frankly, the more you see, the more you’ll like. I mean, overall, the margin at Dow Jones has risen from 24.7% a year ago to 27.9% and now that we’re lapping the purchases of OPIS and CMA, the strong growth rates are clear at these companies, which we have grouped into Dow Jones Energy, where revenues expanded by 15% and it is also, though, worth noting the results of the always burgeoning risk and compliance segment where revenues rose 16%. In short, these are high margin recurring businesses providing essential services and thus have renewal rates well north of 90%.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much. Leila, we’ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask on a portfolio review and simplification announcement that you mentioned three months ago and you briefly touched on it today. Can you just give us a further update? I’m just curious on the timing of this. I mean, I personally didn’t expect a major announcement within just this first three months. But also, the flip side, I wouldn’t expect it to take another six-plus months from this stage going forward. Can you just give investors a little sense of the timing there and I assume you guys did an awful lot of work behind the scenes before you even talked about it three months ago in your conference call. You’ve certainly done some -- I’m sure some, in this last three months. Just give us a little sense of the timing when we might get an announcement here, please? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Craig, your presumption about preparation is not ill-conceived. But this being a rather sophisticated audience, one which understands the nuances of phrases and the subtleties of the SEC, you can take the words I used in my statement as purposefully delivered. There is clearly much introspection, not casual, not peripheral, but significant, serious introspection about structure, and it’s functional, not emotional. And the prevailing truth is that we have created options for our shareholders and that’s a tribute to all at News Corp, with the active support of an enlightened Board and leadership from Rupert and Lachlan, and the efforts of our employees around the world. Let us not forget that misguided investment bankers were decidedly downbeat at the time of the split a decade ago. And now, however, the discussion is how to get full value from, how to fully monetize a precious, prestigious portfolio that has an obvious growth trajectory. That is indeed not an evolution, but a revolution.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Craig. Leila, we’ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.\nLucy Huang: Good morning, Rob and Susan. My question’s on PIB as well. Given we’re kind of getting through the end of the integration of OPIS and CMA, just wondering strategically how you’re thinking about the growth in business and are there any other data sets that you would be looking to maybe build out or acquire over time? Are there intentions or I guess capabilities you’ll like to plug with PIB?\nRobert Thomson: Lucy, obviously, we’re pleased with the progress of the PIB business, and as I said, you can see the overall increase in margin at Dow Jones and that is to a large extent due to the success of the PIB businesses. I can’t go into any more details about what plans are, but needless to say, PIB is core to Dow Jones and its core to News Corp.\nSusan Panuccio: And Lucy, what I can say is that, the thing that’s great about PIB and the Energy businesses is that the new products can leverage the existing data sets that we have, so the pricing, reporting, analytics and newsletters, and they can draw off a lot of the core data that we have. So I think that’s fantastic. And I think Robert’s mentioned in previous quarters, we’ve got areas like renewables that are coming in that we really think that could provide an exciting opportunity for us.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Lucy. Leila, we’ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar.\nBrian Han: Susan, I noticed the second quarter PCP growth in books EBITDA is exactly the same as the first quarter PCP growth, both exactly, I think, two-thirds up on prior period. Is there some sort of a contracted step up in earnings for books or is that just pure coincidence?\nSusan Panuccio: I’d like to think there would be at that level, but no, no, I think, it’s just a coincidence. As we sort of said in the remarks, the Book Publishing segment has continued to exceed our expectations. And look, it’s partly because we’ve had a return to more stability in the revenue post-COVID. So the returns have settled down and the market has settled down a little bit. And it’s also partly because of the great work that the HarperCollins team has done in relation to their cost base in the face of some pretty challenging conditions last year. They also took the opportunity to push through some price rises on books. So a combination of all of that has really helped with putting the good results in for the first half. Look, I think across the full year, we’re still expecting margins to be sort of in low-double digits, a good improvement from the prior year, but probably not to the levels that we’ve seen in the first half.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Brian. Leila, we’ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.\nDarren Leung: Hi, guys. Thanks for the opportunity. I just wanted to ask a bit about the cost out program. Can you give us a feel as to how much has been completed so far this fiscal year of the previous $160 million number? And just a feel for, you know, do you expect more of it to be weighted in third quarter or fourth quarter or maybe another way to answer the question is, what divisions should we expect to see a lot of this cost out come from, please?\nSusan Panuccio: Yeah. Look, we are -- it’s pleasing to say that actually we quoted I think $160 million number in relation to that cost out program and we are going to exceed that number. And actually, from a run rate perspective, we’re pretty much there already. We have said in previous statements, though, that’s the gross cost savings. And we do have reinvestments across our businesses, as you can see, within Dow Jones, within our REA, we’re investing in new Foxtel with the Hubbl launch. And so that is the gross cost savings. What I would say is, notwithstanding that, we are always looking at cost savings across our businesses and so that was pertaining just to headcount reductions. We’re constantly looking at our cost space and our workflows and our efficiencies, and we do continue to drive greater savings than that, which helps us reinvest in these businesses.\nRobert Thomson: And Darren, I’d just like to supplement Susan’s point where we are not going to let these excellent results in any way induce complacency in the company. All the teams are extremely cost conscious and we already are seeing very interesting trends in the ability of AI to reduce costs related to technology spend, to the creation of code, to the cultivation of code. And so not only are we going to be pursuing conventional costs, but we’re looking ahead and trying to make the most of new developments.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Darren. Leila, we’ll take our next question, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, we have no further questions. I’ll now hand over to Michael Florin for closing remarks.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Leila, and thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day and we will talk to you soon. Take care."

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michael Florin, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMichael Florin: Thank you very much, Operator. Hello, everyone. And welcome to News Corp’s fiscal first quarter 2024 earnings call. We issued our earnings press release about 30 minutes ago and it’s now posted on our website at newscorp.com. On the call today are Robert Thomson, Chief Executive; and Susan Panuccio, Chief Financial Officer. We will open with some prepared remarks and I will be happy to take questions from the investment community. This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to News Corp’s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. News Corp’s Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filings identify risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and contain cautionary statements regarding forward-looking information. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements such as total segment EBITDA, adjusted segment EBITDA and adjusted EPS. The definitions and the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of such measures can be found in the earnings release for the applicable periods posted on our website. With that, I will pass it over to Robert Thomson for some opening comments.\nRobert Thomson: Thank you, Mike. In a world replete with uncertainty, News Corp is proud to report rising revenues and increased profitability in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. These distinctly positive results come despite specious macroeconomic conditions including steep interest rates and unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations. The potential for even greater profitability should be even more pronounced when we return to economic equilibrium. These results follow the three most profitable years since the creation of the new News Corp and our digital transformation has continued at pace. And in our view, these results certainly highlight the disparity between the value of our company and our share price, which we believe does not reflect our present profitability yet alone the potential of our incomparable growing businesses. We are acutely focused on enhancing long-term value for all of our investors, and in that quest, have the patent advantage of prized assets, whose value we believe is increasing. We are also assiduously reviewing our structure in the quest to optimize that value. Our first quarter revenues rose modestly to $2.5 billion, while profitability rose 4%, marking the second consecutive quarter of profit growth in these challenging conditions. We believe these positive results are a harbinger of our potential in the medium- and long-term. We expect to continue to drive our digital growth, the scale of which has been transformative over the past decade. It is worth noting a couple of metrics for context and to highlight the intrinsic value of our company. In 2014, print related advertising accounted for 39% of our revenue and now it is trying to get less than 5%, while digital revenues exceeded 50% of revenues last year, up almost 300%. Our loyal investors understand the inherent value of our assets and the scale of our dramatic transition. But we believe the market has yet to fully comprehend the magnitude of the metamorphosis or the future potential of our platform. We have been and expect to continue to generate significant free cash flow this fiscal year and we have a $1 billion buyback plan well underway and ample opportunity to be opportunistic. That opportunistic efficacy, we have shown in our purchases of OPIS and CMA for Dow Jones to high margin digital businesses with recurring revenues which have added much profitable prowess. Their impact means that we are at a pivotal point at our Dow Jones business. The B2B segment at Dow Jones is now outpacing the B2C segment in contributing to profit and at a far higher margin. The net result is that we expect both Dow Jones and News Corporation are becoming more profitable, more digital and even less dependent on the ebb and flow of advertising. That is why we are highlighting the Dow Jones results today and expect to be providing increasing visibility over the coming year. So the potential investors can appreciate the full glory of our valuable assets, while we intensify our institutional introspection on structure. As a reminder, Dow Jones profitability has more than doubled since we re-segmented in fiscal 2020, generating close to $500 million in segment EBITDA last year with strong growth prospects ahead. And the EBITDA margin has been actually transformed. In Q1 fiscal 2018 it was approximately 9%, in Q1 fiscal 2020 it was 12.8% and in Q1 this fiscal year 23.1%. We certainly agree with the perceptive commentators and analysts, who suggest that News Corp is undervalued and its asset quality underappreciated. Our Board, our leaders and our teams deserve much credit for skillfully navigating the turbulent media waters of the past decade. Waters, which have proven treacherous for many media companies. As always, we remain focused on maximizing that value to the benefit of all shareholders. We are also looking into the future in maximizing the value of our premium content for AI. We are in advanced discussions with a range of digital companies that we anticipate will bring significant revenue in return for the use of our unmatched content sets. Generative AI engines are only as sophisticated as their inputs and need constant replenishing to remain relevant and we are proud to partner with responsible purveyors of AI products and their prescient leaders. One observation about Generative AI. We often hear about misinformation and disinformation to the point where the very words become politicized and polluted. The potential for the proselytizing of the perverse will become ever more real with the inevitable inexorable rise of artificial intelligence. But, however, aren’t fully artificial intelligence, it is no match for great reporting and for genuine journalistic nous. On the subject of journalism, I would like to pay tribute to our reporters in the Middle East and in Ukraine who are each day taking calculated risks to bring insight and intelligence to readers around the world during a period of unpredictable turbulence. And I would like to highlight the fate of Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, who has been unjustly incarcerated in Russia for more than seven months nearly for doing his job as a journalist. Let me begin the more detailed extra juices with the increasingly valuable PLS Dow Jones where revenues rose 4% in Q1, despite the volatility of the ad market, while segment EBITDA was lifted by an impressive 10% as revenue and profit contribution continued to expand in the professional information business. Dow Jones offers a unique set of services and products for global business users and readers. As a result, many of our customers encountered Dow Jones products several times each day, not just the Wall Street Journal, Barron’s, MarketWatch and Dow Jones Newswires, but also risk and compliance Dow Jones Energy and Factiva. Risk and compliance revenues surged 23%. Thanks to the increased demand from the financial and corporate sectors seeking to minimize risk and maximize compliance. I trust all of the institutions on the call today aspire to those two worthy goals. RNC has expanded revenues by over 60%, let me repeat that number, over 600% since we relaunched News in 2013. It’s worth emphasizing that the business is fully digital and has retention rates of over 90%. Dow Jones Energy, which includes both OPIS and CMA continues to see excellent double-digit revenue growth, driven in part by higher pricing and is exceeding our initial expectations. Thanks to the global energy transition and opportunities emerging in renewable energy, along with continued reinvestment. Our customer base is growing as we launch compelling products and create critical pricing benchmarks. We are genuinely impressed by the vitality and drive an initiative among our new colleagues at both OPIS and CMA. Factiva is benefiting from its innovative partnership with Cision. And Factiva should be an important building block in the AI future given that it has a database of 33,000 sources in 32 languages from more than 200 countries and territories. That impressive content collection complements our contemporaneous news offerings as we seek to serve corporate, professional and consumer audiences. Across Dow Jones, subscription volume remains strong with digital subscriptions reaching 4.6 million, up 12%, while total subscriptions reached 5.3 million, up 8%. Our teams are focused on reducing churn and maximizing the lifetime value of each and every subscriber. As for advertising, we saw particularly improvement in trends with declines of past quarters abating and digital advertising down only 2%. In Digital Real Estate, it was a tale of two markets during the quarter with the Australian property market improving and the U.S. market still bearing the burden of particularly high mortgage rates which obviously suppressed demand. But it is fair to say that the revenue rebound in the Australian market certainty surpassed the sluggishness in the U.S. market. REA reported strong growth in listing volumes in the two key markets of Sydney and Melbourne, and our value-add clients were keen to subscribe to premium products, thus improving yield. We also saw resounding topline performance and volumes remained strong in October. REA, India is a number one property portal in a country with a rapidly expanding middle class and both its audience and revenue continued to surge during the quarter. As REA has disclosed, the total audience in India in the quarter was up 16% year-over-year, while revenue during the quarter was 25% higher than a year ago. Given a relative political stability in India and ongoing economic growth, REA India is a jewel in the crown. In the U.S. realtor.com like the industry at large was affected by the unusually high interest rates, which do appear to have plateaued and are expected to ease over the coming year. But the short-term conditions do not change our long-term optimism for realtor to capitalize on the increasing digitization of the world’s largest property market. It is easy to buy transient traffic in the short-term, but that is merely a sugar high that leads to digital diabetes. We have a long-term commitment to all Americans who are buying and selling a home and to Real Estate professionals. We also have the ability to leverage our unique media platform from wsj.com to the New York Post among many others, who had a combined monthly audience of over 200 million uniques in September. These are verified authenticated numbers, not a cocktail of cockamania. Under Damian Eales, energetic decisive leadership, realtor is building on the gains of his predecessors and focusing on developing core markets, core clients and core profitability. The realtor team is working even more closely with REA executives in ways that are benefiting both businesses with the sharing of software, marketing mechanics and AI insights. The script for our publishing business was completely rewritten in the first quarter. After a few difficult quarters, segment EBITDA at HarperCollins lifted 67%. Revenues posted a healthy 8% increase and that growth combined with cost initiatives undertaken over the past year and an easing of supply chain inflationary impacts recalibrated the performance at HarperCollins. The logistical upheaval at Amazon has past, return rates are far lower, and both the frontlist and backlist notch gains during the quarter. Among the many and varied strong sellers were Tom Lake by Ann Patchett, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver, The Collector by Daniel Silva and Remarkably Bright Creatures by Shelby Van Pelt. We saw particular strength in our Christian books business, including Reba McEntire’s Not That Fancy. Reba was clearly not describing the HarperCollins performance. And speaking of Christian books, we look forward to publishing a new book His Holiness Pope Francis next spring. I would like to highlight our new partnership with Spotify to broaden the reach of audio books. This is a project we have discussed for some time with the S Mobile [ph] Daniel Ek, with whom I share a passion for books and for the Arsenal Football Club. The new partnership has begun with the U.K. and Australia and in the U.S. announced yesterday, and we are genuinely confident that it will be positive for both companies for authors and for those who love to read and to listen to books. This market has needed a strong new entrant and Daniel and his team are among the most skillful players on the pitch. At Subscription Video Services, revenues were up in constant currency for the seventh consecutive quarter. As expected, the decline in EBITDA was mainly due to sports costs and ForEx fluctuations. But we have no doubt that our streaming strategy has been successful at a time when other companies in other markets are struggling. Overall, paid streaming subscriptions rose 8% on the same quarter last year, while broadcast churn was down from 14.2% to 11.4%, showing that the two products are undoubtedly complementary. But the team at Foxtel is far from complacent and so we are on the cusp of launching our new streaming aggregation product, Hubbell, which will greatly simplify the search for fascinating entertainment and sports from our own companies and from those of our cherished partners to the benefit of all in particular, to the benefit of viewers. The News Media segment faced macroeconomic headwinds and volatility caused by algorithmic changes at the large platforms, but these trends are more femoral than eternal. Subscriptions continue to increase at The Times and Sunday Times, which reported an 8% rise and at News Corp Australia, where we saw a 4% increase in digital subs. As I mentioned earlier, we are increasingly less reliant on advertising, which is now a smaller fraction of our overall revenue and focused on digital recurring revenue streams. We saw strong performance at Wireless in the UK, which had a record 45 million listening hours over the April to September period, up 17% from the prior year, according to RAJAR, led by sports and news. Our teams in the U.K. and Australia were also acutely cost conscious and we are retooling the infrastructure to reflect the contemporary and future initiatives, including printing operations, advertising networks and back office expenses. Rebecca and our teams in the U.K. have been leaders in creating programmatic ad partnerships, which enable all to increase yield and harvest valuable data. This was, in another way, an historic quarter. Our Executive Chair, Rupert Murdoch, announced that he will be transitioning to Chairman Emeritus next week at our AGM. I can personally assure you that there has been no change in his heightened levels of curiosity and energy since the announcement and his vast experience will be an important ongoing resource for the company. All of us at News Corp stand on the shoulders of a giant. And I genuinely look forward to Lachlan becoming sole Chair next week. His thoughtful engagement with our teams already enhances the business each working day and his passion for principal journalism is obvious to all who work with him. There is no doubt that Lachlan’s multidisciplinary expertise and his philosophical integrity will be invaluable as we continue the next phase of our crucial journey. And now our esteemed CFO, Susan Panuccio, will provide more financial granularity.\nSusan Panuccio: Thank you, Robert, and good afternoon, everyone. As Robert mentioned, we are pleased with the positive start to the new fiscal year, returning to revenue growth and posting the second consecutive quarter of profit growth despite the macroeconomic conditions. We have been diligently executing on our long-term plan to drive greater value for our shareholders and believe this is yet to be reflected in our current market value. Our first quarter total revenues were $2.5 billion, up 1% compared to the prior year, marking the first year-over-year revenue growth since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Adjusted revenues also grew 1% compared to the prior year. Total segment EBITDA was $364 million, up 4% compared to the prior year. HarperCollins was the largest contributor to the profit improvement, which is encouraging on the back of last year’s challenging results. Adjusted total segment EBITDA grew 5% versus the prior year. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.05, compared to $0.07 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.16 in the quarter, compared to $0.12 in the prior year. Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $403 million, down 4% compared to the prior year, a notable improvement from the fourth quarter rate. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues declined just 2%. Despite the revenue decline, segment EBITDA rose 3% to $122 million due to higher contribution from the REA Group and cost saving initiatives that move that were partially offset by revenue headwinds. Adjusted segment EBITDA rose a healthy 8%. REA had a very strong quarter with revenues rising 4% year-on-year on a reported basis to $261 million, which included an $11 million or 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Growth was driven by residential yield increases and growth in national listings, along with 25% revenue growth at REA India. Results were partially offset by a modest decline in Financial Services revenues due to lower settlement activity. Overall, new buy listings rose 1%, with Sydney and Melbourne up 16% and 14%, respectively, enabling upward pressure on yields. Please refer to REA’s earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. Move’s revenues of $142 million were down 16% compared to the prior year, relatively similar to the fourth quarter trend absent the 53rd-week impact. For the quarter, Real Estate revenues fell 20%, driven by lower lead and transaction volumes reflective of the broader industry trends. Lead volumes fell 11% year-over-year, while realtor’s average monthly unique users declined 12% from the prior year to 76 million in the first quarter based on internal metrics, but improved from 74 million in the fourth quarter. As Robert mentioned, despite challenging market and competitive conditions, we have made solid progress in Q1 across a number of strategic areas including SEO improvements, expanding our sell-side offerings into the launch of a listing agent tool kit, deepening our collaboration with News Corp’s powerful global platform to drive further reach and the recent launch of a new brand campaign. Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $486 million, down approximately 3% compared to the prior year on a reported basis due to foreign currency headwinds. Importantly, on an adjusted basis, revenues rose 1% versus the prior year, the seventh consecutive quarter of growth. Streaming revenues accounted for 30% of circulation and subscription revenues versus 25% in the prior year, and again, more than offset broadcast revenue declines benefiting from both a year-over-year increase in subscribers and price rises at Kayo and BINGE. Total closing paid subscribers across the Foxtel Group reached almost $4.6 million at quarter end, up 2% year-over-year. Total paid streaming subscribers were 3 million, increasing 8% versus the prior year, although declining sequentially impacted by less output at BINGE related to the strikes in Hollywood, as well as typical seasonality at Kayo due to the end of the winter sports codes in September. Foxtel ended the quarter with over 1.3 million residential broadcast subscribers, down 9% year-over-year. Broadcast churn continued to improve, down 280 basis points year-over-year to 11.4%, while broadcast ARPU rose 3% to over A$85 helped in part by a price rise for non-platinum subscribers implemented in July. Segment EBITDA in the quarter of $93 million was down 16% versus the prior year driven by contractual price escalators in Foxtel sports rights agreements. Adjusted segment EBITDA declined 13%. We completed the debt refinancing in the first quarter, which included securing a new A$1.2 billion credit facility. As we said last quarter, given the improved performance and the completion of the refinancing, this provides a pathway for repayment of our shareholder loans. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones had a strong quarter with revenues of $537 million, up 4% year-over-year despite fully lapping recent acquisitions. Digital revenues accounted for 81% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from last year. Circulation and subscription-based revenues represented over 81% of total revenues, up approximately 1 percentage point from the prior year, underscoring the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base. On an adjusted basis, revenues grew 3%. We are continuing to see very strong growth in our Professional Information business with revenues rising 14% year-over-year driven by risk and compliance and strong gains at Dow Jones Energy. Factiva posted modest growth benefiting from a new licensing deal. Retention across B2B offerings remains at over 90% with nearly all of the revenues recurring. Risk and compliance revenues rose 23% with consistent growth between financials and corporates. Europe remained the largest territory at over 50% of revenues and also the fastest source of growth. Secular trends remain very favorable with global corporations navigating complex sanctions and trade guidance, particularly as it relates to Russia and China. We were really pleased with the 20% growth at Dow Jones Energy, which benefited from price escalators, the rollout of new products and new customers. The results also benefited mid-single digits from one-time items and the World Chemical Forum, a new annual event this quarter, which leveraged the wider Dow Jones experience in corporate events. Circulation revenues gained 1% versus the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 12% year-over-year or 101,000 sequentially, which was principally driven by an increased focus on Dow Jones bundling offer as they look to better leverage subscription acquisition costs across multiple products, capitalize on minimal overlap between products and drive greater engagement from customers. We believe that in the medium-term, bundling will drive higher ARPU per subscriber and reduce long-term churn. Advertising revenues declined 3% to $91 million due to 6% and 2% declines in print and digital advertising revenues, respectively, with trends improving from the fourth quarter. Advertising accounted for 17% of total revenue with 66% being digital, up 100 basis points from last year. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter grew 10% to $124 million with margins improving 120 basis points to 23.1%, the highest first quarter margin since News Corp’s acquisition of Dow Jones, driven by the strong B2B performance, which is on track to be the largest contributor to Dow Jones profitability in fiscal 2024. At Book Publishing, we saw a big recovery from fiscal 2023 results. Revenues were $525 million, up 8%, while segment EBITDA improved 67% to $65 million compared to the prior year. Margins improved over 400 basis points to 12.4%. You will recall the results a year ago were significantly impacted by the Amazon reset of inventory levels and rightsizing of its warehouse footprint. The strong performance this quarter benefited from the success of some key frontlist titles, as Robert mentioned, and also saw improvement in backlist sales, including a notable increase from Christian Publishing. Return rates improved materially, while inventory levels appear to have normalized. Inflationary costs are beginning to moderate with lower manufacturing costs helped by product mix and lower freight and distribution costs this quarter. The backlist contributed 61% of revenues, down from 65% last year, while digital sales rose 3% this quarter and accounted for 22% of consumer sales, within the 22% downloadable audio accounted for 45% of digital revenues. On an adjusted basis, revenues gained 6% and segment EBITDA rose 59%. Turning to News Media. Overall trends continue to be mixed geographically. Revenues were $548 million, down 1% versus the prior year, while adjusted revenues declined 2%. Advertising declined 5% and was down 6% in constant currency, while circulation and subscription rose 2% and was flat in constant currency. At News Australia, advertising saw some improvement compared to the fourth quarter, while the U.K. weakened notably in digital. As Robert mentioned, we did see declines in our traffic at several mastheads related to changes in algorithms at the large platforms which we are monitoring closely and have been felt across the wider publishing industry. Segment EBITDA of $14 million declined $4 million, results included approximately $3 million related to one-time costs as a result of the proposed combination of printing operations in the U.K. with DMG. This initiative demonstrates the continued focus on driving cost efficiencies across our News Media businesses. Before we look at the outlook for the next quarter, I would like to touch on free cash flow. First quarter free cash flow is typically lower due to the timing of working capital payments, including sports rights payments at Foxtel, and this year, it was also impacted from the lower HarperCollins sales in Q4 of the prior year. We anticipate generating strong and positive free cash flow for the year weighted to the second half consistent with prior years. As for the outlook, similar to our comments last quarter, we are continuing to operate in a difficult environment that remains unpredictable in the short-term. That said, we expect the second quarter to continue to show an improvement in revenues and profitability. Looking at each of our segments. At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential new buy listings for October grew 16%. Please refer to REA for a more specific outlook commentary. At Move, U.S. housing conditions remain challenging and we are expecting some reinvestment in marketing to improve share of voice levels, including the recently launched advertising campaign and also in product development to ensure we are best positioned to take advantage of market conditions when they improve. In Subscription Video Services, as mentioned last quarter, we continue to expect modestly higher expenses for the full year, driven by sports rights and some costs related to the launch of Foxtel streaming aggregation service, Hubbell, but remain on track to deliver relatively stable results for the year in local currency. At Dow Jones, we hope to see continued improvements in advertising declines, but as typical, visibility is limited. We continue to expect modestly higher overall expenses for the full year and strong revenue growth in B2B revenues. At Book Publishing, while we expect year-over-year improvements versus the prior year, revenue and profit growth is expected to be more modest than the first quarter given overall industry trends and the normalization of return rates. At News Media, revenue trends remain mixed geographically and we will continue to focus on ongoing cost efficiencies. With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lucy Huang from UBS.\nLucy Huang: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking questions. My one question is in relation to Move. So I just wonder if you can give us an update into the competitive landscape in the U.S. And just any early thoughts on the recent U.S. court ruling around agent commissions, like do you think this could have an impact on industry dynamics more broadly, and I guess, for the Move business longer term? Thanks.\nRobert Thomson: Yes, Lucy. Well, first of all, we will have to see what transpires on appeal in that particular case. But it’s clear that the U.S. property market has already been evolving if rather incrementally. I mean our focus is solely on providing the best possible service for vendors, for purchases and for Real Estate professionals, and we will continue to build audience through the use of our rather large media platforms. We have been taking advantage of the present downturn in the market to build out our sell-side operations and there is definitely a downturn in existing home sales when you have an annual rate of $3.9 million, which is well below the normal average of $5.5 million. We certainly foresee stronger activity longer term on the sell-side, a bit like the Australian market and we have acquired a company UpNest, which is particularly strong in that area. And there are interesting lessons for the U.S. market generally from Australia about what happens when the market turns. There’s patently much suppressed demand here at the moment. In Australia, we saw listings in Melbourne and Sydney surged 14% and 16% in the last quarter, and those numbers were even higher in October, Melbourne listings surged 32% and Sydney saw 33%. So we look forward to similar surging and soaring in the U.S. market when mortgage rates moderate.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Lucy. Laila…\nLucy Huang: Thank you.\nMichael Florin: … we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alan Gould from Loop Capital. Please unmute yourself to ask the question.\nAlan Gould: Thank you. Robert, I was wondering if you can get into a little bit more detail about this residulously reviewing our structure? And secondly, if you could comment on how the recent Real Estate lawsuit might affect the realtor and Move? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: I think, Alan, I answered the second question just now. So we will have to wait for the appeal there. The market itself is still obviously suffering from the heavy burden of mortgage rates here in the U.S. As for structure, look, we agree with the general thesis that the company has been transformed over the past decade and the full value of our incomparable assets is not fully represented in the share price. And that’s a tribute to the leaders of all our business from Rebecca in London to Patrick at Foxtel and to all our teams who have navigated through fundamental changes in each of their sectors and through the pandemic and the subsequent surge in interest rates. And as you can divine from today’s numbers, we are in a truly different position to most media companies with a robust balance sheet and are poised for even greater growth and profitability in the coming years when the economic heavens return to equilibrium. But at the same time, we are consciously and constantly reviewing our structure and have already taken tangible steps to clarify internal corporate structures to ensure that we have maximum flexibility in that overall structural consideration.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Alan. Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Karnovsky from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nTed Karakostas: Yes. Hi. Thank you. This is Ted on for David. I wanted to ask if you could give us an update on digital ad trends. Any color you can share on the quarter and expectations moving forward would be appreciated? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Sure. Obviously, the trends across the mass heads vary by segment and region and algorithm changes can have a short-term impact. Though we do have a strong relationship with both Google and Facebook, and they tend to respond thoughtfully to any infulicities that we identify and I’d particularly like to call out Sundar Pichai and his trustee team, who are conscious of the importance of journalists and journalism. Specifically, at Dow Jones, advertising was down 3%, which was a marked improvement after a 14% decline in the prior quarter, both digital and print reported improvement in trend lines. And there was a more modest decline of 8% in the U.K. But most of that was actually in print as digital advertising was flat compared to the same quarter last year. And the New York Post, while flat overall, actually saw an increase in print related advertising as the paper continued to expand its social, political and commercial reach.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Ted. Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Entcho Raykovski from Evans & Partners.\nEntcho Raykovski: Hi, Robert. Hi, Susan. So, firstly, I just wanted to ask, given that there have been some public comments from a shareholder over the past month about a proposal to spin out REA, interested in your comment as to whether you see merit in that proposal and is that something you are willing to explore or are you looking at other ways, as you have spoken about of closing the valuation gap? And if I can quickly throw a second one in there as well, hopefully, a straightforward one. Given that Foxtel refinanced over the quarter, when do you think the shareholder lines will be repaid? Are there any other impediments or hurdles to that repayment taking place now? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Entcho, it would obviously be inappropriate to comment on any shareholder in particular and actually inappropriate to comment on any shareholder comment. But as I have made clear, we are conscientiously reviewing our structure and have taken steps corporately to ensure that we have maximum flexibility that of itself reflects the constant institutional introspection that characterizes the way we oversee these very valuable assets.\nSusan Panuccio: And Entcho, just in relation to your question on Foxtel, we expect a modest return this year and anticipate the bulk of the repayments to come over the next few years. That’s obviously dependent on the current plans and cash flow position.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Entcho. Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research. Craig, your dial star six on your keypad to unmute.\nCraig Huber: Great. Thank you. Robert, it’s nice to hear that you guys are reviewing your structure. I have long talked about for the last 10 years or so. I mean, the company is very complicated for an investor -- an outside investor standpoint. So I am glad to hear you guys are looking at that seriously. I mean, when I look at the stock, I mean, I looked at 35% to 40% conglomerate discount that’s embedded in your stock in order to justify the stock in the low 20%s here and stuff. So I guess we will see what happens. I hope some significant happens on that front. If I could ask a question about books, I mean it’s nice to see the recovery from a year ago. Are you guys seeing anything in the book area, whether it be on the cost side or on the revenue side that would stop you from getting back to your EBITDA level that you are at in the low 300s back in fiscal 2021 and 2022? Thank you.\nRobert Thomson: Craig, look, obviously, HarperCollins’ journey through a rather unique period of unusual circumstances. The pandemic, logistical issues at Amazon, cost pressures and it has emerged from that confluence -- complexity with a strong front, backlist and margins actually dramatically improvement -- improving from the 4% in the final quarter of last fiscal to 12.4%. So we are seeing that margin improvement already. And there’s also no doubt that there’s reason for excitement about the entry of Spotify into audio books. Over the past few years, audio books have been by far the fastest-growing sector. And Spotify itself has really transformed both the concept and the experience of streaming. And so Daniel Ek and I have been discussing audio books for a few years, and we have reached an agreement on a model that is great for orders, for book lovers, for Spotify, and for us. The early signs from the U.K. and Australian markets are certainly positive. And if those trends hold, audio, which now comprise about 45% of digital sales will reach a far higher threshold level, we will be generating significantly more revenue, and as you asked, be improving our EBITDA.\nSusan Panuccio: And Craig, maybe just to add, we do expect continued profit growth in the balance of the year given certainly the prior year compares subject, of course, to that consumer demand that Robert talked about, but we expect it to be at a more modest rate than Q1. And we are hopeful that the EBITDA margin can remain positive to last year and in the low double digits for the full year having delivered the 12.3% in Q1. So I expect that margin rate will be more over the medium-term when we look to lift it.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Craig. Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Han from Morningstar. Please unmute yourself to ask a question.\nBrian Han: Robert or Susan, can you please clarify, did you guys say in Dow Jones B2B earnings are larger than B2C earnings or did you mean its contribution to growth is now larger than B2C?\nSusan Panuccio: They are larger and on track to be larger for the full year. So, yes, we did say that.\nBrian Han: On track to be larger?\nSusan Panuccio: And they were for the quarter.\nRobert Thomson: And for the quarter and they are obviously a higher margin digital high retention rates.\nBrian Han: Thank you.\nMichael Florin: Thank you. Thanks, Brian. Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Darren Leung from Macquarie.\nDarren Leung: Hi, guys. Thanks for the opportunity. I just have one on Move please and the Real Estate revenues were obviously down 20% and you called out listings down 11%, pretty crude, but it sort of implies that yield -- average yield was down about 9%. Can you talk a little bit about the drivers on this front please and how we should be thinking about the yield driver in the remainder of the year? Thanks.\nSusan Panuccio: Darren, we don’t, as you know, give out specific yields. You may recollect that actually over the course of probably the last 18 months, we have been seeing increases in yields that have helped us offset some of those declines. You could imagine in the current market it’s obviously challenging to be pushing yields up in the U.S. So look, I think what we would say is that we just continue to balance where we think we can push yields in certain markets with the current macro environment. That’s probably all we can say on that.\nMichael Florin: Thank you, Darren. Laila, we will take the next…\nDarren Leung: Thanks. Thanks.\nMichael Florin: Thanks, Darren. Thank you, Darren.\nOperator: One moment…\nMichael Florin: Sorry, Laila, we will take our next question, please.\nOperator: We can go to Craig Huber with a follow-up.\nCraig Huber: Yeah. I have a follow-up question on realtor.com please. Can you maybe just comment a little further on what you are planning to do on the cost side of the business for the rest of the fiscal year here? I understand obviously the pressure on the topline. But I mean, where do you guys think profits in realtor.com are going to go the -- issue on the topline from a macro standpoint, but you want to invest more it sounds like on the R&D side and in marketing? Thank you.\nSusan Panuccio: Craig. Look, if you think about the next quarter, you could probably expect costs to be relatively in line with what we have seen in Q1. As we mentioned, we do want to continue to invest in that business. We see a huge opportunity in that business when the market picks up. We want to make sure that we are in the best position to take advantage of that. Some of the investment areas that we are looking at are building our product investment having a look at marketing, obviously, just given the competitive position there. It’s really important that we do that. So we will probably back in some of those cost investments depending on how revenue trends.\nMichael Florin: Thank you. Thank you, Craig. Laila, any other questions?\nOperator: There are no further questions on the line at this time.\nMichael Florin: All right. Well, thank you all for participating. Have a wonderful day and we will talk to you soon. Take care."
