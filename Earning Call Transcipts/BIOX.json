        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining today's Bioceres Crop Solutions Fiscal Second Quarter 2024 Fiscal Results Conference Call. My name is Tia, and I will be your moderator for today's call. All participants’ lines will be muted throughout the presentation. But at the end of the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the call over to Paula Savanti, Head of Investor Relations at Bioseries Crop Solutions. Please proceed.\nPaula Savanti: Good afternoon, and thank you everyone for joining our second quarter Fiscal '24 Earnings Call. Today's presentation will be led by our Chief Executive Officer, Federico Trucco; and our Chief Financial Officer, Enrique Lopez Lecube. Both of them will be available for the Q&A session following the presentation. Before we proceed, I would like to make the following Safe Harbor Statement. Today’s call will contain forward-looking statements, and I refer you to the forward-looking statements section of today’s earnings release and presentation, as well as the recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new or changed circumstances. This conference call is being webcast, and the webcast link is available at Bioceres Crop Solutions Investor Relations website. At this time, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Federico Trucco, to begin our presentation \nFederico Trucco: Thank you. Thank you, Paula, and thanks, everyone, for joining. Good afternoon or good evening, depending on where you are. It's a pleasure to be having our earnings call today. Please turn to slide number three for this call's highlights. I would like to start by expressing our profound gratitude to our customers, our partners, and the entire Bioseries team from manufacturing to R&D to sales and so on for what has been a new record-setting quarter. While we are not immune to the broader destocking process in several geographies, resulting in a double-digit contraction in some key markets like Brazil, our portfolio of innovative products, secular growth drivers, and strong execution by our commercial teams allowed us to continue to outperform the industry and deliver our highest quarterly revenues yet. Total revenues in our second quarter of fiscal '24 were $140 million, an almost 50% improvement compared to the same quarter of last year. Our net income improved by eightfold, and our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reached $24.1 million, a 134% increase compared to the year-ago period, resulting in an LTM EBITDA of $86.7 million. In a minute, Enrique will provide further details on this outstanding financial performance. On the HB4 front, we continue to make good progress, as I will briefly discuss towards the end of the presentation. It is important to note that we have completed last season's wheat harvest, and jointly with our multipliers, have the required inventories to meet our fiscal year guidance. Another important recent development was the granting of a new patent from the USPTO, covering the HB4 soy technology, and initiating our third patent family for this product, which will provide protection for our seeds until 2042. I will now pass the presentation over to Enrique for a more detailed discussion of our numbers.\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Thank you, Federico. Good afternoon or good evening to everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. Let's dive in into our financials, starting with revenues on slide four. As Federico mentioned, we had our highest quarterly revenue rep this quarter, at $140 million, which represents a 49% increase year-over-year. This result is no doubt a reflection of the quality and attractiveness of our portfolio, but also the ability of our teams to deliver consistent and profitable growth when market conditions are normal. It is important to acknowledge that the percentage growth is particularly large, given the favorable comparison to a rather slow quarter last year. As you might recall, a year ago, Argentina, which is an important market to us, was undergoing a historic drought, and our growth trajectory had been unexpectedly put on hold. At that time, our top line had dropped 7% year-over-year. With the 49% revenue increase that we are announcing today, not only we are delivering targeted growth for this year, but also we are more than compensating for growth that was taken from us by the weather impact last year. During our previous earnings call, I mentioned that first quarter results needed to be looked at in the context of the whole Southern Hemisphere summer crop season, which runs August through December. In the prior fiscal year, we had had a record high first quarter paired with a soft second quarter due to the drought. Well, today we can confirm that the good performance in the current fiscal year's first quarter was matched by outstanding performance in this second quarter, which led to resumed double-digit growth in the first half of the fiscal year, reaching revenues of $257 million, which is a 16% increase to the previous fiscal year's first half. I think this is something that our sales and executions teams need to feel very proud of, so kudos to them and all of the colleagues that provide support to them on a daily basis. Let's turn to slide five, please, to look in more detail at the revenue performance by segment and the main drivers. The first thing I would like to note is that revenue growth this quarter was broad-based, so all segments contributed to growth in a fairly equal manner. In crop nutrition, revenues were up by 49%. This growth was mainly driven by sales of micro-heated fertilizers with an outstanding 61% increase in sales volumes paired with a slight increase in price despite lower commodity fertilizer prices, which in my view speaks to the strength of the value proposition this technology brings to farmers. Also within this segment, inoculants sales saw a slight year-over-year increase for the quarter, inclusive of profit sharing with Syngenta in countries that were operating under the agreement during this second quarter. The seed and integrated product segment saw the greatest percentage growth, almost doubling last year's sales number. In this case, the growth is due to higher HB4 sales, both seed sales and downstream grain sales. On the one hand, HB4 soy hectares under the Identity Preserve Program were at 150% of last year's hectares with a seven times expansion in Brazil as we continue to grow our HB4 program there. But also we explained last quarter that this current fiscal year, we have increased our commercialization of HB4 wheat grain inventories in pursuit of two things. One, recovering working capital from grain that is not seed quality. And two, to develop the industrial channel for fully traced inventories that satisfy particular sustainability and quality requirements. Also important within this segment that despite the migration of certain countries into the Syngenta agreement, seed treatment pack sales remained flat versus last year, which implies that the countries that were kept under our proprietary distribution grew their sales. And finally, in crop protection, revenues increased by 34% compared to last year. Here, the normalization of weather conditions in Argentina plus southern states of Brazil avoiding dry spells led to more pest pressure and greater need for product applications. Adjuvants in particular saw a 40% increase in sales this quarter in Argentina and also performed well in Brazil. In almost all categories of the segment, we saw growth in volumes with flat to slightly higher prices. Bioprotection was the only category that had a slight drop in the top line, but on the flip side expanded margins significantly and grew gross profit as we will see in the coming slide. So let's please turn to slide six now. For the quarter, overall gross profit was $51.5 million, which is a 46% increase over last year's number and consistent with revenue growth. Overall gross margin remained roughly flat at almost 37%. In terms of segments performance, crop nutrition saw the largest gross profit contribution increase, almost doubling gross profit from last year and reaching $15 million. The main driver was the top line growth from microbead fertilizers, which was matched by margin expansion from slightly higher prices and lower raw material costs in that particular product category. Seed and integrated products also contributed to gross profit growth by adding $2 million to the $8 million in gross profit contribution from last year and reaching $10 million. The overall gross margin for the segment decreased as sales from higher margin seed treatment packs and HB4 soy seed grew at a lower-pace than HB4 grain inventory sales, which had been negligible last year and that have inherently lower margins than packs and seeds. And finally, gross profit from crop protection increased by 40% as a result of higher sales, improved product mix and margin expansion in some product categories. The excellent performance of high margin adjuvants improved the mix, contributing to increase the average gross margin of the segment. But also, as I mentioned in the previous slide, a slight drop in bio-controlled product sales in the US was more than offset with margin expansion in that product category, which led to a positive contribution to gross profit growth by this product category, bio-protection. So let's now go to slide seven to take a look at adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA during the second quarter reached $24 million, which more than doubles the $10.3 million in the second quarter of the previous fiscal year. This substantial improvement is primarily explained by the increase of almost $17 million in gross profit that I just described, which was matched by an increase of $2 million in JV results and also operational leverage as operating expenses grew at a lower-pace than gross profit. To that regard, SG&A increased by less than 10% year-over-year, and the increase was largely explained by higher variable expenses on account of higher sales. Importantly, variable SG&A as a percentage of sales remained almost flat at around 5% of sales, and fixed SG&A on an absolute basis remained flat. Both things important to keep disciplined execution. Now let's please turn to slide eight to wrap up with some brief remarks on our financial debt and cash positions. As of calendar 2023 year-end, the total financial debt reached $223 million compared to $257 million in the prior fiscal year. Our financial debt position was slightly lower than the $226 million that we reported in the first quarter of this fiscal year, and we maintain a healthy run rate of interest expenses with an annualized average cost of debt at around 7%. Regarding our cash position, it is important to take into account that the position reported last year accounted for Syngenta's upfront payment, which explains the $87 million in cash. Compared to the first quarter of the current fiscal year, our cash position remained roughly flat. Last two comments from my side on the financial position. One with regards to leverage, we are now at 2.5 turns, mainly explained by good performance on the adjusted EBITDA line, but also the fact that we decreased our total debt compared to a year ago. And finally, with regards to the steep depreciation of the Argentine peso that happened during this second quarter, I think it is worth noting that the strength and stability of a dollar-denominated business in that country not only allowed us to conduct business as usual, but we could also achieve some financial gains from hedging our activities, as well as benefit from a better cost environment. To summarize my remarks, and before I turn it over to Federico, let me tell you that we are highly encouraged by the result of this quarter. We continue to see sustained demand for our technologies and a clear path to targeting double-digit growth, something that we can afford mainly because of the strength and attractiveness of the portfolio that we have been patiently building throughout the years. With that, I will hand the floor over to Federico.\nFederico Trucco: Thanks, Enrique. And please now turn to slide number nine for a brief update on HB4 soy. As we have indicated in our previous call, we have increased our identity preserve footprint in Argentina to be at 1.5 times of what we did last year, continuing to fine-tune our breeding efforts and variety positioning, while building inventories ahead of our targeted fiscal year 25 launch with multipliers and distributors. At the same time, we're seeing an accelerated progress in Brazil, where we work with 25 key farmers to test and multiply two materials developed under the TMG collaboration with good results. On the regulatory front, we obtained feed and food import approvals for soybeans in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, and Malaysia now reaching approximately 80% of the Asian soybean destinations from Latin America. And as I mentioned at the beginning of our call, we were granted an additional patent by the USPTO that should protect the HB4 soy technology through at least 2042. Please turn now to the next slide for an update on HB4 wheat. Two key takeaways here. One, overall variety performance was consistent to that of prior seasons, while we continue to fine-tune variety positioning, which is identify the best suited environments and planting times for each of our existing materials. Our newer materials, which we named second generation materials, have helped us improve performance in some high productivity conditions, where we are now at par to the best performing conventional seeds. And the second takeaway here is that jointly with our multipliers and distributors, we now have sufficient inventories, mainly of these second generation materials, to be in a position to meet our fiscal year '24 guidance, where we expect to improve the EBITDA of this business by approximately $15 million. I think these are the key highlights regarding HB4. I think we can now pause and open up the line for Q&A. Moderator?\nOperator: Absolutely. We will now begin the Q&A session [Operator instructions].The first question comes from Delana Kristen-Owen with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nDelana Kristen-Owen: Great, thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate you taking the question. So first, congratulations on the very strong results here. The one question I wanted to dig into on the HB4 wheat side. So you started talking, Federico, about the quality of the yield and sort of matching the performance of the incumbents. Just hoping you could expand on yield performance there. Any commentary you might have on performance of Gen two versus Gen 1? And I see in this pie chart here a little sliver of Gen 3. Just how to think about that performance yield and then maybe the S curve of adoption for that trait?\nFederico Trucco: Perfect. So thanks, Kristen, for the question and for joining the call today. I think in terms of overall performance in environments where wheat yields tend to be below average, and that is probably below three tons per hectare in Argentina, we've seen double-digit improvements across all generations. So we are talking about maybe close to 20% yield benefits, in some cases about 40% yield benefits when we are at the sort of 1.5 tons on yield. And that is a consistent observation in first-generation materials, second-generation materials, and then we'll talk a little bit about third-generation materials. As we move to higher yielding environments, what we saw in the first-generation materials is that above the 4.5, five tons per hectare, we were experiencing a yield drag or a gap compared to the top-performing commercial varieties. And that is what we tried to fix with the second-generation materials, where we are now into environments of six, seven, and eight tons per hectare at par with the most advanced, most adopted and adopted materials. Concurrently with that, what we have done in this past season is to try to better fine-tune the position of our existing portfolio so that we can tell people in which environments and at which planting times the materials that we hold are most likely to give that sort of top performance. So in the beginning, maybe we were averaging 7% improvements in yields in environments of more than four tons. As we better position these materials, we can move to 9% and 13% improvements when compared to the top-performing variety. So that's the work that has been done in this last season and finally on the third-generation materials. These are materials that probably perform equally to the second generation, but are sort of allowing us to complete certain portfolio gaps so that we can go into northern parts of Argentina with shorter wheat cycles and some regions where we didn't have locally adopted materials. So it's coming from a new wave of breeding, but not necessarily generating a differentiated performance compared to what I recently alluded to in terms of first and second generation. I don't know if I fully answered your question, but I'll pause here and see if that's the case or not.\nDelana Kristen-Owen: The background, that's exactly what I was looking for is understanding what that yield performance looks like, how it varies from generation to generation, and I guess to put just a brief follow-up on that, and then I do have a separate question, but just a brief follow-up on that would be, now, if you feel like there are any barriers that you still have to get through or roadblocks that you have to get through to see sort of that acceleration in adoption from this point?\nFederico Trucco: I think the key here is to get the multipliers. So as we indicated in the past, we have 27 multipliers in the last season compared to three the year before to help us get these varieties in the hands of farmers and have them fully experience what we have experienced with the initial set of farmers that helped us in the identity preserve scheme. So I think making sure the experience is extending to a broader community of farmers is very important to have multipliers improve their performance in the wheat business by having biotech events. Remember, we are the only biotech provider in wheat globally, and that tends to improve the economics for multipliers. So to have them realize those improved economics, I think is also very important. And I'm looking forward to sort of the upcoming season towards the fourth quarter of this year where we have today the inventories on hand to significantly improve compared to what we did the year before. And this means that we will be growing at least at 4X to try to meet the guidance that we provided.\nDelana Kristen-Owen: Okay, thank you very much for that. My second question is a little bit more for Enrique. And, BioSeries, just as a function of your geographic exposure, you're in a much better position coming into this calendar year, coming into this season than a lot of US peers. You've obviously been very successful in integrating Marone and getting that to a point of contribution. Your leverage is down to two times. Wondering what you think about the M&A environment for you guys at this point in time?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Hi, Kristen. Good to have you on the call and thanks for that question. Yes, of course. I mean, I think that we are sort of, we need to be thankful for where we are in terms of geographic positioning. The Southern Hemisphere has had a very, very good summer crops planting season. As you mentioned, we're making good progress in the US. So we do feel very confident about what we're doing. Now, I still think that we need to do work to get the US business and essentially the technologies that we get, we got from Marone now ProPharm to start thriving. And that will require some work, some additional work for us. So regardless of what the market might look like in terms of M&A, we will remain primarily focused on execution. If there are opportunities out there, obviously we will take a look at them, but our primary focus this year is execution and consolidating what we did last year with integration of Marone. And like I said, building a portfolio of technologies that is rather unique.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ben Klieve with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed\nBenjamin Klieve: All right. Thanks for taking my questions. And yes, congratulations guys. Really good quarter here. Lots to talk about, but I want to focus on HB4 Soy. First question, Federico, in your response to Kristen's question, I'm not sure if I overworked this, but the expectations for HB4 Soy here coming up the next fiscal year, didn't hear any comments around any changes to those expectations. Is your previous target still on track? Or do you think there's any kind of headwinds to that third year number as you stand today?\nFederico Trucco: Great to have you on the call, and thanks for your comment on the quarter. I think we're probably not ready yet to tell you if we need to change our guidance for fiscal year '25 on soy. I think it depends, to some extent, on the performance we experience with the current materials in the field and inventory levels. So we feel good in terms of where we are. We feel really good in terms of Brazil, and we think that is moving at a faster pace than what we projected. But it might be a little too early to tell. I think maybe in the next call or third quarter call, we might be able to sort of give you full visibility on that.\nBenjamin Klieve: Okay, very good. That's fair enough. And as a follow-up to that, you know that Brazil, the variety that you are in pre-commercial stage with target to Mato Grosso, can you kind of help kind of roughly characterize where exactly that stands in development? Is that a variety that you think is coming to market in the next year or two? Or do you think that's still more of a mid to long-term type product?\nFederico Trucco: No, I think it's a variety that we can add next year to the two varieties we already hold to try to improve optionality for our farmers in a region that is very important, as you know, the Mato Grosso region, not historically a region that experiences drought too frequently. But as we know, sometimes it happens, like in the last season, and it can be very dramatic. And that is what's creating a high level of interest from some multipliers and seed companies, and obviously, farmers for the HB4 technology. But we expect that to be joining the IP channel in the coming cycle.\nBenjamin Klieve: Great. And then last one for me, and then I'll get back into the queue. In the HB4 Soy performance in the U.S. in this past calendar year, in calendar 2023, there's kind of a series of three, 4-week, just brutal droughts throughout the U.S. I'm curious how the performance of HB4 Soy -- curious what HB4 Soy performance was in those conditions relative to the conventional alternatives.\nFederico Trucco: That's a good question. I don't have the data in front of me. Remember that in the U.S., it's mostly still within the breeding program stage. So we might have been at less than 1,000 hectares for sure. But depending on where we had that, we might have had exposure to the drought that you're alluding to or not, but let me get back to you on that. I'm not immediately knowledgeable on the performance since these were mostly breeding-related activities, no?\nBenjamin Klieve: Okay. Yes, very good. I totally understand. Very good. Well, I appreciate you taking my questions. Congratulations again on a really nice quarter, and I'll get back in line.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Bobby Burleson with Canaccord, please proceed.\nBobby Burleson: Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Yeah, I guess first off, this is something a little bit not directly related to your business, but wondering your thoughts. With the farmer protests in Europe and the scrapping of the pesticide reduction kind of proposal or plans there. I'm wondering kind of are you hearing anything in terms of changes in appetite for biologics? Or what -- how is that affecting the distribution dynamics going forward, do you think with some of the things that might backfill some of the pesticides that were scheduled to be eliminated?\nFederico Trucco: Thanks for joining, and great question. This is kind of a recent development. So we still don't have probably a full picture. We believe that there's been a little bit of a contradictory aspect to sort of the ambition of reduction in the European Union and how that sort of resulted in changes in the regulatory framework to try to help technology developers like us, provide solutions that will go or be aligned to that ambition. So, I think even though there was a significant ambition, we weren't able to see material changes in the regulatory process that would allow us to fast track, time to market for our existing solutions. So now, if those ambitions are being re-evaluated, we don't know what that might imply in terms of the sort of perpetual hope that we have to have a more straightforward regulatory process in Europe. It's -- might relieve some of the pressure from the existing participants on replacing their chemistries. On the other hand, that's kind of a very well-established consumer demand. So we don't know that, it will change the appetite for biologicals. There might be no regulatory driver early on, but in terms of our existing collaborations and our processes in Europe, we continue to do things the same way we were doing before this more recent development.\nBobby Burleson: Understood. And then I'm curious just with the wet weather in California, I'm based in California and it seems to be raining all the time, I'm wondering what the outlook is for pest pressure? You talked about pest pressure in other regions picking up given weather dynamics. I'm curious, what you're expecting here in California?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Robbie, this is Enrique. Thanks for joining us and for the question. Yes, I mean, you're in California as well. We're actually doing this call from California today. So we're here as well. We're seeing the rain coming. It's relieving to see California in this kind of like weather. So, yes, I think that we are preparing ourselves for what should be a rather normal to good sort of season here. We have the products in place. We've been sort of like implementing changes on the sales and marketing teams. So we are preparing ourselves for what should be very reasonable to good season here in California.\nBobby Burleson: Okay. Great. How does that contrast with what you've seen in the past? Since you've owned some Marrone business, is this potentially a better season than you've had since owning Marrone?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Yeas, for sure. I mean, on the weather side, for sure. Then I think that the overall environment with interest rates and sort of like distributors trying to minimize inventory holds, that's probably different to what Marrone had in the past. Maybe two or three years ago, there was a completely different context. Having said that, the fact that, we sort of like are a rather small participant yet in the market is something that makes us feel enthusiastic. We don't feel, as Federico mentioned, such a big pressure as other players from de-stocking or higher interest rates. So I think that that part of the market is different to what Marrone used to have in the past. The last two years have been tough on the weather side. So there are some pros and cons, but overall, I think that the market is there. We have the products and we have better teams. So we should be able to target sort of the type of growth that we see for this type of technologies and portfolio.\nBobby Burleson: Okay. Great. Congratulations on the strong results.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Brian Wright with Roth MKM, please proceed.\nBrian Wright: Thanks, good afternoon and congrats. I wanted to just delve into the into the evaluation effects with was that a net negative on the overall net income line?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Brian, this is Enrique. Well, I mean, we described that in the press release. So what I would say is that from a cash perspective, like I mentioned, we had some hedging gains. So let me take a step back. On the revenue front and the gross profit front, our business is isolated from whatever happens with the local currency, just because we operate in U.S. dollars. So there's no effect there. It's neutral, whatever happens with the local currency. Then there are some cost benefits on the SG&A line. It's not something that was primarily driving the cost effectiveness that we had, but it does help. It's sort of like a tailwind. And then on the financial line, because we hedge all of our activities, we did have some gains on the financial results line. I would say that, there's an accounting part that is related to the depreciation of the local currency, that is the accrual of a one-time deferred tax liability, that if you take a look at the earnings release, you will see that there's an $8 million income tax accrual that is disproportionate to the earnings that we made. And that's essentially related to how IFRS treats depreciation of local currency and potential gains on inventories. There are gains that we will realize in time. But we had to make that a tax accrual. So that's an accounting sort of accrual. It's not cash. On the cash front, the impact from the depreciation of the local currency was actually something positive to us.\nBrian Wright: Okay. So, to think about it, because I'm just trying to bridge the operating profit benefit right versus in growth year-over-year versus the net income and so it really is this tax dynamic that's the biggest driver, so like, if I were to try and derive a adjusted EPS number would I just use the normalized tax rate?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Yes, you could use a normalized tax rate, and I don't have the exact number with me right now, but I think that from the income tax that we are reporting in the quarter, there are about $5 million that are related to this deferred tax liability, and they're not exactly and directly related to the profits that we made in the quarter. So that would be an adjusted net income, or a way to think about an adjusted net income. We would have had a much better result, if it were not for this accounting provision that we had to make.\nBrian Wright: Great. We need to follow-up on the yield performance. And I just want to make sure that I'm interpreting your comments correctly. But it sounds like not only is the yield performance improved through the generations, but the performance of each generation over the years has been fairly consistent. Is that a fair observation?\nFederico Trucco: Yes, Brian, in terms of the low yielding environments. So when we are talking about yields that are below the three tons per hectare, the Generation 1 materials, Generation two materials, and Generation three materials that are now being developed will all give you the same type of improvement. The difference between Generation 1 materials and two materials is around yields in the higher yielding environment. So when we are talking about four to five tons per hectare, where in the first generation materials we had a yield drag compared to the best performing commercial varieties that has been neutralized or overcome in the second generation materials.\nBrian Wright: Great. But there's no degradation from like the second year of that generation. on their relative.\nFederico Trucco: Right, right. I mean, the materials, so yes, the performance of the trade survives as you move from one year to the next. There's no degradation effect from one year to the next.\nBrian Wright: Perfect, perfect. And then lastly, if I could, the Rhino Tech, just approval in South America, just any latest thoughts on timing?\nFederico Trucco: So we don't, we haven't, I think, provided guidance on that in terms of Rhino Tech. I think it's not likely to happen this year. The approval we're looking for this year is the US approval, which is going to be very important for us. I think South America is most likely after this year.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kemp Dolliver with Brookline Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nKemp Dolliver: Hi, thank you and good afternoon. First question is looking at the gross margin in the Seeds and Integrated Product segment. And on a, say, product-by-product basis, were there any surprises with gross margins? Or was this strictly a matter of the increase in the HB4 business?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Kemp, thanks for joining. This is Enrique. That's a good question. No, no, no surprises on the product-by-product gross margins, individual gross margins. The drop in the overall gross margin for the segment comes from a product mix, but there were no surprises. Actually, there were slight price increases both in seeds and seed treatment packs. But obviously, there was a much higher contribution from sales from inventory of grain that have inherently lower margins than the rest of the plots. So that's what's driving the average gross margin for the segment.\nKemp Dolliver: Second question is the new IP that was granted. Could you tell us a little bit more about the nature of the IP? Since this is a U.S. patent, is this IP that you have elsewhere and you're adding the U.S. or anything else on the subject?\nFederico Trucco: Yeah, sure, Kemp. This is Federico. So this is the third family of patents covering the HB4 technology, and this is what we call the event-specific patent. So the first family was probably covering the DNA construct and the method of generating the HB4 events. There's a second family of patents where we had certain modifications that help us achieve better performance. And then the third family is the one where you claim the insertion site in the seed, in the crop, that gives you the specific profile that results in the technology that we are commercializing. So, that -- you will see kind of a mirror strategy in wheat. And this is what is allowing us to have a staggered approach to IP protection. We tend to do the filings first in the US and then file in all the PCT countries except for Argentina, and some other countries in Latin America that are not part of PCT where we have to file individually within a year. So these -- you can expect these same type of protection to happen in every geography where we have an HB4 soil aspiration.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no additional questions left at this time. I will pass it back to Federico Trucco for any closing remarks.\nFederico Trucco: Perfect. So thanks everyone for joining us again. It's been a pleasure for us to announce these results. We are very excited about the way things are going in the current fiscal year. As I said at the beginning, despite the difficulties that have been experienced mostly by others in key markets like Brazil, and sometimes also the U.S. to be able to show this type of growth after growing last year as well, almost 25% on the revenue side, it's very rewarding. So we're delighted. We're looking forward to a great second half, and wishing you all a very good rest of the week. Thanks and have a good evening.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you. You may now disconnect your line."

But at the end of the presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Paula Savanti, Head of Investor Relations to begin. Paula, please go ahead whenever you’re ready.\nPaula Savanti: Thank you, and good morning to everyone joining us for today’s call. The presentation today will be led by our Chief Executive Officer, Federico Trucco; and our Chief Financial Officer, Enrique Lopez Lecube. Both of them will be available for the Q&A session following the presentation. Before we proceed, I would like to make the following Safe Harbor Statement. Today’s call will contain forward-looking statements, and I refer you to the forward-looking statements section of today’s earnings release and presentation, as well as the recent filings with the SEC. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect new or changed circumstances. This conference call is being webcast, and the webcast link is available at Bioceres Crop Solutions Investor Relations website. At this time, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Federico Trucco. Thank you.\nFederico Trucco: Thank you, Paula, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today in our first quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call. Please turn to Slide 3 for the main business and financial highlights for this period. Our first quarter of last year was a record setting quarter in which we nearly doubled our revenues when compared to the year before period that is the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Part of last year’s growth resulted from anticipated second quarter sales as weather conditions were quickly deteriorating in our main LATAM market. In retrospect, this early move allowed us to mitigate part of the effects of what turnout to be a historical drought extending through the next three quarters. We are now happy to say that rains have finally normalized and that planting in our main markets are progressing at full force. Our first quarter’s financial performance is starting to reflect this regained momentum with total revenues at $116.6 million, with most segments exhibiting post-drought recovery and the international business continuing to expand. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $16.3 million. Enrique will explain our financial performance in greater detail in his analysis. On the HB4 front, wheat harvest has started in Northern Argentina with very favorable results for HB4 materials in an otherwise poor season for the crop. Soy plantings are advancing well with good moisture conditions in our targeted regions. Our generation HB4 program is currently running at 150% of prior season acreage with an important 6x increase in Brazil. An important milestone in this quarter was the granting of our first patent covering our Ultra High Concentrate or UHC technology by the USPTO. This technology sets the new gold standard in biological nitrogen fixation for legumes, consolidating our leadership position in this important seed treatment category. We’ll provide an overview of this milestone and other groundbreaking improvements in Seed Applied Technologies that clearly position us as the technology leaders within this segment of biological ag inputs. And finally, we have completed the construction of our new state-of-the-art adjuvant production plant in Londrina, Brazil, strategically positioned to expand our footprint in the high growth Brazilian market as of this year. Let’s turn now to the next slide to put our current quarter into historical perspective. As I indicated before, we’re comparing to a record high quarter the year before and also achieving our second highest historical revenue mark as we do so, while continuing on the upward momentum exhibited in our last quarter of fiscal 2023. I don’t think there’s much more to add to this slide. So I’ll pass it on to Enrique so that he can give you a more complete overview of our financial performance. Kike?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Thank you, Fred, and good morning to everyone on the call today. Thanks for joining us. Let’s start with I think its Slide 5 and take a look at the quarterly revenues. So revenues in this first quarter were marked by the recovery of our Argentine business after three consecutive quarters that were heavily affected by drought. Pre-campaign sales in Argentina during the fourth quarter had already signaled somewhat of a normalization of weather conditions and the first quarter of this fiscal year confirmed that trend as we’re getting into the high season of summer crops planting in Argentina. So let’s take a look at each segment. So in crop protection, we saw a strong recovery of our adjuvants business from previous quarters, particularly in Argentina. And these countries showed a 30% improvement in sales year-over-year for that particular product category, which is good to see as these are high margin products. In some way I think that spring at this time of the year signals a normalization of weather conditions and the farmers’ willingness to spend on preparing fields for planting, both good signs to get as we’re heading into the high season. On the flip side, in this segment, in this quarter, we got rid of some lower margin sales of third-party crop protection products, which is aligned with our efforts to reduce our working capital position. Overall, the segment sales declined by 11%, but importantly, gross profit increased as we will see in the next slide. So Seed and Integrated Products, which is the segment that grew it – did it by 61%, which was explained by downstream sales of HB4 wheat grain. As you might recall under the identity preserve generation HB4 program we purchased from farmers enrolled in the program all of their production. Although the program was originally put in place to comply with regulatory requirements, also to fine tune varieties on which to deploy HB4 and finally to multiply seed. Over the last three seasons, our interest in exploring adjacent monetization opportunities grew as we see value in really understanding with a high level of detail what happens in the field and being able to exchange that information with other players of the supply chain. That might take the form of fully traced information or agronomic management to obtain certain industrial attributes that are important to processors. Federico will expand on this in a coming slide. But what attains to the slide in this quarter, in particular, although at a modest margin, we were able to commercialize upwards of $10 million of inventories that won't be used as seed, which is particularly important to keep working capital under control as we continue making headwinds with HB4. And finally, in crop nutrition, Pro Farm biostimulants sales continue to deliver growth, particularly in Europe, which is good to see and same that in crop protection, Argentina confirmed good prospects for the summer crop planting season. I think it is worth to double click on the dynamics of this segment as the cold comparison to last year might not be a fully accurate indicator of this year's performance. Particularly in the case of micro-beaded fertilizers, last year's first quarter was extraordinary as a result of price and volumes. In terms of price, you might recall that last year, we were seeing record high MAP and DAP prices, the two commodities that our product replaces, which allowed for favorable pricing on our end. And in terms of volumes, we decided to press forward and be aggressive as we anticipated, we would have a soft second quarter in Argentina because of drought. This season, though, has gone back to normal with a good preseason sale in the fourth quarter of last year, which continued with sustained demand during this first quarter. So as comforting as it might have been at the time to have an agile sales force that allowed us to be aggressive when we needed to for the type of technologies that we commercialize, we would much rather have a normal market environment like the one we are seeing this summer crop season. And so I think that prospects for the first half of this fiscal year remain good for the time being and we are optimistic about what we can accomplish compared to last year if you take a look at the first half. Let's now turn to Slide 6 to briefly discuss margins. So margin wise, in crop nutrition, gross profit contribution dropped, mainly driven by the dynamics I just described for revenues. So lower fertilizer sales were coupled with lower gross margins or lower prices, mainly. On a different note, we saw higher biostimulant sales bringing in gross margin expansion for the category, which helped us to partially offset the drop from fertilizers. Seed and integrated products was practically flat, if you look at gross profit. In the quarter, we saw some profits from seed treatment pack sales migrating to Syngenta. You might recall that those were compensated for in the first quarter of the calendar year and that was the third quarter of our last fiscal year, the previous fiscal year. And as I was mentioning before, as modest as they might have been, downstream sales of HB4 allowed us to compensate for that decline in margins from seed treatment packs, and the segment remained practically flat. And finally, in crop protection, gross profit increased by 10% despite the declining sales, as I was mentioning before. So the increase is mainly due to the fact that we strategically exited low margin third party product sales and most of those were replaced by higher adjuvant sales. This was also coupled by a gross margin expansion of the bioprotection sales coming from Pro Farm. Let's please turn to the next slide to take a look at the evolution of adjusted EBITDA. So adjusted EBITDA for this quarter was $16.3 million, compared to a bit more than $24 million last year. I think we can break that down in two buckets, half of that decline is explained by $4 million of less contribution to EBITDA from operations. If you couple the drop in $6.4 million of gross profits and the improvement of $2.3 million from SG&A savings and JVs. The other half of the $8 million decline is essentially explained by R&D expenses, higher R&D expenses, a change in the net realizable value of grain and other income and expenses. Importantly, R&D expenses that were higher are mainly explained by the registration of commercially available Pro Farm products in South American markets, and regulatory and registration efforts related to the launch of the Rinotec platform that Federico will address in his slides, all of this, strategically important for our near and long-term plans. Finally, let's please turn to Slide 8 to take a look at the balance sheet and cash position. Our debt position has remained stable from one year to the next at $225 million, a little bit more than that, with a reduction in the leverage ratio from 2.78 times to 2.5 times of leverage. We remain at a healthy run rate of interest expenses with an annualized cost of debt of approximately 7.5% and our cash remains strong at $43.5 million, leading to a net financial debt of $183 million on September 30, 2023. Let me wrap up by saying that we are very encouraged by the results of these quarters – of this quarter, despite the uneven comparison to a record high quarter last year. And we are enthused by the expectations for the remainder of the year. With that, I will hand the floor over to Federico to give you some more color on the rest of the strategy.\nFederico Trucco: Thanks, Enrique. As I indicated at the beginning, we have experienced good grains in the last part of October and early part of November, indicating that El Niño weather cycle is finally here. This is allowing us to progress well with soybean plantings where we decided to increase acreage under the generation HB4 program by close to 50%. Not only to initiate the inventory ramp up and variety optimization process in Brazil where we are doing 6x what we did last year, but also taking advantage of the recently announced agreement with Moolec Science, which is allowing us and our participating farmers to monetize on the ESG attributes of this identity preserved scheme. We will review some of the features of this value chain integration in a minute, continuing with what Enrique indicated in his part of the presentation. After a very dry winter season, wheat harvest has started in Northern Argentina and preliminary results show particularly good performance for HB4 materials. We expect to be able to report full season results in our February earnings call. An important milestone in the case of HB4 wheat was the recent approval for cultivation in Paraguay, being this the third market after Brazil and Argentina where the technology can be used for production purposes and making Latin America 95% available for the application of this technology. Similarly, the recent feed and food approval from Indonesia for HB4 soy allows us to reach jointly with other approvals obtained. Until today, 86% of the soy export markets of Argentina and 75% of the Brazilian export destinations. Please turn to Slide 10. As Enrique indicated, when we launched our generation HB4 Identity Preserve Program, we had three main objectives. First, to move forward with the development of HB4 technology in the field, while we were still procuring regulatory approvals, minimizing opportunities for cross channel contamination or premature technology leakage. Second, learn from farmers with a collaborative arrangement. Identify what works, what doesn't work, where and when the technology performs, fine tune varieties and breeding program objectives, measure, measure and continue to measure what we do and how that affects the ecosystem. And finally, ramp up inventories. In doing this over several seasons, we learn a lot. We planted HB4 in hundreds of thousands of hectares in most agricultural regions under an array of management practices and with hundreds of different farmers. The wheat materials that we finally launched with seed multipliers in this season resulted from these learning's. But this scheme also forced us to have conversations downstream so that we could offload inventories that we could not retain for future seed sales. We are today operating with more than 40 different processors and starting to monetize the benefits of these downstream relationships. From 5% to 10% benefits associated with agronomic management to higher premiums such as those recognized by Moolec when we provide ESG reports meeting minimum carbon, water and ecotoxicology thresholds, or even higher value from functionalized grain such as good wheat. In our last two quarters, we have started to monetize some of these benefits or contractualized arrangements that will allow us to do so more significantly into the future, while we recover part of the working capital that was tied up in the program. An especially important milestone achieved during this quarter was the granting by the USPTO of the first patent for our latest generation of inoculants, which are ultra-high concentrate. Please switch to Slide 11 to see some of the features of this innovation. UHC inoculants have an order of magnitude higher rhizobia concentration when compared to our LLI formulations used in professional seed treatments or that of our leading competitors. This increased concentration enables rate reduction while retaining pre-inoculation periods further facilitating the replacement of chemical seed treatment solutions. Since some biological substitutes require greater loading. We can see this better when we turn to the next slide and see how the UHC technology matches other groundbreaking improvements we have delivered through other biological platforms. On the pest control front, our second generation Rizoderma biofungicide, which achieves chemical parity at a 6th of the rate of our earlier version, and our Rinotec platform formerly known as MBI-306, which provides both nematode and insect control at a fourth of the rate for which only one of these is achieved with our previous system. As application rates are lowered, we can now include biosimulation solutions such as those from our UVB Platform, which significantly improve early crop establishment and subsequent yield. While we leave more than 50% of the loading capacity of the seed unutilized, making room for new seed treatment innovations or increased seed nourishment. Combined, these platforms represent the new gold standard for biological seed treatments. On a final note, please turn to Slide 13 for an overview of our newly constructed adjuvant facility in Londrina. This facility will allow us to expand our in-country manufacturing by 4X, enabling sales for $60 million of our current portfolio of adjuvants at installed capacity. This equates to less than 4% market share for the Brazilian market, a goal that we expect to achieve within the next two years. I think that we can now open up the floor for the Q&A session. So operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now enter our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Ben Klieve from Lake Street Capital Market. Ben, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBen Klieve: All right, thanks for taking my questions. Good start to the year, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter and great to hear the weather updates, especially. A few questions for me; first of all on the contributions in the quarter from grain – from HB4 grain, I'm wondering what the kind of balance of grain inventory you continue to have that you expect to monetize here throughout the balance of this fiscal year?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Hi Ben, this is Enrique. Thanks for joining us. Good to have you on the call. So, look, I think that this is mostly coming from a wheat that was harvested in December, January. So December 2022, January 2023. So there's going to be probably some more of that that is offloaded in the second quarter, and then we're done with it. So that's mostly, I wouldn't expect something in a different order of magnitude than what you're seeing now in this quarter.\nBen Klieve: And sorry, I want to make sure I heard you right at the end, you said I should not be expecting something of this order of magnitude that we saw in the first quarter going forward. Is that what I heard?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: No, that you should not expect something in a different order of magnitude if something is going to be around this number or smaller. But what we're doing is essentially wrapping up the cashing out of the grain that was not used as seed and that was harvested in the last crop season. Remember that in South America and particularly in Argentina, wheat is harvested in December and January. So we're heading now into the new harvest and expecting to cash out all of the inventories that are not used as seed in this second quarter of the fiscal year.\nBen Klieve: Got it. Okay, very good. And then you also talked about stepping away from some lower margin third-party revenue in the quarter. Can you characterize how significant this revenue base was, say in fiscal 2023? Just trying to understand kind of what overall kind of revenue headwinds you're going to have in 2024 as that low margin business is sensibly exited?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Yeah. That's a good question. Look that was probably in the tune of $15 million to $20 million last year. Remember that, I mean, we are now getting into a position where we want to carefully manage working capital. It was different when we were selling this type of low margin products under a lower scenario of interest rates. As we see cost of capital increasing, we want to be a little bit more careful on what we commercialize and most than anything, what is the cash cycle on those products. That's why this year we decided to let go of some business opportunities that might seem attractive, sort of like in the surface, but when you do the full cash cycle of the products, maybe it's not worth having them.\nBen Klieve: Got it. Okay, very good. The one more for me, and then I'll jump back in queue around this new product. The nitrogen fixation, I think UHC I believe is the brand name. Wondering if you can talk about kind of the efficacy of the product in terms of the overall levels of nitrogen fixation that this product enables versus prior generations or competitive technologies? And then also your expectations on the degree to which this new product will be additive to your inoculant business, or if you expect any kind of cannibalization from your legacy business?\nFederico Trucco: Thanks Ben. This is Federico. It's great to have you in the call and that is a great question. In terms of nitrogen fixation, rhizobia is rhizobia, so what you will see is that you can expect the same level of fixation throughout the portfolio. So the difference is not so much on how much nitrogen is fixed. The difference is mostly around how much time before you can do the application on the seed without losing the bacteria and that is very important in some markets, like in Brazil and the United States, where seed is sold pretreated. So if you had applications that were lost in less than 60 days, that's a no-go for that part of the business. You need to have more than 60 days of viability in the seed and what you're seeing here in this particular solution is that we can get up to 270 days. Now, that is a function of bacterial decay. So the more bacteria you have loaded in the seed, the longer that nitrogen fixation capability is retained. So the ultra high concentration allows you to have either more days of pre-inoculation or achieve a similar number of days of pre-inoculation to the sort of competing technologies, but at a much reduced rate. And the reduced rate is important because at the end of the day, what you can put in a soybean seed is limited in volume, so you cannot load more than 8 milliliters of product on a kilo of seed or 800 on 100 kilos of seed. So, and inoculants were not insignificant in that loading capacity, because if you look at some of the prior versions, we were talking about products that were applied at more than 250 milliliters. So this is allowing us to reduce the rate while we preserve sort of the pretreatment period that is required for professional seed treatments and open up space for additional technologies that might be utilized at the seed treatment level. This is a huge enabler for the American market. Remember, our presence in the inoculants business in the U.S. was fairly small until now, in part because we didn't sell to the on farm solution. Our inoculants are liquid inoculants, so we were selling mostly to the upstream customers. And in the upstream business, you needed to load a number of different things, and we were limited by the loading capacity of our LLI products and prior generation. So the UHC version is a huge enabler for the upstream business in the U.S. And I think in Brazil, what it will do is allow us to expand our profitability, because basically we can reduce rates. And by doing that, obviously we can improve gross margins as we deliver something that can be used both on and off farm in that particular market. So maybe a little bit of cannibalization in Brazil with the LLI business, but a significant expansion in the U.S. in a market that we had very little penetration.\nBen Klieve: Very helpful, Federico. Thank you for that. Very good. Well, more to talk about, but I think I'll leave it there. Thanks for taking my questions, and I'll get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you, Ben. Our next question today comes from Bobby Burleson from Canaccord. Bobby, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBobby Burleson: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess the first one is just maybe going to the topic of the farmers pausing in Argentina ahead of the elections. What kind of impact do you see there in terms of maybe pent-up demand, pent-up activity and how does that translate into the way we should think about seasonality for you guys this year versus previous years?\nFederico Trucco: Thanks Bobby. That's a very good question. I think the election situation in Argentina creates room for speculation, particularly in terms of what might happen to sort of commodity prices under a new administration, whether the export taxation will be removed, mitigated to some extent or not. We have had an extended electoral process because, as you know, we are going into a runoff with two candidates that will occur in this upcoming weekend. So I think that level of uncertainty and potential speculation from farmers probably waiting to make decisions until a final outcome is achieved will soon be over because we will have final results by December. At the end of the day, planting or not planting, there's not too much optionality there in the face of farmers, regardless of how much they might realize at the end because of how commodities get priced. I think farmers tend to plan because that's the only way they can retain hope for future income. Whether they do that making anticipated payments because they feel there is a peso devaluation coming around the corner, or whether they sort of keep the standard financial terms because they feel that it's less likely is what's kind of dictated by the political scenario. The good news is that one way or another we'll have that uncertainty finalized as of this coming Sunday. I don't know, Kike, if you want to add anything to that.\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Hi Bobby, good having you on the call. Yes. Look, I think that what Federico just described is accurate. Throughout the season, what we saw were some factors that played into farmers wanting to rush into buying and then being deterred from that by other factors. So when you put all of that in, I think that we’re seeing a season that is unfolding pre-normal I would say, without much anticipated purchasing from farmers and without a delay in the purchasing either, because we are seeing good rains. And remember that there’s an emotional aspect in farmers minds when you’re coming out of a drought like the one we had last year. So they see good moisture on the soil and they want to plant. So they have been purchasing what they need either to sort of like get fields ready. Like I was saying, on the adjuvant side, there was a lot of spraying done to get fields in shape for planting. And then obviously, as the planting season evolves, then buying seeds and fertilizers and whatever is needed for planting. So again, when you factor all of that in, I think that we’re seeing, from a seasonality perspective, a rather normal season in Argentina.\nBobby Burleson: Great. And then maybe just on the topic of weather, can you help us understand across different geographies how you anticipate at this early stage El Niño’s impact, including maybe the impact potentially in California as well as South America and anywhere else where you think that there’s going to be an impact in terms of pest pressures, unusual moisture levels and timing around planting, whatever else you think is important regarding El Niño. Thanks.\nEnrique Lopez Lecube:\nBobby: There might be some areas where you’re seeing an excess of water, but nothing that is so far concerning. And I think it’s probably too early to know in California how that’s going to unfold. For the time being, I would say that in the Americas, we’re seeing normal markets all around, normal weather conditions in the markets where we operate, which is good to have. I mean, after all of the complexity that La Niña created last year, not getting sort of like any kind of news that are disturbing to our business is good to have. So I would say that no news, good news so far.\nFederico Trucco: Yes, yes. I agree. Not much to add. Yes. Go ahead, Bobby.\nBobby Burleson: Thanks. And then just one last one on the nitrogen-fixing patents that you received and opening up additional opportunities in North America for your speed treatment opportunity there. Is there a way to kind of help us understand the size of that particular market that opens to you? Because it sounds like its additive to what you’re doing, and it sounds like a pretty substantial market, maybe help characterize the size of the incremental opportunity in North America from…\nFederico Trucco: Yes. Look, I think we have historically done probably less than $5 million of inoculant sales in the U.S. market, and that probably was inclusive of Canada. This technology on the upstream should allow us to do at least 5 times that on inoculants alone. And I think it does have a synergistic effect with the rest of our seed treatment portfolio, because when you engage with upstream partners, and remember that the Syngenta agreement in the U.S. is non-exclusive for upstream, so we can go to other participants as well. And this is not negating the value of Syngenta is a market leader and probably can do much better than what we used to do ourselves alone. But this is also allowing us to explore other relationships where we might be today also selling the bioinsecticides for seed treatments. And then we can go with the combined offering, so that you can become a more attractive provider of seed treatment solutions, co-formulated seed treatment solutions for that part of the industry. So I think it’s very meaningful in terms of where we were and our ability to sort of make these 5 times what it used to be. It’s not just us pushing things forward, but we have the Syngenta relationship now and potentially other upstream partners with whom we can partner with this new technology as kind of generating the opportunity for the reengagement in our conversations.\nBobby Burleson: Great. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Bobby. Our next question today comes from Kristen Owen from Oppenheimer. Kristen, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAndre Adams: Hi there, this is Andre Adams on for Kristen. I was hoping you could offer some commentary on the competitive landscape given what we have heard from other crop protection companies. We’re trying to understand if there’s some bifurcation in purchase activities between the biologicals and conventional or generic products.\nFederico Trucco: Hi Andre, that’s a great question. I think the good part of being in biologicals is that sometimes you cannot keep inventories forever like you do with some of the most generic crop protection products. Our best biologicals have shelf lives of maybe 18 months to two years. Where that sort of implies some logistical complications and manufacturing expertise, it also prevents some of the inventory situations that you might be seeing today in the more generic crop protection industry, where we are hearing other companies being significantly affected by the destocking that is occurring at different levels, particularly in the Brazil and the U.S. market. So we have not seen that in the biologicals front. Also to add, many of the products we’re bringing to market are unique within their categories. So there’s kind of a high level of protection from the IP and the novelty of the product that prevents sort of the commodity inter exchange that you see with the crop protection business in general. So I think we’re fortunate because of participating in the biological space and we’re not as exposed to the process that you’re seeing across the crop protection industry in some of the major geographies. And this has been well communicated by other companies in their recent earnings calls now.\nAndre Adams: Got it. Thank you so much. And for the next question, just to help us understand the impact of the mix shift in the Seed and Integrated Products and how we should think about that improving as you progress to the next generation. And any guidance on cadence for gross margin in the segment throughout the year.\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Hi Andreas, this is Enrique. Thanks for joining on the Oppenheimer side. Good to have you on the call. So look, I think what you should expect in Seed and Integrated Products is what we have been communicating so far on the seed side. That is that we expect to make margins that range from 45% to 55% on the sales of HB4 seed. When we sell the full bag of the seed ourselves, margins of upwards of 80% when we are just collecting on a royalty. And that is something that we expect to happen probably in the next 24 months as we get the multipliers that we enrolled with to get seed out in the market, and we just invoice the royalty. So that’s the type of profitability that we’re expecting on the HB4 side. What you’re seeing this particular quarter is something that is more linked to the commercialization of grain that is produced under the HB4 program that Federico just described. And on that part, we expect to see lower margins. I mean, we are not talking about this type of 45% to 55% or 80% and upwards when you get royalties. We’re probably talking of margins of up to 10% when we are engaging certain industrial processors with whom we do a supply agreement with certain industrial attributes. So we’re talking about managing agronomic features in the field, working together with a farmer, in the case of wheat, for example, to obtain certain levels of protein that might be attractive for millers. And in the case of soybeans, the same when you go to sort of soybean concentrates. Then when you talk about deploying other technologies that we have in the pipeline, like good wheat, that is a technology for which we have a license in Latin America, we’re probably talking about higher margins, margins that can go to 20% and higher. And also, when you talk about ESG attributes, like the announcement we made on the agreement with Moolec, where we will also probably be collecting margins that are upwards of 20%. But all of this on the grain commercialization is something that will be capped, if you will, remember that we've announced that we are maintaining the acreage of the generation HB4 program for wheat at the tune of 50,000 hectares. And we will be monitoring sort of like the effectiveness that we have in monetizing these premiums. And if we are not able to monetize these premiums, we will probably downsize the program. If we are able to monetize on this, we will sort of like, we already have enough of an acreage to ramp this up. But for the time being, in the short-term, I would say that this should not be something that is sizable in terms of gross profit compared to what we believe we can accomplish on the seed sales themselves. I don't know, Federico…\nFederico Trucco: What I would add to that is that the quarters that usually reflect seed sales are the second quarter of our fiscal year when we report the soybean season seed sales and the fourth quarter of our fiscal year where we tend to report the wheat season seed sales. So those should be quarters where gross profit tends to be closer to the 50% mark. Not to say that in those quarters there might be some inventory sales that are not seed related and that might be realizing different type of premiums, but which are usually much lower below the 20% range, as Enrique alluded. So in terms of our guidance for incremental EBITDA for this current year coming from HB4 wheat, which was around $15 million that will be derived mostly from this seed sales side of the business and probably heavier towards the fourth quarter when we do recognize those sales.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Kemp Dolliver from Brookline Capital Markets. Your line is open, Kemp. Please go ahead.\nKemp Dolliver: All right, thank you and good morning. The results included an inventory valuation adjustment that was broken out, which I think is the first time you've reported this. So how should we think about it in terms of ongoing effect and whether this is something that results from discrete transactions or if it's continuous revaluation of assets on the balance sheet? That's the first topic.\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: So I assume that you're referring to the adjusted EBITDA rich, Kemp.\nKemp Dolliver: Yes.\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: All right. Yeah.\nKemp Dolliver: It's also in the income statement.\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Yeah, that's all right. So thanks for the question. I think it is worth sort of like taking a look at that. So what we're seeing here is that because now we are recognizing revenues of these type of sales that allow us to sort of capture these lower margin opportunities with a prospect of higher margins, if we are able to do what we believe we can do with inventories generated under this closed loop system, that means that we need to revalue inventories every quarter close. This is done at sort of like average valuations, taking as a reference market prices, which doesn't mean necessarily that that is the value that we will be getting for our inventories. So this is just evaluation of the remaining inventories and whether that's adjusted or not compared to the beginning of the quarter.\nKemp Dolliver: Assuming no premiums. No?\nEnrique Lopez Lecube: Assuming no premiums. Exactly right. And the other thing is, Kemp, bear in mind that particularly in the case of soybeans, so we have as a policy, no price risk, so we hedge for all of our inventories. In the case of soybeans, that is easier to do, because we have a very liquid market in Argentina, in Brazil, and you have a high correlation with CBOT, so very easy to sort of completely erase any type of price risk. And bear in mind that we think of ourselves as a technology company. We're not in the business of trading. In the case of wheat, that is a little bit more complex, because we don't have as liquid as a market to fully hedge. So I would say that $1.4 million change in net realizable value is not strictly linked to what we believe is going to be the value at which we commercialize wheat inventories. It is harder to get the full hedge, but that is street price, not recognizing the premiums that we are seeing in the commercialization of those inventories.\nKemp Dolliver: Great. Thank you for the explanation. The second question relates to the UHC patent and how should we think about the timeframe for the benefits? And I'm thinking of this in a couple of components. One is, you mentioned this opening of the U.S. market and then potentially other geographies, but then also there's this benefit with regard to what I'm assuming is your ability to then sell more products for the same seed. And so how should we think about the timeframes for these benefits to play out?\nFederico Trucco: Hi Kemp, thanks for joining. This is Federico. So some of these benefits will play out immediately, for instance, we already have registration in Brazil. We're already producing, manufacturing this product, selling part of this in Argentina and starting to export to Brazil under the Syngenta agreement. In the U.S., we're planning to also sell this product in the current fiscal year and probably make this our go-to-market sort of approach with the different upstream partners. So I think obviously, we're not going to fully realize the 5x opportunity that this will generate in the U.S. on the inoculant side alone. But I think we can be somewhere in between for the current fiscal year. So it's a product that's already registered where we are already doing manufacturing and we are already exporting things, so it's not too far away.\nKemp Dolliver: And just the other concept of being able to sell more products to the same seed. First of all, is that even feasible for you at this point or will that take a longer time to develop?\nFederico Trucco: No, I think it's feasible. I think it does synergize very well with the Rinotec platform, which we expect to launch this year in the U.S. It might be a product that we can sell with a prior system, the MBI-206 platform that includes what we today sell through although for instance, in seed treatments. But that will not come with sort of the type of – will not free up as much of the seed as I think it will once we have the Rinotec solution. Because the other bioinsecticide – the bioinsecticide that we currently sell in the U.S. requires a load that is between 300 to 400 milliliters per 400 kilo of weight where we can reduce that by 4x to 5x and have nematicide control as well with a new platform. But that platform is due to be approved for commercialization in the current fiscal year in the United States and we are hoping for approval in a later stage in Europe as well. The Rizoderma part of our portfolio is one that will be relevant in Europe, for instance, where we are planning for 2025 approval of the newer version. So that might come maybe after 12 to 18 months. But I think this is very important for the U.S. market in our view.\nKemp Dolliver: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are currently no further questions on this time on the line, so I'd like to hand back to Federico for any closing remarks.\nFederico Trucco: Well, thanks again everyone for joining. I think we have had a good start to fiscal 2024. It's good to see the weather not longer being a significant issue, at least in the one market where we still have a very meaningful presence. So we look forward to a great year regaining momentum. We have created opportunities in multiple areas of the ag input space. We have developed relationships that are ready to be scaled. We have invested in capacity like what you saw for the Londrina facility for adjuvants in Brazil o we are ready to go. We're excited, energized, and hopefully we can continue to deliver growth for our shareholders in the quarters to come. Have a great rest of the week and please feel free to follow-up with us as needed. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call, everybody. Thank you very much for joining. You may now disconnect your line. Have a great rest of your day."
