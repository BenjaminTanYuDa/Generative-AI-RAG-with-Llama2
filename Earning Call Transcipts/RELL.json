        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by and welcome to the Richardson Electronics Earnings Call for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are on a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Edward Richardson, CEO. Please go ahead.\nEdward Richardson: Good morning and welcome to Richardson Electronics conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Joining me today are Robert Ben, Chief Financial Officer; Wendy Diddell, Chief Operating Officer and General Manager for Richardson Healthcare; Greg Peloquin, General Manager of our Power & Microwave Technologies Group, which includes Green Energy Solutions; and Jens Ruppert, General Manager of Canvys. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for playback. I would also like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. They are based on current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Therefore, our actual results could be materially different. Please refer to our press release and SEC filings for an explanation of our risk factors. Financial results for the second quarter of the fiscal year 2024 fell short of our expectations. Economic conditions, rising interest rates, higher inventory levels and a lagging economy in China negatively impacted customer demand for our products. As we operate over the near term with a more uncertain economic climate, we remain focused on pursuing our long-term growth strategies. These strategies position the business to take advantage of large, rapidly growing global opportunities. The expertise of our management team is a significant asset during this period, as we have successfully navigated difficult economic periods throughout our history. This is exactly why we maintain a strong balance sheet with access to additional sources of capital if necessary. We've also made the strategic decision to maintain stable levels of manufacturing employees and salespeople as many of the green energy solutions and semiconductor equipment customers expect demand to recover in calendar 2024. Therefore, maintaining continuity in our manufacturing team is important to ensure we can quickly adapt to increased orders and grow market share. Unfortunately, profitability was impacted in the second quarter as our gross margin reflects the under-absorption in our factory. Within our healthcare business, we made some changes to improve inventory and focus on strategic objectives which Wendy will tell you about shortly. Overall, the team continues to do an excellent job managing expenses, we're focused on driving efficiencies, [which] (ph) simultaneously position the company for future growth. While we acknowledge revenues will be lower in FY ‘24 than previously anticipated, we maintain our optimistic outlook and remain committed to our long-term strategy. We continue to expand our product roadmap for green energy solutions. We are adding new customers for wind, electric vehicles, and rail and the applications that take advantage of energy transition initiatives underway across many geographies. While we're in the early innings of this transformation, we have quickly developed a compelling roadmap of products, technologies, and are establishing Richardson Electronics as a leading provider of innovative engineered solutions for global green energy markets. Activity across all our business remains extremely strong, and specifically for the green energy’s business. Our pipeline of potential projects continues to increase. In addition to public and private energy transition initiatives that are underway, we believe that the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 will create further opportunities for the company. One recent example was a new order from a US-based technology company that's using our 100 kilowatt generators to power a pilot reactor to make crystalline diamond materials for high-tech applications. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, this customer is applying for a grant to build a multi-reactor factory which will require significant number of 100 kilowatt generators. We believe other wind and electric vehicle and rail customers will benefit from the Inflation Reduction Act, which we expect to support our higher sales forecast. As our GES business gets to scale in the coming quarters and years, much of our near-term new business is project-based and timing is not always easy to predict. I want to stress that we've not lost any opportunities and remain focused on capitalizing on market opportunities supported by the Inflation Reduction Act and other energy transition initiatives globally. We're also focused on adding suppliers that will fill our technology gaps. These relationships are critical to our business model as our partners often support new engineered solution opportunities for the company that drive higher and more profitable sales. Our balance sheet remains strong with nearly $23 million in cash and no debt. Inventory increased in the quarter in line with purchases of Talus products, which would support our profitable to business, as well as long lead time capacitors that are required to support our green energy growth initiatives. The balance of our inventory remained flat. And the transit inventory was down, indicating we are reducing inventory purchases in line with sales. With this introduction, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob Ben, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our second quarter financial performance in detail. Then, Greg, Wendy, and Jens will discuss our numerous opportunities within our business units, including the significant number of new products, programs, and customers that drive our optimism for future growth.\nRobert Ben: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I will review our financial results for our second quarter of fiscal year 2024, followed by a review of our cash position. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were down 33.0% to $44.1 million compared to net sales of $65.9 million in the prior year second quarter. PMT sales decreased by $9.3 million from last year's second quarter, driven primarily by a decline in manufactured products for semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment customers. Sales for GES declined $9.7 million from last year's second quarter, primarily due to lower sales of ultracapacitor modules for wind turbines as a result of the project-based nature of this product line. Canvys sales decreased by $2.8 million, primarily due to customer pushouts in North America. However, Canvys backlog increased, reflecting higher overall demand. Richardson healthcare sales were comparable to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as higher CT tube and parts demand offset lower system sales. Consolidated gross margin for the second quarter was 28.4% of net sales compared to 33.2% in last year's second quarter due primarily to product mix and under-absorption. Without under-absorption of the company's manufacturing facility, management estimates that the company's consolidated gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 would have been 31.3%. PMT's gross margin decreased to 28.5% from 34.5%, primarily due to product mix, and $0.9 million of manufacturing under absorption. GES gross margin decreased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to 29.2% from 33.9% in the prior year's second quarter due to product mix. Healthcare's gross margin decreased to 14.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 23.2% in the prior year second quarter as a result of a $0.3 million increase in manufacturing under absorption. Canvys gross margin increased in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 to 33.5% from 29.7% in the prior year second quarter because of product mix and lower freight costs. Operating expenses were $14.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to $14.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in operating expenses resulted from lower incentive expenses, partially offset by higher employee compensation expenses. The company reported an operating loss of $2.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 versus operating income of $7.2 million in the second quarter of last year. Other expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, including interest income and foreign exchange, was $0.3 million compared to other expense of $0.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Income tax benefit was $0.5 million or a 21.6% effective tax rate versus an income tax provision of $1.5 million or a 21.5% effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Net loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.8 million or $0.13 per diluted common share compared to net income of $5.5 million or $0.39 per diluted common share in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to a review of the results for the first six months of fiscal year 2024. Net sales for the first six months of fiscal year 2024 were $96.7 million, a decrease of 27.5% from $133.5 million in the first six months of fiscal year 2023, which reflected lower sales across our business segments. Gross margin decreased to 30.8% from 33.6%, primarily reflecting product mix and manufacturing under-absorption in PMT, as well as increased scrap expense and manufacturing under-absorption in healthcare, which was partially offset by a favorable product mix and lower freight costs for Canvys. Operating expenses were $30.3 million for the first six months of the fiscal year, which represented an increase of $1.4 million from the first six months of the last fiscal year. The increase was due to higher employee compensation expenses associated with the higher staffing levels in fiscal 2023 combined with severance costs relating primarily to healthcare's reduction in staff. Operating loss for the first six months of fiscal year 2024 was $0.5 million as compared to an operating income of $16.0 million for the first six months of fiscal year 2023. Other expense for the first six months of fiscal 2024, including interest income and foreign exchange, was $0.1 million, as compared to other expense of $0.5 million for the first six months of fiscal 2023. Income tax benefit was $0.1 million or an effective tax rate of 16.5% during the first six months of fiscal 2024 versus an income tax provision of $3.6 million or an effective tax rate of 23.4% in the prior year's first six months. The company reported a net loss of $0.6 million or $0.04 per diluted common share for the first six months of fiscal year 2024, versus net income of $11.9 million, or $0.83 per diluted common share for the first six months of fiscal year 2023. Moving to a review of our cash position. Cash and investments at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 were $22.8 million, compared to $24.1 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024. US cash and investments were $8.8 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024 versus $8.4 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Capital expenditures were $1.5 million in the second quarter versus $1.3 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Approximately $1.1 million related to investments in manufacturing, including facility expansion, and included final costs for the renovation of our office space. We paid $0.8 million in cash dividends in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. In addition, based on our current financial position, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share, which will be paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the company had not made any draws on its $30 million revolving line of credit with PNC Bank. Lastly, the company's Board of Directors created new ownership requirements for outside directors. This includes owning a minimum of $150,000 of our stock after a three-year period. Now, I will turn the call over to Greg, who will discuss the results for our PMT and GES business groups.\nGreg Peloquin: Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As expected, the fiscal 2024 second quarter was challenging for our Green Energy Solutions and Power & Microwave Technologies groups due to a fluid economic environment, the timing of some project-based orders, and a decline in sales in the semiconductor wafer fab market. For our GES business in particular, our second quarter results reflect the startup nature of any new business. As a reminder, we are in the infancy of our GES growth strategy, having started to pursue new GES opportunities only two years ago with new designs and customer requirements establishing manufacturing and test and also launching beta site testing, we expect sales to fluctuate as we get to scale and develop more predictable revenue streams. However, in a short amount of time, we have designed numerous new products, received several patents, and shipped over $77 million to an ever-growing list of key customers, with more than $35 million in backlog going into calendar year 2024. We expect significant bookings to be received in Q3 and Q4 of FY ‘24. So needless to say, we continue to be very excited about the next three years. Last year, GES benefited from several large projects, including electric locomotive development and major owner operators of GE wind turbines such as Nextera, Enel, and Invenergy. Given the project nature of our GES business, revenue from these products are not necessarily consistent quarter to quarter. In fact, many of our customers over the past three months completed calendar year 2024 budgets, including our product and will roll out purchases in the first half of calendar 2024. In weekly conversations with our major customers, they note it is only a matter of time until new orders are placed. Our customers repeatedly tell us we have maintained our market share for our core GES applications and have identified new product opportunities. And the decline in revenue we are experiencing is purely a timing issue. In fact, our customer pipeline and the number of opportunities continues to increase as we look to take advantage of significant energy transformation projects globally. Our GES and PMT backlogs remain strong at over $100 million. Given our inventory position, we believe we will ship many incoming orders from stock, which we expect will convert working capital into cash in the coming quarters. We are managing our GES business to support our customers' needs when they are ready. So with that introduction, let's look at the second quarter performance of GES and PMT groups in more detail. GES sales were $2.6 million in the quarter, down from $12.3 million in the prior year's record second quarter. The year-over-year decline in GES sales was due to timing on several major project-based opportunities. Last year, GES revenues included the first phase of rollouts to our wind turbine customers and prototype builds for our EV locomotive customers. During the quarter, we added several major new customers such as BP Energy, EDF Energy, and EDP Renewables. I am pleased to report that 90% of our ULTRA3000 sales in Q2 were with new wind customers. We continue to increase our market share with the customers needing our niche patented green energy products. We believe Phase 2 rollouts for our wind customers will begin in Q3 and Q4 of FY ’24 as many of these customers recently completed their 2024 budgeting process. The forecast they have provided point to growing orders, which we believe will drive stronger GE sales in our fiscal third and fourth quarters. We continue to beta site our patented pending ULTRAUPS 3000, which replaces lead-asset batteries in the UPS system at the base of the wind turbines. The ULTRAUPS 3000 will be used by Siemens and by other owner operators of GE wind turbines going forward. Tests are going well, and we have led to important improvements in the product. We're also testing the ULTRAPEM 3000 which supports other wind turbine platforms such as Suzlon, Senvion and Nordex. This is helping us expand our market outside of North America. One major program for the ULTRAPEM or multi-brand is beta testing with Suzlon in an OEM and replacement basis. This opportunity is for more than 7,000 turbines in India alone and several thousand more in North America. This product is also in final testing with several owner operators in Latin America and North America. We believe initial ULTRAPEM orders will begin in Q4 of FY ‘24. In EV locomotive segment, due to supply chain issues for piece parts from our suppliers, our superstructure builds for Long Island railroad and BNSF electric locomotives will be completed in late Q3 and Q4 of this fiscal year. We anticipate Phase 2 for our EV locomotive customers will be in the third and fourth quarters of calendar 2024. We also have beta orders for our patented ULTRAGEN 3000 starter module with two large diesel and electric [motive] (ph) manufacturers. It is important to note that these are exclusive with both manufacturers. We continue to identify other niche applications for the ULTRAGEN 3000. We are in beta testing with several refrigeration truck manufacturers where ULTRAGEN is replacing lead acid batteries. There are numerous other markets that can benefit from this solution, such as construction equipment, excavators, loaders, and backhoes. These are longer-term opportunities that we expect to add incremental growth in the future periods as we leverage our leadership position, utilizing ultra capacitors and other related technologies as power sources across various applications with many large companies throughout the world. In summary, we believe we will begin to see sequential revenue growth in Q3 and Q4 within our GES business, driven by new products, customers, and technology partners, all supported by the forecast and backlog from these project-based customers. I want to stress that we have not lost any market share. In fact, we continue to increase our market share with new products, applications, and customers and our recent performance is a result of timing issues and the emerging nature of our GES business. So turning to PMT, which includes EDG, our legacy tube business, and PMG, our Power & Microwave Components Group, sales decreased 22.9% to $31.3 million. This decline was mainly due to continued slowdown in our semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment business. The semiconductor wafer fabrication business has always been cyclical. We anticipated the slowdown in 2023, but maintain our expectations that the business will recover in the second half of calendar 2024. This frustration with the cyclical downturn of the wafer fabrication business was offset by strong double-digit bookings growth in our RF and wireless business, mainly supporting wireless infrastructure and communication customers. As mentioned, our engineered solution strategy is led by our global technology partners. We continue to add partners who fill technology gaps in our offering and support our growth. Often through these partnerships we identify opportunities for new products that we design and manufacture in-house. This increase the value we provide customers and allows us to capture more revenue while expanding and diversifying our customer base. These long-term supplier relationships are extremely strong. And when appropriate, we work with them on strategic long-term purchases to maintain appropriate levels of supply. We negotiate special payment terms and shipping schedules to help improve cash flow. In addition, having inventory at hand allows us to capture and maintain market share. We collaborate with both our customers and suppliers and leverage our customers' forecast to help us strategically invest in inventory, ensure we can meet our customers' needs. Our growing customer base and strong relationships with these customers and suppliers, using our version of a customer intimacy model, helps us develop new products and opportunities with our existing customer base. We also continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growth where needed. We're bringing on talented design and field engineers and making investment to enhance our manufacturing capabilities. Our growing in-house design and engineering manufacturing teams are doing a great job supporting increased demand for current products and new product designs. With this team, we will continue to identify, develop, and introduce new products and technologies for green energy and other power management and microwave applications. I cannot stress enough the value of Richardson Electronics model to our customers and suppliers. Our unparalleled capability and global golden market strategy are unique to the power and energy in RF, microwave and green energy markets. We developed a strong business model including legacy products and new technology partners that fit well with our engineered solutions capabilities. Through our steadfast and creative focus on customers, we will continue to excel by taking advantage of opportunities when they arise. The execution of our strategy has never been better. There's no question our customers and technology partners need Richardson's capabilities, products and support more than ever. And with that I'll turn it over to Wendy Diddell to discuss Richardson Healthcare.\nWendy Diddell: Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone. Second quarter sales for the healthcare division were $2.9 million, down less than 1% compared to the second quarter of last year and improved over our most recent first quarter. CT tubes and part sales were up versus the prior year's second quarter, while system sales were down due primarily to timing of cash receipts from customers in Latin America. In the quarter, we benefited from sales of our repaired Siemens Straton Z tubes. Healthcare's gross margin in the quarter was very low at 14.8% compared to 23.2% last year. The reason for the decline in margin was due to under-absorption associated with our decision to produce fewer ALTA tubes in the quarter as well as higher scrap costs. Throughout prior quarters, healthcare inventory has increased due in large part to our growing supply of ALTA tubes. These are the replacement tubes for [CAT] (ph) and CT scanners. We decided at the end of the quarter to reduce our staff and temporarily suspend ALTA tube production which will allow us to sell off inventory. We did retain critical resources who will focus on continual product design improvements and cost reduction opportunities, but reduced production may continue to drive our overall gross margin lower than anticipated. We did not lay off resources working on the repaired Siemens tube program. In fact, we are supporting the development team by reallocating some of the employees who were focusing on the ALTA tubes. We continue to make excellent progress with the Siemens program and with a more focused team, anticipate this to continue. The Siemens repair program includes four tube types, the Straton Z, MX, MXP, and MXP46. The repaired Straton Z is in full production and performing well in the field. Straton Z sales are just starting to ramp up as we have a steadier flow of production. The first repaired MX series tubes are in test and provided our beta testing goes well, we anticipate introducing these to the market later in the third quarter. As we mentioned last period, sales of the MX series will be limited due to supply until FY ‘25. In the quarter, we also received our GMP certification in Brazil. GMP stands for Good Manufacturing Practices. These are the standards set by the National Agency of Health Surveillance, or Anvisa, in Brazil. This paves the way for us to export our tubes to a specific customer in Brazil who will reload and sell our ALTA tubes in-country. We anticipate the first shipments to this customer will be made in the quarter with limited sales in the fiscal year. Rest assured, we continue to monitor healthcare's financial performance with the goal of achieving a break-even point in the fourth quarter. This will be more of a challenge with lower production going through the plant, but we are doing the right things to balance our investments with opportunities in the business. I will now turn the call over to Jens Ruppert to discuss the results for Canvys.\nJens Ruppert: Thanks, Wendy, and good morning everyone. Canvys engineers, manufactures, and sells custom displays to original equipment manufacturers in the industrial medical markets throughout the world. Canvys’ sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 reflects certain customer pushouts primarily in North America. As a result, sales were $7.3 million for the second quarter compared to $10.1 million for the second quarter last year. On the positive side, we finished the quarter with a very strong backlog of $48.2 million which increased by $5.6 million from the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales improved to 33.5% during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 29.7% during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in cross-margin was primarily related to a more favorable product mix and lower freight costs. During the quarter, we received several new orders from both existing and first-time medical OEM customers. Some of these applications include medical device controls within the operating room, surgical navigation, laser ablation, radiotherapy, laboratory equipment, super pulsed laser systems, robotic-assisted surgery, and microscopy. In the non-medical space, our products are used in a variety of commercial and industrial applications. This includes displays used in the public transportation space, human-machine interface applications, and teleprompting, talent monitors, and clocks used in the broadcast market. Over the past couple of months, we have seen more caution in some of our customers' ordering behaviors. With a rapid rise in interest rates, continued global weakness, and expanding geopolitical uncertainty, our OEM customers have seen a slowdown in ordering, particularly in industrial and more recently, some medical applications. Given the strong growth drivers in the various imaging markets and our customers' levels of excitement towards next generation products, we see these current dynamics as temporary. Design cycles at Canvys are long, potentially causing sales to vary quarter by quarter. However, we remain focused on adding new customers and programs globally as we leverage and promote our best-in-class design, engineering, and service capabilities. Despite a more cautious macro outlook over the near term, we believe sales will reaccelerate towards the end of the fiscal year, supported by our growing backlog and the number of projects currently in the engineering stage. From the variety of customers and applications as well as the value of orders from existing and new customers, it is clear we offer our global customers outstanding products and localized service. While our sales organization stays focused on new opportunities, I stay focused on improving the operating performance of the division, maximizing cash flow, managing inventory, and improving Canvys’ profitability is an ongoing priority as we continue to work closely with our partners to meet the demand of our customers. I will now turn the call back over to Ed.\nEdward Richardson: Thanks, Jens. We appreciate your team's efforts to manage customer [push-outs] (ph) without sacrificing our long-term partnerships. As you heard from Greg, Wendy, and Jens, there's much to be excited about in Richardson Electronics. We remain committed to our long-term strategy, and we'll continue investing in our growth initiatives with an emphasis on engineered solutions that improve sustainability. We'll protect our cash and focus on improving profitability and inventory turns in the coming quarters. We're also committed to our shareholders and are pleased to announce we've implemented a program requiring our outside directors to purchase shares and maintain ownership of our stock. At this time, we'll be happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Anja Soderstrom from Sidoti. Your line is now open.\nAnja Soderstrom: Hi, and thank you for…\nWendy Diddell: Good morning, Anja.\nAnja Soderstrom: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So for the ULTRAPEM that you are working with the Indian wind turbine, Suzlon Energy, those are in beta testing, but are you seeing -- do you see any risk to those orders being pushed out as well or?\nGreg Peloquin: Specific to the multi-brand, which is three different platforms of wind turbine manufacturers, we're focused on Suzlon and Senvion and Nordex. No, right now the beta testing is going great. The opportunity, we're exclusive. The numbers they have given us for pricing and rollout are still strong. And so far we do have received orders in North America for people servicing Suzlon wind turbines. And we're actually going to India in a few weeks to finish up the installation of the beta testing. And again, that's a working unit, so we're very excited about that opportunity. I believe I gave the numbers in my opening. So could things be delayed a quarter or two? Yes. That's just the nature of this rollout. I mean, it's an infrastructure rollout. Historically I've had a lot of experience, in a Marketing Director role at Motorola, we rolled out our technology into the [base station] (ph) arena. This wind turbine market is very similar, where when economic issues are applied in a certain area of the world or globally, for example, one of the things we're seeing in Q1 and Q2 where they had budgeted and forecasted to roll out five different sites, they only did two. But that doesn't change the opportunity or the end result of what will be shipping into that customer. It's just a timing thing based on budgets, economic conditions, et cetera. So the reduction would be lowering the number of sites, but the total opportunity, no, we don't see that being limited.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay, thank you. And in terms of the semiconductor, how is the conversation there going with Lam Research and are you still confident in that starting to pick up in the third quarter?\nEdward Richardson: Well, we listen to their vendor calls on a monthly basis and they're telling us that they will even subsidize their vendors to maintain their capability because they think by the end of 2024 that the business will be stronger than it's ever been. So that remains to be seen. Our business is down from about $40 million to $20 million this year. But we're -- it's sort of like a roller coaster. It goes up and down. When it went from 3G to 4G, it went from $22 million to $7 million and 4G to [$5 million] (ph) and went to $40 million. So we're anticipating, according to Lam, that it'll be higher than ever by the end of 2024.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay, thank you. I’ve got a quick -- okay, yeah.\nWendy Diddell: Anja, just to add to that, we do anticipate in Q3, Q4 -- we're not anticipating a lot of growth in the Lam business in Q3 and Q4. It will be starting after that, as Ed mentioned, in Q1 and Q2 of the calendar year.\nEdward Richardson: They're burning off inventory.\nWendy Diddell: Oh, yeah. Excuse me. Q3 and Q4 of calendar year 2024. Our Q1 and Q2 of fiscal year 2025. Sorry for the confusion.\nAnja Soderstrom: Yeah. Okay. And just a quick one, other one for you. Wendy, you mentioned you still think you can reach break-even for the healthcare unit in the fourth quarter. What do you need in terms of revenue to break even at this point?\nWendy Diddell: Well, we need to sell. We need to sell a lot more CT tubes, both Siemens and the repaired Siemens tube and the ALTA 750. In terms of top line, we probably need to be in about $1 million or so more than where we were in Q2 in order to hit that Q4 breakeven point, maybe a little bit higher than that. Depends on how our margins fare. As we mentioned, we've had under-absorption in the factory, which has hurt our gross margin. We did take the actions in Q2 to reduce our costs there and reallocate those people -- some of the people, to making more of the Siemen tubes. So we should be in good shape, but we'll have to see how the margin holds up.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay, thank you. I'll get back in queue.\nWendy Diddell: Thanks, Anja.\nEdward Richardson: Thanks, Anja.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from DeForest Hinman from Bumbershoot Holdings. Your line is now open.\nDeForest Hinman: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Can you just give us some more color on the opportunity within the GES business? I mean just from a context perspective, really good performance in 2023. It seemed like a lot of excitement a couple quarters ago. It still sounds like there's a lot of business opportunities there, but the revenue performance has just really been all over the place. I think, I don't know if it was six months ago, we were talking about growth in GES could offset a lot of the softness within the semi-space. That really hasn't occurred. So can you just reframe what is the revenue opportunity there, maybe within the next six months, within the next 12 months, and then what could this business look like in 2025, your fiscal 2025, if things start improving? Thank you.\nGreg Peloquin: Yeah, thank you. Great question. So what we saw in 2023 is the rollout of new products. Aptly new design, tested, manufactured. The cycle time that we brought those products to market because the customer was in such a need for it based on the cost and failures of the lead acid batteries, the team did an amazing job. And I've been in the new product introduction process my entire career and getting that done within months versus, for example, I mentioned the Motorola part, it took us 3.5 years to introduce LDMOS, which took over the infrastructure market. So that first rollout, we got budgets and forecasts from the top four owner-operators of GE wind turbines in North America, which the ULTRA3000 was designed for. And that was NextEra, Invenergy, RWE, and Enel. They gave us their forecast and kind of the opposite of this year, they actually ordered almost 50% more than they budgeted. However, the team did an amazing job. You had all those supply chain issues, et cetera., and we were able to meet all the requirements, but we didn't have a part in stock until March of last year. And so what we saw this year is a little bit the opposite. The opportunities are still -- the numbers are still there. However, instead of doing, as I mentioned before, 10 sites, they've done five. But in the meantime, specific to the wind turbine business, we've done beta site testing at other key owner operators, and to this day, as of today, we have over 12 customers in North America, owner operators, people like -- I mentioned, I believe, in a press release in December, BP Energy, EDP, Longroad Energy Partners, Pattern, EDF. If you add up the turbines that this program represents within their company, it's over 12,498 turbines. Now, how will that rollout go? It'll go over three years. Again, we're going to see huge sum here, and due to other issues, we're going to see less. But add onto that, we continue to look outside of North America, and as I mentioned before, the Suzlon opportunity in India. Also, in the meantime, we were able to become the exclusive supplier to GE marketplace for the ULTRA3000 and as new products come out, we'll be adding more and more products to that marketplace application. So you can kind of see why we're excited about just the ULTRA3000 in wind turbine business. In the meantime, not waiting for the market to come back or for orders to increase, the team, as I mentioned before, has designed other products, both to go into green energy applications and specifically because of these strong relationships with the wind turbine owner operators, the ULTRAUPS. Now there's a one ULTRAUPS in every single turbine that I just mentioned. And that's in beta site testing. It's going very, very well. But the MPI process, there's a lot of, hey, we need to change this. There's changes with the spec, customer needs change, but we have a very good team here that works directly with the customer on a scheduled weekly call, and of course, there's calls every day on specific items. So that's kind of the -- wind turbine business for the ULTRA3000 and ULTRAUPS. On the electric locomotive side, that's another program where the customer came with needs needed to be expedited. We needed to design, manufacture, test, and build battery modules and also superstructures. And the team, again, with partnership in this case with Progress Rail, did an amazing job meeting and exceeding all the requirements. And we have now shipped all of our products that go into that electric locomotive that we finished that in the fourth quarter of last year. So now they're taking our products and of course there are other suppliers for other products, they're building the finished unit and according to them they're shipping that to their end customer in our fiscal year Q4 and the beginning of FY ‘25, Q1 and Q2. So we expect orders for that, production quantities sometime in the second half of calendar year 2024. And just remember, these are prototype builds and just last year for those prototype builds, we shipped over $24 million worth of products for the prototype build. So again, math after that per train, the numbers that they're talking about as the electric locomotives gets accepted, like electric vehicles get accepted by the customer base, needless to say, we've never been more excited. Just doing math, I've said this before, I don't know what numbers you could come up with, but easily $100 million opportunity. It's just math after that. And we continue to add new products and new customers going forward. So within that, we also have the ULTRAGEN3000, which is the third and fourth product we have. That product is designed, and because of our relationships with the electric locomotive market, we've designed and we have orders for over 25 trains today or starter modules for two of the top owner-op manufacturers of electric diesel and electric locomotives. So that business to us is obviously very exciting and everything I just talked about, we are exclusive with them. There's not a competitor, there's not a second source. So as these relationships grow, new products grow, we'll continue to add to that pipeline. But the pipeline as it stands today is a timing issue as they roll out -- I'm going to use the word infrastructure because that's what the wind turbine business is. It's energy infrastructure like infrastructure for base stations, which I'm comparing it to, makes us very, very excited on the green energy front.\nDeForest Hinman: Okay. I mean -- that's helpful. I mean, obviously, the market's not sharing your enthusiasm. The stock's trading around probably book value at this point with no debt. So it's a two-part question. Should we, as shareholders, expect the management team to be buying stock and then should the Board be thinking about buying stock themselves and issuing a share repurchase authorization? Thank you.\nGreg Peloquin: I want to touch on the excitement part of it. I thought the market and the shareholders got very excited last year on the enthusiasm as what I'm going to call Phase 1 rollout of our green energy solutions strategy. My opinion, I think they should be just as excited about Phase 2, which as I mentioned today, is coming. It's coming. The suppliers, the customers have confirmed that. It's project-based, but I would be just as excited about the next steps as we roll out this new product line, new products, new SVU going forward. I'll let Ed talk about that.\nEdward Richardson: We just instituted a program with our Board that they're required to buy $150,000 worth of stock as part of their participation on the Board and that's just been implemented. You'll see that going in place. We have about $22 million or $24 million in cash. The difficulty is we have 24 foreign subsidiaries and only about $8 million of that cash is in the US. So, the answer to our buying stock back is that we won't be doing that in the near future.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from P. Ross Taylor from ARS Investment Partners. Your line is now open.\nP. Ross Taylor: Thank you.\nWendy Diddell: Good morning, Ross.\nP. Ross Taylor: Good morning. Congratulations on the move with the Board and getting the Board to be invested along with shareholders and management because I think that's a very important step. I've rarely seen small companies succeed when the Board doesn't have a stock, when the Board doesn't have an interest along with other investors. Second or really the first question is, you commented saying that Lam is telling you that you should be ready for, my words, fiscal 20 -- or calendar 2025 being the biggest year you've seen from them. Is that correct?\nEdward Richardson: Yes, that's correct.\nP. Ross Taylor: And the biggest year you've had in that space was what, two years ago at $40 million or so in revenues?\nEdward Richardson: That's right.\nWendy Diddell: Last fiscal year, Ross, [indiscernible].\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. So what you're really looking at is a situation where we would expect that pretty quickly, once they get this turn going, you're going to see a pretty significant ramp up, pushing those effectively like a 100% plus growth in revenues over what they're currently running at?\nEdward Richardson: That's correct. Yes.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay, and that's -- probably carries a better than company average multiple when you get up to that level or operating margin when you…\nEdward Richardson: One those products, we make RF matches and proprietary products where the margin is better than our normal margins.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. And so that alone we're talking about $20-plus-million in revenues being added at, say, mid-30s plus operating margin. That itself is going to be a huge driver forward.\nEdward Richardson: Absolutely.\nP. Ross Taylor: Second is, you've talked about the ability to convert inventories and the like into cash. Do you have an idea of the thought process on how -- what kind of cash generation you can get or creation you can get from drawing down your own inventories?\nEdward Richardson: Well, what do we have? About 14,000 of the electric capacitor modules already built for wind turbines. What's the total number that we have already built?\nGreg Peloquin: Yeah, 14,000 built and about that much on backlog with customers.\nEdward Richardson: All right. So it's a matter of not if it's when, it's all timing when they're going to release. And normally these wind turbines, they do their maintenance in the spring of the year and as Greg mentioned, right now they're all going through a budgeting process. So we have these orders, but they haven't released them. So it's a matter of timing.\nP. Ross Taylor: But what we should see is the ability to convert several million dollars of inventory into cash as they convert to…\nEdward Richardson: Multi-million dollars.\nP. Ross Taylor: Multi-million?\nEdward Richardson: Yes.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. Since it's not several, I'll take multi as being a larger number than several.\nEdward Richardson: That's correct. Okay. In a normal year, we do over $10 million a year with wind turbines alone.\nP. Ross Taylor: It seems to me that listening to you guys talk, reading your release, that this quarter was a combination of unfortunate, uncorrelated, correlated events. They all hit in the same quarter. But at the same time, that this should be the nadir for what we see going on. And so we really moving beyond this quarter as you move to the second half of your year, we should start to see some incremental and then -- what's the idea where they always say about going broke slowly first and then rapidly, that we should see incremental and then rapid growth in top line earnings, free cash flow generation at all. I mean, listening to this was actually the most bullish call you've had and it's kind of ironic that it's occurring with the stock down 20% on the day and trading under $10 a share.\nEdward Richardson: No, we fully understand. I have a saying, you can't fall off the floor. So with all of these things we have going, we think that the company, 50% of our business will be green energy going forward. And we think within five years, it will be $500 million and extremely cash flow positive.\nP. Ross Taylor: And that -- really that -- this is, as you said, that you can't fall off the floor. This is a point from which you don't think you can fall from.\nEdward Richardson: No, we're absolutely amazed that it's -- it's just like you falling off a cliff that the business went to this level. But it did and that's where we are, but we have the backlog, we have the inventory, so it's a matter of timing, not if but when.\nP. Ross Taylor: And can you give a little bit of background on the opportunity in hydrogen? Market size or…\nEdward Richardson: Yeah. We are just starting to work in that area. So they are buying 100 kilowatt generators that we make and they're converting methane gas into hydrogen and acetylene. And actually at this point, the acetylene has more value than the hydrogen. But a lot of companies, including Caterpillar, are talking about having their equipment run on hydrogen in the future. And one of the most profitable ways to generate that hydrogen is using 100 kilowatt microwave generators that we manufacture. They use a tube that's about $10,000 and the generator is like $100,000. So that could be a profitable business for us in the future.\nP. Ross Taylor: And how many tubes do you need?\nEdward Richardson: There's one tube in each generator. We have one customer that we mentioned that's making this crystalline or synthetic diamonds for industrial applications and they are talking about buying 200 generators over the next two years.\nP. Ross Taylor: Over the next two years?\nEdward Richardson: Several years.\nP. Ross Taylor: Several years.\nEdward Richardson: Yeah.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. And then, so we look at this and I guess part of what that business model is you end up -- you sell the acetylene and if you sell the acetylene, then actually it reduces or eliminates the cost of making the hydrogen and then you have the hydrogen as a benefit beyond it.\nEdward Richardson: Yeah, that's correct.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay, well as I said, I think it's fascinating. This isn't the most bullish call I've heard you guys have and, don't get discouraged by the fact that investors look at -- basically drive by looking at the hood of the car.\nEdward Richardson: Well, we've only been around for 76 years. And in my history, the stock has been $375.29. So we'll get there. It's Just a matter of when.\nP. Ross Taylor: Let's get back to new highs.\nEdward Richardson: Okay. Thank you.\nWendy Diddell: Thanks, Ron.\nP. Ross Taylor: Congratulations.\nEdward Richardson: Thanks.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment, please. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from [Ronald Richards] (ph). Your line is now open.\nEdward Richardson: Good morning, Ronald.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. I got a question. Good morning. I saw you got those orders coming in India and I was wondering about GE's penetration in other foreign markets, what kind of progress you're making.\nGreg Peloquin: Yeah, the biggest opportunity is the Suzlon multi-brand specific to Suzlon in India, but that also is going to be tested at their facility to make it an OEM product, meaning it will be designed and it won't be replacing lead acid batteries in their wind turbines. It'll actually be the PEM system within their turbines. That is by far the biggest opportunity. We have numerous opportunities, not nearly as large, with Enel in Italy, with Nordex in Germany. So, it's getting -- because of these relationships and the new products, getting the North American GE market, not 100% exclusive, but grabbing all the market share we can now, and we continue to train our global sales force on these products because again, they're brand new to them too. So we are seeing opportunity, but the biggest probably in the next 12 months is going to be Senvion globally. Because once we go into production for India, that'll transcend to all their turbines and owner operators throughout the world. Suzlon, I'm sorry.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay.\nGreg Peloquin: They sound so much alike.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you.\nGreg Peloquin: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay, thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ed Richardson, CEO, for closing remarks.\nEdward Richardson: Thanks, Justin. Well, we want to wish you all a very happy and prosperous new year and we appreciate your investment, interest in Richardson Electronics. We assure you that it's only up from here and not a matter of if but when and we look forward to discussing our fiscal year 2024 third quarter with you in April. And we're available to take your calls at any time, so don't hesitate to call us. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

At this time all participants are on a listen only mode. After the speaker's presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Edward Richardson, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nEdward Richardson: Good morning, and welcome to Richardson Electronics conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. Joining me today are Robert Ben, Chief Financial Officer; Wendy Diddell, Chief Operating Officer, and General Manager for Richardson Healthcare; Greg Peloquin, General Manager of our Power & Microwave Technologies Group and our newest business unit, Green Energy Solutions; and Jens Ruppert, General Manager of Canvys. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for playback. I would also like to remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements. They're based on current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Therefore, our actual results could be materially different. Please refer to our press release and SEC filings for an explanation of our risk factors. Financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 were below our expectations due to concerns regarding economic conditions, rising interest rates, a lagging China economy, and the possibility of a recession across our global customer base. It was especially challenging period, given the downturn in the semiconductor wafer fab market and the timing of new orders in our Green Energy Solutions business. While sales were lower than anticipated, our gross margin improved from Q4 of fiscal 2023, and the team did an excellent job managing costs. Our core EDG and display businesses were in line with the prior year, and the company remained profitable in the quarter. Despite near term challenges, we've never been more optimistic about our future. We expect the future downturn in the market demand to improve in the coming quarters, and we remain committed to our long-term strategy. Our strategy growth plan is focused on expanding our product lines, leveraging the deep relationships we have with over 20,000 customer globally. We do this by listening to our customers and helping them solve problems. We’re clearly building a name for ourselves as the technology leader in Green Energy Solutions. In addition, we continue to hear from key customers and technology partners in the semi fab equipment market that they're at the bottom of the semi cycle. These companies anticipate growth in calendar year 2024 that exceeds sales levels during the 2022 cycle. We're taking steps in the interim to address the slowdown without impacting growth in these critical areas. We remain focused on increasing the percentage of our sales that come from our Green Energy Solutions business, as well as other products we manufacture. Much of this new business is project based and timing is not always easy to predict. The success of these strategies, however, supported by our sales growth, improved efficiency and higher profitability over the past several years. Our balance sheet remains strong with $25 million in cash and no debt. Throughout the company, everyone is focused on turning our inventory into cash, managing expenses, and driving toward annual positive operating cash flow next fiscal year. Bob Ben, our Chief Financial Officer, will review our first quarter financial performance. Then Greg, Wendy, and Jens will discuss numerous opportunities within our business units, including the significant number of new products, programs, and customers that drive our optimism for the future.\nRobert Ben: Thank you, Ed, and good morning. I will review our financial results for our first quarter of fiscal year 2024, followed by a review of our cash position. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were down 22.2% to $52.6 million, compared to net sales of $67.6 million in the prior year's first quarter. PMT sales decreased by $9.6 million or 21.2% from last year's first quarter, driven primarily by a decline in manufactured products for our semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment customers. Net sales for GES were down by $4.1 million or 48.4% from last year's first quarter, primarily due to lower sales of ultracapacitor modules for wind turbines. It is important to note that the replacement of lead acid batteries in existing wind turbines is often project-based and the timing of orders is difficult to predict. Canvys sales decreased by $0.5 million, or 5.0%, primarily due to lower customer demand in North America. Richardson Healthcare sales decreased by $0.7 million, or 22.1%, primarily due to lower demand in the quarter for parts and equipment. Total company backlog was $148.1 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 versus $160.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross margin for the first quarter was 32.8% of net sales compared to 34.1% in last year's first quarter. PMT's gross margin decreased to 32.2% from 34.3%, primarily due to product mix and manufacturing under absorption. Healthcare's gross margin decreased to 31.6% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 36.7% in the prior year's first quarter as a result of increased scrap expense and manufacturing under absorption. GES gross margin increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to 36.0% from 35.5% in the prior year's first quarter due to product mix. Canvys gross margin increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to 34.0% from 31.4% in the prior year's first quarter because of product mix and lower freight costs. Operating expenses were $15.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $14.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in operating expenses resulted from higher employee compensation expenses, primarily salaries. The company reported operating income of $1.5 million or 2.8% of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 versus operating income of $8.8 million or 13.0% of net sales in the first quarter of last year. Other income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, including interest income and foreign exchange, was $0.1 million compared to other expense of $0.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Income tax provision was $0.4 million, or 23.7% effective tax rate versus an income tax provision of $2.1 million, or 25.0% effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.2 million compared to net income of $6.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Earnings per common share diluted were $0.09 compared to earnings per common share diluted of $0.45 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Moving to a review of our cash position. Cash and investments at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $24.1 million compared to $25.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. U.S. cash and investments were $8.4 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024 versus $7.6 million at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Capital expenditures were $1.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 versus $1.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Approximately $0.9 million related to investments in manufacturing, including facility expansion and the renovation of our office space. We paid $0.8 million in cash dividends in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. In addition, based on our current financial position, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.06 per common share, which will be paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As of the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the company had not made any draws on its $30 million revolving line of credit with PNC Bank. Now, I will turn the call over to Greg who will discuss the results for our PMT and GES business groups.\nGreg Peloquin: Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. In Q1 FY 2024, Power and Microwave Technologies, or PMT, and Green Energy Solutions, or GES, continued to gain market share by developing new products and new customer relationships, while maintaining our market share with our existing customers. However, we did see a slowdown in revenue coming out of a record year in FY 2023, which was mainly due to the semiconductor wafer fab industry slowdown and timing of a number of very large project-based GES opportunities. PMT sales were down year-over-year by 21%, primarily based on the semiconductor industry slowdown, which started late in calendar year 2022. Again, it is very important to note that we have not lost any market share in this business segment. And through excellent customer relationships and communication, we are hearing that sales will reaccelerate in the back half of calendar year 2024. And that 2025 is anticipated to show record demand and sales. We are well positioned to manage this business as the customer demand increases. GES sales were $4.4 million in the quarter, down $4.1 million from the prior year due to timing on several major project-based opportunities. During the quarter, we added several new customers and increased our market share with customers needing our niche patented Green Energy products. We have many highlights in Q1 for our GES Group, beginning with the wind and energy market. During the quarter we added over $1 million in bookings with several new customers for our flagship ULTRA3000 product, increasing our backlog in this product line to over 12,000 units. All of our existing wind customers are significantly expanding their budgets for lead acid battery replacement within their GE turbines over the next couple of years. Their market potential for the ULTRA3000 remains at more than $150 million. The product is reliable and we are enjoying great success and continued relationships with our Tier 1 owner-operators. GE Marketplace, which targets more than 800 wind farm management companies, has also started to produce orders as we work directly with GE farm owner-operators, site managers, and technicians. With over 41,000 units in the field, three patents, and exclusive relationships with the largest owner-operators in North America, we continue to be very excited about this product, technology, and opportunities. Our beta testing of our patent pending Ultra UPS 3000 with Siemens and other owner-operators of GE and Siemens Wind Turbines is underway and going well. The Ultra UPS 3000 replaces lead acid batteries in the uninterrupted power supply, or UPS, that sits at the base of every wind turbine. We're moving forward to testing on other wind turbine platforms, such as Senvion, Suzlon, and Nordex. Once we begin production, we anticipate expanding to other markets and applications as this product works anywhere a UPS is used. Our ULTRAPEM or multi-brand pitch energy module is in beta testing with Suzlon on an OEM basis. This opportunity is for more than 7,000 turbines in India alone and several thousand more in North America. This product is also in final testing with a number of owner-operators in Latin America and North America, which have an SSB pitch system. In the EV and diesel locomotive segment of Green Energy Solutions, due to supply chain issues our superstructure builds for Long Island railroad and Burlington Northern electric locomotives will be completed in late Q3 and Q4 of this fiscal year. We have received beta orders for a patented ULTRAGEN3000 starter module with two large diesel and EV locomotive manufacturers. We'll be doing the beta testing in 25 trains in Q3 FY 2024. It is important to note that we are exclusive with both of these customers. We continue to identify other niche applications in this patented technology. We are in beta testing with several refrigeration truck manufacturers where the ULTRAGEN is replacing lead acid batteries. There are currently 500,000 refrigeration trucks in North America and we estimate this market opportunity to have a TAM of $200 million. There are numerous other markets that this product will be applicable to, such as construction equipment, including excavators, loaders, and backhoes. After a record Q4 and record FY 2023, shipments slowed in Q1 and we expect this trend to continue in Q2. With bookings and new products along with the forecast and backlog from our project-based customers, we feel that Q3 and Q4 will be extremely strong for Green Energy Solutions. We have not lost any market share, and we continue to increase our market share with new products, applications, and customers. Now turning to PMT, which includes EDG, our legacy tube business, and PMG, our Power & Microwave Components Group. Sales decreased 21%. Sales were $35.7 million versus $45.3 million in Q1 last fiscal year. This decline was due to the major slowdown in the semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment business. The decline was somewhat offset by growth in our laser and broadcast tube business which remains steady. We also saw strong bookings in our RF business. The team has been supporting the semiconductor wafer fabrication business and its customers for well over 25 years. This business has always been cyclical. We anticipated the slowdown in 2023, but again, expect the business to recover in the second half of calendar 2024. Our engineered solution strategy is driven by our global technology partners, such as [Qorvo] (ph), Maycom, Anokiwave, Ellis Materials, Amo Greentech, [Novidis] (ph), and Fuji Electric. Key tube manufacturers and partners include CPI, Talus, Nisshinbo Micro Devices, and Photonis. Each of our global partners helps us meet and manage customer requirements. Our team has done an excellent job identifying and cultivating these relationships. We will continue to add technology partners who fill technology gaps in our offering and support our growth. Often, through these partners, we identify opportunities for new products, and we design and manufacture in-house, increasing the value we provide customers and allowing us to capture more revenue and increase our customer base. These long-term relationships are extremely strong and we work with them on strategic long-term purchases to keep our customer sources of supply continually in motion. We negotiate special payment terms and shipping schedules to help improve cash flow. In addition, having inventory on hand allows us to capture and maintain market share. We also continue to invest on infrastructure to support our growth. We are bringing on talented design and field engineers and making investments to enhance our manufacturing capabilities. Our growing in-house design engineering and manufacturing teams are doing a great job supporting the increased demand for current products and new product designs. I am pleased with the progress. And with this team, we will continue to identify, develop, and introduce new products and technologies for Green Energy and other power management and microwave applications. Our growth strategy has been proven to be highly successful over the years. We will continue to develop new products as well as increase our customer base revenue and profits by capitalizing on existing demand creation infrastructure. Our belief in the future based on our customer forecast requires us to strategically invest in inventory that positions us to fill the pipeline, and ensure we can meet our customers' needs through close collaboration with both our customers and the suppliers themselves. I cannot stress enough the value of Richardson Electronics model to our customers and suppliers. Our unparalleled capability and global go-to-market strategy are unique to the power and energy RF and microwave and green markets. We have developed a strong business model including legacy products and new technology partners that fit well with our engineered solutions capabilities. Through our steadfast and creative focus on customers, we will continue to excel by taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. The execution of our strategy has never been better. There's no question our customers and technology partners need Richardson's products and support more than ever. We remain excited about the future as we find opportunities and build our market share for PMT and GES with new products and customers. Our team will continue to work closely with our customers throughout the beta testing phase for these exciting patented products. And with that, I'll turn it over to Wendy Diddell to discuss Richardson Healthcare.\nWendy Diddell: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. First quarter sales for the Healthcare division were $2.6 million, down 22.1% versus the first quarter of last year. Sales were down in all product categories, reflecting lower demand for parts and services throughout the most recent summer months. In the quarter, we sold all of our repaired Siemens Stratton Z tubes, helping improve our gross margin to 31.6%. While this was lower than the prior year's first quarter, this is a significant improvement from the fourth quarter margin of 23.7%. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin was negatively impacted by higher scrap costs in the quarter. We continue to make good progress on the Siemens repaired tube program. This is a series of four tube types, including the Stratton Z, MX, MXP, and MXP-46. The Siemens CT install base is considerably larger than the install base for our ALTA tubes and there are no third-party replacement options for these tube types. The repaired Stratton Z is in full production and performing well in the field. We expect sales to rise gradually in the coming quarters as we expand our production team in the repair process and add more tubes to inventory on a consistent basis. We also continue to make good progress on the repaired Siemens MX series. We know demand is strong based on discussions with our customers. While we anticipate launching the first repaired MX series tube around the end of the calendar year, supply will be limited due to recent challenges we are experiencing replacing a critical component. It is important that we get it right and we believe we are on track to do so. This will delay having sufficient inventory to meet customer demand until FY 2025. While our engineers work on the Siemens repaired tube program, we continue to work our way through the local registration process for reloading tubes in Brazil. We still anticipate this program may have a small, yet positive, impact on our revenue in FY 2024. We remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing development efforts within the healthcare business will enable the division to achieve its goal of breaking even in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. I will now turn the call over to Jens Ruppert to discuss the results for Canvys.\nJens Ruppert: Thanks Wendy. And good morning, everyone. Canvys engineers, manufacturers and sells custom displays to original equipment manufacturers and industrial and medical markets throughout the world. Canvys’ performance remains strong with sales of $9.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, down slightly from $10.4 million during the first quarter last year, and up from $9.2 million in the fourth quarter. First quarter sales reflected stable custom demand globally, and we finished the quarter with a backlog of $42.6 million, which remains strong. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 34.0% during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to 31.4% during the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily related to a more favorable product mix. During the quarter, we received several new orders from both existing and first-time medical OEM customers. Some of these applications include: ophthalmology, laboratory equipment, video documentation systems, robotic assisted surgery, and surgical navigation. In the non-medical space, our products are used in a variety of commercial and industrial applications. This includes large-size industrial printers, displays used in the public transportation space, human machine interfaces for packaging machines, and industrial automation, tailor prompting, talent monitors, and clocks used in the broadcast market. Over the near term, we expect increasing interest rates and continued high inventory levels will have a short-term impact on our business. Customers are forecasting more conservatively and only placing orders when the inventory is at a minimum level. We haven't lost the program, but we expect sales to vary quarter-to-quarter depending on our customers' inventory levels. Given the number of projects currently in the engineering stage, we believe sales will re-accelerate towards the end of this fiscal year. We are proud of the efforts and innovations of our talented engineering team and the ability to design products that help create productivity and value for our customers. During the quarter, we further advance our high-end 4K display offering by adding a special film to the LCDs to ensure a super low refraction. The monitors have been evaluated by large medical companies with very positive feedback. From the variety of customers and applications, as well as the value of orders from existing and new customers, it is clear we offer our global customers outstanding products and localized service. While our sales organizations is focus on new opportunities, I stay focused on improving the operating performance of the division. Maximizing cashflow and improving Canvys’ probability is an ongoing priority as we continue to work closely with our partners to meet the demands of our customers. I will now turn the call back over to Ed.\nEdward Richardson: Thanks, Jens. We understand the near-term challenges you face, but we remain confident that Canvys will continue to grow, given its stronger relationships and recognition as a leading custom display solutions provider. To conclude, we're excited about the direction we're headed. We remain committed to our employees, our customers, our suppliers, and our shareholders. We're investing in our growth initiatives with an emphasis on engineered solutions that improve sustainability. We're a GES business just getting started. The products we manufacture are used in aftermarket applications, and we have solutions that improve operating efficiencies and help companies achieve their green energy goals. Much of our legacy business, including EDG, is reoccurring revenue for consumable products. Within the launch of the Siemens repaired tube program, we anticipate improvement in our healthcare business, helping strengthen our bottom line. We'll protect our cash and focus on improving inventory turns. Finally, we're confident that we'll emerge from the challenging period stronger and better positioned to grow in sales and profitability later in the year. We continue to believe it's not a matter of if, but when. At this time, we'll be happy to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question, please. And our first question comes from Anja Soderstrom from Sidoti. Your line is now open.\nAnja Soderstrom: Hi, and thank you for taking my questions. So first, I'm curious for the [GES] (ph) that came in quite softer than I had anticipated. Can you just talk about the timing there? Was it something that was just shifted into the second quarter or is it just these larger projects that you are seeing longer sales cycles of or how should we think about the second quarter for GES?\nEdward Richardson: Yes, it was a combination of two things. First of all, the Phase I orders that people in terms of setting their capital budgets, how many farms and how many turbines they were going to start to implement taking out the lead acid batteries with our ULTRA3000. That phase was expedited. The team did an absolutely fantastic job getting the product to the customer in our fiscal year and in the dates they needed it. That was completed. They're installing them over the next couple of quarters. And according to each one of them -- and we are tied in with every major owner operator of GE wind turbines in North America, the Phase II will start early 2024. So in essence, the first quarter of calendar 2024, we'll start seeing the bookings for Phase II. And right now, it looks like, for example, our backlog today is about the size of our sales last year. So we're looking to grow in this fiscal year. The exact timing of how much we'll ship in Q3 and Q4, this project-based business is very hard to do that, but inputs from the customers is, that'll kind of be the progress going forward.\nAnja Soderstrom: So the second quarter is expected to be at the same level as the first quarter sort of?\nEdward Richardson: It'll be very close to the first quarter shipments.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay, and then on the flip side, the PMT was stronger and with sub-growth sequentially. What's driving that and how is that continuing into the second quarter?\nEdward Richardson: Yeah, both the tube business and then the RF and wireless component business did good. The RF and wireless component business received a lot of strong bookings in Q3 and Q4 of last fiscal year. And so we had very strong shipments in there. Their backlog grew and they grew year-over-year in Q1. On the tube side, we had real strong growth in our laser tube market and also we had a large business with some replacement business [indiscernible] 354. So that's just very consistent business. It goes up and down 5% or 6%, but with the recession coming on and this being replacement business, it's not 100% recession proof, but it's because it's repair business, we seem to have consistent numbers throughout the year. So we'll probably see the same type of growth that we saw on Q1, and now in Q2 throughout the year.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay, thank you. And then inventory seems to be managing that well for the quarter. How -- what's included in that inventory and how are you going to need to start building that in anticipation of these large orders that you expected in the second half?\nEdward Richardson: Yes, there was two main increases in the inventory, very strategic purchases. One was some long-term, lifetime buy orders to support our customers on product that's being discontinued over the next couple of years to make sure our customers we've had for 20-30 years have a source of supply. And the other part of it was, four months ago we had zero inventory on the ULTRA3000 and many of the GES products. So we're trying to build up inventory where we have a quarters -- a minimum of a quarter's worth of inventory because just like it's hard to predict these project-based orders, When they come in, typical customer, they want them the next month or the next week, so we went through two years of daily calls and the supply chain issues, and we can't let our customers down, and we did an amazing job, as you saw with the numbers from FY 2023, supporting their Phase I builds, both in the locomotive and wind turbine business.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay, thank you. I'll get back in line.\nEdward Richardson: Thanks, Anja.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of P. Ross Taylor with ARS Investment Partners. Your line is now open.\nP. Ross Taylor: Thank you. I very rarely get the full name. A couple of things first. Revenues were down about $10 million in the semi-cap equipment space. That carries probably about your best margins in your firm. So would it be safe to assume that on operating profit basis that probably hit you guys by something in the neighborhood of around $5 million?\nEdward Richardson: On the operating profit.\nRobert Ben: That's probably a fair assumption. It might be a little less than that, but that's about correct.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. Do you have any ability to reduce the other costs associated below the operating profit line when you see a drop like that?\nWendy Diddell: So -- Hi, Ross, it's Wendy. We had a few layoffs that we were able to take some costs out there. We had some people voluntarily take furloughs. We were able to take some costs out there. Our plan is considerably higher than where the sales actually came in, so we have savings in the incentive area. We certainly hold off on adding any non-critical ads to staff. And in general, we look at things like travel, can we cut back on that? Marketing, can we cut back on that? But you're not going to see a $5 million reduction in SG&A.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. So it's safe to say that probably cost on an operating basis $0.35, $0.40 a share. You're being told to look for fiscal 2025 that would be at record levels better than you saw last year, is that true?\nWendy Diddell: So what we're anticipating is that, the business will start improving again in the back half of calendar year 2024. In the calendar year 2025, we're anticipating that will be a record year.\nP. Ross Taylor: Yes, okay. Calendar 2025, that's even better.\nWendy Diddell: Calendar, not fiscal year.\nP. Ross Taylor: Calendar, right. Okay, so looking at that setup, is there any reason to believe that you should not be able to sustain or even improve profitability as you move back to record levels of revenue in that space?\nWendy Diddell: We absolutely can achieve that.\nEdward Richardson: Yes, in addition to that, there's a number of large programs out there on the GES side that would compensate for any continued comeback with that market. So there's a lot of things in the pipeline that we really think will be added to that, that will get us back to these record profits we saw over the last year or so.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. And Let's move on to the GES space in Suzlon. They have about 7,000 towers. Each tower…\nEdward Richardson: They currently have about 9,000 total turbines. We have a bi-weekly call with the group in India. The first Phase I will be 7,000 turbines and those are all in India actually. And we're all set up to do that beta testing the third week in October, so end of next week or week after I guess. And we've tested the product in a Suzlon turbine here in the states with one of our owner-operative partners and it has worked very, very well. So we're really excited about that program, getting an OEM and working with them. In addition to that, they also own a number of GE sites, which obviously the ULTRA3000 was designed for. So we look at that program to be very strong going forward, absolutely.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay, so when we look at the demand for your ultracapacitors, on a GE side it's one for one, right? So that's -- if there are 18 batteries that's 18 ultracapacitors. On the Suzlon, from my understanding of the technology, it's like a one for two. So if there's 9,000 towers, that would mean you need something -- each tower having 18, or the equivalent of, I'll say 18, you'd end up needing something then in the neighborhood of 50,000 modules or something like that total. The 7,000 in India alone would be like 42,000 modules that you'd be looking at putting into that. Is that about right? seven times 18.\nEdward Richardson: Yes, that's close. So the Suzlon module is based on the ULTRA3000 technology, but it is a redesign specific for Suzlon, and there's six modules in every Suzlon turbine versus 18 modules in every GE turbine. However, this product is a little more expensive than the ULTRA3000. So it'd be six times 7,000, which is what you came up with about 42,000 of these.\nP. Ross Taylor: 42,000. And so we're looking at that project, that opportunity alone, is probably something in the neighborhood of $34 million, $40 something million of revenues and operating profits, something like $14 million to $18 million out of that project alone.\nEdward Richardson: Yes.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. How long would it take you to fulfill an order for 42,000 ultrapapacitors?\nEdward Richardson: Well, with the new manufacturing area, it's just about resources. We get the people. Right now we can produce probably 5,000 to 6,000 a month. So it wouldn't take that long.\nP. Ross Taylor: So you can easily fulfill that inside a year and if you ramp up you could fulfill it in five months, six months or less type of situation.\nEdward Richardson: Absolutely.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. Cool. Unique about –\nEdward Richardson: The large order we received when we started this program, they picked sites and they did a complete repower, meaning, they took all the lead acid batteries out and put these in. Some of these other owner-operators, it's when they have a -- one of the unique things about our product from the competition is that, you can put it in a turbine and keep. If you want to put two in, you can keep the other 16 batteries in the turbine until the warranty runs out or the batteries fail. So they replace them as the batteries fail versus just doing a sweep of every site. So that's just a timing thing, but it’s great business and great program, great product.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. And the technology with Siemens is a little different is it not? You're saying it's like one at the base, but it's probably a much bigger more powerful one than what we're seeing is -- the economics might not be the same as times 18 for GE or maybe times six for Suzlon, but I would assume that's a pretty valuable unit at the base of each Siemens tower.\nEdward Richardson: Yes, so the UPS product is a different technology than the ULTRA3000. The ULTRA3000 is a pitch energy module. The UPS is an uninterrupted power supply. So there's only one per turbine, but it's five times the amount of an ULTRA3000. So that's the Siemens design we're working on right now. It's for the UPS, not the ULTRA3000.\nP. Ross Taylor: And that's a similar margin?\nEdward Richardson: Yes.\nP. Ross Taylor: Okay. So look, I mean, that's really setting up. Well, we've got a market here that seems to be focused on looking at its speed and concerned about what's going on, which leads to my next area. I know [indiscernible] ask two questions, but Ed and Wendy know me, so they know that I'm not going to only ask two questions.\nEdward Richardson: That's okay.\nP. Ross Taylor: So, one of the things I'm looking at is at this point in time, this company is actually selling at net-net working capital. The market is assigning a zero value to the business. It's literally saying that Richardson is worth nothing other than what you can liquidate its current assets for. When I look at that, that tells me that there's something really just kind of wrong with the thinking. And now, Ed, you've done an amazing job of changing this company. I mean, this company going back a number of years was a highly cyclical, really focused into one primary area, and you've diversified it. And I think your dad would be really proud of what you've done with it. And to be honest, what I'm hearing on this call, I think in two years, your dad is going to be -- would be beyond satisfied with you ever. I think he'd be enthusiastic, because I'm hearing you guys talk about the put these pieces together. We're looking at a return to not just the level of earnings you had last year, but earnings that can be meaningfully higher than that, meaning, when I model it out I get a $1.82 a share in fiscal 2025 for you. And I think that the inability of the market to appreciate that is problematic. But I also want to say that I think that there are some things that we can do with that. One is, in the past you've indicated that your banking accord doesn't allow you to buy back stock. When you're selling at net-net working capital and I've talked to a bankers. I have my – one of the guys I golf with is a vice chairman of one of the world's four or five biggest financial institutions. They don't bank down at this level, but he tells me it's absolutely asinine you can't buy back stock in your bank accord, given your balance sheet. And I think that, I for one would argue we need to get a bank accord that reflects what [REL] (ph) is today and where it is going, which is, it's going to go parabolic, it's going to be a massive free cash flow generator. There is no risk to a bank in lending you money. So it's time that we start to get banks that respect us and give us that type of opportunity. So that's my Ross Taylor [Smitty] (ph) comment at the moment on your banking situation. I do think that if you do that, we're looking at a stock that's down a lot this year. You have $5 million plus, you have 100 acres plus in unused land, that's a zero asset right now, really, it's being farmed at this point.\nWendy Diddell: Correct.\nP. Ross Taylor: What kind of --\nEdward Richardson: That's correct.\nP. Ross Taylor: What do you get on leasing out that acreage to be farmed.\nEdward Richardson: We get about $340 an acre. We sold 55 -- we sold 225 acres of that 55,000 acres, so it'll tell you pretty much what the value is.\nP. Ross Taylor: Right. So, right now you're getting about $34,000 a year on that land.\nEdward Richardson: That's true. We think that ultimately that the electric locomotives with progress rail and [indiscernible] are going to be huge business and we want to keep space that we can expand backwards. We're on 25 acres in the front of the 120 acre property and we want to keep space to be able to expand.\nP. Ross Taylor: So if you sold off 50 acres and you got the $55,000 you did before and you turn that into -- if you bought 10 year treasuries, you'd literally increase the income off of that land by a factor of four or five. And so I'd suggest -- and you could use that -- I mean, that's in this environment and that still leaves you a lot of land to expand, leaves you 50 acres to expand into. But it does strike me as in some ways, you're on the cusp of something major here. The market isn't smart enough to figure it out. But there's a reason why I -- my career is based on the stupidity of the market. I like to tell my daughter [Multiple Speakers] I tell my daughter [Multiple Speakers] markets are stupid. So we look at that going. If we could do something that's in the way of monetizing some of that asset, there's a lot of good things we could do even to just make more money. That's a penny plus a share pre-tax. At the same time, you could use that. Maybe if your bankers would wake up, they might let you use some of that to retire stock in a Dutch auction or something and take the selling pressure off in the end of the year because people are looking at their feet, not at the opportunity. So I think that's something we need to look at, because there is zero reason why this stock should trade at net-net working capital. Your business is worth easily a low teens multiple on the earnings power of this business. And the net-net working capital should be an add-in. I don't have anything in my universe that's trading at net-net working capital. I challenge people to find much that is in the world. Now on to my next, because I am going to -- because this is Ross and Ross goes places where things --.\nWendy Diddell: Your last one, Ross. Last one. We got to give time to everybody.\nP. Ross Taylor: This is it. I'm really frustrated with your board. You've got three directors who've been there for 10 years. They own zero stock. I will be honest with you. You guys who've been there for 10 years shouldn't own less stock than my dogs, right? I mean, it's not acceptable. And I look at your business, it's changing. Your business is going places you weren't before. I would love to see you change your board. I'd love to have you put people on who believe enough in this company that they're willing to spend the price of a happy meal and a latte every day to buy a share of stock. And I also would like to see those people come in with expertise. Because, Ed, you've got such a great opportunity here and you've done such a great job with this company that if you surrounded yourself with people who have green energy background, people who have background in the semi-cap equipment space, people who have capital markets background and things of that nature. And those people not just brought their expertise, but brought their pocketbooks and bought stock. I think it would send a message to the street that they just -- that they need to look at this opportunity and they need to take you guys seriously. And I know it's always hard. I understand boards tend to -- these are people who have been around for a long time. But from my outside perspective, their unwillingness to commit capital to buy stock and the lack of clear industry expertise and exponential expertise tells me that we need as outside investors, I need people to be my champion on your board and I need people to bring you the skills so that you guys get everything you can out of this opportunity. And so, I would strongly advocate we bring some new blood into the board. I'm in my mid-60s, so I hate calling people in their 70s old. But that we need new people on this board who bring that expertise and honestly come in and are excited by this opportunity and say, you know, I right now can buy a stock for $0.00 to $0.50 above net-net working capital that I think is going to earn close to $2 bucks in two years. And that's insane and I want to own a lot of them. And I'll let others talk now.\nOperator: Thank you.\nEdward Richardson: Yes. Well, we certainly agree with you and we had a long discussion with the board when they were here this week about buying stock and that's under consideration. We agree, we think this company will be $500 million in the next three to five years And we have $25 million in cash today. We'll go cash flow positive in 2025. So all the things you say we agree with, and we appreciate your opinion.\nWendy Diddell: Thanks, Ross. We're going to move on. Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Barry Mendel with Mendel Money Management. Your line is now open.\nBarry Mendel: Yes. A couple of things. One, when do you expect your backlog to start increasing? Because I think that would be a catalyst for the stock. I know you expect the big locomotive orders, at least last quarter you said, sometime in the third or fourth quarter of this year. So when do you expect the backlog to kind of bottom out?\nEdward Richardson: Yes, on the GES side and the PMT side, we look at the backlog to start having some of these project-based businesses the end of Q2, the very beginning of our Q3, and then we expect the delivery will be over the next six months after that. So end of Q2 based on some of the beta testing we have and the customer's forecast. And then -- but Q3 should be a very strong booking quarter, Q3.\nBarry Mendel: You're fiscal Q3?\nEdward Richardson: Our fiscal Q3, yes.\nBarry Mendel: Okay. In terms of the semi space, because I recall last quarter I believe you mentioned the semi space expected to improve in the first half of calendar 2024, not just setting the second half of calendar 2024. What's the reason for that shift?\nWendy Diddell: Hi, it's Wendy. We -- I think we've been consistent saying it's -- our customers have been forecasting improvement in the second half. We are hoping that maybe we would see some of that start to come in in the first half, but it's always been consistent that they were not anticipating significant or really any recovery until the second half of calendar year 2024.\nBarry Mendel: Okay. And [indiscernible] the magnetrons. What's going on with that business?\nWendy Diddell: I'm sorry, could you repeat that? You're a little bit distorted.\nBarry Mendel: What's going on with the magnetrons business in terms of capacity and sales there?\nEdward Richardson: With magnetrons. Yes. Well, we're building new test equipment. We've improved the carbonization of the filament on the tube. There's a huge demand out there, probably over 5,000 tubes a year, and we're trying to build our capacity to take advantage of that. And we have monthly progress in that area. Plus the 915 megahertz magnetron at 100 kilowatts, there's the huge market for also creating synthetic diamonds and then they make hydrogen out of methane gas, which is another big application. So the magnetron business is strong and well and our restriction is how fast we can develop higher power magnetron and improve the quality of the ones we make already.\nBarry Mendel: As I recall you, [indiscernible] capacity in that business earlier this year, in the spring or early summer?\nEdward Richardson: Yes, we're still having difficulty [quality] (ph) there. The problem is that tube type equipment is all custom-made and we've geared up now where we can build about 240 a month, but we need to get to 500 a month on the YJ1600, which is the 6 kilowatt tube. But we're getting there. It's progress. It's slow.\nBarry Mendel: When do you expect to get to 500 a month?\nEdward Richardson: I would say six months out.\nBarry Mendel: Okay. That’s clear. Thank you.\nEdward Richardson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Ron Richards. Your line is now open, sir.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. I was wondering, in light of all the problems that Siemens is having, I know that you're in beta testing right now. Do you have any guesses as to when we might start receiving some orders from Siemens?\nEdward Richardson: Yes, I think it's similar to the other ones based on how they structure their capital request and money. So they put in for it. The part's been successful in testing. And again, Q3, Q4 of our fiscal year is when we think we'll be getting, per them, production orders. We've already received orders for beta testing and alpha testing, but production orders probably Q3, Q4 based on what they're telling us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Okay, is this your fiscal Q3, Q4?\nEdward Richardson: Yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.\nWendy Diddell: And that particular product, Ron, is the ULTRAUPS 3000, which is also in test with other large wind turbine companies. Greg, you want to comment on that?\nGreg Peloquin: Yes, it's again a base design that we're designing for Siemens, but also we have beta testing going on with Nextera and RWE. So yes, it's -- and again, it goes in every one of their turbines, so we're excited about that product.\nWendy Diddell: And they're aftermarket. So Siemens might be an OEM opportunity but the other ones are aftermarket.\nEdward Richardson: They're both aftermarket.\nWendy Diddell: So it's not waiting for turbines to be built. So if that's your concern with Siemens, that's not an issue.\nEdward Richardson: Yeah, no. It's not based on new builds.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thanks for the color. Appreciate it.\nEdward Richardson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hughes of SGF Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nMichael Hughes: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, can you just -- Hi. Can you break out the backlog by segment for the quarter please?\nRobert Ben: Yes. Hi, Michael. This is Bob Ben. Yes, so again the total backlog at the end of the quarter was $148.1 million. Of that, approximately $67.4 million was PMT, $36.5 million was Green Energy Systems, $42.6 million was Canvys, and the remaining $1.6 million was healthcare.\nMichael Hughes: Okay. And then, Wendy, I think you referenced an issue with a critical component for the Siemens tube program. Can you elaborate on that a little bit?\nWendy Diddell: A little bit. I don't want to get into too much detail on this call, but it is a part that we thought we could use a refurbished part or a part that's already been used on another tube, and unfortunately that method is not going to work, so we have a -- we need to wait until the patent expires. In the interim, there are a number of the MX series that we can repair without replacing that specific component, and that's what we'll focus on. Which is why I say we'll have limited supply until next summer.\nMichael Hughes: When does the patent expire?\nWendy Diddell: During the summer of 2024.\nMichael Hughes: Okay, right, right. Okay, that makes sense. And then last question for you. I'm not sure if you'll disclose the precise number, but was the semi-cap equipment revenue up or down sequentially?\nEdward Richardson: It was down certainly. It’s pretty much flat.\nMichael Hughes: So flat for the May quarter?\nRobert Ben: Yes, it's running about $4 million or $5 million a quarter.\nMichael Hughes: Okay, great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.\nWendy Diddell: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Rem with Odinson Partners. Your line is open.\nEdward Richardson: Good morning, Andrew.\nWendy Diddell: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Rem: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot. Just on the beta test coming up in October, what needs to be proven in that beta test?\nEdward Richardson: They just -- they run it. They take the turbine and shut it down, so there's an electrical fault to see if it works. They just -- for the most part just want to run it in a specific turbine for a period of time. It varies. Some want to do it for a year. Some want to do it for six months. Some for three months. But it's just a -- the beta testing we've done almost all the testing you can get in the data in our labs and either a local turbine, but then when we go to the large orders, these large customers, it averages between three months to a year. They just want to run it in the turbine to make sure it works.\nAndrew Rem: Okay. So now if I take kind of [Multiple Speakers]\nEdward Richardson: Go ahead.\nAndrew Rem: Go ahead.\nEdward Richardson: I was just going to say, in beta testing, so then there might be a mechanical issue, meaning, the way it fits into the box that we might have to do a tweak here and there, but it's just a handful of tweaks, but it's really the performance of it. They just need to run it for a certain period of time.\nAndrew Rem: Okay, setting aside the nuance with the mechanical box piece, just if we try to think reasonably expectation, you've talked about 7,000 wind towers, but realistically, knowing that the beta test could take six months plus, it probably wouldn't be until the back half of calendar 2024 where you might start seeing kind of full rollout of that kind of deployment. Is that a fair assessment?\nEdward Richardson: Yes. And that's specific to the Suzlon opportunity in India. If everything goes perfectly, yes, we'll see shipments in our Q4 and the early part of fiscal year 2025. But yes, based on history and the way these things work, and I've been doing MPIs or new product introductions for now almost 40 years, second half of 2024 calendar year will be when we see the large production orders going on.\nAndrew Rem: All right. I want to tag on. I think the questioner a couple people ago, I think his name is Rob, mentioned this comment about stock buyback. I want to pile onto that comment by suggesting you might want to take a look at foregoing dividend payment and do a stock buyback, because that would be a much higher return profile for investors. So it's a way to both pay the investors back. It's a more efficient way to do it because they don't have to pay taxes. And obviously, you should be able to -- if you realize what you guys are trying to do here, obviously, the stock should be significantly higher. So that would be a great return on investments for you and shareholders. Also what he said about the board, I would double down on that in terms of ownership. So I guess, that's two votes for a couple of different thoughts there. And then lastly, just Ed, it sounds like maybe you have a cold, so hope you get well soon. Thanks a lot guys.\nEdward Richardson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Richardson for closing remarks.\nEdward Richardson: Well, we appreciate all your comments and we appreciate your investment and interest in the company, Richardson Electronics. We look forward to our ongoing discussions and sharing our fiscal 2024 second quarter with you in January. Do not hesitate to give us a call anytime. We're happy to take your calls and talk to you individually. Thanks, Noma. It was a very good question-and-answer period.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."
