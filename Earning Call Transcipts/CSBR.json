A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Ronnie Morris, CEO of Champions Oncology. You may begin.\nRonnie Morris: Good afternoon. I am Ronnie Morris, CEO of Champions Oncology. Joining me today is David Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our quarterly earnings call. Before I begin, I will remind you that we're making forward-looking statements during today's call and that actual results could differ materially from what is described in those statements. Additional information on factors that could cause results to differ is available on our Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the call to GAAP financial measures is available in the earnings release. Overall, we experienced a challenging third quarter with less than stellar results as we continue to navigate through the challenges we've been highlighting over the course of the year. However, I will reiterate that we see positive developments emerging that will translate to improving results over the coming quarters. As we have discussed on previous calls, the challenges began in October of 2022, when the economic environment, specifically in the biotech sector turned markedly negative. Our customers reduced their R&D budgets in real time, which led to fewer studies ordered and increasing cancellations and longer sales cycles. In addition, the study sizes were smaller than we were accustomed to, which is a trend that has continued. All of these factors resulted in lower net bookings and ultimately lower quarterly revenue. Along with the external factors, we identified some operational issues that led to slower revenue conversion, putting additional downward pressure on our top line and operating results. We have made significant progress towards reversing these trends and the metrics we use to measure operational efficiencies and success have made significant headway over the last several months. Cancellations have receded back to historical levels. Our business development strategy is taking hold, which will contribute to our already strong bookings, which are the fundamental foundation for building long-term success. As these higher bookings convert to revenue over the coming quarters, we will see a return to quarterly revenue growth and profitability. Anticipating the slowdown in biotech funding and R&D, over the last year, we have expanded our work with some of our top-tier larger customers. These large pharma companies generally have larger and more stable budgets than the smaller biotech companies that we work with. This does not mean we are abandoning the smaller biotech space, but we see a more robust pipeline of opportunities emanating from these larger customers. Despite the fact that the biotech sector is showing a lot more activity since the start of the year, we have decided to right-size the operational teams and reduce our costs at this time to better reflect the current market conditions and our current revenue. When the need arises, we are confident we will be able to step up to meet the increased need. We are becoming leaner in order to reach our goal of quarterly profitability and the continued -- and then continue to expand our operating margin over time. As is often the case, anticipated turnaround has taken longer than initially expected but it is coming. With regard to specific offerings, our clinical biomarkers pipeline has grown with a modest uptick in our clinical bookings. This has been an area that has lagged behind our internal expectations and we are monitoring closely to determine if it can finally become a more meaningful contributor to our long-term revenue growth. Turning to ex vivo. We continue to expand our ex vivo offering, making it more robust by adding additional model to our platform. We continue to get extremely positive feedback from our customers on this platform and we anticipate strong growth from our ex vivo offering over the coming quarters. With regards to Corellia, our wholly owned drug development subsidiary, our lead discovery programs are progressing well through the therapeutic discovery stages with our two lead programs exhibiting promising results. We continue to be actively engaged with investors in an effort to raise capital to support and accelerate our growth. In addition to the prospect of raising capital, there are potential near-term licensing opportunities that we are currently evaluating. This is an exciting development within our target discovery program and a model we hope to replicate. In summary, the quarter's performance was challenging but not entirely unexpected. We anticipate that improvements will slowly take hold and put us back on our targeted trajectory. Despite the slowdown, we continue to have robust bookings, a comprehensive platform, a stellar reputation and a strong team that is poised for the next stage. We are confident that we will emerge with stronger revenue and profitability over the long-term. Now let me turn the call over to David Miller for a more detailed review of the financial results.\nDavid Miller: Thanks, Ronnie. Our full results on Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC on or before March 18. Our third quarter revenue was $12 million, a decline of 6% from the third quarter of fiscal 2023. As we've been guiding on our calls throughout the year, the challenges encountered last year, specifically the customer cancellations led to a reduction in convertible bookings and would ultimately lead to lower revenue in 2024. We believe last quarter, our Q2 was the revenue low point and the expectation remains that we'll see gradual improvement over the coming quarters beginning with this quarter, Q3, which was approximately 4% higher sequentially. On a GAAP basis, our loss for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $2.6 million compared to $2.5 million in the prior year. Included in the $2.6 million loss were non-cash expenses of stock comp and depreciation totaling approximately $900,000. Excluding these non-cash items, our adjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $1.7 million for the quarter compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $1.6 million in the year ago period. Turning the focus to our cash-based results. The total cost of sales was $7.8 million compared to $7.5 million in our third quarter last year, an increase of 4%. The increase relative to the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in mouse costs. These costs rose due to some operational inefficiencies, which are being corrected. This should lead to lower mouse costs as a percentage of revenue in the coming quarters. As a result of our lower top line revenue and higher cost of sales, our gross margin dipped to 35% for the quarter compared to 41% for the same period last year. Our margins should begin to improve over the coming quarters as our revenue expands, leveraging against the fixed cost component of cost of sales and lower mouse costs resulting from both price reductions on recently negotiated terms along with improvement in operations. Additionally, we anticipate a decline in salary expense as we make some strategic reductions in our operational team. For the quarter, R&D expense was approximately $2.2 million compared to $3.2 million in the year ago period. Our R&D spend is split between our traditional R&D supporting our core business services and investing in our drug discovery platform. Approximately $900,000 was invested towards our drug discovery efforts during the quarter, down from $1.5 million in the year ago period. The reduction in our drug discovery spend should continue in subsequent quarters, as we're in a holding pattern while we look to raise capital for future discovery efforts. For the quarter, sales and marketing expense was unchanged at $1.7 million. Our G&A expense was mostly flat with expenses of $2 million in the current quarter compared to $1.9 million in Q3 2023. Now turning to cash. We ended the quarter with $4.5 million of cash on the balance sheet and no debt. For the quarter, cash used in operating activities was approximately $900,000, resulting primarily from our net loss and partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue. Changes in our working capital accounts were in the ordinary course of business. Investment in new lab equipment was a modest $125,000 and we do not anticipate any significant CapEx investment in the near-term. We are carefully monitoring our cash position and have no plans to raise capital for our core business. We anticipate a small decline in our cash balance in Q4 with a gradual quarterly acceleration beginning in fiscal 2025, stemming from improvement in our operational results. We believe our cash position remains sound. In summation, our third quarter financial results were weaker than usual, but mostly as expected. We envision a return to sustained revenue growth, which we began this quarter, while at the same time, we begin to realize operational efficiencies that have been a company focus over the last few quarters. We will keep tight control on our expenses, including making strategic reductions in several areas that won't adversely impact operations or long-term growth, but should start having an impact on our bottom line results in the near-term. We are confident that despite recent obstacles from both internal and external factors, our long-term prospects are positive and we're poised for a slow but steady improvement in our operational results, including revenue growth and ultimately profitability within the next few quarters. We are currently in our fiscal fourth quarter. As such, our next earnings call will be in late July when we report on fourth quarter and full year 2024 results and a 2025 preview. We will keep you apprised should there be any significant developments in the interim. We will now open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jack on for Matt. A couple of questions. When do you expect the press release? It looks like that hasn't been published yet. And then for a follow-up, coming out of what have you been hearing from customers regarding budgets and their pipelines? Are they feeling a bit more comfortable with their balance sheets and willing to reengage from an investment standpoint?\nDavid Miller: So I'll take the first one, and I'll let Ronnie take the second one. Yes, I'm not sure why there was a delay in the press release. I actually got an e-mail confirmation just while we're on the call. It was sent out as per usual. And I know it didn't hit at 4:00 p.m. as it was scheduled. There's no other reason other than some technical issue on the press release side, not on our end.\nRonnie Morris : And in terms of the -- in terms of what we're seeing out there, there's certainly been a loosening up of the R&D budgets in the pipelines. Certainly, there's been a lot more activity in the last couple of months than there were almost all last year. We're -- as I think I mentioned in my comments, we anticipated this coming down the pike and we're working really hard to work more closely with some of the larger pharmaceutical companies and partners that we have. We are starting to see more of the biotechs starting to have more funds and starting to talk about doing more studies. But I think it's still a little bit early for us to know exactly if -- how far back things have come. So certainly looking better than it was, let's say, a year ago, but how far it's going to come to where it was a couple of years ago, I just don't know yet.\nUnidentified Analyst: And if I could squeeze in one more question regarding Corellia AI. Can you just give a progress update on that? How much do you think you've invested in the business during Q3? And then given the environment, does it make sense to maybe put it down the side burner until we see further improvement?\nRonnie Morris : Yes, go ahead.\nDavid Miller: It was about $900,000. And again, there is some overlap between Champions and obviously, Corellia, but about $900,000 was in the current quarter. And certainly, Ronnie can take the -- in terms of the strategic planning for the future.\nRonnie Morris : And in terms of the Corellia investment, we definitely are lowering our investment substantially for both Q4 and Q1 going forward. We are -- we believe, getting close to getting investments or out-licensing deals for some of the assets, so we think in short order. So the answer to your question is number one, we are taking that into account and we are reducing our spend significantly. And two, we are excited and hopefully getting outside funding in short order to take the pressure off of Champions to continue to grow the exciting platform.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Ronnie for closing remarks.\nRonnie Morris: Thank you. So thank you, everybody for joining our quarterly earnings call. As I think we've mentioned, it was somewhat of a disappointing quarter from financial perspective, but we do feel very confident going forward both looking at our bookings and our efficiencies and our operational excellence and the customer feedback that we are going to start to have quarters where we have good revenue, higher base of revenue, decreased costs and profitability. So we are excited to continue to update you for Q4 and for next year's guidance as well over the summertime. So we look forward to that update and have a good evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Ronnie Morris, CEO. You may begin.\nRonnie Morris: Good afternoon. I am Ronnie Morris, CEO of Champions Oncology. Joining me today is David Miller, our Chief Financial Officer. Thank you for joining us for our quarterly earnings call.  Before I begin, I will remind you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during today's call and that actual results could differ materially from what is described in those statements. Additional information on factors that could cause results to differ is available on our Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the call to GAAP financial measures is available in the earnings release.  Overall, our second quarter's results were mixed as we continue to navigate through some of the challenges we've been highlighting over the past several quarters. Our financial results were weaker than we have been accustomed to delivering. However, there were several positive foundational developments in our core business that have us well positioned for the future. As we have discussed in the past, approximately 1 year ago, we encountered business headwinds on multiple fronts. The economic environment specifically in our sector turned markedly negative which impacted our customers, and ultimately, Champions Oncology. As our customer's R&D budgets were reduced, we encountered longer sales cycles and fewer studies signed. Additionally, customers had a much higher propensity to cancel all or part of the study they had recently signed. The resulting lower net bookings was the precursor to the anticipated revenue decline we are currently experiencing.  Additionally, in conjunction with the external factors, we identified some operational issues that led to slower revenue conversion, creating further downward pressure on our operating results. I remain optimistic that we have made significant progress towards reversing these trends and we see a light at the end of the tunnel as positive trends are emerging.  We have made the necessary operational changes with some key hires and internal restructuring that we are confident will lead to greater efficiencies and an improvement in our overall operations. Cancellations have receded back to historical levels. Our bookings which are the fundamental foundation for building long-term success are strong and we are anticipating continued acceleration for the second half of this fiscal year. As these higher bookings convert to revenue over the coming quarters, we will see a return to quarterly revenue growth and profitability.  With regard to specific services, we have increased our clinical biomarkers pipeline with an uptick in bookings. This has been an area that has lagged behind our internal expectations but we are feeling more confident that our clinical work can finally become a more meaningful contributor to our long-term revenue growth as it ramps up in accordance with our initial expectations. Similarly, we continue to expand our ex vivo offering adding additional models to our platform which should lead to increasing ex vivo revenue in the coming quarters.  With regards to Corellia our wholly-owned drug development subsidiary, our lead discovery programs are progressing well through therapeutic discovery stages with our two lead programs exhibiting promising results. We continue to be actively engaged with investors in an effort to raise capital to support and accelerate our growth. Although we anticipate a return to revenue growth and profitability given some of the recent weakness in our revenue, in the short-term, we are reducing our quarterly investment in the subsidiary. We do not anticipate this short-term reduction in spend will have a material effect on our progress.  In summary, the quarter's performance was as expected. We anticipate that improvements will slowly take hold and put us back on our targeted trajectory. Despite the slowdown, we continue to have robust bookings, a comprehensive platform, a stellar reputation and a strong team that is poised for the next stage of growth. We are confident that we will emerge with stronger revenue and profitability over the long-term.  Now let me turn the call over to David Miller for a more detailed review of the financial results.\nDavid Miller: Thanks, Ronnie. Our full results on Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC on or before December 15th. Our second quarter revenue was $11.6 million, a decline of 19% from the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As we've been guiding over the last several quarters, the challenges encountered last year, specifically the customer cancellations, led to a decline in prior quarter net bookings and would lead to lower revenue in the first half 2024. We believe Q2 was the low point and a gradual improvement will follow over the coming quarters. On a GAAP basis, our loss for the second quarter of 2024 was approximately $2 million compared to a gain of $8,000 in the prior year.  Included in the $2 million loss were noncash expenses of stock comp and depreciation totaling approximately $600,000. Excluding these noncash items, our adjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $1.4 million for the quarter compared to an adjusted EBITDA profit of $686,000 in the year ago period.  Turning the focus to our cash based results. The total cost of sales was $6.6 million compared to $7.2 million in our second quarter last year, a decline of 9%. The decrease relative to the same period last year was primarily due to a reduction in outsourced lab services and supply expenses. Despite the decline in cost of sales as a result of our lower top line revenue, our gross margin for the quarter was 43% compared to 49% for the same period last year. Our margins should begin to improve over the coming quarters as our revenue expands and we leverage against the fixed cost component of cost of sales along with our variable cost increasing at a slower pace.  For the quarter, R&D expense was approximately $2.5 million compared to $2.6 million in the year ago period. Our R&D spend is split between our traditional R&D supporting our core business services and investing in our drug discovery platform. Approximately $1.2 million was invested towards our drug discovery efforts during this quarter.  For the quarter, sales and marketing expense was a relatively flat $1.8 million the compared to $1.7 million in the year ago period. Our G&A expense was also unchanged at $2.1 million for the quarters ended October 31, 2023 and 2022. Now turning to cash. We ended the quarter with $5.5 million of cash on the balance sheet and no debt. For the quarter, cash generated from operating activities was approximately $600,000, resulting from an increase in receivable collections and an uptick in deferred revenue. The change in these working capital accounts was in the ordinary course of business. Investment in new lab equipment was a modest $150,000, and cash generated from financing activities was approximately $200,000, primarily from stock option exercises. We anticipate remaining in a generally cash neutral position for the next quarter or two, with a gradual acceleration towards the end of fiscal 2024 and into next year. As our operational results are expected to improve, we believe our cash position remains sound. In summation, directionally, our second quarter financial results were mostly as expected. However, revenue was a bit below our expectations. This is mostly due to timing uncertainty on study completions in the bookings to revenue conversion process. As a result, despite the anticipation of revenue reacceleration in the second half of fiscal 2024, we are revising our full year revenue guidance and expect that revenue growth will be generally flat compared to last year. However, with continued strength in our bookings which are a leading indicator of revenue with the operational corrections made beginning to take effect and with reduction in cancellations, we are confident that despite these short-term obstacles, our long-term prospects are positive. We anticipate a slow but steady improvement in our operational results including revenue growth and ultimately profitability within the next couple of quarters. We look forward to our next update in mid-March when we report our third quarter results. We will now open the call to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Jack on for Matt. As you commented in your prepared remarks, you spoke to elevated cancellations. Is this broad-based or is there one or two large cancellations that represented the delta? And then how are things looking so far this quarter? We're hearing from others in the industry that the rate of cancellations are declining, we're curious if that's consistent to what you're hearing? And then I have a follow-up as well.\nRonnie Morris: Yes. So I would say that it's pretty much a broad-based effect that started a couple of quarters ago that's washing out now. And we don't see it from necessarily one or two customers. We saw it as a kind of a broad-based industry-wide exercise with just a lot of cancellations. Your second question was what again? Sorry. Remind me of your second question.\nUnidentified Analyst: How are things looking so far this quarter? We're just hearing from others in the industry that the rate of cancellations are declining, but we're curious if that's consistent with what you're hearing?\nRonnie Morris: Yes. Totally consistent with what we're seeing. The cancellations have come back down to what we call our historical norms, the way it was before. I would say it started about a year or maybe a little over a year ago. So we are seeing that. We're seeing the bookings remain consistently strong with cancellations coming down, which gives us the optimism that we think things are going to get back to the way they were and back to normal profitability and growth in the short-term.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then for my follow-up, a lot of pharma and biotech companies are in a midst of budget planning. What are you hearing from them as far as expectations for next year and how do you think that will impact your business?\nRonnie Morris: Yes. So we're hearing some mixed feelings. I think we're generally optimistic. Certainly a lot of the larger pharmaceutical companies as opposed to some of the smaller biotech companies, we feel very confident that their budgets are healthy and we've been in discussions with them about planning for next year. So, I think it's a mixed bag still. I don't think we're back to the way things were a couple of years ago where there was a tremendous amount of investment in biotech. But I don't think it's as bad as it was 1 year, 1.5 year ago where nobody knew what to do and everyone was hoarding cash and was worried about where they're going to be able to raise money and holding on to budgets really tightly. So I think we're better than we were. I don't think we're back to the way things were a couple of years ago but there are certainly different strategies. One of our strategies is to focus more on the large pharma and who I think have more visibility into their R&D budgets than some of the smaller biotechs.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Okay. We have no further questions in queue. I'd now like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nRonnie Morris: Thank you everybody for joining us for our quarterly call. Clearly not the quarter we expected. Certainly the quarter we expected a quarter ago but certainly not something that we have generally expected over the last couple of years with a lot of growth. We're looking forward based on all the information that we see in front of us to getting back to the continued growth. We're excited about the drug development effort and the subsidiary that we have carved out. In terms of that endeavor we're also excited about some of our newer service lines including clinical biomarkers and our ex vivo platform. So a lot of promising news to come and we look forward to updating everybody on our next quarterly call in a couple of months. Thank you everybody for joining. Bye. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

I will now turn the conference over to your host, Dr. Ronnie Morris, CEO of Champions Oncology. You may begin.\nRonnie Morris: Good afternoon. I am Ronnie Morris, CEO of Champions Oncology.

Additional information on factors that could cause results to differ is available on our Forms 10-Q and Form 10-K.  A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that may be discussed during the call to GAAP financial measures is available in the earnings release. I'll start by pointing out that our prepared comments for today will be relatively brief as we just recently provided our fiscal year-end results and company update six weeks ago. On that call, I provided an update on the accomplishments from fiscal year 2023, along with the longer-term strategic vision for the company. I also highlighted the challenges we encountered such as the overall economic environment, which led to cancellations well in excess of our historical norms. Additionally, we identified some operational issues that led to slower revenue conversion and put pressure on our operating results that may extend into fiscal year 2024.  As indicated, those challenges are impacting our current year's results. However, I'm cautiously optimistic that we have made significant progress towards reversing those trends. We have made the necessary operational changes with some key hires in internal restructuring that we're confident will lead to greater efficiencies and an improvement in our operations. Externally, some of the economic pressures that were impacting customer behavior, resulting in longer sales cycle and higher and quicker propensity to cancel studies seems to be easing. On a positive note, our quarterly bookings have continued to grow, and we're seeing a softening of the cancellations over the last couple of months, retreating towards historical levels. We continue to be excited about our expanding ex vivo platform, which we anticipate will lead to increased sales and revenue growth over the coming quarters.  In our clinical biomarker services, we've made some key business development hires during this quarter. We have seen an increase in lead generation in addition to an uptick in clinical bookings. As discussed over the years, the revenue from clinical work has a longer cycle than our traditional services, but the increase in the pipeline and in bookings are positive developments that should contribute to revenue growth over time. With regard to Corellia, our wholly-owned drug development subsidiary, our lead discovery programs are progressing well through the therapeutic discovery stages with our two lead programs exhibiting promising results. We have begun building therapeutic programs around these targets. Our platform has identified many other exciting targets, and we are actively engaged with investors in an effort to raise capital to support and accelerate our growth.  In summary, the quarter's performance was generally as expected. We anticipate that improvements will slowly take hold and put us back on our targeted path. Despite this being a challenging period, we continue to have robust bookings and comprehensive platform, a stellar reputation and a strong team that is poised for the next growth spurt. We are confident that we will emerge with strong revenue and profitability over the longer term.  Now let me turn the call over to David Miller for a more detailed review of the financial results.\nDavid Miller : Thanks, Ronnie. Our full results on Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC later today. Our first quarter revenue was $12.6 million, a decline of 9% from the first quarter of 2023. As highlighted on our year-end call and reiterated by Ronnie, the challenges encountered last year will impact our financial performance in the first half of 2024, with a gradual improvement occurring over the course of the year.  On a GAAP basis, our loss from operations for the first quarter of 2024 was $2.6 million compared to a loss of $284,000 in the prior year. Included in the $2.6 million loss were noncash expenses of stock comp and depreciation totaling approximately $900,000. Excluding these noncash items, our adjusted loss was $1.7 million for the quarter compared to adjusted EBITDA of $450,000 in the year ago period. Turning the focus to our cash-based results, the total cost of sales was $7.5 million compared to $6.9 million in our first quarter last year, an increase of 9%. The increase relative to the same period last year was primarily due to an increase in outsourced lab services and launch [ph] costs.  Due to the increase in cost of sales on lower revenue, our gross margin for the quarter was 40% compared to 50% for the same period last year. The margin pressure will continue for the next few quarters, but we anticipate gradual improvement as our revenue accelerates over the course of the year, while our cost of sales will increase at a much slower rate. For the quarter, R&D expense was approximately $2.8 million compared to $2.9 million in the year ago period. Our R&D spend is split between our traditional R&D supporting our core business services and investing in our drug discovery platform. Approximately $1.2 million was invested towards our drug discovery efforts during the quarter. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was a flat $1.6 million. Our G&A expense was $2.3 million compared to $1.9 million in the year ago period, an increase of $400,000. The increase was primarily due to a small increase in compensation expense and the bad debt and credit loss allowances. Now turning to cash, we ended the quarter with $5 million of cash on the balance sheet and no debt. For the quarter, cash used in operating activities was $3.8 million with an additional $700,000 for investment in lab equipment and $600,000 in financing activities as part of our stock repurchase plan. The accelerated cash burn for the quarter was due to multiple factors, including our net loss and a return of customer deposits on canceled studies, which reduced our deferred revenue and cash balance. As our operational results improved, cancellations decreased and with our bookings, which are our leading indicators of higher revenue, continuing to grow, our cash position remains solid and will gradually increase over the second half of the year. In summation, our first quarter financial results were mostly as expected. We project that results would still be impacted by the challenges faced in our fiscal 2023. However, with our continued strength in bookings and with the operational corrections made beginning to take effect, and with an improving economic environment we're experiencing, we're confident that despite some short-term obstacles, our long-term prospects are positive.  We anticipate a slow but steady improvement in our operational results, including revenue growth and profitability as the year progresses. We look forward to our next update in mid-December when we report our second quarter results. We will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. And the first question today is coming from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Matt, your line is live.\nMatt Hewitt: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe first one regarding the landscape. Obviously, we've been hearing, not just from you guys on your Q4 call, but today, and we've heard from others that it's just a really difficult environment right now. Pharma and biotech companies are facing funding pressures. There's all sorts of issues.  What are you hearing from your customers as far as these cancellations are concerned. It sounds like it's coming down, but is that a function of them reprioritizing pipelines? Is it a function of kind of shifting gears and maybe exiting one area to focus on something else, and that's what this next leg is going to be? Or is there something else driving the, I guess, what's an improving booking situation?\nRonnie Morris: Yes. I think it's a -- I think, Matt, it's a combination of all of the above. I think that the cancellations that we had over the last couple of quarters were primarily from things that booked a little earlier. And those, I think, were driven more by, I would say, the budgetary concerns of just are they going to be funded?  I think that the newer ones are more of a prioritization where they might book something and then they might decide that with the landscape that they want to prioritize one thing over the other. I think I would say two comments. And these are all very general because there's so many anecdotes. But I would say two comments. One that we have seen a palpable kind of a decrease in cancellations over the last couple of months. So it wasn't just one month or two months, now it's the third month. So we're kind of confident that from that perspective, those are moving in the right direction. And I would say the second thing is that we feel like things are opening up more now in terms of the mood or the feeling. The biotech's feeling like things are opening up for them to raise money and continue to fund their program. So certainly not the way it was a couple of years ago in terms of just a tremendous amount of influx and the feeling like there's always going to be money available, but we feel much better than we did, let's say, a year ago.\nMatt Hewitt: Got it. So maybe more back to a more normalized lull of capital. \nRonnie Morris: I think so.\nMatt Hewitt: Okay. Got it. \nRonnie Morris: I think so, yeah. \nMatt Hewitt: Okay. That's super helpful. And then a question regarding the gross margin. Some of the decline year-on-year was due to increased outsourcing that you guys are doing. Are any of those services something that in theory you guys could bring in-house at some point to reduce your dependence on others to complete some of these studies?\nRonnie Morris: Yes. We could for some of them. I would say the biggest pressure on the gross margins was just some of the delayed studies and the repeating of studies, which we think we have a pretty good handle on now. And that goes to the mouse costs increase because we're using more mice to get the same amount of work done. So I think that those pressures on the gross margin are probably the largest pressures that I think in the next couple of months, certainly next couple of quarters, I think we're going to turn back around.\nMatt Hewitt: Got it. And then maybe one last one from me and I'll hop back in the queue. I think you were commenting on the biomarkers and some of the key hires that you were able to get there. You've seen an increase in the lead gen and your clinical bookings are improving. How should we be thinking about size of some of those types of studies? Are they bigger than your historical studies? Or just -- I know that they've got a longer lead time. So I'm just thinking theoretically, those should be larger, right?\nRonnie Morris: Yes. They come in all different sizes, primarily because for certain types of these clinical biomarkers, you first sign a study just to see the validation of an assay. And then if you successfully validate the assay and the biotech or pharma likes the assay and the way it's working, then they'll sign a larger study. So it comes -- or it's a validated assay and really then it's a larger study you're dealing with. So I think that they're all different sizes.  And from our perspective, I think it took us a couple of years to get our operations correct. Remember, we had talked many years about how it just took us longer to get the labs running efficiently with the right type of regulatory and operational efficiencies. We've accomplished that. The second part was to get the business development team that could actually go out and spread the word that we are in these services because this is a new service line for us. It's a relatively new service line for us, get the word out that the high quality we do in preclinical work, we can also do in clinical services as well. And that's why we're excited about these new key hires in the business development team because we think now we're going to be able to go out and spread the word and let people know the high-quality work that we do, which will lead to increased business, which we're already starting to see.\nMatt Hewitt: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The next question is coming from David Baron from Baron Capital. David, your line is live.\nDavid Baron: Good afternoon, Morris. I wanted to ask you a question about your hiring. I know that it's out there that the Champions is looking to hire. Are your results affecting your hiring goals? Are your hiring goals increasing? Or are they decreasing? And are these positions you're looking to fill more for entry level or higher level management in which you're seeking more seasoned employees?\nRonnie Morris: Yes. So we aren't -- we certainly have a couple of positions we're looking to hire, but we do not have a lot of positions looking to hire. We have a fairly good team. I mean when I say a good team, I mean we have a very good team in terms of quality of people. But we have a -- we're, I think fairly well positioned that I think we, at this point, considering certainly our history, we have very few positions available. So I'm not sure the question in terms of hiring, but I don't think our hiring has changed. We have a certain expectation for the bookings. We have a certain expectation for the work we want to do. And we have outfitted the organization to meet those expectations and certainly for like the scientific operation, like the ex vivo platform and the biomarkers. We have built a team that has excess capacity because we need that team in place. We need to be operationally efficient with good quality. And we expect that over the next year or two, we'll be able to fill it up, and we'll be able to continue to work efficiently. So I don't know that we have that many openings right now. We always have openings. There's always some bit of turnover, but I think we're hiring the same we've always hired.\nDavid Baron: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And there were no other questions from the lines at this time. I would now like to hand the call back to Dr. Morris for closing remarks.\nRonnie Morris: Thank you for joining us for our quarterly earnings call. A lot of good things happening at Champions Oncology. We're very excited about the drug discovery effort that we have. We're very excited about some of the new assays that we've been rolling out, especially our ex vivo assay. We continue to be excited about our in vivo work that we do. And clearly, the biomarker that we perform for biopharma. So in all areas, I think we continue to have an excellent reputation in the marketplace for doing good, high quality work.  We are scientifically inclined, collaborative. And I think those are all the recipes for continued success. So we look forward to discussing those with you on our next quarterly call. And thank you, everybody, and have a good afternoon. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
