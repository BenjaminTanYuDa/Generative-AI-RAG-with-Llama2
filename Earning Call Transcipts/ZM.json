And now, I would like to hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, David. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024. I'm joined today by Zoom's Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; and Zoom's CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.us. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that along with our earnings release include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025; our expectations regarding financial and business trends; impacts from the macroeconomic environment, our market position, opportunities, go-to-market initiatives, growth strategy and business aspirations; and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today's webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Hey. Thank you, Tom. Thank you everyone for joining us today. In FY ‘24, we made a tremendous amount of progress towards our mission of one platform delivering limitless human connection. As Generative AI began to take the world by storm, we listened carefully to customers in order to deliver AI that can best serve their needs, with innovation that is responsible, empowering, and built from the ground up in a way that permeates and unifies our entire platform. Zoom AI Companion, our generative AI assistant, empowers customers and employees with enhanced productivity, team effectiveness, and skills. Since, its launch only five months ago, we expanded AI Companion to six Zoom products, all included at no additional cost to licensed users. But we are far from done. Our future roadmap for AI is 100% guided by driving customer value. We are hard at work developing new AI capabilities to help customers achieve their unique business objectives and we'll have more to share in a month at Enterprise Connect. We hope to see you all there. Our expanding Contact Center suite is a unified, AI first solution that offers tremendous value to companies of all sizes seeking to strengthen customer relationships and deliver better outcomes. The base product includes AI Companion and our newly launched tiered pricing allows customers to add specialized CX capabilities such as AI Expert Assist, workforce management, quality management, virtual agent, and omnichannel support. Bolstered by its expanding features, our Contact Center suite is beginning to win in head-to-head competition with legacy incumbents. Beyond that, it is competing on its own merits with customers completely new to Zoom, broadening the funnel to the Zoom platform. As Zoom becomes a full workplace solution, we are seeing customers migrate from other chat products onto Zoom Team Chat, very excited. Over the past year, Zoom Team Chat usage has increased 130% across our paid accounts. And our migration tool, designed to simplify the transition, has seen a 4x increase in downloads in the last six months. Customers across industries are moving to Zoom Team Chat including a global supply chain leader, who has migrated over 1,200 users, a major law firm who has migrated 1,500 users, and a financial payments leader, who has moved over 2,000 users. Customers appreciate the improved user experiences and enhanced collaboration driven by our Zoom Team Chat product as well as the cost efficiencies realized by consolidating their communications and collaboration solutions onto Zoom. Last April, we acquired Workvivo and its integration into the Zoom interface has strengthened its market position. In Q4, we upsold a Fortune 10 company and long standing Zoom customer on Workvivo, making it Workvivo's biggest customer to date. And on the flipside, we also saw a global bank, who started as a Workvivo customer, adopt the broader Zoom platform. As you can see, adding new products both organically and inorganically creates a virtuous cycle, allowing us to sell more product into a larger base. We were very pleased to see Workvivo recognized as a leader by Magic Quadrant in its first report on Intranet Packaged Solutions. Similarly, Zoom Revenue Accelerator was recognized as a Strong Performer in The Forrester Wave in its first year of being covered, an amazing testament to its value as a powerful AI-enabled tool driving value for sales teams. FY ‘24 was a difficult year from a macro perspective and we faced those challenges head on. We became more disciplined and focused, while continuing to prioritize growth opportunities. As a result, we are much better positioned than we were one year ago. Our platform moat is deeper, our contact center offering is more robust, and our go-to-market teams are primed with defined goals and sharpened expertise to drive growth and empower our customers. Now, let's talk about some of our amazing customers. First, I'm so excited to welcome Broadcom, a global infrastructure technology leader, to the Zoom family. Recognizing the simplicity and ease of use of our expanding platform, they opted for the Zoom One Enterprise bundle to modernize the way they communicate and collaborate. Let me also thank Diageo, a leading global beverage company, for doubling down on Zoom. Seeing strong value from their existing Meetings, Phone and Rooms deployment, in Q4, they expanded to Zoom Contact Center and Zoom Virtual Agent. Let me also thank Community Financial Credit Union, a full-service financial cooperative, for investing in our broad Zoom One platform. They have chosen to modernize member engagement with Zoom Contact Center. Community Financial chose Zoom because of our one platform, video-first approach to solving all their communications needs. Zoom's integrations with key banking solutions through our APIs and partnerships were core to their decision making process. Finally, let me thank Convera, the World's FX payments leader. Zoom Phone was the foundation of their Zoom engagement and from there, they adopted the wider Zoom One platform in less than two years. Seeing the benefits of the tight integration of our products underpinned by AI Companion, they recently began to deeply leverage Zoom Team Chat in order to streamline their pre, during and post-meeting communication all within the Zoom Platform. Everything we do here is rooted in our culture of delivering happiness. This is why our employees, this is why the customer employees, this is why employees even more than IT departments are our biggest champions. And of course, happy employees are the most productive, so choosing Zoom becomes a win for everyone. We are laser-focused on our mission and could not be more optimistic about our future. The best is yet to come. And with that, I'll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a few of the financial highlights for FY ‘24. We were pleased with our strong finish to the year with Enterprise Revenue growing 9%, and free cash flow up 24%. We also achieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 39.2%, up 326 basis points from 35.9% in FY ‘23. In Q4, we saw traction in our emerging products, including a nearly 3x increase in Zoom Contact Center licenses as we not only added a significant number of new customers but also expanded average deal size. Zoom Phone customers with 10,000 or more seats grew 27% year-over-year to 95. And Zoom AI Companion has grown tremendously in just five months with over 510,000 accounts enabled and 7.2 million meeting summaries created as of the close of FY ‘24. We are excited about the strong growth across these new products and the benefits they drive for our customers. Now, let's dive into the financial results. In Q4, total revenue came in at $1.146 billion, up 3% year-over-year. This result was approximately $16 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue, up from 57% a year ago. We continued to see improvement in Online Average Monthly Churn, which decreased to 3% from 3.4% in Q4 of FY ‘23. This is consistent with the previous quarter and the lowest churn we have ever reported. The number of Enterprise customers grew 3% year-over-year to approximately 220,400. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q4 came in at 101%. We saw 10% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,810 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue. These customers represented 30% of revenue, up from 28% in Q4 of FY ’23. Our Americas revenue grew 4% year-over-year, while EMEA was flat and APAC declined by 3%. The international performance was partially due to the FX headwinds in APAC as well as the impact from our sales reorganization in early FY ‘24 that took longer to complete internationally than domestically. Moving to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on strategic investments, income tax benefits from discrete activities, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 79.2%, which was slightly lower than 79.8% in Q4 of last year, mainly due to our investment in AI Companion. In FY ‘25, we expect our gross margin to be approximately 79%, reflecting focused investments in our AI features. Over the course of FY ‘25, we expect to directionally improve gross margin towards our long-term target of 80% as we continue to optimize our data center strategy and grow some of our higher ASP products like Zoom Contact Center. Non-GAAP income from operations grew by 10% year-over-year to $444 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $414 million. This translates to a 38.7% non-GAAP operating margin for Q4, an improvement from 36.2% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share in Q4 was $1.42, on approximately 313 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.27 above the high end of our guidance and $0.20 higher than Q4 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.27 billion, down approximately 3% from Q4 of last year. This was roughly 3 percentage points better than the high end of the range we provided last quarter. For Q1, we expect deferred revenue to be down 4% to 5% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO increased 4% year-over-year to approximately $3.57 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 58% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 56% in Q4 of last year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 66% year-over-year to $351 million. Free cash flow grew 81% year-over-year to $333 million. The sharp increase in our cash flow metrics was due to stronger collections, targeted expense management and higher interest income. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins expanded to 30.6% and 29%, respectively. We ended the quarter with approximately $7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Turning to guidance. As we consider our view for Q1 and FY ‘25, we have not assumed any changes in the macroeconomic outlook. For Q1, we expect revenue to be approximately $1.125 billion. This incorporates two fewer days in Q1 and would represent approximately 1.8% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $410 million to $415 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.18 to $1.20 based on approximately 316 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY ‘25, we expect revenue to be approximately $4.6 billion, which represents approximately 1.6% year-over-year growth. We expect Q2 to be the low point from a year-over-year growth perspective and to accelerate from there. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion representing an operating margin of approximately 37.5%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share for FY ‘25 is $4.85 to $4.88, based on approximately 321 million shares outstanding. For FY ‘25, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.44 billion to $1.48 billion. We believe that our strong cash flow generation and financial discipline coupled with responsible capital allocation is a powerful combination. As indicated in our earnings press release today, our board has authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program that we will start executing this quarter. This not only underscores the confidence our board and management team have in the future of Zoom, but also allows us to leverage our strong profitability, cash flow and balance sheet to drive shareholder returns, while also allowing us the flexibility to consider M&A options to accelerate growth and deliver for our customers. As a note, the share count and EPS metrics in our guide do not account for the impacts from this repurchase program. To echo what Eric said, we are optimistic about where we are now and where we are going. Our competitive position, innovation engine, and customer base set us up for success in FY ‘25 and beyond. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors for your trust and support. Before closing, I would like to thank just one more person for their support over the years. Our head of IR, Tom McCallum has decided to retire this Summer after a seasoned 25-year IR career. Tom, it's been an honor and a pleasure to work with you. You have contributed tremendously to Zoom's success since before our IPO and will be dearly missed. Thank you so much for all you have done and congratulations. I am pleased to announce that Charles Eveslage, who has worked with Tom and me for several years now, will assume the role. With Charles at the helm, we are confident that the investment community will continue to receive a high level of service from Zoom's IR team. Please hold your goodbyes for Tom for now as he will be with us until mid-year to ensure a smooth transition. With that, David, please queue up the first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Kelly. As Kelly mentioned, we will now move into the Q&A session. When I call your name, please turn on your video and unmute. As a reminder, in an effort to hear from everyone please limit yourself to one question. And our first question comes from William Power with Baird.\nWilliam Power: Okay. Great. Thanks. I guess -- well, Kelly said to hold this for Tom, but Tom wanted to say thank you for your help over the years. Kelly, maybe to kick it off with you, as we look at guidance, maybe just talk about what's providing confidence of the year-over-year growth should trough in Q2 if I heard you right? How do we think about the key drivers then to perhaps accelerate year-over-year growth in the back-half of the year and perhaps into fiscal '26 and how do we think about that trajectory over the ensuing 18 months maybe as we get past that.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So when you think about your coming down in Q2, but then accelerating in the back half. This is the culmination of what we've been talking about for a while, which is the growth being driven by Zoom Phone, by Zoom Contact Center, which we've seen continue to mature by the effect that AI and adoption of Team Chat are having on the overall retention metrics of the company. So, all of those factors are what gives us that confidence that we're going to see it come down in Q2, but then start to reaccelerate after that. And then I mean, it's very early to comment on FY '26, but that would be an indicator that exit-rate for FY '25 would be an indicator for FY '26.\nWilliam Power: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Meta.\nMeta Marshall: Thanks. Just wanted to ask maybe just in terms of, on the deferred revenue in the past quarter, you mentioned that deferred revenue would kind of be down this quarter or we saw it come down. And just wondering, last quarter you talked about the terms that you were seeing, people extending their deals come in a little bit, just any trends that you're seeing just in terms of renewals. And what you're kind of seeing in terms of renewal there in terms of products that they're adding but just also maybe term compression, they might be seeing. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, we've continued to see strength in renewals are, huge thanks to our renewals team in Q4 actually did an amazing job of exceeding their target, which was great to see. And what we have seen is the continued trend of our customers wanting shorter payment terms, they're hanging on to their cash. Remember, we talked about this in Q3, but that's really what contributes to the decrease in deferred. And then the other thing is the timing of renewals. We are seeing customers not necessarily wait to their renewal period to start these discussions. For example, I renewed -- I reviewed a proposal today for a customer that's not going to renew for six months. So, customers are really thinking ahead about their contracts and being very thoughtful about this. And what that does, it creates some variability in both the RPO and the deferred, because it's very sensitive to the timing of these things.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ethan Bruck from Wolfe Research.\nEthan Bruck: Hey, guys. Congrats on these results, and I'm asking a question on behalf of Alex here.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Ethan.\nEthan Bruck: So. I guess my question would just be a little bit back on the guidance for fiscal '25, just if you can give some puts and takes, I know you said you're not factoring macro improvement. But how should we think about both the enterprise and online piece, I know you guys are rolling out some pricing increases. So maybe how to factor that going into numbers for next year. And just also the NRR piece, maybe roughly when you're expecting that to trough, Is there any color on that would be great?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So in terms of the enterprise of the direct sales organization, we kind of touched on this in the prepared remarks, but they're off to a fast start this year, we're really excited about that. If you remember last year, we had not only the overall reduction in the company, but the sales reorganization, which took a lot of time for the organization to recover from frankly and so, seeing them well-positioned to start off this year strong is really exciting to see. And that's certainly going to contribute to the overall growth that we're expecting to see, especially in the back half of the year. And then from an online perspective, really pleased for example with the Q3 churn metric. I think considering that we typically see seasonally higher churn in Q2 and Q4, that churn rate falling from Q3 to Q4 at that lowest rate of 3.0 is really indicative of all the improvements that the team has made to the platform, the ongoing initiatives they put in place. And so all of those considerations is what gives us confidence around the FY '25 guide.\nEthan Bruck: Got it. That makes sense. Just a quick follow-up is just around some of the AI, like you are successfully embedding it across the platform. I'm just curious, as we think about kind of the monetization angles over the next few years. I mean if you were to stack rank where you think the combination of moving users to higher SKUs matching price-value, you guys are obviously already doing or getting folks to adopt more products on the upsell side in the contact center, for example, curious how you guys are thinking about that right now.\nEric Yuan: I can take it. So -- and we're monetizing on many fronts. You look at our Zoom AI Companion, right, so first of all. for our existing customers because they all like the value we created to generate a meeting summary, meeting query and so and so forth, because of that we do really do not -- customers they are trying to review the cost. That's why we do not charge customers for those features. However, a lot of areas we can monetize, in order to take our AI Companion for an example, enterprise customers, how to leverage enterprise customer directionally a sure source data and also to build the -- tailor the Zoom AI Companion for those customers sort of like a customized Zoom AI Companion and we can monetize. And also look at all those services and maybe I'll just take a contact center for example, we're offering Zoom Virtual Agent and that's the one we have to monetize and recently, we announced three tears in our Zoom Contact Center product. The last one is a per agent and per month, we charge $149, the reason why? There are few features, one of the feature is Zoom Expert Assist. But all of those features are empowered by AI features, not to mention, we're also going to build new services and are driven by Zoom AI Companion as well. I think this year, I mean we're going to be doubling down on Zoom AI Companion customization and also focus on monetization. That's our effort.\nEthan Bruck: Got it. Thank you, guys, and congrats on the results.\nEric Yuan: Appreciate it. Say hello to Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Thank you for taking the question and apologies for the quality, I'm in transit at the moment. Wanted to ask you about the recently announced buyback $1.5 billion is impressive, 7% of your shares outstanding. But, I guess how did you kind of come up with that number, and does that signal anything about the size of potential M&A that you're hoping to do, anything that you can just share in terms of why now, and the decision process would be helpful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So, we've talked about this many times in the past, every quarter we have this discussion about capital allocation with our Board, of course, with Eric, and with $7 billion sitting on our balance sheet today and the strength of our cash flow outlook for FY '25, we feel confident that having an authorization in place does not preclude us and still provides us plenty of flexibility to do M&A transactions that we might see as exciting in the future. And we continue to look for any opportunities that make sense to bring another organization to the Zoom portfolio. And we were targeting an amount that would approximately offset potentially most of the dilution for FY '25 and that's how we were thinking about it. Of course, you did that quick calculation and math but there's always variability in the execution of these programs and we will be looking -- the way that we execute it is we set an approximate amount, we want to acquire every single quarter. So we'll be evaluating this as we move through the year this year.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Tom Blakey from KeyBanc.\nTom Blakey: Thanks everyone. Good to see you, Eric, and Kelly and congratulations on the, I'll say, early retirement, Tom. Just point of clarification first, Kelly, on I think Meta was asking about 2Q in the guide. And you mentioned something about being that, were you implying just point of clarification that fiscal 2Q would be down quarter-on-quarter from fiscal 1Q?\nKelly Steckelberg: We're saying that the year-over-year growth rate in Q2 will decline as compared to the year-over-year growth rate in Q1. Yes, it will be positive. It won't be -- It's not going to go negative based on our current outlook, but it will be lower than the year-over-year growth rate in Q1.\nTom Blakey: Sorry for the handholding there.\nKelly S. Steckelberg: No, it's okay.\nTom Blakey: My key question would be on CCaaS, it sounds like you're off to a great start. There's a lot of demand out there. Hearing from your peers. I'd love to just give you the opportunity to talk about pricing, uptake of some of the Virtual Agent, Agent Assist functionality and maybe any type of what you've baked into fiscal '25 in terms of visibility here as you come out very strong here in the fourth-quarter -- in the fiscal '25. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, do you want to talk about the Contact Center in general for a minute first?\nEric Yuan: Sure, absolutely. I think Tom you may not know actually, recently I got a new job here at Zoom, I become the Contact Center General Manager of the product management team engineers and our go-to-market team, sales, marketing, they all reporting to me directly. That means huge opportunity ahead of us, why I want to wear another ahead of GM of Contact Center. Seriously, but anyway, so based on customer feedback, very, very positive. We're doing extremely well in every quarter, and Q4 number is amazing and plus the reason why we have confidence introduced like three tiers of pricing, because a lot of customers told us, right. They probably needed a basic contact solutions. The $69 per agent, very competitive, all of the features, or if they want some social channel maybe outbound dialer, they can pay another $30 more per agent. And for a huge enterprise customer want to buy 1,000 agents, and we give them Zoom export Assist and also Workforce Management and Employee Management all of the features, you can see Zoom has become a full suite of Contact Center offering. We can compete head-to-head to the legacy incumbents. I'll give one example, in Zoom, we internally we deployed our Virtual Agent, guess what, every month, we saved 400,000 agent hours. And more than 90% inbound inquiries can be done by our Virtual Agent driven by the AI technology, I'm very excited about everything we're doing. And the feedback are very positive. Again we're going to be doubling down, tripling down on our Contact Center offering because that's a modern solution, AI empowered video first and also we build a full suite. That's why we're so excited.\nKelly Steckelberg: Based on your enthusiasm, Eric, I am going to raise your quota.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. I raise the quota to the system every day. So, there's no difference, so.\nTom Blakey: And Kelly, look what kind of outlook, are you baking in terms of the strength there and the visibility commentary about fiscal '25 and then is that -- this is just enterprise right now, right. This is that no self-service online here, right?\nKelly Steckelberg: Correct.\nEric Yuan: Not yet, but -- yeah, you're right on. See, thank you for helping us to monetize Contact Center in other ways.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So, Tom, we looked at the trends that we've been seeing the number of customers, the growth rate, the size of the deals, which have been expanding over the last several quarters. And just -- and of course, sales capacity and taking all of that in consideration, including the new pricing tiers. That's how we built our outlook for FY '25.\nTom Blakey: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question here. Tom, congrats on the announcement and Eric, good luck with the increased quota from Kelly now. Kelly, just going back to a couple of questions ago, on how to think about the quantitative approach here on past or future price increases on the guide for this year? And for Eric, what's causing customers to move over to the Zoom chat function and off your main competitor like Teams, just further consolidation on the one platform or is it AI Companion playing a larger role here, especially as you guys are concluding it as opposed to $30, $35 a month. Thanks guys.\nEric Yuan: Kelly, you want to take the first one.\nKelly Steckelberg: No, You go ahead. You go ahead first.\nEric Yuan: Sure. So James one thing I think we did not do well, as I mentioned even before is, we did not do well on marketing front. A lot of customers, users, they do not know Zoom has a greater presence in Team Chat functionality at no additional cost. And it works is extremely well. All the key features any other competitor's product they have also have that as well. Very well-integrated with Zoom product. And a plus as new side, you also right on customers they see using their Chat solution, they want to use AI. Let's see, I send you -- James, I send you a message, I want to leverage AI, send a long message, however, if you use the other solutions sometimes other solutions itself even with all AI is not free, right. And in our case, not only our core functionalities, but also AI Companion built in also at no additional cost. I can use it for any users, customers, you already have a meeting license, Zoom Team Chat is already built in, all of the core features, you can use Zoom AI Companion and also let AI write a chat message and as so on and so forth, it works well at no additional cost. The total cost of ownership of a Zoom Team Chat is much better than any other team-tailored solutions and also we built in a native client, not like some other competitors, the web-based client, sometimes like I am using Mac and performance so on and so forth is really not good in [indiscernible] experience. That's the reason why more and more customers, they discovered Zoom team share capabilities, wow, why not move to Zoom platform, they give the Team Chat functionalities at no additional cost, right. That's the reason why we have confidence. I hope more and more customers are going to move to a Zoom Team Chat and will also built a very seamless migration tool as well to have a customer migrate to Zoom Team Chat.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric. In terms of the price increases, James, so certainly be online price increases that we talked about last call, and they were implemented in Q4 are in all of our forward-looking guidance. And then the renewals team as they're talking to our customer about renewals where there are opportunities for price increases, we've seen those trends over the last few quarters have been doing that and that would also show up in the pipeline that the team has out there. So in that context, it's also been considered.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. By the way, James and all, all the analysts that are here. If you are logging with the Zoom client, my email address and we can create a Zoom Team Chat group, and let's get a first-hand experience, how powerful it is. So it's very easy.\nKelly Steckelberg: You can have one-on-one access to Eric, James. [Multiple Speakers]\nJames Fish: Sounds good, Eric, don't worry. I won't annoy you too much.\nEric Yuan: Awesome. Thank you, James.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I guess one more on the Contact Center. Curious in terms of how the mix is maybe different with channel involvement and partners being involved in those deals over the last couple of months as you really invested in the channel program. And then secondarily, what is the mix of I guess, the contact center sales into existing customers especially existing Zoom Phone customers, is that any different than the early days of Zoom Phone in terms of mix? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So, Kelly, feel free to chime in. I think for the core meeting product, by and large is directly driven and Zoom Phone is mix via direct and channel driven. You look at it as Contact Center product, for sure we have a Zoom Contact under specialist here, but I think primarily driven by a lot of, and very well-established third-party agents, right and those are channel partners for they already have great relationships. We have to invest into that area. So, this is the reason why a lot of deals are brought to us by those channel partners, some of them even never used it and they are not Zoom Meeting customers, but also they have become the first Zoom Contact Center customers. So that's kind of a channel and also the Zoom Contact Center specialist. Also at the same time, because Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center are integrated very well and also we're training all those Zoom Phone specialists also o become Zoom Contact Center specialists, right, to further help our work internal net sales capacity as well and I think that overall and you look at the revenue trajectory and Kelly, correct me if I'm wrong, is very similar to our Zoom Phone. And hopefully, after I become GM, maybe we can build that as well, so -- and anyway, so that's where we are now, so.\nKelly Steckelberg: The only thing that I would add to that is, that we're very excited, we hired Chris Morrissey in November. He is a veteran in this space. So really excited to have his talents here at Zoom. And then one other thing to note, which has been interesting about Contact Center is we actually have seen customers -- new customers coming for Zoom Contact Center. So it's also an opportunity to start to bring, expose the platform to new prospects and customers as they're really excited about this really modern technology that we have in Zoom Contact Center.\nMatthew VanVliet: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. By the way, Chris reports to me directly, he came from NICE, inContact.\nMatthew VanVliet: All right. Great. Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi Siti.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my [Technical Difficulty] So I wanted other growth driver you have, phone. From the phone side, so help us understand, like what's your penetration right now within the installed base on the phone side. And any update in terms of whether a number of states or revenue you have by end of this fiscal year.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we are really excited about the ongoing strength and growth in Zoom Phone. The -- in terms of the opportunity ahead even internally, the penetration rate for deal attach is still under, I think, 20%. So, that just highlights, there is also a greenfield even within our existing Zoom customer base and the metric that we gave this quarter was that customers with greater than 10,000 seats increased 11% year-over-year, or 27% -- sorry 11% quarter-over-quarter, 27% year-over-year to 95. So, seeing lots of strength in that high-end of the customer base, which we're really excited about and we didn't give a seat count metric this quarter, it's probably something that we'll do in the next quarter or two.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you.\nOperator: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Eric, thank you. Maybe going back to the Contact Center piece and trying to loop in the AI Expert Assist side, when you're when you're seeing customers come in, are they adopting the premium tiers off the bat and do you have a sense of whether the usage of Expert Assist is picking up as a result or is this something that we should think of as a future upsell driver as customers kind of land maybe at the low-end, and then expand over time.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. That's a good question. The reason why we introduced the multi-tiers in Contact Center because if we really look at it from a cost perspective, each customer has reported a dip in the demands or requirements and sometimes they do not care about social media channel, right. And they just need core functionalities, right. Just a few 100 assist and then migrate from other cloud-based upon contact center solution really do not need a Workforce Management or Quality Management, right. That's the reason why we have three tiers now, right. And quite often follow the SMB customer. I think that Zoom Contact Center essentials is good enough, right and we talk with customers with more than 1,000 agents, for sure they would like to have those AI Expert Assist and our Workforce Management or Quality Management and so on so forth, right. That's the reason why because in customer demand, we have multiple tiers and our Contact Center specialists and also partners -- channel partners, working together, right. Based on customer demand, we offer different tiers. We might introduce more in the future. We do not know, but again we look at everything from customer perspective, that's the reason why based on those multi-tier packages, you can see that, with demand coming from every segment, SMB customers, lot of enterprise customers and it's very healthy, so.\nKelly Steckelberg: And just further to what Eric said, the packages are off to a really great start. We've had approximately 3,700 licenses sold in those upper tiers and the ASP for those is double what our existing ASP was before we introduced those additional tiers. So it really shows you how this is going to not only address the broader market, but also accelerate our revenue growth here.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. It used to be a little bit over 50 now it is 100, this is great result, so.\nArjun Bhatia: Great to hear. Awesome. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Imtiaz Koujalgi with Wedbush.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Imtiaz.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Hi. How are you? Thanks for taking my question. I've a question on the guide for next year. Kelly, how do we think about the breakdown between enterprise growth and online for next year, should we see online start growing year-over-year in '25?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We aren't going to give specific guidance for the segments. But we're really focused on continuing to have stabilization in the online segment, what you saw happen again this quarter is actually both quarter -- both segments were slightly up in Q4, which was great to see and really focusing on the initiatives to drive basically stabilization is how I would think about for FY '25 and the online segment.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Got it. Thanks. And then one follow-up for Eric. Eric, you mentioned increasing deal sizes for Contact Center. Can you compare when a customer buys Zoom Phone and buys Zoom Contact Center, are the deal sizes a lot different or similar because the ASP is a lot higher for Contact Center, but I'm guessing the seat count is lower. How does the seat -- the deal values compare between Phone and Contact Center.\nEric Yuan: I think it's good question. I think for sure I do not think and compare that with Zoom Phone as Zoom Contact Center as and when we started normally is hey have a lot of cost, but the average deal size is relatively small. Now you see the average size of a deal is bigger -- greater and greater, right, this is much better than before. And from that perspective, it's very different in comparison for Zoom Phone. That's the reason why you look at it our Zoom and the three package, right. And earlier the package is behind, I think is $49 per user per month -- per agent per month, it is much bigger than Zoom Phone, right. That's the reason why I think in terms of pricing it is very different. We see that more and more medium and large customers adopt Zoom Contact Center, you can see the average deal size is much bigger and we do not [Technical Difficulty] number of the sales, number of customers but focus on the size of customers, that's very healthy.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Matthew Bullock with Bank of America.\nMatthew Bullock: Hi, Eric, and Kelly. Thanks for the question. I'll be asking one -- we have a microphone today regarding Zoom's progress and roadmap for Contact Center product development. Can you provide an update on the company's near-term priorities in terms of functionality improvement. And then the longer term where is the company's focus to better position the offering for large-scale enterprise deployments? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Great. So first of all, I want to tell you from architecture perspective, we are ready already for bigger, very, very big aligning with customers in terms of number of concrete agents, and we did a test, it works well. For now, but just focus on the future set. Again, we already have lots of features, most of the customers they can deploy Zoom Contact Center without any problem either migrate from legacy contact center solutions providers or migrated from the other cloud solution providers. In terms of new features, I think in next few quarters, like one big feature is PCI compliance, right. We need to support that. And also how to support channel partners, right, and also all of those features, may not be the core features but also like PCI compliance and also the support of the channel partners, right. All of those features, sort of like enterprise-related. So, and we're also working on that and also some like Workforce Management and Quality Management further enhance that and also add a lot of AI features as well. I think, as you can see, in the core feature set already is there, we just need to add a few here and there and I think we are almost 100% ready. Like even for social media channel we already support and the other -- like in the social media channel, how to support more the channels like WhatsApp, right. How to add a WhatsApp there. It is just some corner feature here and is there in the next few quarters. And that's team working very hard on that.\nMatthew Bullock: So, super helpful. Thank you.\nMatthew Bullock: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Mark, are you there? Okay, will move ahead, it's alright.\nKelly Steckelberg: [Multiple Speakers] Excuse me, he just came off mute, there you go.\nEric Yuan: Hi, Mark.\nUnidentified Participant: Sorry about that. This is [indiscernible] on for Mark Murphy. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on all the milestones. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about how AI Companion is into your Contact Center suite of solutions. In our discussions with industry contacts, those sort of applications for gen AI have been pretty scaled -- pretty strong and a lot of customer interest. Are you guys seeing a similar pattern with the customers, is that an area where you're seeing kind of an outsized interest to utilization of AI tool? Thanks.\nEric S. Yuan: Yes. I think it's very similar. I mean, you look at a Zoom meeting product, customers discovered the Zoom AI Companion to help you with a meeting summary and after they discover that feature, and they would like to adopt that. Contact Center is exactly same thing. And like Virtual Agent, Zoom Expert Assist, those are AI features, manager can understand what's going on in real time and also agent can leverage AI to get real time knowledge base and any update about these customers. All these AI features can dramatically improve the agent efficiency, right, that's the reason why it's kind of we're not take a much longer time for those agents to realize the value of AI features, because it is kind of very easy to use and I think the most adopting, I feel like Carnegie Center AI adopt rate probably faster than the other features, so called services.\nUnidentified Participant: Thank you very much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark.\nMatthew Harrigan: I'm sorry, I actually wasn't -- I didn't have my hand up. But since you asked, do you have any thoughts on the relative macro strength you're seeing in different markets pacific rim, Japan obviously, Buffett was just extolling the virtues of Japan, it is an investment area right now, Europe, U.S., etc. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We agree, we see Japan as certainly a very important market for us and it is a core focus for FY '25 is reinvesting and reinvigorating our go-to-market teams in both EMEA and APAC. We have new leadership in some of those markets and are really excited again about the quick start the teams being in market and we're ready to go and look forward to great things from them this year.\nMatthew Harrigan: I'm very facile of that mute button, since I was even expecting being called on, so I probably -- I should get brownie points for that.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Good job. Good to see you, Matthew. Thank you.\nMatthew Harrigan: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Weed with Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you very much. I really appreciate all the detail and it's obviously pretty exciting news to see all the expansion opportunities going on with the enterprise customers, along with kind of maybe a fore coming in with the Online customer groups. I guess two follow-ups, got around the enterprise customers. I don't think you commented on how churn is evolving with those customers. And obviously, with continued tailing NRR. I'm trying to unpack what portion of that coming from churn versus what portion of that is coming from the kind of continued refresh cycle you have with like long-tenured customers that are still coming down on seats. And then the second part is kind of you look through on that NRR and you're talking about some acceleration going on later this year and I think that's starting to mixed in and customers that no longer those long tenure that has seats coming down and it's really being replaced by those that expansion is really in functionality is coming in. If you look at those customers that are kind of past their seat readjustment how expansive are those customers that we can maybe, look forward to out a year or so being a greater portion of the mix.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So it's a really good point here. So we've talked about this a few times, but in FY '24, we know -- we saw that the majority of our customers had a renewal event. So they had the opportunity to work with us as they needed to potentially right size their seat count. Again, our renewals team has done an amazing job of taking the opportunity to talk to them about the opportunity to upgrade to Zoom One, to potentially add-in Zoom Phone or additional products. So, maintaining that spend. So we've seen some shifting around in terms of the overall portfolio, but really focused on maintaining that spend, and what that does is it really situates us very well as those customers start to grow again that the customers are now sitting in different SKUs that potentially are more retentive. And also at a higher price point, honestly, that they can grow into. As they start adding seats again, we do see there's going to be a much lower percentage of our customers that are up for renewal this year that didn't have a renewal event last year. So, we've seen again the majority of our customers, if they had something to work through in terms of rightsizing, we've seen the majority of them had the opportunity to do that in FY '24, so we expect that to have a much lower impact in FY '25.\nPeter Weed: And the churn side of it. How much of the roll-off and NRR is because churn has gone up or is it continuing to be what it has always been on the enterprise side pretty stable?\nKelly Steckelberg: It's been pretty stable. We did -- we've talked about, these customers that we're rightsizing. You saw -- given the reduction that we saw across our customer base and you saw generally in organizations last year there was some impact for that, but the churn rate themselves have been pretty stable. And you remember that our net RR number is a trailing 12-month metric. So you're likely going to see a little more decline in that metric before it starts to reaccelerate again along with our revenue that we're expecting to see at the back half of this year.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Shelby Seyrafi with FBN Securities.\nShelby Seyrafi: Yeah. Thank you very much. So adjusted for the two fewer days in Q1, you're guiding for a 3.6% -- 4% growth in Q1 and for the year, you're guiding for about 1.5% growth. I know you are bottoming Q2 but it seems like with a reasonable projection still going to be like 2% growth roughly half the 4% growth in Q1 in the back half of the year, you're going to have these new products ramping, the Phone, the Contact Center, AI, etc. I'm trying to understand why you don't expect an adjusted revenue growth acceleration in the back half instead of the implied deceleration, I get in my model.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We do -- we are guiding to 1.8% in Q1. So that's the outlook that we're giving. If you're backing into something different, but the guidance that we're giving is a reminder is 1.8% and then 1.6% for the full year, with the decline that we're expecting from a year-over-year growth perspective in Q2.\nShelby Seyrafi: Let me be clear, but Q1 has a 1.8% hit from the two fewer days. So adjusted for that is 3.6% growth in Q1, right. So apples-to-apples 3.6 goes down something like 1 or 2 in the back half of the year and you have new products ramping in the back half of the year. So, I am trying to [Multiple Speakers] on that.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are not assuming any improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook and/or changes significantly in terms of our international contribution. So all of that combined, we're taking what we believe to be an appropriately prudent outlook for the year.\nShelby Seyrafi: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Rosenblatt Securities.\nCatharine Trebnick: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Much appreciate it.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Catharine.\nCatharine Trebnick: So back to the Contact Center, to beat a dead horse, it seems like there is this -- a lot of the Information I gathered was there's a big push for light contact centers and it seems that Zoom fits it quite well with your pricing model. And when I say light, I mean those are non-agents versus agents. So, we've like a split for the quarter that you were willing to share that would be agent versus non-agent. I'm just trying to get a good handle on that growth outside the traditional agents for a license because there seems to be a good opportunity there.\nEric Yuan: I think direction-wise, you're still right. And on the one hand for the real human agent they still need a modern contact center solution while working hard on that to replace legacy vendor solutions or other cloud-based solutions. On the other hand and if it is more and more demand I think on the customers, they are not going a human agent anymore, right. can have a virtual agent. I think that is the reason we also sell Zoom Virtual Agent as well. I think maybe in the next few quarters and maybe ready to disclose that, for now I do not think we are ready to disclose that number, but we focus on both side and either you do not have more agent, you can have the AI. This is good or you can buy agents, that's okay too. So -- and that's our plan.\nCatharine Trebnick: All right. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Peter Levine with Evercore.\nPeter Levine: Well, great, thanks for squeezing me. And I'll just give you a quick. Kelly, your comments on M&A, can you share with us what you're thinking in terms of inorganic contributions, but what area would you consider is at CCaaS, is it like workflow optimization, you have got collaboration, but any sense on kind of where you're thinking or how you're thinking about adding to the portfolio. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We've been exploring opportunities actually across all of those areas, Peter, we look for opportunities to either accelerate what we already have, which would obviously be in the CCaaS space and a good example is, what we did in the past with Solvvy around our Zoom Virtual Agent product or something that sits a little bit next to it which Workvivo is a great example of that as well. So we're continuing to look in areas both within our current portfolio as well as around us with things like productivity tools. That's how we're thinking about. Eric, is there anything you want to add?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. You're just right on, just either technology-driven or just expand on the cap[ph] or maybe double down on our existing services. Pretty much those three things. We're interested in all three.\nPeter Levine: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. We only have time for one more question and that comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thanks for taking me. Kelly, maybe expanding on your comments on the sales side and the reorg, how do you feel about your productivity in North America and internationally, and when you look at investing this year, where are you putting the most effort?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So you saw in our results for Q3 and Q4 that we had reacceleration and sales productivity in the back half of FY '24, and again, off to a really fast start for FY '25. So excited about that. We are investing in both direct and channel on a global basis, as it's really important that we keep fueling the growth driver that we have here in North America, but also reinvesting and reinvigorating our international markets as well.\nGeorge Iwanyc: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A and. I would now like to pass things back to Eric for closing comments.\nEric Yuan: Well, thank you all for your support and thank you all for your time. Really appreciate it. And see you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Again, this concludes today's release. We thank you all for your participation -- from our family to yours. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Well, hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's Q3 FY '24 Earnings Release Webinar. As a reminder, today's webinar is being recorded. And now, I will hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations. Tom, over to you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Kelcey. Hello everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the third quarter of FY ’24. I’m joined today by Zoom’s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, and Zoom’s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.us. Also, on this page you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding financial and business trends; impacts from the macroeconomic environment, our market position, opportunities, go-to-market initiatives, growth strategy and business aspirations; and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today’s webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Hey. Thank you, Tom. Thank you everyone for joining us today. In early October, we hosted Zoomtopia, our yearly customer and innovation-focused event, and it was awesome. Like last year, we ran it hybrid on Zoom Events, thousands joined us in person and many multiples of that virtually. Among the in person attendees were 40 customer presenters such as JP Morgan, MIT, Boston Consulting Group, HubSpot and Kohls, who spoke about their amazing experiences on Zoom and excitement about the future. We also showcased newly-released innovations like Zoom AI Companion, as well as Zoom AI Expert Assist and Quality Management for the Contact Center. Zoom AI Companion is especially noteworthy for being included at no additional cost to our paid plans, and has fared tremendously well with over 220,000 accounts enabling it and 2.8 million meeting summaries created as of today. Remarkable growth in less than three months. At Zoomtopia, I also had the pleasure of sharing the stage with Flex, a global manufacturing and supply chain leader, who spoke about how they use Zoom to connect their large, distributed workforce of 170,000 employees across 30 countries. Flex started using Zoom Meetings in 2017, quickly followed by Rooms and Team Chat. Since then, Flex increased Team Chat users by 200% and Zoom Rooms by 245%. They also became power users of Zoom Whiteboard, creating over 13,000 Whiteboards. And moving to Zoom Phone allowed them to eliminate 50 to 70% of circuits and infrastructure across the globe, and reduce total cost of ownership. We were so happy to have Flex share their journey at Zoomtopia, and it cannot wait for what is in store for our partnership next. Now moving on to some of our customer wins in Q3. First, let me thank Dropbox, who has been an amazing customer for many years starting with Meetings and then extending to Rooms, Phone and Events. In Q3, they selected Zoom Virtual Agent and Zoom Contact Center to provide world-class AI-enabled support to their global user base. Let me also thank Amynta Group, a premier insurance services company, who initially adopted Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center on a limited scale in Q1 of this year. Seeing how our modern solution offered superior agility, customization for CX flows and administrative functionality. In Q3, they decided to standardize their customer-facing sales support on the Zoom stack and add Workforce Management, leading to a nearly 5 times increase in their monthly spend with us. I’d also like to congratulate the Virgin Group on their launch of Workvivo to bring together 60,000 employees across almost 40 Virgin companies on one platform. The Virgin Family Workvivo platform is helping to drive social connection, encourage collaboration and boost brand knowledge. It’s inspiring to see how the Virgin Group is bringing the platform to life and strengthening culture with Zoom’s Workvivo. These wins are a testament to the investments we are making in our customer experience offering, with the rapid pace of new innovations like Workforce Management, Quality Management, Zoom Virtual Agent and AI Expert Assist. They also highlight our progress with employee experience, especially with integrating Workvivo into the Zoom client. Thank you so much to Dropbox, Amynta and Virgin Group. I love you all. And with that I’ll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric and hello, everyone. We are pleased that we beat our top-line and profitability guidance in Q3. Here are a few milestones: First, Zoom Phone reached approximately 7 million paid seats. Second, Zoom Contact Center reached approximately 700 customers as of quarter-end, while Zoom Virtual Agent customers nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter. And finally, the number of customers on Zoom One bundles that include Zoom Phone grew approximately 330% year-over-year. These proof points demonstrate our customers’ willingness to entrust us with their critical CX and EX processes, and their commitment to grow with us as we expand our platform. In Q3, total revenue came in at $1.137 billion, up 3% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. This result was approximately $17 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise business grew 8% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue, up from 56% a year ago. We continued to see improvement in Online Average Monthly Churn, which decreased to 3.0% from 3.1% in Q3 of FY ‘23. This is the lowest churn we have ever reported. The number of Enterprise customers grew 5% year-over-year to approximately 219,700. Our trailing 12 month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q3 came in at 105%. We saw 14% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,731 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 29% of revenue, up from 27% in Q3 of FY ‘23. Our Americas revenue grew 5% year-over-year, while EMEA, APAC declined by 2%, each. On a constant currency basis, APAC grew slightly year-over-year Moving to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on strategic investments, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 79.7%, an improvement from 79.5% in Q3 of last year, but slightly lower than the first half of this year. The strong performance in gross margin was primarily driven by the optimization of usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers, partially offset by our additional investments in new AI technologies. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 80%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 17% to $447 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $405 million. This translates to a 39.3% non-GAAP operating margin, a meaningful improvement from 34.6% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.29, on approximately 310 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.20 above the high end of our guidance and $0.22 higher in Q3 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.32 billion, down approximately 3% from Q3 of last year. This was roughly 1 percentage point better than the high end of the guidance we provided last quarter. For Q4, we expect deferred revenue to be down 6$ to 8% year-over-year, partially driven by shorter billing frequencies on Enterprise deals arising from the high interest rate environment. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO increased 10% year-over-year to approximately $3.6 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 58% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 59% in Q3 of last year, indicating lengthening contract durations on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, our renewal seasonality peaks in Q1 and declines throughout the rest of the year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 67% year-over-year to $493 million. Free cash flow grew 66% year-over-year to $453 million. The sharp increase in our cash flow metrics was due to stronger collections, targeted expense management and higher interest income. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins expanded to 43.4% and 39.9%, respectively. Turning to guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.13 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth. Adjusting for currency impact, this projection is slightly higher than the previously implied guidance from our Q2 call. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $409 million to $414 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.13 to $1.15 based on approximately 312 million shares outstanding. We are also pleased to raise our top-line and profitability outlook for the full year of FY ‘24. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.506 billion to $4.511 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 3% year-over-year growth. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.745 billion representing an operating margin of approximately 39%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share for FY ‘24 is $4.93 to $4.95, based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors for your trust and support. Kelcey, please queue up the first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Kelly. And as Kelly mentioned, we will now move into the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just to start with Kelly, do you have any changes in the overall macro environment in the third quarter compared to the second quarter? And could you touch on how linearity did throughout the quarter for new bookings? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. Hi, Ryan. So the macro has been pretty consistent from Q2 to Q3. We continue to see similar trends in terms of deal scrutiny, back-end loaded. So the quarter from a direct perspective was fairly back-end loaded. As a reminder, the online segment of the business is typically pretty linear throughout the quarter. I think the only thing that got a little worse from Q2 to Q3 was actually FX, as you saw in Asia Pac that had – that was a fairly significant headwind for us, whereas Asia Pac would have at least been flat year-over-year, if not for that impact.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Moving on to Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe just a question on kind of what feedback you're getting on the AI companion and that's a pretty big jump in kind of customers using it. So just what features are they really liking -- and is it kind of helping with some of the free-to-pay conversion that you guys were hoping for? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yes. It's a great question. I think we are very, very proud of our team's progress since it launched the Zoom AI Companion, as I mentioned earlier, right, a lot of accounts enabled that. Remember, this is no additional cost to paying customers, a lot of features -- one feature of that is like take a meeting summary, for example. Amazingly, it's very accurate and really save the meeting host a lot of time. And also, our federated AI approach really contributed to that success because we do not count on a single AI model and in terms of latency, accuracy and also the response, the speed and so on and so forth, I think, really helped our AI combining. Again, and for the online producers and also its additional cost. For sure, for free users, they do not -- they cannot enjoy this combining, for sure, it's a daily health for those who free to approve for online operate. So anyway, so we keep innovating on AI company. We have high confidence. That's a true differentiation compared to any other AI features, functionalities offered by some of our competitors.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question on Kasthuri Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKasthuri Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. Happy to see the results, and happy Thanksgiving. I just had one question, if I could restrict myself to one. The SMB online churn 3% I don’t know it came down from 3.1%. Any initiatives that you are undertaking that could bring that number even down more significantly I would resume that, that would have big implications for your growth rate and margins, which are already quite good. Thank you so much.\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, Wendy and her team are always working on initiatives. But I think what Eric was just mentioning about AI is probably really going to be a key differentiator and a retention -- retention tool in the future because as a reminder, all of the AI companion features come included for our three -- sorry, for our paid users. So we're seeing it not only help with conversion, but we really believe that for the long term, it will help with retention as well. And cash, I've gotten this question many times, and I would say like, this is the lowest we've ever seen, but also our platform is so much better. It's infinitely better than where it was on a pre-pandemic basis for our online users. And so I think we will -- this is how we're modeling it at this level. But I think over time, you should continue to see retention just continue to improve.\nKasthuri Rangan: Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Let me add on to what Kelly said, also the happy Thanksgiving to you as well. So more and more customers realize, wow, Zoom even for online users, it's not only for Zoom Meeting. A lot of other features, right? And I take a Zoom Team chatter for example, this is a great position and it had a solution. It's part of offering, even for free users as well, right? For the paid user for sure, a lot of other features, the more they spend time on Zoom platform, really as well. This is pretty powerful, not only just for meetings but the entire platform.\nKasthuri Rangan: Got it. Thanks so much, Eric and Kelly.\nEric Yuan: Yeah.\nOperator: Wells Fargo is Michael Turrin. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great. Thanks. Nice to see everyone. I guess as a complement to Kash's question, you're showing stabilization here on some of the major metrics, the enterprise expand metric took a step down to 105%. And so just wondering what it takes for that metric to similarly show stabilization as given in Q1 renewal cohort and kind of walking through that. Anything on the product side for us to consider or just any other commentary there is helpful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, as a reminder, it's a trailing 12-month metric. So as we've worsely seen our growth rates come down this year that's following behind it. But absolutely, we believe that AI Companion in general as well as the success that we are seeing in Zoom Phone, in Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Virtual Agent, all of those will be key contributors to seeing that metric start to reaccelerate again as we see our growth rate starting to decelerate as well.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Funk with Bank of America.\nMichael Funk: Yeah. Hi. Thank you for the questions toning. So just on the deferred revenue guidance for 4Q, Kelly, in the commentary on the macro and the rates affecting that. How should we think about growth rate in calendar year '24 given the decline in deferred revenue and impact on new deals in enterprise?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So I mean what's very interesting, if you look at, right, you see growth in RPO, but you're seeing a decline in deferred revenue, which implies customers while they're committing for long-term agreements, they are preferring to pay in shorter-term increments to keep their cash and take advantage of the interest rate environment. So the other thing, as a reminder, right, we're going to have a big renewal cycle in Q1, and then that's the peak and it's going to come down. And we believe that in FY '24 that we're currently in, we had -- the majority of our customers had some sort of renewal period during FY '24, which means that we believe that we've moved through a lot of our customers that were impacted themselves by a reduction. And we've talked in the past about how our team has been doing a great job of preserving that spend. But to the extent we're helping them right-size or transition from new meetings to say, a Zoom One bundle. We think the majority of our customers, we know the majority of our customers have gone through that renewal period in FY '24. And so that by the time we get into FY '25, hopefully, we're in a little more normalized renewal cycle.\nMichael Funk: Great. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: And moving on to Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Hey. Great. Thank you. Hey, Kelly. The phone business has been a big part of the Zoom growth algorithm lately. So I'm wondering if you could elaborate on how that parties did in the quarter. On the surface, and I know that you round that seat number, but it looks like the sequential phone suggests (ph) that might have been a lot less than the last several quarters. Maybe that's rounding, but I wanted to give you a platform maybe to elaborate about that part of the business.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you. So Q3 cyclically, just as a reminder, Q1 and Q3 cyclically are our lower orders, given that our enterprise reps -- some of our enterprise reps are on six month quarter. So we've historically seen the big Zoom Phone, just add quarters be in Q2 and Q4. What we did see in Q3 was that customers in the upper segments. So customers with greater 10,000 seats grew 9% quarter-over-quarter. So we're seeing a lot of strength in the upper end of Zoom Phone. So really happy to that. I mean that's the largest increase we've had so far this year. And then as a reminder, we haven't always given that metric, honestly at the exact same period. So it's hard a little hard for you to tell exactly how it's trending every single quarter. And as just in the past, we'll continue to update you on future milestones as they make sense.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer has the next question.\nGeorge Iwanyc: All right. Well, thank you for taking my questions. So Kelly, maybe following up on Zoom Phones to give us a bit of extra color on the contact center and the customer traction you're seeing there?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So as we mentioned, we're up to over 700 customers on Zoom Contact Center and we saw our Zoom Virtual Agents product double the number of customers quarter-over-quarter. So really excited there. I mean, maybe Eric can talk about some of the features and functionality, but we're thrilled with the progress that we're making there so far.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So we are extremely excited about our content center opportunity. And it feels like back to a few years ago, when we announced the Zoom Phone, right? Quite often, a lot of people mentioned, wow, you would take you guys many years to get recognized, deployed by large customers and look at what we have today in terms of number of paid user phone (ph). I feel like if we ask well, I think we are going to follow the similar journey and maybe even better because if you look at our content center and modern architecture, extremely stable and plus a lot of AI features and innovation speed. I think whenever a customer really take a Zoom content center seriously, evaluate Zoom contact center. The feedback is very consistent. Wow, I did not realize you guys have a so powerful contact center, it's just amazing, right? I think that there's further boosted our team is confidence double down, triple-down our own contact center. Again, it's modern architecture, very scalable. I also shared quite a few customer cases, right, during this call, and we are very, very excited. A lot of new AI features in virtual agent and workforce management and so on and so forth. And this is something that are very, very exciting.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll know hear from Peter Levine with Evercore.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thanks for taking my question here. Maybe for Kelly, as I look at gross margins, how sustainable is it keeping at these levels? I know AI companion is being given away from as part of the package, I guess, prepaid users. But if you think about the cost to run these models, the margin profile of contact center in phone. How durable is it to kind of sustain these levels? And then second, as you think into next year, you have guided, but what's the best way to think about stock-based comp and dilution as you kind of manage through that?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So in terms of our gross margins, we'll obviously give FY '25 guidance on our call next quarter. But as we are working on our planning, our DevOps team is doing an amazing job of continuing to optimize around the data centers and being very thoughtful about leveraging capacity to its highest and best use and making room for all of this AI innovation. So while we are going to invest, and we're actually -- we're going to invest to the extent that XT and the team really believe that we need to and that for the long term, it's an amazing ROI when you look at what it's going to do for our customers, for our growth and for our retention. But we do expect there's going to be some impact on gross margins. I mean we -- I don't think it's going to be significant because the team will continue to work to operate, the very efficient manner that they do and run our colors that way, but we do expect there's going to be some impact to our gross margin as we move forward. Do you want to add anything, Eric?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So you are right on. Just to echo what Kelly said, led by our CTO, XT and his team our federated AI approach, as I mentioned earlier, really contribute a lot. So for sure, and there's a cost impact, but extremely manageable, right? And our team is really, really, I think I had a very smart architecture. That's why I think in terms of cost, very manageable, but also the quality is pretty good. So and we are keep innovating on that.\nPeter Levine: Thank you both.\nKelly Steckelberg: Peter, regarding stock-based comp, about a third of our expense this year is related to the supplemental grants. So as a reminder, those that best along with how the underlying grants are vesting. So there's a couple more years for that to just start to bleed off, if you will. If you're going to model that out.\nPeter Levine: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: And we will now hear from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Thank you. Hi. So Eric, what is your ideal customer profile on the contact center side of the business?\nEric Yuan: That's great question. I think first of all, again, this is based on architecture and AI features. I think [indiscernible] medium-sized because the reason why for very, very large customers, even if our architecture, everything, ever ready, but sometimes they just want to look at, hey, you are still too early, but even product fully ready. That's the reason why sometimes even we do not reach out to them. It's very large, let's say tens of thousands in customers, if they take our certain series. [Technical Difficulty]\nKelly Steckelberg: Is it Eric freeze or did I freeze.\nOperator: I think Eric is -- Okay.\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. Let me -- sorry for that. Eric, we lost you for a minute there.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. I'm sorry. And so given the new solution is sort of a modern architecture and all the new AI features those, let's say, like 20,000, 10,000 agent customers, if they look at our solutions, they have confidence. Because of that, we want to be a little bit of practice to focus on medium-sized companies, like form of hundreds agent to thousands of agents. That's our obviously a sweet spot. But not me, I'm going to stop here, as I mentioned earlier, any when, very big large companies, when you look at our contact center solution seriously, we have a confidence about to win. But however, to get there, they focused on the medium-sized companies.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Thank you, Eric.\nKelly Steckelberg: All right. I could give you an example, Patrick. We have a customer called Venture, which provides like payroll and HR services. And they became in the last year, they doubled their Zoom Phone seats. They've doubled their contact center our seats into four digits now. They also have deployed workforce management as well as quality management and ZVA (ph). So really taking advantage of the whole suite Zoom products, not only the contact center and its extensions, but the full suite of Zoom. And I think when they start to deploy like that, they really see the power, and it's been very exciting to see them grow.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Thank you both.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you. Can you just touch on the international business a little bit? It seems like it's certainly trailing the U.S. but what gets that business to turn around? And maybe talk about some of your new growth drivers, how they're faring there with Zoom Phone and contact center? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So Unfortunately, both EMEA and APAC over the last year have been impacted both by currency and then EMEA has been impacted by the general economy and the war there. But in terms of our focus, we have very recently actually added a new European leader and a new leader in Australia and New Zealand. So we’re very excited about the team. And since we did the reorganization earlier this year, those regions have just taken a little bit longer than the U.S. but we’re starting to see that momentum build again and really excited about what they’re going to contribute and watching their success in the future.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. His video is not on, so he may just be audio only.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Alex. Hey, Alex. Do you want to go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant: This is Ethan Brock (ph) on for Alex. He said he is in [indiscernible] right now. Thank you for taking my question. I just had two quick questions. Just how do we think at what level should we expect or when for the NRR of the enterprise cohort to trough? Just any kind of puts and takes around enterprise revenue in the quarter, right, above your expectations, it grew sequentially. And it was also -- it was probably like RPO, CRPO. CRPO bookings has all accelerated. I guess, is it fair to think that for next year's enterprise growth rate would be above what's implied in the 4Q guide? And just if you can give any more kind of color around the 4Q numbers and kind of what you're expecting in the online churn, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we did see strength in the direct bookings, they were very back-end loaded in Q3, which just continues the theme that we've been talking about in terms of the overall macro. And as we look forward to Q4, we have typically, we have the benefit of having year-end where customers are having their year-end on 12/31 and then we have our year-end on January 31. And of course, we have our six-month quota-carrying reps that are coming to the end of their quoter cycle. So hopefully taking advantage of their accelerators. But we are expecting similar behavior in terms of even if we have a 12/31 sort of bump expecting that to be back-end loaded and then January 31 on as well. In terms of your question around net dollar expanding, we're not going to give -- I mean, we don't guide on that. I expect that given your growth rates have come down a little bit more that there might be a little bit more room for that to come down even further until it starts to stabilize and probably reaccelerate sometime next year.\nUnidentified Participant: Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. Just on the comment you made in your prepared remarks around the shorter billings duration. I guess, is there just any way to qualitatively think relative to 3Q, if there's any change, just how to think about obviously, people moving to a more different -- shorter payment terms. So just how we think about that in terms of what's implied in the 4Q guide? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We -- so we commented first time, in seeing this trend was in Q2. If you remember, we also talked about this in our prepared remarks, we saw this happening. And given the interests rates are high, I don't expect it's going to change any time soon. I think -- the good news is from the health of the underlying business, right, customers are committing to longer-term duration contracts, they just are preferring to pay on shorter term. And yet, we obviously had very strong cash flow in the period. So I don’t think it’s something you should be worried about.\nUnidentified Participant: Got it. Thank you very much. Congrats on the next results.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Mark Murphy at JPMorgan. Mark will be audio only.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi, guys. This is [indiscernible] on for Mark Murphy. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. You guys called out the Virgin Group and the launch of Workvivo across 60,000 employees and a number of the workforce-related innovations you've launched recently. Can you just speak to the adoption of those products and what kind of momentum you're seeing on that front? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nEric Yuan: Kelly you go ahead.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. I mean we're really excited about Workvivo. They -- first of all, in terms of operating, they're continuing to run as an operating unit, which -- we're making sure that we support them and their continued momentum, and we've already talked about -- we talked about Dollar General on the last quarter and their amazing adoption. So we're really excited about that team. They -- when they joined us, we said, welcome to the family and gave them an accelerated bookings target, and they are running and achieving against that. So really thrilled to have them and watching that continue to succeed.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from Catharine Trebnick with Rosenblatt.\nCatharine Trebnick: Thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. Has your appetite for M&A changed at all in the last year? All day long on CNB they kept saying, we're looking for growth, reacceleration of growth. So I'm just wondering if you're looking at the $6.5 billion and your attitude towards M&A? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Thank you, Catharine. M&A is something that we evaluate and think about for as a potential strategy all the time. I have a core dev (ph) team that looks at opportunities on a daily basis. And we have a very strong lens that we look through in terms of evaluating that is, first of all, the technology and what does it bring to our customers. We would always want to make sure that our customers continue to enjoy a really high-quality product like they do with Zoom today. We look at the culture to make sure that it's something that we think work well with Zoom. It's usually a really good indicator success of integrating two companies. And then, of course, we look at the lens of valuation and does it make sense? Is it a price that we are willing to pay. And because we have such a high bar, it honestly has been hard to find companies that we love that makes it through all three of those tests. It doesn’t mean that we wouldn’t love to find someone that did. There are some really great companies out there. And for one reason or the other to date, we just haven’t found the right match, but it doesn’t mean that we won’t. And that is why we have purposely remained retained, I should say, the flexibility of having that cash on our balance sheet so that if we do see something interesting, we’re able to act on it.\nOperator: Moving on to KeyBank of Tom Blakey.\nThomas Blakey: Thank you very much. Good to see you, Eric, and hi, Kelly. Just wondering quickly on the stability that we were talking about a couple of quarters ago in online. It's a pretty impressive that we went back and forth on that a little bit here and very stable. I mean obviously talked about the churn. Can you just maybe update us that on that in terms of should we expect the same type of stability in online into the fiscal 4Q and maybe even similarly into fiscal '25, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So the team has done a lot of work this year to -- on many fronts around online. First of all, stabilizing retention, which you're seeing the benefits of that today as well as focusing on free-to-pay conversion because it's really important that we're continuing to fill the top of the funnel, and those are things like force brakes. And as Eric mentioned earlier, also being able to procure additional products online, things like whiteboard and scheduler are very well aligned to the strategy of our online buyers. So those are all of the initiatives that went in our team are continuing to focus on. In terms – I mean, we hold ourselves to a very high standard. We say stabilization. What we really want to see is dollar stabilization quarter-over-quarter. And while it’s very, very close, it’s not quite there. And I expect it will be slightly down, just very, very slightly down again in Q4. But as we’re working on FY ‘25 planning with the team, really looking forward to initiatives that drive stabilization and if not, some growth into FY ‘25.\nThomas Blakey: Very helpful. Thank you, Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes. Thank you very much. You guided deferred revenue to decline 6% to 8% in Q4. Do you sort of billing frequencies with enterprise customers. The question I have is what kind of decline would that have been without that billing frequency change? And related to this, you're going to have a big renewal cycle in Q1. So do you expect deferred revenue growth to pick up meaningfully in Q1?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So as a reminder, the way the deferred revenue trends about the year is it's always the highest in Q1 and then it declines throughout the year. And there's two things that are happening. First of all, Q1 is the largest renewal period. So if the bucket gets filled up, and then that’s getting amortized through the rest of the year. But also the subsequent renewal cycles are lower than Q1. So it’s the inverse of probably every other SaaS company in the world where usually you’re adding higher renewals every single quarter, we are actually adding a lower number – a lower dollar amount of renewals every single quarter. So as Q1 is getting amortized down, what’s coming into refill at the top of that bucket is coming down every single quarter. And that’s why you have seen for quite a number of years now, typically a sequential decline in deferred revenue quarter-over-quarter.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: We'll now hear from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Appreciate all the details around some of the product lines. But building off of a few prior questions with that contact center customer count up to about 700 versus the 500 last quarter. If my math is right, given kind of what you guys have talked about with price points kind of seems like we're nearing $100 million of ARR now or how should we think about that average seat count at this point? And then, Eric, for you, look, it got released and was available this quarter, but how has that workforce engagement solution really gone in terms of penetration with the contact center installed bases, is that acting as sort of a consolidation function underneath for especially that small mid-market. Thanks, guys.\nKelly Steckelberg: Go ahead, first.\nEric Yuan: I think if you look at the contact center, right? So not only just all fast to offer the core kind of contact center of capabilities, we want to offer a full platform, right, including workforce management, right? This is the -- based on modern architecture, not something like, hey, you have on-premise solution for a long time, you just put it into the -- in the cloud, that's not the case. We built it everything from ground up. It's tied to integrated with our core contact center solutions. That's the reason why when you look at our customers right from SMB, minimum size, all the way to lot enterprise, I think we are ready. And however, as I mentioned earlier, sweet spotters should be the major, right. However, one thing is realized, customers do have one seamless experience for everything contact center and workforce management, virtual agent AI feature call, engine, right, so we are trying to offer all of them. So that's kind of our strategy. In terms of our workforce management contribution, it really helped because we tell them, hey, we offer everything to you. We are not going to let you deploy other third-party workforce management solutions. We offer all the services, all the functionality to you with one platform.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. And James, in terms of your ability to kind of understand how those products are progressing themselves, we'll do done with others and announced milestone metrics as we start to see them emerge. They're just so new right now that doesn't really sense, but we will do that over time.\nJames Fish: All right. Thanks, Kelly. Thanks, Eric.\nA – Kelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nA – Eric Yuan: We are not ready to share with the number, exact number yet about how many customers deploy the workforce management, so we’ll state in the future quarters.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Matt VanVliet fleet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess following up one more on sort of the contact center and Zoom Phone. In terms of overall customer mix, you're well below 1% penetration on contact center here. Is there a target that you think is sort of the next few years of the customers you're going to go after? How high do you think of roughly 200,000 customers you have an existing contact center that you've maybe identified and comparably work your way into. And then sort of following up on that, what percentage, if you can share the over 100,000 customers, 100,000 revenue customers have Zoom Phone or Zoom Contact Center as an attachment there?\nKelly Steckelberg: So I guess the way that I think about contact center and its progress is that it's so far is very, pulling in a very similar road map, if you will, than that Zoom Phone did. So if you think about -- we can see the visibility internally just as we could with Zoom Phone. But in terms of ARR as a metric for example, it's going to take a little while for that to be something that's visible to you. But so far, it's tracking in a very, very similar way that's Zoom Phone did, which I think is very encouraging. And that we need a couple more years and then it starts to be a really significant growth contributor. It just start small and then grow quickly, and that's what we're seeing.\nEric Yuan: And also, if you look at opportunity, very similar as well. Many years ago, a lot of our enterprise customers, their phone you see deployment is still on-prem. Today, you look at most of our enterprise customer contact center still on track. So that’s why a lot of opportunity ahead of us, in particular, in our model architecture is very scalable.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Needham’s, Ryan Koontz has the next question. Ryan, please go ahead.\nRyan Koontz: Hi. Happy Thanksgiving. From Zoomtopia, we're really impressed with the Zoom Rooms and what you're doing there. The innovation really seems years ahead of the market. And I wondered how you -- what's your updated view on the rooms opportunity for the company. Do you think it's strong enough that you can use that as a lead as almost a stand-alone product? And you see the market opportunity more promising for you with that product. You have to go to market in those sort of questions. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: So you're right. So speaking of the opportunity, you're also right. We never, customer, for many year, they right deployed the Zoom Rooms for more and more customers. I mean they try to invest hybrid work. They need to have a modern solution for their conf-rooms, they are multiple solutions, Zoom Rooms indeed stands out is indeed years ahead of any other competitors. However, sometimes for customers when they try to support a hybrid work right now, they're in the middle of embracing hybrid work, right? What’s the new layout of the entire workplace and how many conf-room they needed to support and so on and so forth, right? That's why a lot of opportunities. At the same time, when guys work together with customers and not only for conf-room innovation, but also entire workplace, the management, what's the new layout [indiscernible]. I think a lot of opportunity, not only for conf-room itself, like how to reserve a desk, right? All those things we all build in as a part of the Zoom Room, like an example, like a digital signage and also part of Zoom Rooms as the full as the conf-room or workplace solution, and that’s why we needed to make sure a focus on marketing side to share with the customer. Again, Zoom Rooms is not only just for your conf-room solution, but it’s for hybrid work and also for entire workplace as well.\nRyan Koontz: That’s great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Ryan.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: Now we'll move on to Peter Weed with Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. I think for the first time, at least as far as I can look at in the model, it looks like the kind of large enterprise was greater than $100,000 enterprise customers were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. But we're hearing the great stories about customer expansions and the number of those customers has continued to increase, which would imply there's a whole another set of customers that are either shrinking or churning and it appears that got more pronounced this quarter than perhaps we've seen recently. How should we think about those effects, and is that more churn or is it downgrades? And when customers are churning or downgrading, where they're going? And is this something that is kind of temporary and you see it kind of ending? Or is it something where we may have some pain for a bit of time before we get through some effects?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So I think we've talked about this the last couple of quarters. We certainly have seen impact in our customers having retraction in their own businesses in their own employee count. So we -- if that's the situation that we are working with them, we -- the good news is we've not seen a lot of logo churn. It has been more down selling in terms of rightsizing, their meeting license numbers. And yet even in that situation, our team is doing a great job of taking the opportunity to transition them from potentially meetings to one of our Zoom One bundles that include Zoom Phone. We talked about in our prepared remarks, we saw that grow over 300% year-over-year in terms of the number of customers that are using those bundles and that's great for many reasons, right, in terms of retention and having more than one product deployed, we see as very advantageous to customer retention. So we certainly have worked with many, many, many of our customers this year on ensuring that they have the right package in place. And -- but I also talked about earlier this earlier on the call, that we know that the majority of our customers have had some sort of renewal period in FY '24, meaning that we hope, we anticipate that as we've got -- get through the end of this year, we've moved through most of those transitions where organizations have done their own reductions and are aligning their licenses to that.\nPeter Weed: But it sounds like you're not seeing an uptick in churn. This is mostly just that kind of reduction in force. And once we do that, then you set a four in so that the expansions can kind of work going forward on all the great things people are buying, which even us at -- great customers love the product.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah, I mean that, we're not giving FY '25 guidance, just to be clear. But yes, that's in general what we anticipate, just knowing that we've worked through most of our customer renewals this year, and I assume that they've gotten through their reductions. Now it depends on what has overall with the macro, but that's what we leave to be the case. Yes.\nPeter Weed: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Imtiaz Koujalgi with Wedbush.\nKelly Steckelberg: You are on mute.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Sorry, can you guys hear me now?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: A question on Zoom Phone. So Kelly, you give us the ARR last quarter, we have the Zoom Phone seat this quarter. Further, if I do a rough math on the ASP, it comes down to like $7 to $8 something per month, which seems like almost half or even more of the list price. If you can just confirm that and has that come gone down or gone up?\nKelly Steckelberg: So as a reminder, you can buy Zoom Phone either for $10 per license per month if you have metered calling on top or $15, if you get unlimited long distance. So the ASP is going to depend on which version of that, which of the SKU the customers are buying and how they come together. And then, if you think about some of our largest enterprise customers, we do discount not just for obviously, for Zoom Phone, but the overall value of their purchases or their value of being a customer for longevity in terms of length of cycles, willingness to pay upfront. So all of those things contribute, but it sounds like you're right in. You're right in sort of the ballpark. We have not seen a dramatic shift in those discounts up or down.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: And just one follow-up. Is that similar to what you're seeing in the contact center or versus your I think the list price was 70 for contact center. Any comment on how the discounting in contact center compares to what you've seen in Zoom Phone?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. No. I don't think if you can correlate them. They're very different products with different sales cycle and approach. So I don't think I can try to take a percentage discount necessarily from one product and expected to apply to a different one.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: We will now hear from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Tyler.\nTyler Radke: Yeah. Hi. Good evening. So Kelly, if I look at the midpoint of your guidance for Q4, it's about 1% growth in others. Some currency in there. But how should we be thinking about that as a jumping off point for fiscal year '25? What are kind of the puts and takes that would cause growth to be higher than that, and also lower. It does sound like you're starting to see some stabilization in parts of the business. But just help us frame for how we should be thinking about that trajectory beyond Q4.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we will obviously give FY ‘25 guidance on the Q4 call. However, I do think that the Q4 implied extra rate and considerations around the macro? And if it is stabilizing or improving over time are important considerations. We do see -- we’ve talked about many great aspects of our business today, growth in Zoom Phone, growth in contact center, stabilization and all online, all could be contributors that could drive growth in FY ‘25 to be slightly higher than the implied Q4 exit rate. But right now, I mean, if you look at the extra rate consider the macro and take all that into account as you’re modeling.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move on to William Power with Baird.\nWilliam Power: Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of quick follow-ups. I guess, Eric, to an earlier question on AI companion, can you just talk about where you're seeing the greatest usage. I mean what are customers most focused on? And what's the early feedback look like? And what are customers asking for in AI? Where can you continue to add more value there?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. It's a great question. First of all, AI combining includes a lot of features. Like if you are related to the call, you want to instead of what's going on, what kind of the point I missed, and so you can ask, right, all those kind of features. And also when you use our team chat, you can have a composer chat solution and a lot of features built upon that, right? So -- and one of the key features customer-like is very for sure Zoom Meeting summary, right? And after meeting Zoom, not only to be generated. Sometimes, record meeting or some -- for now you don’t know recorded meeting anymore. It just recorded a summary. And that future works extremely well. We do see among a lot of other features, customers already started in a blink. I think this one is probably one of the highlights. It is very easy to use and you see the very adverse in our way to enable that feature. So again, it's a lot of other features as well. And like for me, I also use our -- the client, the Zoom Client, connect and other services you can, right? You can have -- you compose e-mail as well, right? It's a lot of features, right? And down the road awareness for the whiteboard with AI companion as well. Almost every service entire platform, we're going to lever the AI combined. So and a lot of features and the AI Companion.\nWilliam Power: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: You enable meeting summary and explore so many features, I'm pretty sure you'll love that. So we've got a lot of very positive feedback from those early adopter.\nOperator: And our last question is going to come from Stephen Bersey with HSBC. Steven, if you want to go ahead -- I believe, Stephen, just disconnected. Stephen, are you still out there? If you are not, I don't think he's -- no longer with us. So what, Eric, I'll just turn out to you for closing remarks.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So first of all, thank you all for your time to join our Q3 earnings call, I really appreciate wish you all and your families have a wonderful holiday season. Thank you again for your great support. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much, Eric. I apologize, Kelly. Again, everyone, this concludes today's earnings release. As Eric and Kelly mentioned, we thank you all for your participation and from our family to yours. May you and yours have a safe and happy holiday season. Enjoy the rest of your day."

        "content": "Operator: Okay. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's Q2 FY ’23 Earnings Release Webinar. As a reminder, today's webinar is being recorded. And now I would like to hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations. Tom?\nTom McCallum: Thank you, David. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. I’m joined today by Zoom’s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, and Zoom’s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.us. Also, on this page you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding financial and business trends; impacts from the macroeconomic environment, our market position, opportunities, go-to-market initiatives, growth strategy and business aspirations; and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, that we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make on today’s webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Hey. Thank you, Tom. Hey. Thank you everyone for joining us today. So before starting, I’d like to welcome Dr. Xuedong Huang as our CTO, who joins us after a successful career at Microsoft, where he most recently served as Azure AI CTO and Technical Fellow. Dr. XD joins us at an optimal moment in our AI journey. In the past few months, we brought several new AI innovations to the market and announced an aggressive roadmap aimed at empowering our customers to work smarter and serve their customers better. And, as we develop and deploy AI solutions, we strongly believe that technology should advance trust. We are privileged to have countless customers rely on us for their communications needs. We don’t take that for granted. Earlier this month, we took the additional step in stating that Zoom does NOT use customer content to train our AI models or third-party AI models. I’m proud of the approach we are taking. By putting customers’ privacy needs first, Zoom is taking a leadership position in ensuring customers can use our AI features with confidence that their content is protected. Now, let me share how we have advanced in our mission of: One Platform Delivering Limitless Human Connection. We launched Zoom Scheduler, which serves to reduce the hassle of scheduling with people outside your organization, and Intelligent Director, which uses AI and multiple cameras to provide the best image and angle of participants joining from a conference room. We also launched many new offerings like Zoom Clips, which enables asynchronous video conversations. And more and more customers are getting on Zoom Team Chat, driven by increased adoption of Zoom One and new features like Continuous Meeting Chat, which connects the transient in-meeting chat feature to the persistent Zoom Team Chat product. Currently, we have two fortune 15 companies, one major consulting firm, a global F&B brand and a leading law firm using Zoom Team Chat as a core means of text-based communications. Our Contact Center product has surpassed 500 customers and we are rolling out about 90 new features and enhancements per quarter. We launched Workforce Management in early July to help customers streamline customer communications, manage agent needs, and transform their customer experience all from a single, unified platform. WFM is already off to a great start and we look forward to adding additional products to this suite to expand our native customer experience capabilities and revenue streams. We have progressed rapidly in our integration of Workvivo. After rolling it out internally, I could not be more impressed with the product and confident in the value it will bring to our customers in terms of building culture across a distributed workforce, ultimately delivering upon our strategic pillar of enabling hybrid work. Speaking of which, a few weeks ago, we announced internally a structured hybrid approach -- asking our Zoomies that live within commuting distance to come into their local office twice a week. Zoom is purpose-built for hybrid work and it is on us to understand what our customers are experiencing in their hybrid journeys and what works and does not work for them. We believe that this approach will enable us to continue to innovate for our customers and deliver what they need to succeed. Now moving on to some of our customer wins. First, we are excited to expand with the United States Postal Service. In Q2, the postal service added Zoom Team Chat for 21,500 users to their existing Zoom for Government deployment. Let me also thank Brookdale Senior Living, the largest operator of senior housing in the United States. Brookdale started as a Zoom Meetings customer in FY20. A year later, they began evaluating Zoom Phone. And in Q2 they went all-in on the cloud and upgraded to Zoom One, in order to unify their communication needs under one integrated product. Let me also thank Perdue Farms. Like many of our customers’ journeys, Perdue’s started years ago with an initial Zoom Meetings deployment. Last fall, they went all-in with Zoom One Enterprise Plus. However, the story does not end there. In Q2, Perdue added Zoom Contact Center due to its native integration with their existing Zoom Phone deployment and our ambitious innovation roadmap. Let me also thank Valmont Industries. Valmont came onboard as a Zoom customer a little over a year ago with Meetings and Phone and quickly became a major platform adopter, including Zoom One and Zoom Contact Center. And in Q2, with the goal of utilizing AI to better serve their customers and also their employees, they added Zoom Virtual Agent due to its accuracy of intent understanding, ability to route issues to the correct agent, ease of use and quality of analytics. We are so delighted to see our partnership with Valmont grow so quickly and are committed to innovating further to support their operations. Finally, let me thank Dollar General, America’s general store, for choosing Zoom’s Workvivo to connect employees as the digital heartbeat for the company. Dollar General will rollout Workvivo’s employee engagement platform for its roughly 190,000 employees to enhance the employee experience at the individual, group and district levels, drive employee dialogue, and reinforce its strong culture. Again, we are so excited to welcome and expand with USPS, Brookdale, Perdue Farms, Valmont, Dollar General, and all of our customers worldwide. And with that I’ll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. We are pleased that we beat our top line and profitability guidance in Q2. Here are a few milestones. First, operating cash flow grew 31% year-over-year to $336 million. Second, Zoom Phone reached roughly $0.5 billion in annualized run rate revenue. And finally, we are excited that Zoom Contact Center has surpassed 500 customers in only six quarters. In Q2, total revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $1.139 billion, which includes $10 million of pressure from foreign exchange. This result was approximately $24 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise business grew 10% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue, up from 54% a year ago. We continue to see improvement in Online average monthly churn, which decreased to 3.2% from 3.6% in Q2 of FY '23. The number of Enterprise customers grew 7% year-over-year to approximately 218,100. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers came in Q2 at 109%. We saw 18% year-over-year growth in the upmarket as we ended the quarter with 3,672 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 29% of revenue, up from 26% in Q2 of FY '23 and include some of the amazing names that Eric highlighted earlier. Our Americas revenue grew 6% year-over-year, while EMEA and APAC declined by 1% and 3%, respectively. Absent currency impact, both EMEA and APAC would have been approximately flat year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, all regions grew 3%. Moving to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on strategic investments, restructuring expenses and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 80.3%, an improvement from 78.9% in Q2 of last year. We are pleased with the strength of our gross margins as we continue to optimize usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers for both existing and emerging technologies. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 79.7% as we make additional investments in new AI technologies. Research and development expense grew by 6% year-over-year to approximately $104 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 9.1% from 8.9% in Q2 of last year, reflecting our investments in expanding our product portfolio, including Zoom Contact Center, AI and more. Looking ahead, investing in innovation will remain a top priority for Zoom. Sales and marketing expense decreased by 3% year-over-year to $276 million. This represented approximately 24.2% of total revenue, down from 26% in Q2 of last year. As a reminder, Zoomtopia will be held in Q3 of this year and will drive incremental marketing investment in the quarter. G&A expense declined by 19% to $73 million or approximately 6.4% of total revenue, down from 8.2% in Q2 of last year, as we continue to achieve greater efficiencies and experienced onetime savings in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 17% to $462 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $410 million. This translates to a 40.5% non-GAAP operating margin, a meaningful improvement from 35.8% in Q2 of last year. Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 18.5%. For the remainder of the year, our tax rate is expected to approximate the blended U.S. and federal state rate. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.34 on approximately 306 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.28 above the high end of our guidance and $0.29 higher than Q2 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.37 billion, down approximately 2% from Q2 of last year. This was in line with the high end of the expectations that we shared last quarter. For Q3, we expect deferred revenue to be down 4% to 5% year-over-year, partially driven by shorter billing frequencies on Enterprise deals arising from the high interest rate environment. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO increased 9% year-over-year to approximately $3.5 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 59% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 61% in Q2 of FY '23 indicating lengthening contract durations on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, our renewal seasonality peaks in Q1 and declines throughout the rest of the year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 31% year-over-year to $336 million. Free cash flow grew 26% year-over-year to $289 million. Both results include the approximately $60 million cash payment related to the legal settlement that we discussed last quarter. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins were 29.5% and 25.4%, respectively. We ended the quarter with approximately $6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Given the strength in profitability and collections, we are increasing our cash flow outlook for FY '24. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.23 billion. Turning to guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.115 billion to $1.12 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth or 2% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $400 million to $405 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.07 to $1.09 based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. We are also pleased to raise our top line and profitability outlook for the full year of FY '24. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.485 billion to $4.495 billion. At the midpoint, this represents approximately 2% year-over-year growth or 3% in constant currency, which we expect to be neutral in the back half of the year. Our increased total revenue guidance reflects a consistent view on Enterprise, with tempered expectations for Online for the remainder of the year. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.685 billion to $1.695 billion, representing an operating margin of approximately 38%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share for FY '24 is $4.63 to $4.67 based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community and our investors for your trust and support. Before opening up for Q&A, we are excited about our premier user conference, Zoomtopia. It will be in person in San Jose as well as on Zoom Events. We look forward to sharing more about our expanding platform, new innovations and customer testimonials. Please join us at Zoomtopia on October 3 and 4. David, Please queue up our first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Kelly. As Kelly mentioned, we will now move into the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our question will come from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Well, thank you so much and congrats on solid execution in the quarter. Curious, if you can comment on the Zoom Scheduler product. It looks like a very attractive add-on option and a clear efficiency gain. I understand that, that's going to be free for some period of time and that looks like $6 per month for certain users. I understand it's going to be included in some of the other bundles. But can you just comment on how that's going to work or maybe Eric, you can touch on the efficiency gains from that product? And Kelly, any type of a framework for the revenue potential out of that particular product?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So I can talk on the product side. Clearly, Kelly, feel free to tell on the revenue potential. I think, Mark, you're also right on. I guess probably you already tried it out is indeed very attractive. The reason why you look at the whole customers are -- including Zoomies, right, how we schedule the meeting. Let's see, Mark, I want to schedule a meeting with Zoom next week is so complicated, right? I need to [indiscernible] we think about calendar schedule is so hard, meaning across the company, scheduling is so complicated, right? How to have the customers and simplify that experience, that's why I decided to introduce Zoom Scheduler, right? And also, there are some other start-up solutions out there. The customer, they would like to lever the Zoom platform because they already used Meeting and the Phone, Team Chat, one more click, they can schedule the meeting with somewhere from outside organization, really like that experience. That's why we decided to build that. And we already have a free trial and as a customer [indiscernible] customers already and also be part of the Zoom One as well down the road. And actually, it's doing very well and really simplify the way for you to schedule meetings with any other side of your organization. We're pretty excited about that opportunity.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. I think in terms of its overall contribution, Mark, it’s at a very attractive price point and will grow over time, certainly. But also, we think that what it does is make the product continue to be where you live and make, especially our larger enterprise customers that much more retentive as it continues to spread the platform and how you spend your day.\nMark Murphy: Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Mark. Hopefully you try that. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nKelly Steckelberg: Meta, we can't hear you.\nMeta Marshall: Because I'm on mute. So one of the questions that I had was just, what you're seeing in terms of the environment? I know that your upside kind of came from the Enterprise. Just wanted to get a sense of how the environment changed during the quarter, if there were any changes during the quarter? And just whether kind of that upside came as a result of kind of better upsells or just more deals kind of getting closing in shorter order? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. Thank you, Meta. So I would say in terms of Q2 versus Q1, the environment has been pretty consistent. We continue to see momentum in Zoom One, in Zoom Phone. There are still, I would say, lengthen sales cycles out there and customers really making sure that they take advantage of doing their full due diligence. But we're really excited about the vision that we can take for them not only around, obviously, the existing platform but what's also coming from an AI perspective. And I think our customers are finding that very attractive, as you’ve heard from the customers that Eric talked about seeing a lot of momentum of customers that were originally Meetings customers really moving either into Zoom One or adding on Zoom Phone and considering Contact Center as well.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nEric Yuan: David, next.\nKelly Steckelberg: David, who is next?\nOperator: Apologies. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Kash.\nKasthuri Gopalan: It looks like the Enterprise business is seeing stability with respect to attrition, et cetera. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the Online business. So it's still a substantial part of the revenue and anything that you have identified that could help stabilize the attrition levels? And also, just while we're at it, what is the pricing power of Zoom? Like you talked about customers worried about inflation and doing shorter-term contracts, that I guess on the flip side means that you could raise prices. So wondering how much leverage we have at that. Thank you so much.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So in terms of the Online segment, we were really pleased with the continued improvement that we're seeing in the [indiscernible] rates or the churn rates. They are really at historic lows. And so that's really great to see. And when the interim team continue to innovate, we just saw a little more volatility, and that's what we indicated in sort of tempered expectations for the rest of the year, but really pleased with the ongoing progress that we're seeing in that segment of the business. And then in terms of the pricing power -- I mean, Eric, feel free to chime in. But certainly, we continue to have a discussion with our customers when it comes up for renewals, looking for opportunities to potentially expand their usage of the portfolio, moving them from Zoom Meetings to Zoom One is a very common upsell mechanism or, I should say, movement that we're seeing with our customers today and considering, is there an opportunity potentially given the value that they're seeing in the platform potentially for a price increase at renewal as well?\nKasthuri Gopalan: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Just quickly, in terms of pricing power and most of the businesses, they still view employ experience as the number one priority, right? That’s why they really wanted to kind of give a customer the best service like a Zoom platform. Otherwise, probably they do not experience on price, that’s not the case, right? And most of the customers we talked with has really appreciated the value and ease of use and quality of Zoom service.\nKasthuri Gopalan: Thanks so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Kash. Appreciate. You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Funk with Bank of America.\nMichael Funk: Yeah. Hi. Thank you for taking the question today. So congratulations on new logo additions, good momentum there and the Phone adds as well. Just wondering, Kelly, I mean, what has to happen with some of the other metrics, it did decelerate during the quarter. India decelerated sequentially. Online churn up sequentially. Enterprise customer additions also slowed sequentially. So thinking about the acceleration in revenue growth we've been expecting or hoping for, which of those metrics is going to turn first? And how much visibility do you have into that turn?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So a couple of things. Let me just comment on a couple of the metrics that you called out specifically. First of all, the Online term metric. As a reminder, we expect Q2 and Q4 to be seasonally higher than Q1 and Q3. So while it was up over Q1, it was down over Q4, and that's because of summer and winter holiday. So I think the 3.2 number is a really great number. And we are going to continue and continuing to focus on opportunities to improve that. In terms of the Enterprise, we're really focusing on some of the approach as we've talked about earlier. Certainly, Zoom Phone is one of the key drivers in terms of expanding our customers use to the platform. That doesn't necessarily result in new customers, but you could see that in the Enterprise customer metric as that starts to expand also the success of Zoom One is going to drive that expansion of more customers in the $100,000. So I think those are the metrics that you should watch as great indicators as our Enterprise team continues to in Phones in One in Contact Center. And then, of course, as AI becomes more front and center, you'll get to see that as well.\nMichael Funk: So just quickly then, so the NDRR for Enterprise that should improve as we exit the year, is that expectations of 109 (ph) just should improve off that number?\nKelly Steckelberg: You remember, it's a trailing 12-month number. It may come down a little bit more yet, but then start to inflect potentially at the back half of the year, but it might be into early of FY '25.\nMichael Funk: Okay. Thank you, Kelly. Thank you, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Fish from Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Kelly, for you or Eric, are you seeing optimizations on your seats showing a slowdown or a similar pace to what you've seen more recently? Is there any way to talk about the linearity in general? And Eric, we get the investment behind AI, and it seems like it's causing gross margins to drop a couple of points and guide sequentially. I guess what can you say that gives confidence that this isn't just further price degradation or just a higher level of conservatism on the other side of the coin?\nEric Yuan: Kelly, you wanted to address the first one?\nKelly Steckelberg: So in terms of the optimization of seats, what we've seen is, I think we talked about the sales motion before that our reps have the opportunity to really get in there and talk to our customers and they've done a great job about logo retention. And even if they are customers because they've had a dislocation in their employee base, taking that opportunity then to replace that revenue with an upsell of another product like Zoom Phone and showing them how overall we can drive such a great ROI for them and save them. And our sales team has been incredibly successful at that. And so that's what we're seeing, even though there's still a little bit of shifting, I would say, of seats in there, we're seeing lots of momentum on those upsells at that renewal period. And I just want to highlight, we only -- in terms of gross margin, we had 80.3 this quarter, and we only guided to 79.7. So it's not even 100 basis points of degradation. So Eric can talk about the reasons and why that is and what we're investing in.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Gross margin is very, very strong. Again, in terms of the impact, it's just a short term, not long term. The reason why -- when it comes to AI, it's becoming more and more important. Many of our customers told us, they rely on Zoom platform, like all the features today, like Meeting Summary. Someone can take a meeting manually, right? How to leverage AI improve the productivity and efficiency, right? For sure, we needed to invest more. The good news is we already invested two to three years ago, right? And that's why some of the feature are already ready. But how to further double down on that investment, right? We hired Dr. XD and also invested in a lot of the GPUs as well, our team, and we have a high confidence and those AI features will have a customer rock, right? And also our strategy is very differentiated, right? First of all, have a federated AI approach. And also the way we look at those AI features, how to help a customer improve productivity, that's very important, right? And because the customer already like us, not like some others, right, who gave you a so-called free services and then your AI features price. That's not our case, right? We really care about the customer value and also add more and more innovations. At the same time, the way for us to look at innovations not only for incremental innovation in terms of revenue AI but also how to lever the AI due to some brand new services to innovate, to deliver more value than customer expected. That's where we can monetize to lever the AI technology. That's why we keep investing more. Again, the goal is about some brand new AI services like Zoom a lot of other services we are going to build it down the road. So stay tuned for the Zoomtopia.\nJames Fish: Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Kelly.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew VanVliet, BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the trends you're seeing in the Contact Center. Can you help us with what situations you're seeing the most success in or the most sort of Meetings and Phone? And then sort of within that, are you seeing more sort of internal help desk-type situations? Or are you seeing kind of higher volume customer-facing deployments as well?\nEric Yuan: Yeah, Matt. It's a great question. First of all, I can tell you, take a Zoom Phone for example. We already deployed the Contact Center Zoom since a year ago, right? And our support team are very happy about our own deployment. It works extremely well, right? Because all those innovations and integrations on customers, right, for sure a loss of innovations every quarter. But the brand recognition, right, it still -- will take some time. That's why quite often all the existing customers, they would likely deploy Zoom Contact Center integration very well with the Zoom Phone and also they a new use case like internal hyperdesk, IT hyperdesk as At the same time, we also have some Contact Center customers no have a Zoom Phone, they don't have a Zoom Meetings. They like a Contact Center. I think given the speed of innovation, I think we have a higher confidence not only SMB but also more and more customer when realize the value of Zoom and Zoom Contact Center, I think something similar to what we did for Zoom Phone as well, right? When we started on existing customer realize, wow, there's a huge value and why not a try or tested out Zoom Contact Center as well, right? So that's the pass for our – to further grow our Contact Center business.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Needham\nRyan Koontz: Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the healthy growth we're seeing here in the $100,000 accounts. Is that primarily displacement of legacy vendors that we're still seeing or are these other kind of competitive wins, greenfield-type wins? And can you share anything about kind of the effective playbook you're using up market there to expand these big logo wins? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. I think some of that, Ryan, points to the ongoing success we're seeing with Zoom One. Customers really like the ability to buy the bundle, which meets all of their needs. And it's a great opportunity to see the value, especially previously existing Meetings customers seeing that opportunity. We do continue to see greenfield, especially Eric just highlighted Contact Center. Sometimes it's a way that they're coming in the door now, which is amazing. And then also, we still have a lot of customers that are Meetings customers that are upgrading to Phone as well. So it's a combination of both new customers that come in at that level as well as customers that grow up to that level over time.\nRyan Koontz: Got it. Any general changes in the pricing environment market?\nKelly Steckelberg: No, especially from Q1 to Q2, there were won't really significant changes. As I mentioned, there's still think lots of scrutiny around the yields, but no other real changes in the environment.\nRyan Koontz: Got it. Real helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: All right. Thanks for taking my question. My question on Contact Center again. That is -- that's a huge opportunity considering like 80% legacy still here to move to cloud. And you are starting from a clean slate, just building yourself in-house. So Eric, how are you trying to differentiate, I mean, among other cloud vendors right now in the Contact Center space. And Kelly, should you think about this Contact Center next leg of growth? Is this adoption should be like Phone what we have seen in the last few years?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So speaking of differentiation, first of all, we built the Contact Center service from ground up, right? This is the new architecture and also video is part of that as well. AI as AI components, we invested in AI and also, at the same time, a seamless integration with other products as well. That's why we have a high confidence, right? And all like some other vendors there for a long, long time, right? And the architecture may not be modern and the performance, the quality and so on and so forth, right? However, how to make sure every Enterprise customer during their RV process, right? They do look at Zoom. When they look at Zoom, we have a higher confidence, we can't compete. And also, we just had a lot of innovations around the Workforce Management platform as well and essentially Zoom Content Center to become our full Contact Center suite. Not just one part, right? It's targeted SMB and Enterprise and also with AI, I think we are innovating very fast, right, to compete against any other cloud-based or on-prem based and Contact Center vendors.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: And is that going to be similar like Phone kind of adoption? [Multiple Speakers]\nEric Yuan: Yes. Sorry, go ahead -- yes.\nKelly Steckelberg: Only six quarters old today. So it's very relative, right, to the existing ARR base. It's small. It's growing very quickly, though. So it won't be visible to you probably for at least another four -- I don't know, four to five to six quarters, probably, but we’re really pleased with the growth. And then as Eric mentioned, when you start considering Workforce Management, of course, Zoom Virtual Agent, Quality Management, which is coming, it starts to be a platform itself that could really be a significant growth driver over time.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: [indiscernible] Zoomtopia.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Hey, Eric. Hey, Kelly. Thanks so much for taking my question. Two quick ones. First, look, I appreciate a lot of the investments you're making around generative AI. And I know it's early, but I want to think about how do you think longer term about your strategy around monetizing generative AI? Is it around specific modules and discretionally charging for them? Is it about gatekeeping them behind higher tiers and using that to drive upgrades? And maybe alongside that, you're starting to see better adoption, I think, of your noncore products, including Zoom Phone $0.5 billion in ARR. Eric, you called out some great customer wins on Zoom Chat. How do you think about using generative AI as kind of a connective tissue to drive more usage of noncore products and maybe even of the entire Zoom One pricing packaging? Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. That's a wonderful question. So look at the Zoom platform, right, so not only do we have Meetings, right? So some people still sort of we're just a Meeting company [indiscernible] of a full company, right? For those customers, we deployed like Team Chat, USPS deployed Zoom Team Chat. A lot of companies deployed the Zoom Phone and Whiteboard Zoom Contact Center as well Scheduler and also the Zoom Clips. As we build more and more services, right, and essentially, when we double on our platform, how to look at everything from a customer perspective, how to add more value? Let's take a Zoom One, for example. Customers say, I really like Zoom, already paid a platform. A lot of features to take this generative features like Meeting summary and to leverage GenAI to Team Chat and meeting inquiry and let's say, you are late to the meeting, how to get a quick real-time summary about what had been discussed over the past 5 minutes. All those GenAI features can make the entire platform, not only sticky, but also more value, right? So quite often, some customers say, yes, you can charge and some other competitors do that. We are taking a different approach. We think if you add more value to customers, and they are doing more -- were likely to move on to our entire platform, right? It does not mean we cannot monetize AI. How do you think about AI to build new services, right? [indiscernible] one example. Back to 1995, 1996, I mean Internet was sort of born, when every -- let's say, the stores, right, when they Internet, you do not want to increase the price, right? You buy online, why increase price? However, you can have the Internet to build new services, right, new innovations. That's why we're taking a different approach, not as some other competitors. They gave us free service AI, oh my god, they charge you a crazy price. I do not think that’s fair to customers, right? And we are taking a different approach and more value to leverage GenAI to our existing customers focus on the future improvements to leverage GenAI. At the same time, given our speed of innovation, how to leverage GenAI to build some brand new AI services to monetize. That’s our goal. That’s our direction. That’s our differentiated pricing strategy as well. Hopefully, my answer is clear. Otherwise, let’s talk more at Zoomtopia.\nRishi Jaluria: Yeah. Very helpful. I’m looking forward to it. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolf Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, so when I sit back and look at the quarter, this quarter looks a little bit different than last quarter. You grew sequentially your revenue base on Enterprise and Online for the first time together in some time where both of those things happen. Your Enterprise billings actually grew as well. And so I look at the guidance, and it looks like we're taking a step back, and I appreciate the conservatism in the macroeconomic environment. I appreciate the fact that you've got changes you're still working through in the go-to-market. But help us understand, if we look at the trends as they -- as churn stabilized to a point where we can expect, for instance, on the Online business that this is a new floor we can count on. Because if I look at the exit rate for Enterprise revenue, I don't think it's at the rate that any of us sitting here would be jumping up and down about you mentioned NRR on the Enterprise side starting to -- I think you said in but maybe go back up in the first half of next year, what's the right way to interpret the Enterprise growth exiting this year and into next year? And then I've got a quick follow-up.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So in terms of Online, I would say that we are very pleased with the performance that we're seeing in the churn rate itself. And I do think we're stabilizing around a new level that is back to historic levels. And I think that's a reasonable assumption to make going forward. And then in terms of Enterprise, we're obviously not in a place that we're going to comment on FY '25 yet. We're not going to do that on this call. But Enterprise, when you look at it from -- I don't say this for you. When you look at it in terms of the growth rate that you're expecting, you've been back into, right, what it is. And we are, as you say, still considering no improvement from the macro at this point. And as you said, continuing to have the sales force settle into our new structure. We're thrilled to have Graeme leading the organization. We -- some of the transitions took a little bit longer in EMEA and APAC than the rest of the world, as you've heard us talk about. But as we're coming into Q3, the pipeline is strong. It's stronger than it was as we were coming into Q2. So I think those are the factors you can take into consideration as you're looking for the growth rate for the rest of the year.\nAlex Zukin: Okay. And then maybe, Eric, for you. Obviously, the evolution of Zoom from a point solution to a platform is nice to watch. You've talked about Zoom One. You've now given us that $500 million annualized number for Zoom Phone. What's the penetration today for Zoom One within the Enterprise base? And what's the penetration for the Phone product in the Enterprise base? And where does it go from here in your mind, like what does success look like for you?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. I think Zoom Phone penetration is doing relatively well. But Zoom One, I think still we had a huge opportunity, right? Zoom one is not only for Zoom Meetings, the Phone, right? Also the Team Chat, if the customer wanted to deploy our free Team Chat solution and Whiteboard and a lot of other services, right, I think a huge opportunity, especially for medium and larger-sized customers and we needed to kind of share them the value. As I said earlier, about like GenAI features, all those kind of things is part of Zoom One, right? So leverage all those up, the cool features, right to penetrate more about Zoom One the market share, right? And Zoom Phone itself doing right at well, but a huge opportunity ahead of us for Zoom One penetration. And I will say we just started. I give one example. I take USPS, for example. When the reader is wow, you have a greater Team Chat solution is also part of Zoom One and also it's free. That's amazing, [indiscernible] why not deploy Zoom One, right? So many more customers when they realize the full potential of a Zoom One platform, I think that's the value, right? We need to do focus on.\nAlex Zukin: Thank you, guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Weed with Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. And maybe this kind of follows up a little bit of what Alex just getting at. But first off, I want to say it's really exciting to see the progress on Zoom Phone and Contact Center. It's been amazing to watch that and all the checks I do with folks are very positive on things that are going there. I think, Kelly, you commented a few minutes ago and were to think with Alex here, that NRR may come down a bit before it starts reaccelerating maybe by the end of this fiscal year and maybe the beginning of next year, we start to see some line of sight to some benefit there. I'd really love to kind of dig into like what will drive that improvement? And kind of when split the customer base, you do a really nice job of reporting bolt-on greater than 100,000 and less than 100,000, like some quick math suggests where it's been really painful recently is on the greater than 100,000 customers. And I tried to figure out like on that reacceleration is it about kind of reigniting those greater than 100,000 is the opportunity with the less than $100,000, like growing them up because they're less mature. And like really what is it that you are going to be delivering with these customers to reignite that between those customer bases?\nKelly Steckelberg: So one of the things I commented on is that we have seen some dislocation in our customers' own employee base and that our sales reps do a great job when they're talking to those customers about helping them potentially right size if they have downsize in their employee base, but upselling and retaining that revenue in other parts of our platform. So that -- as is there's still pressure in the macroeconomic environment, you're going to see that a little bit, right? So maintaining logos, even maintaining the same amount of revenue, but would have been an upsell, if not for a down sell due to seat. So part of it is just an ongoing potential change in the macro, which we have not factored into the guidance that we gave. And then the continued acceleration of all these new products that we keep talking about, right? Phone is obviously doing really well. And it's well hit its stride. But remember, that's taken three to four years to accomplish. And so Contact Center that we expect to follow the same is just -- it just needs a little more time. And then you heard about all the additions into the Contact Center platform itself with ZDA, with Workforce Management and Quality Management that's coming, all of those will continue contribute to growth over time. And then Eric sort of hinted thinking about the ways that AI over time is going to help with both retention as well as potential opportunity to grow revenue. So it's just -- some of these things just have to grow a little bit or age a little bit and mature into the stage that they're contributing in a way that you can see them.\nPeter Weed: And how high do you anticipate NRR being able to get once all that stuff works out? I mean, obviously, you've seen some of those headwinds. So you kind of know how much you're like I lost this and it would have been so much better. Like if you're looking forward, like what should we aspire to be getting NRR back to? And like how soon do you think we can get there?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Peter, we'll talk about that more when we're ready to give FY '25 guidance, but not today.\nEric Yuan: Yeah, I can take a little bit more, Peter. So the question you asked was very similar to what about Zoom One. Actually, today, the problem is Zoom is a too strong brand on Meetings side, right, right? Many of the customers unfortunately, they even did not realize we have a lot of other services, not to mention a Zoom One platform, right? That's the number one challenge that we are facing. How to make sure all those – even existing – even for existing customers. They also think Zoom just a meeting, that’s not the case, right? When we and share a greater story, make sure most of our customers are publicly realize our Zoom not only just the meetings had a full platform, I think the inflection point will not happen until then.\nPeter Weed: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Taz Koujalgi with Wedbush.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions. First one for Kelly. I think you had a price increase for the Online business in Q1, and that was being phased out, I think, in different geos at different times. Has that been rolled out across the globe? And if you can comment on any tailwind you saw from that price increase in the Q2 Online business?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So it has been very effective in general in terms of maintaining strong retention rates and moving customers from monthly to annual as they continue to see value when we rolled out this price increase. And given that it's been in effect for the full time now, we're not going to break out, but it break it out separately, but it certainly is overall having a great impact including in the momentum for our Online and it is -- I believe it's live in every market at this point.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Got it. And then one follow-up on Contact Center. I know it's just pretty early you've just started -- you've just had your first early customers. But any comments on price points you're seeing and attach rate of seats. So let's say a customer has 100 seats of Zoom Meeting, when customers buy a Contact Center, what is kind of the attach rate that you're seeing for these early customers?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. It's -- I mean it's very different, right, in terms of it's not anywhere near, like Phone, typically is near one to one and sometimes even more one to one attach rate. Contact Center is very different. It depends on the use case we're seeing of the customers. If it's an internal help desk, or if it's like -- one of our largest deals to date was a BPO, where it is their business, right, to drive Contact Center. So I don't think there's necessarily a standard ratio that you can look at because it varies so much based on use cases. And then in terms of pricing, as a reminder, our list price for Contact Center is highly disruptive. It's $70 per seat. And given -- comparing that, it's -- given comparing it to the other competitors in the market, it's a really -- I think it brings a lot of value to our customers. So while Enterprise customers and large customers are going to get discounts, we've certainly been able to manage to maintain price points, given how disruptive and competitive it is compared to others in the market.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Guys, sneaking just one more clarification. Kelly, you mentioned that we won't have visibility into Contact Center revenues for another four to six quarters. It's still very early. Were you implying that it will be close to 10% of revenues in four to six quarters?\nKelly Steckelberg: No. I don't mean to imply that at all. I just mean that I see laughing -- that over time, you started to see Zoom Phone and we talked about like more milestone metrics and how it was contributing, that's what I was saying. I mean that would be the best growth rate if that were to occur.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Got it. Thank you guys. Thanks a lot.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Stotler with William Blair.\nMatthew Stotler: Hey. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on Zoom Phone. If I look at the disclosure this quarter, $500 million ARR and last quarter, Zoom Phone 10% of revenue. The implication would be something in the ballpark of, let's say, 10%, maybe a little more sequentially in terms of growth for Zoom Phone ARR. I'll just dig into -- or double-click on, I guess, what's driving that growth, right? Is that indicative of the success we're seeing is Zoom One? Is that evidence of go-to-market maturity there? Is it some large customers like the BPO you just mentioned kind of ramping up? Anything you'd like to call out there?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. I mean, actually, Matt, it's all of the above is what I would say. It's -- as we've taken -- as we are talking to our customers about renewals, taking the opportunity to talk to them about the value of Zoom One or talking about just helping them -- I think every CFO and CIO across the world today is trying to think about how do they drive more efficiencies in their organization and Zoom Phone is a great way to do that when you look at it compared to the ROI, especially of having an on-prem solution. And then also with Contact Center -- Contact Center is a driving force, Zoom Phone is a very natural adjacency to it. So I think it's a combination of all of that, and it's just going to continue to create more and more synergies as Zoom Contact Center especially continues to mature.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Just quickly, when we talk with our customers, they really like we have a both -- they deploy both Zoom Meeting and Zoom Phone together. The Contact Center, a new opportunity, in particular, for those customers I think they don't want to deploy a point of solution, right? If you just have a Phone business, it's really hard to build a sustainable business customer Phone and Meetings, some of – they’re very similarly integration, like you have a phone call, one more click and jump on the video meeting, right? So that’s – that kind of a similar experience really helped us further our Phone growth, right? If you just offer a point of solution, it’s really not scalable, not a sustainable. And down the road, more and more customers would like to move on platform play like a Zoom.\nMatthew Stotler: Got it. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with Moffett Nathanson.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Sterling.\nSterling Auty: Hey, guys. All right. Kelly, for the Online outlook, how much of this is that -- because it seems like the Online guidance is a little bit worse than what we had before. How much of this is macro? How much of this is execution? And Eric, one for you. When we think about AI and all the innovation that you're driving, how much of that AI innovation is just going to be driving and differentiating the core Zoom products versus bringing a premium monetization kind of pricing model or specific AI SKUs?\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, do you want to go first?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So first of all, in terms of Online study. I know you have an account. Hopefully, you still have account. And for sure, it can contribute to our Online growth. So speaking about AI, I think we are taking a different approach. As I said earlier, from an architecture perspective, it's different, federated AI. In terms of monetization, right, again, we look at it how to leverage GenAI to improve our core Meeting experience and deliver more value, make the services more sticky Zoom always offer more and more features values. And at the same time, we do not kind of charge price, increase the price a lot at all, right? That's right, we build a trust. They want to go to for Zoom Phone platform. At the same time, GenAI does bring huge opportunity like in terms of monetization, in terms of the new service. As I said earlier, how to leverage GenAI to build some branded new service. You cannot only turn on low-hanging fruits. You already deployed this service. I have a GenAI feature now, you need to pay crazy price. I do not think that's sustainable. A customer do not like it. right? That's our approach, how to leverage GenAI to make sure existing customer happy and leverage GenAI to build new services focused on innovation, innovation and innovation. That's our approach.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric. And Sterling, in terms of Online, I would say we're pleased with the execution and where you see that is the ongoing stabilization in the churn rate. That, I think, has been really, really well done and stabilized over the last 4 quarters now. And I think that's a really great indication of the ongoing improvements of the platform, the buy flow, the movement of customers from monthly to annual where we do see some ongoing headwinds is in the overall macro, which is driving more for the top of the funnel. And that's where when the team continue to focus on new pricing packages, new payment currencies, things they can focus on to expand the top of the funnel so that over time and then eventually starting to add new products as well that can be sold online. That's what will eventually drive this. Ideally, we want it to not only be stable but to be a growth driver as well.\nSterling Auty: Makes sense.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Sterling.\nOperator: Okay. We have time for one more question. And that last question goes to William Power with Baird.\nWilliam Power: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking me in. Maybe one more question on Contact Center. Great to see the traction there. I wonder if perhaps, Eric, if you can update us on where you are with respect to go to market? I know that has been a big focus. How much more room and opportunity is there on that front? And then I guess the second part of that is it feels like there's a big opportunity with respect to AI Contact Center being a new entrant, how do you think about the opportunity for whether it's virtual or other capabilities to help you be even more disruptive in that market?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Great question. So yes, speaking of go-to-market, I think on product front, we have a high, high confidence innovation speed, we have so many features and Workforce Management, a lot of other features are being introduced every quarter. In terms of go-to-market, I think not like what we did before for Meetings, right, by and large, more like primarily driven by [indiscernible] business, Contact Center is different. For sure, we need to double down, triple down on the indirect channel, right, embrace all the sort of partners and master agent and so on so forth. And we need to invest more on that front. And essentially, this is one of the things why not like Zoom Phone [indiscernible] accelerated revenue, but even have a greater Contact Center product. As you see the progress on go-to market front, I think that we will see the great result. And in terms of AI, not like other vendors, right, they already have Contact Center solution for a long, long time. When you look at AI kind of architecture and flexible, right, how to add AI to that to all those existing leaders the Contact Center. We already realized the importance of AI, right? That's why we have a very flexible architecture. Not only do we build organic AI features but also acquired Solvvy and also the Virtual Agent and so on and so forth. Organic growth and also the acquisition certainly help us a lot in terms of product innovation. And AI is going to put a big look for the Contact Center. We have higher confidence we can do very well on that front.\nWilliam Power: Thank you.\nA – Eric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. This concludes our Q&A. I would now like to pass things back to Eric for closing comments.\nEric Yuan: Thank you all for joining us for the Q2 earnings call. I really appreciate for your great support and very, very beautiful. And thank you. Appreciate.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: We thank you all for your participation, and we look forward to seeing you again. This concludes today's conference. Enjoy the rest of your day.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Good-bye."

        "content": "Kelcey McKinley: Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's Q1 FY '24 Earnings Release Webinar. As a reminder, today's webinar is being recorded. And now, I will hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations. Tom, over to you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Kelcey. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. I’m joined today by Zoom’s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, and Zoom’s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.us. Also, on this page you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the first -- for second quarter and full fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding financial and business trends; impacts from the macroeconomic environment, our market position, opportunities, go-to-market initiatives, growth strategy and business aspirations; and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make on today’s webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Hey. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, everyone for joining us today. As we continue to execute on the strategic focuses, which I shared with you our last quarter, we are very grateful for the support, feedback and trust that we have received from our customers and investors. Last month, we closed our acquisition of Workvivo, which we are super excited about. Workvivo is a modern employee communication and engagement platform. Their solution combines a social intranet and employee app into one central hub, forming the heart of a company's digital ecosystem. Incorporating Workvivo's feature-rich technology into our all-in-one collaboration solution will allow us to offer Zoom customers, a unified platform that keeps knowledge workers and frontline employees informed, engaged, and connected throughout the workday, regardless of in-person, remote, or hybrid work style. According to Enterprise Apps Today, communicative employers have mobile workers who are 5 times more productive and feel 3 times less burned out. The Workvivo team is working very hard to capitalize on this opportunity and is 100% aligned with our culture of delivering happiness to customers and employees. We are so excited to join forces with Workvivo and help our customers raise the bar for employee communication and engagement. Last quarter, we reiterated our strong positioning in AI, and highlighted our expanded vision to see generative AI permeate and elevate productivity across our portfolio. In Q1, we made considerable progress towards that vision. We outlined our approach to AI is to drive forward solutions that are federated, empowering and responsible. Federated means flexible and customizable to businesses’ unique scenarios and nomenclature. Empowering refers to building solutions that improve individual and team productivity as well as enhance the customer experience. And responsible means customer control of their data with an emphasis on privacy, security, trust and safety. At Enterprise Connect, we unveiled ZoomIQ’s new set of in-beta features leveraging generative AI to support Chat and Email compose, and meeting summary. We are also building new features to summarize long chat threads, catch up tardy meeting participants on what they missed, and brainstorm in Whiteboard. Last week, we announced our strategic investment in Anthropic, an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. Our partnership with Anthropic further bolsters our federated approach to AI by allowing Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude, to be integrated across Zoom’s entire platform. We plan to begin by layering Claude into our Contact Center portfolio, which includes Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Virtual Agent, and now in-beta Zoom Workforce Engagement Management. With Claude guiding agents toward trustworthy resolutions and powering self-service for end-users, companies will be able to take customer relationships to the next level. Now moving on to some of our customer wins. I would like to thank Major League Baseball. MLB has long used the power of the broader Zoom Platform to strengthen its connection to fans and teams. And this quarter, we expanded our relationship by launching a first-of-its-kind partnership that leverages Zoom Contact Center to enhance real-time replay reviews and deliver increased transparency to baseball fans. By introducing Zoom technologies into operations on and off the field, MLB strives to create an engaging and unique experience for its fans and teams. I would like to thank Virginia Tech for expanding our relationship by adding more than 10,000 Zoom Phone seats as well as Zoom Contact Center to their Zoom Meetings deployment. We brought responsiveness, reliability and regulatory compliance to this large expansion and Virginia Tech leverage Zoom’s unified communications platform to build a next-gen solution integrated across meetings, phone and contact center, to serve the entire university community. I would also like to thank Vensure Employer Services, which has grown its workforce significantly the past few years through hiring and M&A. In Q1, Vensure expanded their existing footprint with us by adding approximately 10,000 Zoom Phone Seats and 800 Zoom Contact Center seats, as well as our AI-powered Zoom Virtual Agent and Zoom IQ for sales. It is so exciting to see customers leverage our natively integrated Phone plus Contact Center solutions and invest in our next generation AI-enabled products across their businesses. Finally, I want to thank My Plan Manager, Australia's leading services provider for the National Disability Insurance Program. MPM chose Zoom Contact Center for its attractive total cost of ownership, the deep integration with salesforce, and the vision and future roadmap for customer experience. And our journey did not end with Contact Center. Appreciating the value of the platform, they also decided to standardize on Zoom One. We are so happy to partner with MPM to help them deliver a world-class customer and employee experience to their clients and disability service providers. Again, thank you so much MLB, Virginia Tech, Vensure Services, MPM, and all of our customers worldwide. And with that, I’ll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric and hello, everyone. We are pleased that we beat our top-line and profitability guidance in Q1. Here are a few milestones: first, our non-GAAP gross margin of 80.5% exceeded our long term target; second, after adjusting for the three fewer days in the quarter, our Online revenue was slightly up sequentially; and last, the moment you have all been waiting for, Zoom Phone surpassed 10% of revenue in the quarter. In Q1, total revenue came in at $1.105 billion, up 3% year-over-year and 5% in constant currency. This result was approximately $20 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise business grew 13% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue, up from 52% a year ago. As I mentioned in the quarterly milestones, our Online business improved meaningfully in the quarter as it benefited from many initiatives including the price increase and buy flow optimization. In addition, we saw Online average monthly churn decrease to 3.1%, from 3.6% in Q1 of FY ‘23, and 3.4% last quarter. We are pleased that this part of our business is stabilizing sooner than expected. The number of Enterprise customers grew 9% year-over-year to approximately 215,900. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q1 came in at 112%. We saw 23% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,580 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 29% of revenue, up from 24% in Q1 of FY ‘23, and span diverse industries such as healthcare, education, government, and more. As expected, we did experience some distraction across the global sales team due to the previously announced headcount reduction and subsequent sales reorganization. Despite the distraction, our Americas revenue grew 8% year-over-year, while EMEA and APAC declined by 8% and 5%, respectively. The decline in EMEA was primarily attributable to the outsized impact of the headcount reduction due to local regulations prolonging the process, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the stronger dollar. The decline in APAC was primarily attributable to the stronger dollar. Moving on to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities, restructuring expenses, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 80.5%, an improvement from 78.6% in Q1 of last year and 79.8% last quarter. We are pleased that we have achieved our long term target as we drove sequential improvement mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers. For FY ‘24, we still expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 79.5%, reflecting additional investments in new AI technologies. Research and development expense grew by 25% year-over-year to approximately $106 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 9.6% from 7.9% in Q1 of last year, reflecting our investments in expanding our product portfolio including Zoom Contact Center, AI, and more. Looking ahead, innovation will remain a top priority for Zoom. Sales and marketing expense grew by 4% year-over-year to $278 million. This represented approximately 25.2% of total revenue, up from 24.9% in Q1 of last year. G&A expense declined by 10% to $84 million or approximately 7.6% of total revenue, down from 8.6% in Q1 of last year, as we focused on achieving greater back office efficiencies and savings. Non-GAAP operating income expanded to $422 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $379 million. This translates to a 38.2% non-GAAP operating margin, an improvement from 37.2% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.16, on approximately 304 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.18 above the high end of our guidance and 13% higher than Q1 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.4 billion, up 3% year-over-year from $1.3 billion. This is slightly above our guidance and primarily driven by renewals during our largest seasonal renewal quarter. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year from $3 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 59% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 63% in Q1 of FY ‘23 and 56% in Q4 of FY ‘23. The sequential increase in current RPO as a percentage of total RPO was primarily due to shorter contract durations in recent Enterprise deals arising from uncertainty in the macro environment. We expect Q2 deferred revenue to be down 2% to 4% year-over-year, which takes into account the recent trend of shorter durations on Enterprise deals and our renewal seasonality, which peaks in Q1 and declines throughout the year. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $418 million, as compared to $526 million in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow was $397 million, as compared to $501 million in Q1 of last year. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins were 37.9% and 35.9%, respectively. Due to a net legal settlement expected to occur later this year, we are revising our cash flow outlook for FY ‘24. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.19 billion. In FY ‘24 and going forward, we expect our smallest cash tax payments to occur in Q1, and the largest to occur in Q2. Now, turning to guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.11 billion to $1.115 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth, or 2% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $405 million to $410 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.04 to $1.06 based on approximately 307 million shares outstanding. As our Online business is stabilizing, we wanted to give you all some additional one-time color on how we see it playing out in the coming quarters. We expect our Online revenues to be approximately $480 million in Q2 and be relatively flat thereafter in FY ‘24. We are pleased to raise our top-line and profitability outlook for the full year of FY ‘24. We now expect revenues to be in the range of $4.465 billion to $4.485 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 2% year-over-year growth, or 3% in constant currency. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.63 billion to $1.65 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 37%. Our tax rate is expected to approximate the U.S. federal and both state blended rate. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $4.25 to $4.31, based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. As we look to reignite growth and maintain strong profitability, we are committed to doing so in the right way. We are pleased to have recently issued our second ESG report, which includes additional data regarding our greenhouse gas emissions inventory, and recommits Zoom to achieving 100% renewable energy for our direct operations by 2030. Our core value of care is as important as ever. It’s embedded in how our product fosters emissions reductions, while supporting inclusiveness. It is also evident in our corporate and employee giving. You heard it from Eric. We are innovating extremely quickly to bring our customers the immense benefits of generative AI and empower modern collaboration. We are trusted and loved by our amazing and diverse set of customers. And we are fortunate to be one of the most recognized brands in the world. In Q1, we made some very tough decisions related to team size, structure and incentives that have understandably caused distraction in the short term, but at the same time exemplify our commitment to long-term growth and profitability. With a focus on the future, we have refreshed our mission and vision: One platform delivering limitless human connection. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors. With that, Kelcey, please queue up our first question.\nA - Kelcey McKinley: Thank you so much, Kelly. As Kelly mentioned, we will now move into the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Goldman Sachs' Kash Rangan. Kash, go ahead and come on video for us and unmute if you would, please. All right. Well, hearing no response. We'll go ahead and move on to Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: All right. I think I got mine to work. Perfect. Appreciate it. I noted that you were taking down kind of -- or not taking down, but giving back some of the gross margin upside that you saw in the quarter and noted that, that was for some of your AI investments. Eric, I guess I'm just wondering, how you're judging kind of build versus buy when it comes to AI or just where to leverage kind of the ecosystem of AI development that's going on versus investments that you want to make? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Good question. I think it looks like everyone seem to have just woken up to AI. Actually, we have been busy on AI front for a few years, if you look at the past several – two of the largest acquisitions, right, Solvvy and Kites, right, all of the AI-based. Internally, we also have AI team as well because we understand the importance of AI in particular during recently by the generative AI momentum. I think, first of all, we do have our own AI team. We have our own internally developed AI models as well. We also will take up a very open approach. Essentially, we announced our federated approach to AI. We announced the collaboration with the Open AI, Enterprise Connect. We also doubled on our partnership with Anthropic recently as well and down the road maybe some open source AI models available, we are also going to embrace that. Again, we look at everything from end user perspective, right? First of all, we have a team really dedicated on AI. And also, when we sit down with the customers, some customers say, yes, really like Anthropic model. Yes, why not. We doubled on that partnership, we know we can leverage their API as well, right? So we are taking a federated approach which is to put a customer centric, right? That's why we are very, very excited about this AI momentum can truly improve our product experience.\nMeta Marshall: All right. Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And moving on to Michael Funk with Bank of America.\nMichael Funk: Yes. Hi. Thank you, guys. Another question for you, Eric, if I could. Some more detail on how you think about AI integrating into your own platform. Do you think about it more as an enhancement or as a separate SKU? And then how do you monetize AI within your platform?\nEric Yuan: It's a good question. I would say the answer is about both. You take our Zoom IQ for sales, for example, right? It's extremely important, right? When you send all the salespeople back at the home or work remotely, how to help them to improve their productivity. That's the reason why we announced the Zoom IQ for sales and even way before the generative AI momentum, right? And internally developed large language models really help us, right? We can monetize that AI empowered Zoom IQ for sales product. At the same time, you look at our feature-rich collaboration portfolio, like a meeting summary, the e-mail and compose a chat message and Zoom Contact Center and Virtual Agent and also recently in beta, right, Workforce Management Solution as well, all of them will be empowered based on AI, the platform, right? So on the one hand, we leverage AI to look at almost every features we have to empower those features and also elevate the customer -- the product experience. At the same time, a lot of monetization opportunities, right? Zoom IQ for sales is just one example, right, as a real more opportunity for us. Again, we think AI does bring tremendous opportunity for us because we focus on communication, I think Workvivo, for example, right, we just acquired them in the employee communication and engagement [Indiscernible], how to leverage AI to improve that product experience that is another example. Again, full of opportunities here at Zoom with AI.\nMichael Funk: Great. Thank you, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: All right. So let's go to Kash again with Goldman Sachs. Kash, I think you're out there driving, so he's going to stay off video.\nKasthuri Rangan: Exactly. Thank you very much. I appreciate you watching out for my safety. But just so you know that I'm not a bot, I'm a human. I just will turn on that video very quickly on. So Eric, I'm curious to get your take. So I want you to, if you don't mind, drill a little bit deeper to generative AI and while a lot of software companies are announcing partnerships with LLMs based on the content and data that they uniquely process, we're also at a point where many companies are identifying very unique workflows and productivity scenarios that differentiate them going forward, right? So in that regard, just so there's a scenario everybody in UCaaS will ultimately have a generative AI strategy. So when you start to have these LLMs work with your core products and given the vast user base and behaviors that you've contained in your knowledge base, how do you think Zoom is uniquely qualified to get productivity scenarios that are very unique to Zoom? Sorry for using the same word again, that could be more enduring as a source of competitive advantage because the first chapter of UCaaS was all about providing the core capability of the technology, which you did an amazing job of but I'm curious, the next leg of productivity growth and how you can take this company forward? Thanks so much.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Good questions. We have a great integration with the Tesla cars, right? If you use drive a Tesla, just one click and join the call. Even if you can’t come over the video, the audio will be always on anyway. So back to your AI question, I think, first of all, if you look at the generative AI, two things is very important, right? So first of all, if you do not start years back, just given what's going on in AI industry, AI world, you say, oh my god, a lot of things. However, we already started investing in AI, a few years back. We should understand that. The reason why our Zoom IQ for sales was developed based on our own internally developed large language models. Having said that, there are two things really important. One is just the model, right? Open AI has modeled Anthropic and Facebook as well, Google and those companies. But most important thing is, how to leverage these modules to fine-tune based on your proprietary data, right? That is extremely important. When it comes to collaboration, communication, right? Take a Zoom Employee, for example. We have so many meetings, right, and talk about every day, like our Sales team use the Zoom call with the customers. We accumulate a lot of, let's say, internal meeting data. How to fine tune the model with this data. It's very important, right? Not only just for the AI model itself because it will evolve for sure and also we're also going to embrace. At the same time, how to leverage our proprietary data to fine-tune these AI models towards our industry, that's very important. Look at -- take a meeting, for example, right? I think that this is probably we have way more data than anybody else, right, given all the past many years’ experience, how to fine tune that model with those data. And I think this is our unique -- will help us to deliver unique experience to customers. If any other company, you may have, let's say, you have a greater AI model, however, how to fine-tune it. It's a lot of effort, right? That's the reason why we think that's something unique for us to truly empower AI to deliver a differentiated experience to our customers.\nKasthuri Rangan: Thank you so much Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nKelcey McKinley: So sorry, please continue. Okay. We'll move on to Tom Blakey with KeyBanc.\nThomas Blakey: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly and Eric, good to see you guys. There are some - a large competitor of yours has been the news lately with Microsoft possibly needing to create a separate SKU for their teams -- Team's product in terms of debundling that product. I know how important the collaboration component is to Zoom's vision of becoming the communications operating system for large enterprises and just noting with Kelly's updated color in terms of Online with that -- with the Online business stabilizing, which is great. The implied guide for the enterprise business is for pretty good decel into the second half. So just wondering, how Zoom is thinking about, if at all, the potential impact or opportunity there just to get an understanding of the importance of the collaboration component to your product? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: As we noted, we talked about earlier in the quarter, I don't think that the adjustment that you're seeing is necessarily related to competition and more due to as we expected, some distraction internally due to the reorganization, but we feel great about the structure of our sales organization now with Graham, especially as our Chief Sales Officer; and Wendy leading the online team and that we've made the hard decisions to get them focused and ready now to execute for the rest of the year. And we're just looking forward to seeing that come to light over the next couple of quarters.\nThomas Blakey: Okay. Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: Our next question will come from Parker Lane with Stifel.\nParker Lane: Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Kelly, I was hoping you could give us a better understanding of just how -- to what degree contract duration is actually compressed during the quarter? How much that will be an impact as we progress through the year? Is that more of a factor in any particular product set or was it pretty much across the board?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. It was pretty uniformly across our direct segment of the business, especially [Technical Difficulty] thing to be thoughtful about every decision, which is every buying decision, I should say, which is not new. It's just taking -- giving themselves time to make sure that they are getting the product deployed, and we expect it to be not long term in nature. But in order to reflect that, we updated our guidance based on, as we talked about deferred revenue as well for the coming quarter.\nParker Lane: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: We will now hear from Peter Levine with Evercore.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Peter.\nPeter Levine: Thank you for taking my question. Maybe, Eric, one for you is when you think about the use case of AI and you think across like phone, video, contact center, where do you envision seeing the most kind of uplift in terms of client adoption of AI? Just curious to know where you're seeing that today.\nEric Yuan: I think on many fronts, right, like take Anthropic investing, for example, right? For sure, we are going to lever that not only for the entire portfolio, but we are going to start from a contact center, the virtual agent and the contracts and the related features. We also look at our core meeting platform, right, in meeting summary. It is extremely important, right? And it's also we have our team chat solution and also how to lever that to compose a chat. Remember, last year, we also have email candidate as well. How do we leverage the generative AI to understand the context, right, and kind of bring all the information relative to you and help you also generate the message, right? When you send an e-mail back to customers or prospects, right, either China message or e-mail, right? We can lever to generate is, right? I think a lot of areas, even like you like say, maybe you might be later to the meeting, right? 10 minutes later, you joined the meeting. You really want to stand in what had happened, right? Can you get a quick summary over the positive minutes. Yeah. You just also have to generate AI as well. You also can get that as well. It's kind of almost a lot of key use cases, right? I think will be empowered by those AI capabilities. That's why we are looking at almost every area, right, how to leverage generate to improve that experience. We take an Open AI, for example. This is a great company and also a lot of companies are leveraging their AI, not only bigger companies, small companies, we also announced the collaboration with them at Enterprise Connect, right? So that's why, as I said earlier, three things, right? You understand the large lung model, how to fine tune that with your own data and also revisit almost every feature you have -- are there any ways to empower those features? Are there any ways to monetize. That's why we take a holistic approach and also we like our federated approach to AI. By the way, internally, we do have AI team. It should understand the large language models. It's not something other companies just have work for AI.\nPeter Levine: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: I'm moving on to Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Wonderful. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Eric, I want to stay on the AI train for a little bit. You've obviously talked about some great use cases and feels like there's a big opportunity. I want to ask about maybe the potential to start to verticalize some of the AI solutions because it feels like you have a huge opportunity around distribution, doing things like adding AI tools on top of videos for video interviews and giving real-time signals, for example? And I'm sure that's one being discussed internally. So I just want to understand maybe how are you thinking about that opportunity to verticalize? And is that something that can make maybe direct monetization a little bit more easy because the value prop is very straight out of the box? Thank you.\nEric Yuan: That's a great question. By the way, I download the Open AI mobile iOS app, I should ask open ChatGPT to answer to another question. But anyway, you are so right on. When it comes vertical, I would say, the opportunity. There are two things. One is a departmental level, another one is a vertical industry, right? You look at our Zoom IQ for Sales specifically targeted sales use case or sales department, right? Contact Center is for supported part. You're so right, down the road HR department in marketing, almost every department, they all use Zoom, right? How to leverage AI to build a differentiated solution, right? That is the opportunity. That's one opportunity. Another opportunity really about the vertical industry. Take health care, for example. Zoom by far is number one on telemedicine, right? How to leverage that, right? And with those proprietary data, right, and also working together with the customers, right, and fine tune this AI model, right? This is one example. Another example is a lot of law firms are also using Zoom as well, right? And how to lever the AI to truly empower those use cases is also another opportunity. I think as I said earlier, AI truly brings tremendous opportunity to us. So we got to leverage that. The good news, we're already heavily invested in this area for a few years.\nRishi Jaluria: Awesome. Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Rosenblatt Securities.\nCatharine Trebnick: I got it. Thank you. All right. In the last two years, a lot of changes has happened. First, everybody worked from home and now people are going back to the office. So has that actually changed any of your opportunities when you're looking at marketing, your products. I was thinking in terms of Zoom Room and then some of the areas where you want everybody to be equal in your Zoom Room viewing. So has that changed anything? Have you seen anything different from that?\nEric Yuan: Good questions. Good news is a question not about AI anymore. So you're so right. I think that during the COVID, right, as a lot of consumer use cases, right? Almost every family, you have with company account like a Zoom account, right? After the COVID, I think if you look at the usage, right, consumer-centric usage, I think, less and less. But however, to support a hybrid work, enterprise customers, they are going to leverage the video content more and more, not only just to support remote work. When you try to support hybrid work, how to reserve a desk, all those basic features, right? How to make sure when you join the meeting from the comp room, right, remote people, they can't see you, right? Not only just big square, right? So everyone who are sitting in the comp room, equally, we have a square as well as Zoom Square, right? So those kind of experiences extremely important, right? A lot of features are built upon enabling hybrid work, right? Even Workvivo is not example, right? During the hybrid work, right? Quite often, you can chat, you use the e-mail or use the phone call, meetings. But sometimes also want to announce a very exciting news and record a video how to distribute those to employees and sometimes even to customers, that's the reason why we acquired Workvivo as well. I think hybrid work is going to stay. That's the reason why a lot of new use cases, right? How to double down on that. Take [Indiscernible], for example, we have the smart gallery view feature, right? Customers like that. However, in some cases, customers are still down to work. I have a huge conference room, how do you support that? That's the reason why we are working on supporting three cameras, right? That's another way to embrace hybrid work. I think the hybrid work does bring another kind of huge opportunity to us, especially it's hard to convince everyone back to office five days a week. Even for us, even if I talked with many CEOs. Everyone wanted, right, sometimes you want these employees more. But however, this is kind of to let employees work anywhere, it sort of become a fashion. It's hard to force employees back in the home. That's why you have to embrace hybrid work. That's the reason why Zoom can play a much bigger role to support the hybrid work.\nCatharine Trebnick: All right. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And William Blair's Matt Stotler has the next question.\nMatthew Stotler: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just one on the contact center side. So you obviously continue to innovate on the product front for contact center. But last time, we got a deep update. There was still some honing that was needed on the go-to-market front. We'll just get an update on what you're seeing on that front, overall adoption of the Contact Center product suite? And then what you think are the keys to driving further adoption going forward?\nEric Yuan: Kelly, do you want to take it?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So our contact center leader is Scott Brown. He is a great addition to our team. And we are focusing from a go-to-market perspective now in the same way that we took Zoom Phone. We are hiring. We have some on board already, but we were hiring additional contact center specialists, who will act as an overlay team and be there to support the account executives to go in, as it's more of a technical sale and give them the opportunity to eventually over time, all become versed in how to sell Contact Center. So we're in the process of that today. And as I said, we've approved more reps. So we're excited about making the investment there.\nMatthew Stotler: Got it.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: Moving on to William Power with Baird.\nWilliam Power: Great. Thanks. Yeah. I want to ask a question on Online. It's great to see that segment play stabilizing. Maybe kind of two parts tied to that. Any early color with respect to the price increases and what you're seeing out of that? And as you look forward for the guidance for online, maybe just some broader framework for how you're thinking about both churn and top of funnel what gives you the confidence on both those fronts that this really is going to stabilize here?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we've seen a very positive reaction to the price increase. The -- when we came into the year and we were modeling it, we've actually seen better-than-expected retention rates in response to that. So that's been really great. As well as -- when he's done a lot of work around the online buy flow, which has also seen a very positive response. And then we've talked about it in the past, but there's a whole road map of other initiatives that are being worked on and continues to be added, including things like additional payment currencies, additional payment types and additional offerings. So those are all the top-of-the-funnel items you're referring to. And then they've also done a lot of work to the flow when people -- the cancellation flow when people come through, which is also contributing to the improved retention rates, and we feel great about them. Now they've been, it was 3.1% in Q3, 3.4% in Q4 and now 3.1% again or maybe -- yeah, 3.4% and we were born now back to 3.1% again in Q1. And as we said, we expect Q2 and Q4 to be seasonally higher quarters due to the holidays in those periods and the flexibility we give our customers to come and go as they need the product. So the churn we're very pleased with, and we've seen the behavior expect exactly as we expected it coming back down in Q1. So that gives us confidence that it's going to be within that range for the foreseeable future.\nEric Yuan: By the way, just quickly to add on what the Kelly said, right? So as we add more and more new services also can help us more upsell opportunities even for online segment. take the Zoom Schedule, for example, we announced that new service, right? And some customers already paid for other services like [indiscernible] right? Customers, yeah, I'd like it to go with Zoom, deploy something similar, right? It's a part of the package, right? I think a lot of upsell opportunities for us to target the Online segment as well.\nKelcey McKinley: Thanks, William. And moving on to Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. Eric, when you -- I just want to dig into this Workvivo acquisition. Do you see that more of a long-term opportunity or do you see that something that we can think of, this is some sort of technology that you can cross-sell into their base in near term? And what sort of -- is there some particular vertical or in a segment where you can see more traction there? Could you give some little bit elaborate in terms of revenue opportunity from that?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Good question. So first of all, if you look at our collaboration platform, right? We really want to offer a unified communication and collaboration platform. Customers I can leave it in the room platform, right? I think today is one of the problems we are facing customer also mention for us as well, right? Quite often, we send all kind of message either to e-mail, it's really hard to find, not scalable or you send message to chat, bar all those public channels, right? Customers also wanted to essentially like see a video message, right? I want to share to the entire employee base and a maybe a department of news, right? All those kind of accounting, right? Are there any other better ways to share and engage these employee, right? I think that's the reason why we think Workvivo can play a bigger role right to put on those kind of use cases, right? It's not only for the short term, is a key missing element of our entire product portfolio, but also in the long run, also is will help us a lot because of the AI, right, because how do you make sure you have more data, right, and really collaborating communication-related data, right? It's Workvivo for sure. Every day we use engaged with our employees, we are -- what we platform, you will generate lots of data, right? All those are very, I would say, is relevant and meaningful, right? How to lever the AI, right? That's why in the long run, certainly it can help us more.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: Great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: Next question will come from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. Kelly, maybe building on the stabilization you've seen on the online side. Can you give us a sense of what your expectations are from an expansion rate on the enterprise side as you look out over the next couple of quarters?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We don't guide specifically around the expansion rate. But as a reminder, it is a trailing 12-month metric. So given that it's at 112% and you can look at where the enterprise growth rate is that possibly has the opportunity to come down slightly more until it starts to reaccelerate as we expect gold online and direct revenue to start reaccelerating as we get to the back half of this year and that the net dollar expansion rate is going to trail behind that.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: Wolfe Research’s' Alex Zukin will have the next question.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Can you hear me, okay.\nKelcey McKinley: Hi, Alex.\nAlex Zukin: So I guess I'll try kind of a two-parter. One is just a simple how do you plan to monetize generative AI functionality in the product rather than making it making it a part of the overall experience? And the second is from an enterprise revenue growth perspective, I think the rate of decel being contemplated from the mid-20s last year in the first half to just over 5% of the second quarter guidance implied. That's a much larger rate of diesel than I think we all contemplated or thought. So how do we -- like is it an upsell? Is it cross-sell? Is it new products that are launching? Is it later revenue recognition? Like what is it that's driven that rate of decel? And how do you reaccelerate obviously, but how do you get back to a double-digit growth rate in that regard because it seems like that's where a lot of the valuation oomph is coming from for the stock?\nEric Yuan: So Kelly, I'll address the first one, you take the second one. I think in terms of how to monetize generative AI. I think first of all, take Zoom IQ for Sales for example, that's a new service to target for the sales deportment. That AI technology is based on generative AI, right, so we can monetize. And also seeing some features, even before the general AI popularity, we have a live transmission feature, right? And also, that's not a free feature. It is a paid feature, right, behind the paywall, right? And also a lot of good features, right, take the Zoom meeting summary, for example, for enterprise -- and the customers, if you deploy Zoom One, deploys why do we have those features, right? For to customers, see three, all those SMB customers, they did not deploy Zoom One. They may not get to those features, right? That's the reason -- another reason for us to monetize. I think there's multiple ways to monetize, yes.\nKelly Steckelberg: And then in terms of the enterprise outlook, as I mentioned earlier, we expected the distraction in Q1 as there was impact to the sales or not only from the reduction, but also reorganization. And we feel really good about the structure of the sales organization now. And we've also, as I mentioned, we are prioritizing where we want to continue to invest and just recently committed to adding more reps in the contact center team for example. We hired a leader in Europe, which we haven't had before. So really excited to have Frederic join us. And all of these put us -- to bring us to be very well positioned to execute for the rest of the year. And now we're looking to the sales team to do exactly that. And they -- we talked about we have an amazing platform that's there for them to sell, and we're all rallying behind them to support them to see them execute.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And moving on to Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, there. Thanks. Good to see everyone. Kelly, on the billings deferred revenue side, you came in a little bit ahead of what you were guiding for a few percentage points from last quarter despite some duration impact. So I'm wondering, if there's any way you can help us quantify those duration impacts either on Q1 or the Q2 guide? And anything else you can provide just to help us think through seasonality as you've now passed the heavier renewal period, but mentioned maybe some sales transition impacts still out there. Just help us think through just what's contemplated in the guide from a few different levels. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So I think on the billing duration impact. As I said earlier, we don't expect this to be a long-term impact. We think it's just indicative of some of the uncertainty that's in the macro environment today. And just watching and being thoughtful about the impact that it's having on deferred and then you also heard it in terms of RPO. But we've seen this impact before, and we've also seen customers come back then. And I think especially as we continue moving towards more bundles, Zoom One, Contact Centers and Zoom Phone, those are all products that customers are going to commit to for the longer term. So I think as you continue to see more and more of those in our pipeline and being sold by the enterprise team, that, that duration impact will start to expand again. And then in terms of the balance between enterprise and online, we're thrilled that enterprise has stabilized a little bit earlier than we expected. Given the days in the month -- the days of the quarter, that's why we gave a more view because it's a little bit tricky when you look at it for the rest of the year. And the guidance contemplates all the things that we already talked about in terms of the pipeline and all the initiatives the online team is working on. And then, of course, the restabilization, if you will, of our direct sales work at the same time.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays has the next question.\nRyan MacWilliams: Great. Appreciate it, guys. And congrats on Zoom Phone reaching 10% of sales. So just thinking back a few years, pretty amazing that this metric only came after reaching 5 million phone sales, so quite the run. Look, I love all that questions so far, but I guess I'll just ask the boring macro question. Kelly, are you seeing any differences in the impact of macro to the Online segment versus the Enterprise segment? And have you seen any changes at renewal on the enterprise side, maybe from an enterprise logo like churn standpoint? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: No. So our enterprise renewals, as you know, Q1 is our highest seasonal quarter and the renewals were exactly in the range of where we expected them to be for the quarter, so that was really great to see. And then in terms of Online, where we've seen strength that we've already talked about, I think it's increasing the top of the funnel. We've also continued to see strength in annual plans, which is great. And this is due to the -- just as a reminder, when we did the price increase, we didn't increase the price for the annual plan. So it just shows customers committing to the amazing value that they see in Zoom and the discounts that they get for committing to the long term, but of course, that's amazing for us because the lifetime value of those annual customers is so much greater.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for the color. Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities has the next question. I'm not sure he's out there, Patrick, do you want to come off mute and start your video for us? All right. Hearing no response...\nPatrick Walravens: I'll come off mute. I'm going to turn off the video and you can see why? Eric, can you talk to us a little bit about sort of the [Technical Difficulty] and what part of that is appealing to investors?\nKelcey McKinley: Patrick, so sorry, your audio is cutting out for us. Will you try one more time? And unfortunately, we might have to skip you if it doesn't improve, but try again, please.\nPatrick Walravens: Eric, can you just talk a little bit more about Anthropic and what they believe come with it?\nEric Yuan: Sure.\nKelly Steckelberg: I heard Anthropic.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. I think Anthropic is a great partner, and this is a great team. And when we look at the AI landscape, I think why not double down on that partnership, right? And given our federal AI approach, right, internally we discussed that happened to be in the middle of using another round of financing, right? That's why how to solidify our partnership, right? Again, they are a great team, greater technology. And I think this is no brainer for us, we invest in them to further solidify the partnership. And yeah, so that's pretty much because look at our contact center, right, we will further empower our contact center offering, right, and also download applied to an entire product portfolio. Again, this is very important to our federated approach to AI, and that's the reason why you invested in them.\nKelcey McKinley: Thanks, Patrick. We'll go ahead and move on to Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones on cash flow maybe for Kelly. First, accounts receivable the last two years, it's been about a drag of $80 million this quarter, much better, only about $29 million, wondering what changed there in terms of cash collections? And then secondly, in terms of this legal settlement, if you can just quantify and let us know maybe when we should anticipate that? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. In terms of the settlement, Matthew, we -- it's not clear exactly when that will be completed in terms of the payment. That's why we said for the full year, we're updating it could be in Q2, it could also be in Q3. That's why we just wanted to give you visibility into that. And then, in terms of your first point about collections. I think part of that, honestly, is just the continued improvement that we're seeing in our team around collections and our ongoing DSOs and also, as we've seen online, when there's more online, especially annual, that is the online is mostly paid via credit card. So that is an improvement in terms of our DSOs usually as that's growing because the DSOs on online are about three days. Does that help?\nMatthew Niknam: And the legal settlement, if you could just quantify how much that is?\nKelly Steckelberg: It's exactly the amount of the difference between our previous guidance. Let me say it this way, there was no other change to our cash flow outlook other than the anticipated potential net legal settlement.\nMatthew Niknam: All right. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nKelcey McKinley: Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities has the next question.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yeah. Thank you very much. So you're implicitly guiding for your enterprise growth rate to decelerate to something like 6% in Q2 and maybe 3% to 4% in the back half. It was only double-digits in the past. So I know you have a lot of changes this year with the sales force, et cetera. After this year, or do you target double-digit growth in enterprise or is it like an upper single-digit growth rate? And also related, the Online business is stabilizing for the next few quarters, it looks like Q4, that means zero growth versus negative growth. Is it a growth business afterwards as well? So I'm just looking after this year is online a growth business is enterprise low double-digits or upper single-digit growth rate business.\nKelly Steckelberg: All the investments that we are making today are focused on growing the top line and investing in ways to do that for the future for both online and the direct business. So that's innovation. It's expanding our platform. It's focusing on investing in the go-to-market teams in terms of what we've talked about earlier, like the contact center, adding a leader to Europe, really focusing on marketing in the right way. And we haven't obviously given FY '25 guidance, but the goal is, and we've talked about before, starting to see reacceleration of growth as we exit FY '24 and having that continue into FY '25. And we're so early in the year of FY '24, but lining up everything to anticipate reacceleration as we exit the year.\nShebly Seyrafi: And the enterprise?\nKelly Steckelberg: Across -- potentially...\nShebly Seyrafi: I'm just saying the enterprise is it upper single digits or low double-digit growth rate, the way you're targeting it, not guiding, just targeting?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah, I'm not going to get that specific, especially this early. We'll be prepared more great to talk about that later this year.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And we'll move on to Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Hey, Kelly. Just to follow on that conversation about driving for acceleration next year. And earlier on, you talked about innovation being a huge priority, that seems to me like there's the potential to shift a little bit the growth margin trade-off as you invest to drive growth. next year. I'm wondering if you're intending to signal that high 30s, 40% margins, everybody on the call should consider sort of a peak. And then if I could ask a clarification, did Workvivo impact at all your guidance for this year? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Thank you, Karl. So as a quick reminder, our long-term target operating margin is lower, much lower than where we are operating today. And that is, as we've said in the past, to give us the opportunity as we see opportunities for investment to do so. We are really focused on doing everything we can to drive top line growth and continue to take market share. In the period of time where we've had slower growth, we've been focused on balancing that with profitability. But as we see opportunities, we absolutely could bring our margins down. So yes, I think we're at probably the peak of where our margins are. But again, we're always being very thoughtful about growth and profitability and balancing both of those. And then in terms of the Workvivo team, given they're amazing, and we're really excited about bringing them into the family, but they're having really, I would say, minimal impact on both the top line and the bottom line today.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nKelcey McKinley: We have time for one additional question, which will come from Sterling Auty with Moffett Nathanson.\nSterling Auty: Great. Thanks, guys. Hopefully, my connection holds up. Just wondering back on the enterprise. Given the online $40 million a quarter stabilization. It implies the enterprises revenue is well below Street consensus. Did we analysts just have the mix model [Technical Difficulty] wrong or was the disruption or something having a bigger impact on the line -- on the enterprise business for the rest of the year?\nKelly Steckelberg: I think there's two things. I think first of all, we've seen online stabilize much more quickly than we anticipated or than we had been indicating to all of you. So I think the overall mix for the year is probably shaving up to be a little bit different than you anticipated and even a that we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And then we're doing -- as I said, we're doing everything we can to focus on supporting our direct sales organization. The distraction in was not de minimis, right? It was -- as I said, it was across not only the reduction but also a reorganization and some changes to incentives and comp plans. And so we're very happy that that's all behind us now, and we're all looking forward to do everything we can to support them and regain momentum there.\nSterling Auty: Sounds good. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nKelcey McKinley: And again, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. So I'll pass it back to you, Eric, for any closing or additional remarks.\nEric Yuan: Well, thank you all for your time. Really appreciate all your support, and thank you, as you all in our next meeting. I appreciate it. Cheers.\nKelly Steckelberg: Bye everyone.\nKelcey McKinley: Sorry, Kelly. And again, this does conclude today's earnings release. We thank you all for your participation. So go enjoy your summer, and we will see you next quarter."
