Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Boor, President and Chief Executive Officer. Bill?\nBill Boor : Welcome, and thank you for joining us today to review our third quarter results. While the earnings release focuses on year-over-year comparisons in this market, I believe the quarter-to-quarter developments are more relevant to understanding current market dynamics. It's not to disregard any insights and bigger picture takeaways regarding the dynamics a year ago relative to today.  Last year, we were a couple of quarters into the effect of rising interest rates, industry backlogs were higher than now, but they were declining rapidly and the pace and direction of backlogs is generally more important than the level. As we wrapped up this third quarter, rates [Indiscernible]. In fact, on a same plant basis, we have now seen five quarters of increasing net orders and backlogs are stabilized, albeit at low capacity utilization. So while economic uncertainty remains, the trends are pointed in the right direction as we emerge from the typically slower winter and holiday months.  The positive trending we're seeing in the market is coming from the dealer channel. Their traffic remains healthy and conversions are improving. Buyers are adjusting to the now steadier interest rates and to the reality of how much home they can afford. The underlying need for affordable housing is coming to the forefront and driving modest but meaningful quarter-to-quarter order improvements. As discussed over the past few quarters, community orders continue to be off considerably. As industry backlogs decreased in the latter part of 2022, deliveries to communities accelerated, which resulted in excess community inventories going into calendar 2023. The issue is not whether there are buyers or renters once a given unit is put into service. It's how quickly the units can be permitted and set to reduce the inventory and resume more normal orders. In other words, placements are occurring at a much higher pace than orders until balances reestablished.  The natural question is, when will this balance be achieved? Of course, varies by operator and location. However, the outlook for this calendar year is considerably better than last based on our discussions with community operators and developers. We expect we will see increased community orders as the year unfolds.  Against that market backdrop, we've stabilized our backlog over the past three quarters by matching production to the pace of orders. Our capacity utilization remained steady this quarter at about 60%. And while the value of orders in the backlog declined from $170 million last quarter to $160 million in Q3, the number of units in the backlog increased 3%.  The quarter ending backlog represents five to seven weeks of production, consistent with last quarter. That stability is an important point coming through the winter months and heading into what we typically would expect to be better selling months. We have a number of plants operating at reduced schedules that are looking to increase when the market supports. On the margin side, pricing has been relatively stable. While our overall factory-based housing gross margin declined 0.8% sequentially, this was driven more by the cost side and how cost of goods sold flowed through our manufacturing and retail sales. Big picture margins remained healthy at 22.4% in our housing segment, and prices are continuing to hold for the most part.  Overall, our quarterly revenue was down about 1% sequentially to $447 million and pretax income dropped from $52 million last quarter to $44 million. Before repurchases and after acquisitions, cash flow was about positive $25 million. We used $50 million to repurchase shares, which resulted in our cash balance being down $24 million relative to last quarter. Before handing the call over, it was good to see many of you at the Louisville show a couple of weeks ago, among a number of other innovative homes, we brought our new Anthem series Duplex to Louisville. The Anthem is the first nationally available HUD-approved multifamily unit. We're very excited about the affordability benefits these homes offer and the interest level has been tremendous, particularly with developers and community operators.  I also wanted to recognize and welcome Dustin Ying and the people from Kentucky Dream homes to the Cavco family. Kentucky Dream Homes operates five well-managed sales centers in Kentucky and Florida, and we joined forces through an acquisition in the third quarter. Dustin and his team are strong operators and great people to be associated with, and we're very excited to be on the same team.  With that, I'd like to turn it over to Allison to discuss the financial results in more detail.\nAllison Aden : Thank you, Bill. Net revenue for the third fiscal quarter of 2024 was $446.8 million down $53.8 million or 10.8% compared to $500.6 million during the prior year. Sequentially, net revenues decreased $5.3 million driven by a reduction in units sold, partially offset by higher revenues in financial services.  Within the factory-built housing segment, net revenue was $427 million, down $54.2 million or 11.3% from $481.2 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a 13.7% decline in base business unit volume and a 5.3% decline in average revenue per home sold, partially offset by the Solitaire acquisition, which contributed $33 million during the quarter. The decrease in average revenue per home was primarily due to more single wise in the mix and to a lesser extent, a decline in product pricing.  Sequentially, for the factory-built housing segment, net revenue was down $7.1 million or 1.6% from $434.1 million. The decrease was primarily due to a 2.1% decline in units sold partially offset by higher average revenue per home, primarily due to more double-wise in the mix and a higher proportion of homes sold through our company-owned stores. Back to utilization for Q3 of 2024 was approximately 60% when considering all available production days, but with nearly 70%, excluding scheduled downtime for market or weather. This utilization level was consistent with the past three quarters.  Financial Services segment net revenue increased 2.1% to $19.8 million from $19.4 million, primarily due to more insurance policies in-force, partially offset by fewer loan sales. Consolidated profit in the third fiscal quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.1%, down 330 basis points from 26.4% in the same period last year. In the factory-built housing segment, the gross margin decreased 310 basis points to 22.4% in Q3 of 2024 versus 25.5% in Q3 of 2023, driven by lower average selling prices and volumes partially offset by lower input cost per floor. Comparing to the sequential fiscal Q2 of 2024, while average selling prices increased due to a higher proportion of homes sold through company-owned retail stores, cost per unit sold also increased with the net effect being an 80-basis point reduction in factory built housing gross margin. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue in financial services decreased to 36.8% in Q3 of 2024 from 46.6% in Q3 of 2023 from higher insurance claim activity. Financial Services gross margin increased sequentially 90 basis points to 36.8% from 35.9% due to higher net insurance premiums earned.  Selling, general and administrative expenses in Q3 of 2024 were $63.3 million or 14.2% of net revenue compared to $58.9 million or 11.8% of net revenue during the same quarter last year. Sequentially, SG&A increased $1.8 million. The increase in both periods is primarily due to higher costs in Q3 of 2024 related to the ongoing litigation between an indemnified former officer of the -- in the SEC, as well as higher compensation expense from acquisitions.  Interest income for the third quarter was $5.2 million, up 46.2% from the prior year quarter and down 9.9% over the sequential quarter. The increase over the prior year is primarily due to higher interest rates, whereas the sequential decrease is related to a lower average cash balance over the period. Interest expense this quarter was $0.8 million compared to $0.2 million in the prior year quarter. This interest relates to adjustments of our redeemable non-controllable interest in Craftsman Home LLC. Net other expense this quarter was $0.2 million compared to $0.3 million in the prior year quarter. Pretax profit for Q3 2024 was $43.9 million down $32.2 million from the prior year period. The effective income tax rate was 18% for the third fiscal quarter, compared to 21.7% in the same period last year. The change between periods is primarily the result of higher benefits from stock option exercises. Net income attributable to Cavco shareholders was $36 million compared to net income of $59.5 million in the same quarter of the prior year and diluted earnings per share in Q3 of 2024 was $4.27 per share versus $6.66 per share in last year's third quarter.  Before we discuss the balance sheet, I'd like to take a minute to talk further about capital allocation. As announced with our press release, the company's board of directors approved a new $100 million stock repurchase program. It can be used to purchase its outstanding common stock. This increases the total available to $139 million including the amount remaining under the program announced in 2023 after our purchase of $50 million this quarter.  Our strategic capital allocation priorities remain an improvement further acquisitions and ongoing evaluation of the opportunities in their lending operations. We continue to use stock buybacks as a tool to responsibly manage our balance sheet. Now I'll turn it over to Paul to discuss the balance sheet.\nPaul Bigbee : Thanks, Allison. So I'm going to cover the changes in the December 30, 2023 balance sheet from April 1, 2023. Our cash balance was $352.8 million, up $81.4 million or 30% from $271.4 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. The increases are primarily due to net income adjusted for non-cash items, such as depreciation and stock compensation expense and working capital adjustments, including the following: inventory decreases, which provided $51.2 million from lower balances of raw materials in our production facilities and finished goods at our retail locations.  Decrease in accounts receivable of $18.2 million. Prepaid and other asset decreases provided $9.9 million. Primary uses of cash for the nine months, offsetting the above include decreases in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of approximately $23 million. Our acquisition of five retail stores and associated inventory for $19.7 million and share repurchases for $96.8 million.  Outside of cash, consumer and commercial loans decreased from the pay down of associated loans that were greater than the amount of new loan originations. Prepaid and other assets was lower due to lower prepaid income taxes and a reduction in delinquent Ginnie Mae loans. The remaining change is due to normal amortization of prepaid.  Property, plant and equipment net is down from the sale of unutilized equipment acquired with Solitaire Home. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities are down from lower accrued bonuses, customer deposits and commission taxes.  Lastly, stockholders' equity exceeded $1 billion, up $32.4 million from $976.3 million as of April 1, 2023. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nBill Boor : Thanks, Paul. So, why don't we just go ahead and turn it over for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question, which will come from Daniel Moore of CJS Securities. Your line is open.\nDaniel Moore : Good morning, Bill, Allison, Paul. Good afternoon, I should East Coast. But thanks for the time and taking the questions. Maybe start with your kind of outlook. What are your expectations for sequential growth in production and shipments in terms of both modules as well as the number of homes as we look to the March quarter relative to December and similar question, what are your expectations for average selling price?\nBill Boor : Dan. Well, you know we don't give guidance. And I guess every time we get asked that question, I always feel like we're at a point, it always feels like we're in a point where if you go one way or the other, right? I think you probably took from some of my comments that the general feeling is pretty positive going into the spring. That's mostly coming from just how well the dealer channel is going. And so we feel like we're in a position to respond to the upside. And that's where most of our energies are at this point is getting ready for that upside, but we don't have a specific expectation to share at this point.\nDaniel Moore : Understood. I guess what would it maybe talk about, when you would expect to have a better sense of the true underlying demand. Right now, it's been improving sequentially and certainly strong from a seasonal perspective. But by April, May, when do you have a better sense for whether you might be in a position to start to ramp production?\nBill Boor : Yeah, absolutely. We're sitting here beginning of February, always making very general statements when we do a market locally as I always remind everyone. But I think internally, we're kind of looking to late February, March time frame to see an uptick, see the normal selling season and how that develops. And so we kind of in that waiting mode right now coming out of the winter and the holidays.  So in the next couple of months, we'll know whether we saw the meaningful improvement that we're hoping for in the spring or whether there's some other issue going on. I feel like as I said in my comments, I think the buyer is there. The interest rates have stabilized. They're higher than they were a bit ago, and that's hard for people, but they are kind of acclimating to that. In some cases, I think we've got good indications that they recognize they can't buy as big a home as they could have bought if they had done so a couple of years ago, but they're adjusting to all that.  So the underlying demand, and I would include as my promise that I would include the communities as well on this. If they can get a home set, they've got a renter or a buyer for that home. So we should see some improvement from -- we're hoping we'll be watching to see some improvement in the selling season. And as the year unfolds, we're also looking for that community order pattern to start improving.\nDaniel Moore : And just based -- maybe it's more anecdotal, Bill, but based on your conversations with some of the community operators, the REITs, where are we if it's the baseball analogy in that getting through the inventory trouble issues or the set and fitness challenges. I know it's market by market, but in general, do we have quarters to go, getting to tag ends and waiting on orders? What are you hearing?\nBill Boor : Yeah. This is completely anecdotal and field based on those discussions. And you'll -- I'll make an analogy. You remember when we were coming out of the retail inventory issue it wasn't sudden, right? I mean it just kind of happens individually, and it builds up and next thing you know you're not talking about the problem anymore. So I think it's going to feel like that. But in our discussions, in my discussions with folks at the larger community operators, they definitely are projecting higher order rates for calendar year '24 than '23.  So I think in order for that to take place, we should see some improvement in the next couple of quarters.\nDaniel Moore : Helpful. Last one, I'll jump out. Thanks for the color, Allison, as well on the gross margin front and the timing of kind of how COGS are rolling through. At kind of current levels, just speak to your confidence around holding gross margins where we are at these levels? And what kind of potential upside we might have if and when the demand comes back, capacity utilization improves. Thanks, again. \nAllison Aden : Yeah. Sure, Dan. Thanks for the question. And just as we said, big picture, the factory-built housing margins remained very healthy at 22.4% this quarter and prices are continuing really to hold for the most part. And while we know based on our prior quarter comments, it's really hard to speculate on price.  I think P&L pricing and cost is going to be the key elements to the determining future margins. And from commenting on the price, we're seeing some regions where pressure is becoming more apparent and some where it's not. So it's a mixed bag. Also, from a cost perspective, we've seen the movement in commodities can be a little volatile and hard to predict. So we're continuing to watch lumber and OSB.  As we said last quarter, we believe that we're doing a good job of really managing our cost of sales. And if we see the top line increase, we certainly have leverage still absorption costing within our cost of goods and also at an SG&A level.\nDaniel Moore : Yeah, Iâ€™ll come back with any follow ups. Thank you.\nBill Boor : Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Greg Palm of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is open, Greg.\nDanny Eggerichs : Hi, thanks. This is Danny Eggerichs on for Greg today, hoping to just kind of go back and touch on what you're seeing in fiscal quarter four again. Can you maybe just remind us -- I know it's kind of jumped on in the past of seasonality from December to March quarter? And maybe on top of that, any impacts that you felt from maybe adverse weather in the month of January?\nBill Boor : Let me take that second part first. We did have some pretty isolated down days due to the weather. I know in Texas, we had some in the Northwest. But I think it was to an extent that we're hoping we can make it up over the course of this quarter, if that makes sense because we are running at a reduced overall rate. And so while we did have some down days, it shouldn't really knock us off where we would end the quarter otherwise on a production basis, if that makes sense. On the seasonality, I know we've looked at that. Mark might have a comment on the percentages. But what I'll say before we say that is we look at seasonality over a long period of time in many years. And you can kind of glean from that what an average seasonal change will be. And yet I think when you look at any given year, it never really plays out that way because the macroeconomic factor is probably way heavier than the seasonality at times. But given that, Mark, I'll check my recollection, I mean, at most 10%.\nMark Fusler : Yeah, I was going to say around 5%, probably.\nBill Boor : 5% to 10%. But again, we are hitting the better part of that from a seasonality perspective.\nDanny Eggerichs : Okay. Got it. And then maybe just touching on ASPs again. You kind of commented that within the backlog, you're seeing some lower ASPs. So I guess -- is that a good proxy for this current quarter on ASPs? And within that, is that just kind of mix then? Or what are we seeing there?\nBill Boor : Yeah. What I would say is we've kind of had a movement we've talked about in previous quarters that if you looked on a year-over-year basis, we're selling more single section units and multi-section units. So I would suggest, and I look around to see your reactions to, I would suggest that our lower value in the backlog is more driven by that change than it is by the fundamental pricing of a given unit.  I think that's your question. Let me know -- does that answer your question?\nDanny Eggerichs : Yeah. Yeah. You just kind of mentioned that pricing was holding steady, but backlogs, ASPs were kind of coming down. So I was just wondering if that was mix or what -- so thank you, you answered that.\nBill Boor : Yeah, the backlog moves more to a character, it's got more single lights than multi-section, then you're going to naturally see that value per unit go down, right?\nDanny Eggerichs : Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Maybe just one last more on maybe the Anthem product just kind of initial interest. I know you're showing that off of the Louisville show and how big you think that could be and what the market could potentially be like for that certain product?\nBill Boor : Yeah, we're obviously really excited about it. I mean, this is a change that's been made after a lot of work at the industry level basically with HUD to allow multifamily units to be coded under the HUD code. And we are excited about it. We had a launch event, one of our -- basically our lead plan on this is the Rocky Mount Virginia plant. And we had a launch event in early December, and I was there, and I was really impressed by the support we're getting not only from dealers and community operators, but also from municipalities showing up looking for solutions to their density and affordability issues.  And so we've talked about it as being a nationally available. We're going to produce that variations of the [indiscernible] product. I mean, there's more than one per plant, the variations that we're going to produce in plants across the country. So yeah, I don't have any numbers for you to share at this point, but we've been really excited about the interest level.  And if you think about it, if you're running -- let's just take the example of a community operator. The opportunity to get some density, you're going to get more revenue essentially from a given lot. And at the same time, those two residences or households are going to both benefit from the density with lower cost. And so that's what saw in the affordability issue is all about. So I appreciate you asking because obviously, we're pretty excited about it.\nDanny Eggerichs : Yeah, sounds like something lot of good stuff. So Iâ€™ll leave it there, thanks. \nBill Boor : Thank you. \nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Jay McCanless of Wedbush. Your line is open, Jay. \nJay McCanless : Hey, good morning, everyone. So Bill, could you maybe talk about the Kentucky Dream acquisition, how many owned stores does that take Cavco to now? And what's kind of your outlook for more acquisitions like this in the coming year?\nBill Boor : Yeah. We've had a bit of an increase in our total owned stores. And it came -- a big chunk of that came through the Solitaire acquisition a year ago. We were in the low 40s before that. Solitaire, I think, brought us 22%. And then with a few greenfields and then the Kentucky Dream Homes acquisition, we're at 72% now. So I think you're asking for a little more detail on those assets. Is that right, Jay?\nJay McCanless : Yeah. And just are there other larger dealer chains out there that you might be looking at from an M&A perspective and if there are, what kind of -- is the goal to get to 100, 150 what's kind of your long-term vision for the retail stores?\nBill Boor : Yeah. Taking back and tell you how we think about retail real quickly. We have not generally had a strategy of trying to grow retail for its own sake. We've had a strategy that's been very clear that -- we want to look at every one of our plants in a local market and make sure we've got the right access to market.  So if we look down the road and we see, for example, a lot of integration by competitors and that increases our risk of distribution. That's when we try to figure out a good solution. That solution could be anything from developing a closer partnership with an existing dealer, independent dealer to greenfield and then two acquisitions and the example of Kentucky Dream Homes.  So we don't have a goal to reach a certain level. We're not pushing growth in the retail segment necessarily, we're only happy to make a good acquisition when it's both a good investment and improves our distribution.  Kentucky Dream Home is a great example of that. I mean, Duston has run a great business. They've built a great business, really thrilled at the fact that he's staying on board and his management team stay on board because they're here at what they do. They have five stores in Kentucky and in Florida. And yeah, we sold them or repurchased them during the third quarter.\nJay McCanless : Got you. The other thing I wanted to ask about is what you're talking about before, Allison with the increased cost of goods sold? Is it still just OSB? Or are you starting to see some wage inflation kick in maybe what are the drivers that are driving the COGS line up?\nAllison Aden : Yeah. So on the COGS, Jay, it's largely the commodities. As we mentioned last quarter, with the focus, of course, on OSB and lumber and we stay pretty close to it. And currently, it looks like it's a similar trend to what we talked about last quarter.\nJay McCanless : Thatâ€™s all I have. Thank you. \nBill Boor : All right. Thanks, Jay. \nOperator: And one moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Camden Roberts of University of South Carolina. Camden, your line is open. \nCamden Roberts: Hey, guys. Thank you for the great earnings call. I'm calling from South Carolina. We were actually just at the hamlet factory in North Carolina, and we had a great tour. And I just wanted to ask you what are you -- what should we be looking at in 2024? Are you optimistic about Anthem and those duplex sales? I'm sure there's a lot of pent-up demand for that? Or should we be looking more at the recent Solitaire acquisition. What are you most optimistic about? And what should we be focusing on 2024?\nBill Boor : It's a big question. Glad it's great to hear you were at Hamlet. We thought that was a good tour. We're pretty proud of that new plant and how it's come up, and we think it's targeted at the right point in the market for what's going on from an industry dynamic perspective. They're making kind of at the lower price point product, and they've really come up very quickly as far as most excited.  I mean we talked about Anthem. We think that's -- I think that's going to be a good business for us. I also to be honest, I also think that from a broader perspective, those are the kind of solutions that can move the ball forward on affordability. So I'm really excited about the potential of the industry taking advantage of those changes in the HUD code to get better solutions for affordability.  You touched on Solitaire. We've had a year now with Solitaire. We're excited about that acquisition. We told folks when we announced that acquisition that we bought some really good plants and they've got a great brand in the market that's kind of in a particular niche. And we think that's going to -- where acquisition is going to be a great one for us. Overall, again, you asked a broad question, I could probably talk all that. Overall, I'm excited to see the industry start picking up as community orders start to pick up. The dealer channel has been -- has gotten back on its feet, and I think it's doing pretty well. You could almost look at the difference in the peak HUD sales for this industry compared to the most recent seasonally adjusted level in December based on high shipments, and it pretty much can be explained by the drop-off in community orders this past year.  So I think as we -- as the year unfolds, I'm not able to make predictions about it, but as the year unfolds and we see communities get their inventory behind them and start resuming their orders. I think it's a lot of good positive upside for the industry.\nCamden Roberts: Thank you, Bill. I mean I know it is open-ended. I mean there's a lot to be excited about. So I just wanted to know what were pointed down, but those three of the community sales does sound exciting. So thank you very much.\nBill Boor : All right. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] our next question will be a follow-up from Daniel Moore of CJS Securities. Daniel, your line is open.\nDaniel Moore : Thanks, again. I just wanted a quick question or two on kind of update on financing and availability. So any meaningful change in spreads over the last 90-plus days, both for chattel as well as land home versus traditional stick-built mortgage rates? And how would you describe the lending environment today relative to a year ago? Now you're seeing more community banks exit stable or others backfilling? Any kind of color you might give there would be helpful. Thank you. \nMark Fusler : Yeah. So I'll start with the rates, Dan. So the rates for just home-only loans quoted rates are in the high 8%, low 9% range still, and that's been pretty consistent these past 90 days.\nBill Boor : Picking up on your question that I hope I rephrased it accurately kind of the investors in MH loans, for example, community banks and like regional banks and credit union pipe investors can be finicky. And I'll tell you that I don't want this to be alarmist at all because it shouldn't be, but they've tightened up a little bit. But I think we'll work through that. I don't think it's a major issue from the perspective of lending availability to the consumers.  And why I say that is there are a lot of folks in that market and they're not all heavily dependent on those outlets or those final investors. And one thing we've talked about over the past losing track of time, but it's been a while is that for a while, GSE loans, the conforming loans had really kind of gone out of the market. And basically, what happened is GSEs raised their requirements, raise their terms and interest rates and the investors we're talking about like the regional banks, credit union type investors really didn't respond as quickly. I think that's because they had a lot of capital put in place.  Now what we're seeing is that the regional -- I call them the non-conforming investors have increased their requirements. But what happens is GSEs become more competitive in the market, and we'll probably see a swing back to that that final funding source for the loans. As usual, I think I'm giving a long answer to a short question, but we're not -- we'll watch those dynamics, but we are not really seeing anything that gives us concern about the end consumers' access to reasonably priced loans.\nDaniel Moore : No, that's good color. I appreciate it. I'm going to ask one more and maybe it's a variation on a prior question, maybe not let you judge. But at this stage, we're stable -- pretty stable at 60% capacity utilization, plus or minus would you be looking to add capacity when you think about the opportunity set and the lack of for availability in terms of affordable homes over the next two, three, five years? Or are we more let's kind of stick where we are wait and see and see how the demand builds over the coming quarters. Thanks, again. \nBill Boor : Yeah. That's a really good question, actually. I guess I would say it's the latter or it's the former. I haven't restated. I would not -- I don't think Cavco would hesitate to add capacity in this industry given what we see strategically. And when you look at a strategic time frame, which I define as three-plus years, it takes time to put capacity in place. This country has -- depending on your favorite economist, 6 million housing unit deficit to be filled. And so strategically, we look right through the many cycles like the one we're operating in right now, and we know that there's an opportunity to continue doing more to bring down to increase the availability of affordable housing.\nDaniel Moore : Very helpful. Thanks, again. Look forward, to catching up soon. \nBill Boor : Thanks, Dan. \nAllison Aden : Thanks, Dan. \nOperator: I would now like to turn the conference back to Bill for closing remarks.\nBill Boor : Okay. Thank you. I mentioned Louisville show in my opening comments. We showcased 15 homes from 9 Cavco plants at the show. We also had our lending company, CountryPlace Mortgage there. They were there to talk to customers about how we can meet their commercial and consumer lending needs. So it was a great effort to try to get out there and show what we can do from a partnership perspective. I want to take a quick moment to thank everyone at Cavco, who has been involved in our development and launch of the Anthem Duplex line and in all that went into the Louisville show from the folks who are designing and building these homes to the marketing and sales teams, the commitment teamwork have really been outstanding.  At both events, it was great to see the strength of our organization coming to the forefront. Our drive during this downturn has been to keep focused on getting better in every way, so we're ready to run when the inevitable market upswing occurs. And I'm very confident we're doing just that. So I want to thank you, as always, for your interest in Cavco. And we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Now Iâ€™d like to turn the call over to Bill Boor, President and Chief Executive Officer. Bill?\nBill Boor: Welcome and thank you for joining us today to review our second quarter results. I thought, Iâ€™d jump right in with some perspective on what we are seeing in the market. As we previously reported, the dealer inventories that created a big drag on wholesale orders through the first half of the year are now generally under control and our company-owned stores and broadly throughout our independent dealer network, homebuyer interest as reflected in online leads and store traffic is healthy. However, as everyone knows the macroeconomic environment is not providing any relief for those prospective buyers. Having said that, we continue to see quarter-to-quarter order improvement, that trend is largely coming from street dealers with community still lagging as expected and discussed last quarter. Looking forward, as those community operators work through their inventories, that would be another positive for wholesale manufactured housing orders. Against that backdrop, we continue to operate at a reduced level. Production was down from last quarter as certain plants dealt with the lack of orders and continued to slow production. In line with production capacity utilization was down slightly, but still in the range of 60%, with the already mentioned order improvement, we hit a balanced point at the current overall production rate. As a result, our backlogs were consistent with last quarter. We ended the period at $170 million, which equates to five weeks to seven weeks of production. Clearly, we are anxious and prepared to move plants back to full schedules, as soon as the market supports. In the meantime, our plants have done an outstanding job in maintaining healthy profitability and cash flow through the market challenges. In the second quarter, our housing gross margin was 23.2%, down 1.6% from last quarter and 3.6% from a year ago, when we were running full schedules and 80% utilization. Allison will go into the gross margin shifts, but the point here is that reducing shipments about 17% year-over-year to match lower demand and still maintaining margin to that extent only happens through discipline and operational excellence. Our retail business has performed exceptionally well. They adjusted quickly to the changing market conditions last year and stayed committed to their winning processes. On a same-store basis, excluding the added volume from Solitaire retail, homes sold through our company-owned stores were up slightly from the previous period. More importantly, the manufacturing and retail teams are working cohesively on product decisions and selling strategies to produce optimal results across the operations. This teamwork has demonstrated itself as we brought the Solitaire stores into the retail operation and filled out product offerings to improve inventory turns. Overall, our revenues were down sequentially from $476 million to $452 million and pretax income was $52 million, compared to $61 million last quarter. We generated strong cash flow, returned $47 million through share repurchases and added $25 million to our cash balance. We remain convinced of the dire need for our homes over time and our strong balance sheet enables us to pursue investments in organic and external opportunities, despite the near-term conditions. With that, Iâ€™d like to turn it over to Allison to discuss the financial results in more detail.\nAllison Aden: Thank you, Bill. Net revenue for the second fiscal quarter of 2024 was $452 million, down $125.4 million or 21.7%, compared to $577.4 million during the prior year. Within the factory-built housing segment, net revenue was $434.1 million, down $125.5 million or 22.4% from $559.6 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in base business homes sold and a decrease in average revenue per home sold, partially offset by the Solitaire Homes acquisition, which contributed $35.6 million in the quarter. The decrease in average revenue per home was primarily due to more single-wides in the mix and to a lesser extent product pricing decreases. Factory utilization for Q2 of 2024 was approximately 60%, when considering all available production days, that was nearly 70% excluding scheduled downtime for market or weather, consistent with our last two quarters. Financial Services segment net revenue increased 1.1% to $18 million from $17.8 million, primarily due to more insurance policies in force and higher insurance premium rates, partially offset by fewer loan sales. Consolidated gross profit in the second fiscal quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 23.7%, down 360 basis points from the 27.3% in the same period last year. In the factory-build housing segment, the gross profit decreased 350 basis points to 23.2% in Q2 of 2024 versus 26.7% in Q2 of 2023, driven by lower average selling prices, partially offset by lower material cost per floor primarily due to lower lumber prices. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue in Financial Services decreased to 35.9% in Q2 of 2024 from 44.6% in Q2 of 2023 from multiple severe storms in Texas and in Arizona. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $61.5 million, compared to $66.9 million during the same quarter last year. The decrease in these expenses was primarily due to lower third-party support costs, and lower incentive compensation costs, partially offset by the addition of Solitaire Homes SG&A costs. Interest income for the second quarter was $5.8 million, up 214% in the prior year quarter. This increase is primarily due to higher interest rates and greater invested cash balances. Net other income this quarter was $0.7 million, compared to $0.5 million in the prior year quarter. Pretax profit was down 44.3% this quarter at $51.7 million from $92.8 million for the prior year period. Net income to Cavco stockholders was $41.5 million, compared to net income of $74.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year and diluted earnings per share this quarter was $4.76 per share versus $8.25 per share in last yearâ€™s second quarter. Now I will turn it over to Paul to discuss the balance sheet.\nPaul Bigbee: Thanks, Allison. I will cover the balance sheet changes from September 30, 2023, compared to April 1, 2023. The cash balance was $377.3 million, up $105.9 million from $271.4 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to a few factors; first, net income adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and common -- and stock compensation expense; and secondly, working capital changes related to inventory decreases of $19.7 million from lower raw materials at our manufacturing facilities and less finished goods at our retail locations, decrease in prepaid and other assets of $17.8 million, increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $9.9 million, and decreases in consumer and commercial loans. These cash inflows were partially offset by common stock repurchases of $47.2 million. Restricted cash increased from cash collected on serviced loans in our Financial Services segment in excess of what was distributed. Consumer and commercial loans decreased from loan sales and the pay down of associated loans and fewer new loan originations. Prepaid and other assets decreased from lower prepaid income taxes and a reduction in delinquent Ginnie Mae loans, as well as the normal amortization of prepaid expenses. Property, plant, and equipment net is down from the sale of unutilized equipment acquired with the Solitaire Homes acquisition we completed last January. Accrued expenses and other current liabilities were up slightly from higher insurance losses in warranty reserves, partially offset by lower customer deposits. Lastly, stockholdersâ€™ equity exceeded $1 billion, up $43 million from $976.3 million as of April 1st, 2023. With that, I will pass it back to Bill.\nBill Boor: Our results this quarter highlight the ability of our organization to manage costs and generate cash even when conditions are challenging. Everyone at Cavco is ready for the inevitable return of demand, so we can help more families get the homes they need. Abigail, can we please open the line for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Your line is open.\nDaniel Moore: Thank you. Good morning, Bill, Allison, and Paul. I appreciate the time and taking the questions. Maybe I will start with just the order trends, Bill. Obviously it ticked a bit higher, which is nice to see. That said, we are entering the typically slower period seasonally. Just maybe talk about your expectations for orders and shipments in fiscal Q3 relative to Q2 and when you expect to be in a position to start to increase production rates?\nBill Boor: Yeah. Thanks, Dan. Yeah. I mean, I think, you are absolutely right. We are now entering the period we hit about November, December, and typically, if you could isolate seasonal patterns that would mean a slowdown in shipments. Some years, we donâ€™t really see that because it gets dwarfed by the macroeconomic factors that are probably a bigger impact. But certainly, thatâ€™s not a -- itâ€™s something we have to really be keeping an eye on and we are not at this point speculating on how thatâ€™s going to develop. We are encouraged by the -- by a few things. One is, we have reported a few quarters where we have intended to even exaggerated view of this, but a few quarters where orders have increased quarter-over-quarter and this quarter continued that. So thatâ€™s a real positive. And then the other thing that, I guess, Iâ€™d point to that, sure, it was lost on you and others is that, we have been able to kind of stabilize the backlog. So we feel like we are in balance right now going into it and more personally focused on macroeconomic drivers than the seasonality. But if we can come through these winter months in good shape, then I think it will be a real positive sign.\nDaniel Moore: Maybe ask another way, so far in the quarter, production rates held pretty steady with what we saw in fiscal Q2?\nBill Boor: I think generally they have, we have kind of hit a balance point here, which is what we are trying to convey to people and we would like it to be a balance point at a higher production level for sure, but itâ€™s good to feel like orders are supporting, at least the current production levels. So Iâ€™d say thatâ€™s continued.\nDaniel Moore: Okay. Excellent. B Yeah.\nDaniel Moore: And maybe just in terms of the gross margin, the -- if you could dive into it a little bit more to rank order, sort of the impacts, obviously, on the Financial Services notwithstanding, focusing on the residential housing or focusing on just the housing segment, between input costs mix, fixed cost absorption, what were the kind of the key elements that may be pushed to lower sequentially and are you seeing any pricing or competitive pressures or is it more a function of those things that I have just mentioned?\nAllison Aden: I think maybe a way to think about margins this quarter to Q1 is really margins in this quarter were kind of the store is really more around cost and not really around price. We saw price hold fairly consistent, but we have seen inflationary pressures thatâ€™s driving up price per OSB, which as you know, is one of our larger inputs for materials. So thatâ€™s caused -- that slight elevation is caused -- is finding its ripple effect through the margin and obviously something that we will stay close to. We continue to be very efficient in our cost structures and our plans as we adjust to production levels and we can always -- we can certainly see consistent leverage of fixed costs at the plant level and then also at the SG&A level.\nDaniel Moore: Got it. And so would -- given that and where we have seen OSB pricing, likely this kind of piece hang around in those levels, the gross margin likely to, right, remain in those levels for maybe one more quarter and would you expect to start to see some increase beyond that?\nAllison Aden: I think, we donâ€™t really project on gross margins, but we -- the fact is that we stay very close to pricing, which has been really consistent and rational. And then, of course, the input cost that the majority of our materials are lumber and OSB. So as those contracts and that level of -- and the cost pricing increases or decreases, those fall through our margin in about a 60-day trend. So thatâ€™s -- that information that can be accessed. And then our overhead support continues to be leveraged. So all-in-all, I think, as we stay close to the story thatâ€™s evolving on the OSB, we should be able to factor that into where we currently are at the Q2 level for Q3.\nDaniel Moore: Very helpful. One more. I will jump out. Are you seeing more of a mix shift to lower price point entry-level homes. Is that trend continued and just maybe talk about your expectations for ASPs as we look forward over the next couple of quarters?\nAllison Aden: So we are seeing the trend go toward more single. But as we have kind of said in the past, we think about margin -- gross margin associated with the singles and multi. More of a function of time or time spent of productivity within the plants and not so much a distinguishing factor between multi and single at the gross margin level. Clearly, there is a price point differential at the revenue level.\nBill Boor: Hey, Dan, just to jump in. There are definitely, I mean, as you know, following the industry for a long time for many, I think, years, we were seeing a move toward multi section in the mix, and for several quarters, now we have reported that thatâ€™s reversed, the quarter-to-quarter change wasnâ€™t that significant, but it was a little bit more to singles again. And I think thatâ€™s -- our view is that thatâ€™s just a really strong indication of the affordability challenges people are facing out there and folks who have still been coming out to shop for homes, we reported consistently the traffic is healthy. So they are out there. They are trying to figure out how to solve their home need. Many of them, I think, are coming to the realization that they are going to have to accept less than they might have been able to purchase in years past. So I think thatâ€™s really what we are seeing through that continuing trend toward single. Over the last year, itâ€™s been pretty dramatic. Over the last quarter, it was pretty mild as far as the shift.\nDaniel Moore: Perfect. Okay. I will jump back with any follow-ups. Thank you.\nBill Boor: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for our next question next question. Our next question comes from Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nGreg Palm: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow up a little bit on kind of the community REIT channel and figure out whether your visibility has improved, changed at all, relative to a few months ago?\nBill Boor: Yeah. This is a good topic to hit on. I commented very briefly on it that, they really havenâ€™t come back at this point. The street dealers are carrying the load right now. A lot of that we have talked in the past is really driven mostly by communities that have spaces to fill and they have got inventory, but they are having trouble getting it placed as fast as they would like. All my discussions with operators -- community operators is that, itâ€™s not a question about whether thereâ€™s a resident demand, itâ€™s just been a function of them having inventory on hand, kind of similar to the previous problem at street dealerships and how fast they can place that product. So I think we even commented last quarter that we expected it to be not trying to pinpoint too many estimates when we donâ€™t have perfect visibility. But last quarter we said, that was probably last through the calendar year and I think thatâ€™s still true. I donâ€™t know that we will be completely through it in the current quarter or whether it will leak into next year a little bit, but once that does clear, just as when we saw the street dealer inventories get balanced, thatâ€™s a positive for our orders. Greg, I will open up another topic, because you and I have talked about this over time. I think everything I am saying is, the way to think about it is, itâ€™s very true for existing communities. Just even following some of the public statements for some of the REIT operators, now we are starting to hear people say, hey, if the cost of capital keeps going up, new development is something they are going to hold off on. So not really thrilled to hear that, but it stands to reason that as interest rates continue going up, those operators are balancing, whether to invest in new developments or to just kind of hold the capital or pay down debt. We havenâ€™t heard that consistently. It hasnâ€™t been a loud message. But itâ€™s something I think for us to keep our eye on. Not really an impact on the inventory discussion we have had. But just kind of a down the road thing to keep an eye on.\nGreg Palm: Yeah. That makes sense, wonâ€™t be a huge surprise. In terms of order rates coming through when they are ready, would you expect them at kind of similar levels as retail, has placed those orders post destocking or will there be any change in how the community REIT channel places orders versus what you have seen in retail over the last two quarters?\nBill Boor: I donâ€™t think so. I think once they get cleared of the inventory that they are trying to work through, we talked with the street dealers on the concept of one-to-one, right? They sell a house, they need a house and I think we will see the same thing. And communities are a meaningful portion of the overall, we kind of in this discussion, I am grouping developers communities kind of as one package, but itâ€™s a meaningful part of the overall demand. So we typically talk about that being 30%, 33% of the market and they havenâ€™t been carrying the 33% or so of the current orders. So we will see it pick up once that continues to clear. I am not sureâ€¦\nGreg Palm: Yeah.\nBill Boor: Did that address your question?\nGreg Palm: Yeah. Yeah. Totally did. And I guess just lastlyâ€¦\nBill Boor: Okay. Thanks.\nGreg Palm: â€¦ I know you have kind of characterized this as kind of a challenging time andâ€¦\nBill Boor: Yeah.\nGreg Palm: â€¦ Cavco as a company is fortunate, good balance sheet and all, and thereâ€™s a lot of operators out there that, probably, donâ€™t have any backlog, they donâ€™t have a good balance sheet. And so I am curious, does this change your appetite for M&A? Have you seen additional opportunities hit the pipeline? Whatâ€™s just kind of your visibility level there?\nBill Boor: Yeah. I wouldnâ€™t say itâ€™s been a big impact right now as far as people being distressed and therefore having to look for alternatives on the manufacturing side as far as M&A work. We are always interested and always in kind of some stated discussion to stay connected with those folks. So I wouldnâ€™t characterize that I have seen a lot of distress type situations. And I think really we have to look at it -- you are right, if you lose your backlog that could be an issue, obviously. But pricing is held up, so I think margins through the industry are still more healthy than would be the case in a time when manufacturers are really on the verge of failing.\nGreg Palm: Yeah. Thatâ€™s a good point. Okay. I will leave it there. Best of luck.\nBill Boor: Thanks, Greg.\nAllison Aden: Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Jay McCanless with Wedbush. Your line is open.\nJay McCanless: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. So, actually, Bill, I was going to ask you the pricing question, too. So it sounds like things were holding up. You havenâ€™t had to be really aggressive on cutting price?\nBill Boor: Yeah. We havenâ€™t seen. I mean, I would say, itâ€™s been consistent over the last couple quarters where there are markets where you see a little bit of price competition, but itâ€™s been a little bit and you see other market -- markets, where it really hasnâ€™t been a factor at all and you can see in, our average selling price that we reported has a lot in it with retail and mix and everything else. But you can see that prices just havenâ€™t materially dropped. So we always say itâ€™s a local business. So when we talk to all of our plants and kind of check in with how things are going, we hear slightly different stories from plant-to-plant and region-to-region. But where itâ€™s been noticeable that thereâ€™s a little price competition, it hasnâ€™t been very dramatic.\nJay McCanless: Thatâ€™s good to hear. Could you talk about where chattel rates are now and what type of availability you think is out there in the market on the chattel side?\nMark Fusler: Yes. On the rate side right now, they have held pretty steady from last quarter, so they are still about 9% to 9.5%.\nBill Boor: Yeah. Availability is kind of consistent in that sense. So I think if you are -- what Markâ€™s quoting is a pretty good credit score, good loan-to-value, we try to report that consistently in that sense. But I wouldnâ€™t say that, if you have got the credit, I donâ€™t think the availability has gone down.\nJay McCanless: My last question. So we have heard from one of your competitors that, there may be some people walking away from floor plan financing for street dealers. Can you talk about your appetite to maybe pick up some of that business, especially with having the sizable cash balance you do, even notwithstanding the buyback, still have a pretty healthy cash balance? Is that something where Cavcoâ€¦\nBill Boor: Yeah.\nJay McCanless: â€¦ might want to go a little deeper?\nBill Boor: Yeah. I think we just kind of react to the situation for the most part. As you know, we have got a reasonably sizable portfolio of floor plan loans with our independent dealers. And I think as we have stayed very close -- by virtue of having that, you stay very close to the credit situation out there. So, yeah, we absolutely would provide floor plan financing in the right situations. We wouldnâ€™t shy away from it in this market.\nJay McCanless: Okay Great. Thatâ€™s all I had. Thank you.\nBill Boor: Great. Thanks, Jay.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Chapman with Aviance Capital Partners. Your line is open.\nMichael Chapman: Thanks. A quick question on the revenue per module, been kind of flat like you mentioned for the last 25 [ph] quarters. If the developers are rolling off with -- I am assuming they would be at more of kind of a wholesale margin. Do you think that kind of gets picked up by more wholesale or could that actually have some upward bias on your rev per module?\nBill Boor: You are saying, if -- when we are working with developers, are we selling at wholesale price or retail?\nMichael Chapman: Yeah. I mean, if...\nBill Boor: Is that kind of a question?\nMichael Chapman: Yeah. If developers are moving out, I am assuming that they kind of get wholesale pricing. Is there anyâ€¦\nBill Boor: Yeah.\nMichael Chapman: â€¦ opportunity to get price increase just because you are going to have more retail?\nBill Boor: I am not sure I am following unfortunately. I think you are right that there would be kind of a distribution partner in the sense they would be getting wholesale price. So the extent that picks up, we will see a little bit of a shift within our consolidated financials to more wholesale pricing. And as we have tried to explain through time about our average selling price, our average selling price is affected by the proportion of wholesale pricing to retail pricing. So in that case, as communities and developers come up, I think, I am getting to your question, you would see wholesale take a bigger portion and you might see our reported average selling price drop a little bit, right?\nMichael Chapman: Okay.\nBill Boor: Is that -- am I getting that, Michael?\nMichael Chapman: Yeah. No. You did. You got to it. I appreciate that. And then just kind of looking at...\nBill Boor: Yeah. Yeah. And we wouldnâ€™t consider that to be a negative because that would be incremental volume over where we are at now. So, we would be thrilled with that average selling price as an indicator, but we are looking at the bottomline.\nMichael Chapman: No. Fair enough. And then just kind of on inventory levels, over the last couple of years, inventory turns have gone up, inventory days have come down, obviously, through the pandemic and everything itâ€™s changed. Are those going to come back or whatâ€™s the time period that you would think that those would get back to levels that they were in, say, the 2019 area?\nBill Boor: Yeah. Itâ€™s interesting because as we have gotten through the inventory problem and this is kind of a general industry statement, but certainly a statement of our company-owned stores as well, turns are getting back into good ranges anyway. They are kind of stocking at a level to -- and you think about the incentives. Letâ€™s take an independent dealer, you think about their incentives, floor plan financing has gone up in cost, so they are going to carry less inventory and make sure their turns are pretty solid. So when we look at turns even within our own system. They are pretty good right now. They are not bad at all, because inventory is being managed down.\nMichael Chapman: Okay. And then just kind of following on the financing side, I mean, homebuilders have been kind of keeping volumes up, stick to homebuilders, keeping volumes up by basically buying down yield. So basically using their balance sheet to increase the volume. You guys -- all the big guys have really good balance sheets on that. How do you go about doing that or is that just something that you wouldnâ€™t do in the chattel market because of the credit profile that you face?\nBill Boor: Yeah. I mean, itâ€™s something that, Iâ€™d say, as a general rule has not been a main driver of how people have gone to market. Traditionally in our industry, the manufacturer sales teams working with dealers, for example, have been selling on price and product. And so there hasnâ€™t been a lot of subsidizing consumer rates. But itâ€™s always a tool that you kind of keep an eye on and itâ€™s something that could become a factor. Thatâ€™s why I think itâ€™s good for us to -- so I am happy that we are kind of in the position we are with Country Place, because we can always keep an eye on that and if the opportunity came to drive more volume by providing this kind of programs, we have got the capability to do it. It hasnâ€™t happened a lot yet, but in the end, you are trying to manage for integrated value and so itâ€™s something that we do look at and opportunistically we would be willing to do it.\nMichael Chapman: Okay. I mean could you have...\nBill Boor: The discipline on that -- just to explain the discipline on that, just to finish that thought? We have, whatâ€™s commonly called an asset-light model in our lending business, where we donâ€™t want to hold loans and so it creates a natural discipline that we have to have investors buying those loans, and they are going to want to buy loans at market. And so if we buy it down, itâ€™s a good discipline because the economic reality of buying down that rate is staring us right in the face, right? So I think thereâ€™s a lot of discipline in that.\nMichael Chapman: Okay. And then just kind of my last one, I mean, you guys in this quarter generated strong free cash flow, by any stretch of the imagination, in good times, you will obviously generate more.\nBill Boor: Yeah.\nMichael Chapman: Do you have constraints on acquisitions or the volume of acquisitions you can make just because of the concentration of the industry? Because if you are going to do, give or take, $200 million in free cash flow and given at what you guys have been paying on price of sales, you guys could makeâ€¦\nBill Boor: Yeah.\nMichael Chapman: â€¦ $200 million, $300 million, $400 million in revenue purchases a year. But thatâ€™s a lot of revenue for whatâ€™s remaining outside the big three or four guys. So, I mean, I look at it and the cash flow that you guys have, seems like you have almost too much to just do nothing with it. And so I am kind of wondering what the thought process is, given the volume of cash flow and your ability to apply that in the market in acquisitions? Thanks.\nBill Boor: Yeah. Yeah. I think, one answer to your question is we donâ€™t feel constrained on acquisitions. We kind of maintain our balance sheet, so we can act strategically and acquisitions you can look through our history, have been an important part of that. So certainly donâ€™t feel constrained with either the cash balance or the cash flow that we have been generating as you identify. So we want to make sure we get those deals at the right prices, I think, is the limiting factor for us. We are always kind of looking to make sure itâ€™s a fair deal for both sides. So we have obviously used repurchases as a balancing tool on our balance sheet. We have been pretty clear with folks that we want to maintain a responsible balance sheet and thatâ€™s where the repurchases come out back into play. They are not really speculating on price. They are more trying to keep our balance sheet appropriate for keeping the dry powder to do the deals you are talking about. So anyway, I think, the bottomline to your question is, we do not feel constrained and when we see good opportunities and acquisitions, we feel free to do them given our strong balance sheet.\nMichael Chapman: And thereâ€™s no regulatory constraints to increasing your market share?\nBill Boor: We havenâ€™t gotten to that point yet and I think thereâ€™s a couple of things there. One is, as I said in my earlier remarks, itâ€™s a local business and so that analysis really has to be done at a local business. And secondly, when you look at deals in this industry, I think, we are part of the overall homebuilding industry, not just the manufactured housing industry. So we havenâ€™t really felt that we are bumping up against any kind of regulatory constraint or in concentration.\nMichael Chapman: Okay. Great. Thanks. Thatâ€™s all my questions. Appreciate it guys.\nBill Boor: Thank you\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn it back to Bill Boor, President and CEO for closing remarks.\nBill Boor: Thank you. Obviously, the focus of the call has been on financial results and understanding market dynamics at the moment. Internally, the various parts of our company are really working better than ever. For example, our marketing team continues to leverage the digital investments we have made and thatâ€™s benefiting our dealers and home shoppers and they are working seamlessly with our expanding national sales team to grow the business. We have got a lot going on in learning and development, where I feel like we have created really world-class programs aimed at improving leadership across the enterprise and providing clear pathways for our people. And finally, the business leadership across manufacturing, retail and Financial Services are doing a great job teaming up to ensure we have the right products and services for our distribution partners. As I have said before, our operators in all business segments are doing an outstanding job managing the challenging market conditions and thatâ€™s reflected in the strong cash flows despite the environment. But the real focus throughout the company is on getting ready to run, when economic conditions support, turning the tide on the huge deficit of attainable housing in our country and getting more families into quality Cavco homes, thatâ€™s our real focus and these conditions really havenâ€™t taken our eye off that ball at all. So thank you as always for your interest in Cavco. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in todayâ€™s conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect."

Now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill Boor, President and Chief Executive Officer. Bill?\nBill Boor: Welcome, and thank you for joining us today to review our first quarter results. While the earnings release provides year-over-year comparisons, I'd like to focus primarily on the sequential movements which I think are more relevant in understanding the current dynamics. From an operating and financial results perspective, this quarter was very consistent with Q4. Sequential volumes were essentially flat, up about 2%. Revenue was flat at $476 million and pretax profit was up slightly from $59 million to $61 million. Our capacity utilization, as measured over all available days remain consistent as well at approximately 60%. So operationally, it's been a steady quarter at the reduced pace with most of our plants remaining on a four-day schedule, and costs are being well managed as indicated by the strong gross margins. The most notable change this quarter was a meaningful pickup in wholesale orders. Backlogs edged lower from seven to eight weeks to five to six weeks, showing that production is still outpacing wholesale orders. However, the change was more modest than in the past few quarters, meaning the pace of orders did improve. Order rates were up year-over-year and up considerably over Q4. The pickup in orders is partly attributable to the improvement in retail inventories, which are now largely under control, and it's partly due to increased home buyer activity. We need to see these trends continue in order to achieve balance with our reduced production rates and then we'd be able to start ramping capacity utilization up from there. In our retail business and across our independent dealers and communities, there's a continued confidence in the underlying demand, and that's based on traffic, quotes and overall buyer activity. Interest rates and general economic confidence remain the questions for the near term. However, given the positive order trends, we believe we've seen the bottom of homes wholesale orders and we're looking to return to full production schedules as soon as the market support develops. I spoke about this last quarter, but continue to think it's worth noting in these tougher operating times that our plants have done an outstanding job of managing margins despite reduced production rates. Factory-built gross margins remained healthy at 24.8%. This was certainly helped by lumber and OSB pricing this quarter and by continued healthy selling prices. The business model is centered on the ability to keep controllable costs in our factories as variable as possible and our healthy profit and gross -- our cash generation despite a challenging order environment as the result. It's been a fast two quarters since we closed on the Solitaire deal. The work to combine the companies continues to go well. One area of focus has been on developing new models and updating the existing lineup with a focus on high-quality lower-priced products in line with current market needs. We've spoken in the past about the opportunities to round out product offerings across the combined retail operations and very good progress has been made there. As we continue to work-off the purchased inventory, Solitaire's impact on our results will develop as expected. Overall, there have been no surprises, and we're very happy with the acquisition and the great people that have joined our Cavco family. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Allison to discuss the financial results in more detail.\nAllison Aden: Thank you, Bill. Net revenue for the period was $475.9 million, down $12.4 million or 19.1% compared to $588.3 million during the prior year's first fiscal quarter. Within the factory-built housing segment, net revenue was $457.1 million, down $115.5 million or 20.2% from $572.6 million in the prior year quarter. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in base business homes sold and a decrease in average revenue per home sold, partially offset by the Solitaire Homes acquisition which contributed $36.8 million in the quarter. The decrease in average revenue per home was primarily due to more single-wides in the mix and to a lesser extent, product pricing decreases. After utilization of Q1 of 2024 was approximately 60% when considering all available production days, but was nearly 70%, excluding scheduled downtime for marketer weather, consistent with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Financial services segment net revenue increased 19.2% to $18.8 million from $15.7 million, primarily due to more insurance policies in force and higher premium rates. Consolidated gross profit in the first fiscal quarter as a percentage of net revenue was 24.8%, up 20 basis points from the 24.6% in the same period last year. In the factory-built housing segment, the gross profit increased 40 basis points to 24.8% in Q1 of 2024 versus 24.4% in Q1 of 2023, driven primarily by lower material dollars per floor. As expected, Solitaire purchase accounting adjustments on acquired inventory continue to have a 40 basis point negative impact on our gross margins this quarter. Under accounting rules, the inventory acquired upon purchase is recorded at fair value, which approximate the sales price. Therefore, when acquired inventory is sold, no operating income is recognized. We anticipate seeing the same impact for the next two quarters. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue and financial services decreased to 24% in Q1 of 2024 from 32.6% in Q1 of 2023, resulting from higher insurance claim expenses from increased weather events, which included a very long period of daily storm activity in Texas. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $61.7 million compared to $66.1 million during the same quarter last year. The decrease in these expenses is primarily due to lower third-party support costs and lower incentive compensation costs, partially offset by the addition of Solitaire Homes SG&A costs. Interest income for the first quarter was $4.6 million, up 251% from the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily due to higher interest rates on greater investment cash balances increased lending under our commercial loan programs. Other income net this quarter was $0.1 million compared to $0.4 million of expense in the prior year quarter. This increase is primarily driven by unrealized gains on equity securities held in the current year compared to losses in the prior year. Pretax profit was down $18.6 million or 23.5% to $60.7 million compared to $79.3 million for the prior year period. The effective income tax rate was 23.5% for the first fiscal quarter compared to 24.7% in the same period last year. In the prior year period, Energy Star credits had expired and had not yet been fully extended. Therefore, the current period tax rate is more indicative of our future rate. Net income attributable to Cavco shareholders was down $13.2 million or 22.1% from $46.4 million compared to $59.6 million in the first quarter of the prior fiscal year. Fully diluted earnings this quarter was $5.29 per share versus $6.63 per share in last year's first quarter. Before we discuss the balance sheet, I'd like to take a minute to talk about capital allocation. As announced with our press release, the company's Board of Directors approved a new $100 million stock repurchase program that may be used to purchase our outstanding common stock. This increases the total availability to $135.7 million. This includes the remaining amount under the program previously announced last year. With that, we will continue to responsibly deploy capital in keeping with our strategic priorities. Our capital priorities remain plan improvement, further acquisitions and ongoing evaluation of the opportunity in our lending operations. We will continue to utilize buybacks as a tool to responsibly manage our balance sheet. Now I'll turn it over to Paul to discuss the balance sheet.\nPaul Bigbee: Thank you, Allison. When me compare the July 1, 2023, balance sheet to April 1, 2023, the cash balance was $352.2 million, up $80.8 million or 29.8% from $271.4 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. The increase is primarily due to net income adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and stock compensation expense, and other working capital adjustments, including inventory, which decreased $9.2 million from lower raw materials at our factories and finished goods at our retail locations. Cash also increased due to the sale of consumer loans greater than originated, partially offset by commercial loan originations exceeding payments received. Prepaid and other assets are down from lower prepaid taxes and normal amortization of prepaid expenses. Property, plant and equipment net is down from the sale of equipment acquired with Solitaire Homes. And lastly, stockholders equity exceeded $1 billion, up $47 million from $976.3 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. This concludes the financial review. Now I'll turn it back to Bill.\nBill Boor: Thanks, Paul. Our results this quarter highlight the ability of our organization to manage costs and generate cash even when conditions are challenging. Everyone at Cavco is ready for what we view as an inevitable return of demand so we can help more families get the homes they need. With that, Abigail, let's turn it over and open up the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Moore with CJS Securities. Your line is open.\nDaniel Moore: Sorry about that, was muted. Thank you, Bill, Allison, Paul. Good morning. Thanks for taking the time and the questions. Maybe -- and Bill, very helpful color in terms of the cadence of orders and demand. Maybe if you can delineate across end markets, starting with retail, then the REIT channel and community developers, what's the cadence of order to look like throughout the quarter and thus far into fiscal Q2?\nBill Boor: Just looking for kind of relative differences between those?\nDaniel Moore: Yeah, exactly, exactly. And the rate of improvement and whether that's continued thus far in the current quarter.\nBill Boor: Yes, it has continued. I mean I think we talked last time about order levels and the fact that they left the fourth quarter -- basically not confuse the time period. So March was stronger than January, right, as you would expect seasonally, but it was good to see it. And that's what we kind of reported on last quarter. And that strength kind of continued to carry through. And as I said, we had a pretty nice sequential increase in order rates this quarter. To take it deeper, because I think this is part of your question, a lot of that strength, I think, is really coming from the dealers, the independent stores and are obviously Cavco owned stores. We've talked about the inventory problem. And last quarter, we said that we really thought that was going to -- it's not like it immediately is an on-off switch, but that was going to largely be behind us sometime during this first quarter. And I think that's the case from a total inventory perspective. And so right away, you kind of get the lift of starting to get to 1-to-1 orders, right? They sell a house and they need to order another home from the factory. So that's kind of played out as we expected it to when we talked last quarter. So a lot of the uplift in order rates has really come from the dealers. The communities are lagging a little bit. I mean it's interesting to think about. I think they're dealing with their own form of an inventory problem. And we've talked this in the past, and I think it's hard to generalize across the thousands of communities that are out there. But I think the community inventory problem takes two forms. Some communities have set houses that are ready to be occupied and they've seen a slowdown in filling those homes. So they're not going to be ordering. And then their ordering is fast, itâ€™s not an either/or but they're going to be kind of on the slower side of wholesale orders. And then other communities, when we've talked to this, they have unset homes. They have inventory of homes they previously ordered and that were largely delivered that they haven't been able to get set in place due to permitting and crew problems, set-up crews. And so if they could set more quickly, they feel they do have the demand but they're not able to get their homes ready to be occupied. So I don't mean to complicate this, but I think we've got a little of all that going on in the community side. And the total effect is that while retail orders are on the upswing, community orders are lagging a bit. We've talked to folks, both our people talking to the communities and also at a higher level with some of our large REITs. And best estimates we've heard are that this issue will start to ease up by the end of the calendar year, and we'll expect to see community orders improve, which will be upside from the pace of ordering we've seen now. And that's all. Every time I talk about that, looking forward, I always feel like I've got to say that's all assuming macroeconomic factors kind of allow that, right? There's -- we've seen what happens when there's kind of a shock or a big upswing in interest rates and things slow down. But macro factors permitting, I think the communities will pick up yet this calendar year. So that was a mouthful, Dan, did I cover the basis?\nDaniel Moore: Without a doubt. No, I found that, that was extremely helpful. And in fact, maybe just delineate a little bit further between communities and REITs, any difference or delta between the factors that you just described there? And what they're saying about their likely plans as we look to the balance of the year and next year?\nBill Boor: I'm not sure what you're asking for delineation. I was kind of talking through collectively the REITs and therefore, the community operators.\nDaniel Moore: That's fine. We kind of finish that offline. But maybe talk about yourâ€¦\nBill Boor: Okay.\nDaniel Moore: As you mentioned, in order to start to see an uptick in factory utilization, you need to see orders continue to build. I believe I heard that correctly. What are your expectations for shipments as well as ASPs directionally for fiscal Q2 which we expect shipments to be basically flattish from here, a little -- maybe a little bit of pull back? What are your thoughts?\nBill Boor: Yeah. We kind of stay away from guiding because I think it's still subject to changes in the market. So it's -- I'd kind of shy away from making a prediction about it. And my comment was as you picked up, it was that -- it's not only the level of backlog that matters, it's the direction of backlog. And we haven't turned that around yet. We saw another bit of drop in backlog this time. It was a much smaller drop, so the pace of that drop is improving. And I guess I'm being very repetitive here, but that pace was improving because the orders were up. Our production level was pretty steady the last two quarters. So we just need that trend to continue. I think it's on the right trajectory where we'll see backlogs first stabilize, which would be great. And then hopefully start to build with our four-day schedule and again, hopefully return to a level that supports us starting to take plants on a local basis back up to full schedule. So I'm not trying to make a prediction as much as you're saying. That's -- those are the trends that we're going to keep an eye on, and we're going to be looking forward to that time we get our utilization back up.\nDaniel Moore: Understood. Maybeâ€¦\nBill Boor: You asked about pricing as well, Dan?\nDaniel Moore: Yep.\nBill Boor: You asked about pricing as well, and that's very related, right? If the supply and demand balance supports, I think the industry has shown good discipline in holding price as well as it has. So all we need is for those backlogs to stabilize and start turning the direction and then that would support prices. If something happens to disrupt demand, then I think it's a real risk as it always is in this industry.\nDaniel Moore: Understood. Helpful. I will jump back with a couple of follow-ups, but turn it over. Thank you.\nBill Boor: Thanks, Dan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg Palm with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nGreg Palm: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe starting off and following up on a couple of Dan's. Can you maybe quantify exactly kind of what you're seeing in terms of order rates, whether that's a sequential or year-over-year basis? And then just specifically, what are you -- what are you seeing in July? Are you seeing sort of same magnitude of what you were seeing in the quarter? Are you seeing better? Are you seeing worse? And then maybe just kind of remind us what kind of normal seasonality is in terms of order rates on a normal year?\nBill Boor: Yeah, I can take a stab and then ask few other folks to correct, if I get this off or anything, I'm looking at some data here. And I'll give you the numbers. We haven't historically done this, but on a same plant basis, which basically what's not included in these numbers is the Solitaire acquisition. But on a same plant basis, we're up about 25% year-over-year on orders. And quarter-to-quarter, we were up about 65%. So pretty big jumps. Last year -- I think I'm right about this, last year, we were in a period now where we are starting to see cancellations in the orders drop off. So I really think it's more instructive to focus on sequential. There's the data on both. And Greg, could you remind me the second part of your question?\nGreg Palm: Yeah. What are you seeing in July specifically in terms of order rates? I mean anything that may be different relative to the quarter? And then I guess if you can just remind us kind of what normal seasonality is on -- for a typical year in terms of orders?\nBill Boor: Yeah. The -- I wouldn't note anything different in July kind of the continuation coming off of the last quarter information I just shared. So nothing of note there. And seasonality is interesting. We've looked at this and kind of if you take the year, this is going to be way too simplistic, but I think if you looked at the year kind of late March timeframe through October, that tends to be considerably higher, and then things drop off after October seasonally when you get into November, December and the early part of the calendar year as far as the seasonality. But I'll tell you, the seasonal shifts in some years where you've got a lot of bigger things going on like we have, like the interest rate adjustments and the macroeconomic drivers kind of shifting on folks as far as confidence, the seasonal aspect can sometimes get dwarfed by that. But we should -- we're not hitting a period where we'd expect things to drop off seasonally. We should be in -- from that perspective, be in a good zone through October, at least.\nGreg Palm: Yeah, okay. In terms of the commentary on the community orders and more or less on the timing, how is your visibility? And I think what you said was expect to see some orders, I don't know if it was by year-end or towards the end of the year, but can you give us maybe a little bit finer point on when you think -- I know your crystal ball is not perfect, but just based on all the information we know today?\nBill Boor: Yeah. Well, thanks for acknowledging itâ€™s not perfect because I was feeling that way as you're asking the question. Yes, I think my only statement is that just about everyone we talked to internally and externally, kind of feels like this is something that will be worked through in the next couple of quarters. So that's why I didn't really pinpoint it. I don't know. These things don't happen. I always say that they don't happen like a on-off switch. So hopefully, we'll be able to see this ease during the period. But even in talking to our big REIT customers, they're kind of feeling like, hey, by the end of the year, we should be â€œback to normal,\" meaning the, because I'm defining it an inventory problem that they have is kind of worked through. So it's a little bit analogous to what we went through with the dealers and the communities just seem to be on a little different time schedule. So I can't pinpoint it by months.\nGreg Palm: Yeah. But just to be clear, is that -- does that mean they order in advance, so they're ready to start taking more units by the end of the year? Or is your expectation that they start sort of ordering the units and then it's another handful of weeks or months until they actually take delivery and set them up?\nBill Boor: Yeah. That's kind of fine-tuning. We do expect that we'll see -- if we have an expectation, we do expect that we'll see orders in that time frame. And keep in mind, our backlogs are pretty short. So all of our customers know that orders turn into shipments pretty quick when backlogs are this short. So they won't be ordering with an assumption that, that means for delivery for in the future. But it should be really -- when we have this sort of a backlog, which is a good thing in this regard, it should be pretty just in time. They make an order, we're putting it into production and getting it done. So anyway, long-winded way of saying, I think the answer to your question is, yes, we're hoping that we'll have communities strengthening to support the order trends we're seeing from street dealers right now.\nGreg Palm: Understood. And last question around margins. Do you have -- I think you mentioned increased claims in the financial services. Do you have sort of any visibility on whether that might impact this quarter as well? Or do you feel like that was just sort of a one quarter kind of thing?\nBill Boor: Yeah. You know it's weather. Everything that our insurance company is doing to run their business, they feel real good about, their costs are right, they're getting appropriate premium increases, which are -- that's the whole process to get states to approve premium increases. And it takes a little time for the premium increases to kick in. But that business is operating as we expected to. They just had high claims. And so in my view, we had a number of storms, none of which were catastrophic, so they didn't get into the reinsurance levels. And on the kind of near-term outlook, there's no reason to think that correlates necessarily to a continuation of storm events for the rest of the year. So it's kind of just from a planning perspective, that past quarter is kind of isolated, and we're looking forward to an insurance company. Over time, they've done real well for us economically as far as getting a good return and making profits. But a little bit of the nature of the game that periodically can get hit with a rash of storms. I'm not sure if that was a clear answer, but going forward, I don't see that there's any reason to expect a continuation.\nGreg Palm: Yeah. Okay. Sounds good. All right, thanks for the questions.\nBill Boor: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jay Canless -- McCanless, with Wedbush. Your line is open.\nJay McCanless: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So Bill, congrats. Cavco's unit decline was about half of the 28%, 29% decline we saw in the industry shipments. I guess could you talk about how flexible you've had to be on price to do better than the industry. And then also on the flip side of that, now that we've seen lumber prices starting to work their way up, have you guys been tightening up on pricing just in the eventuality that higher lumber prices are going to start to flow through?\nBill Boor: Yeah, I really don't think we've -- I don't think we've maintained or gained any market share through pricing, through being more aggressive on pricing. I really don't believe that's the case. Just as we talk to all of our plants, we're in constant touch with them and have focus calls every month, we go through them kind of sensing what's right to do in their market. And for the most part, when they're kind of looking and talking to their own customers, the dealers, they feel like we're priced right with the other manufacturers. So I think we -- I'd like to think that we've got really good relationships with our dealers. I think that pays off over time. And I attribute any strength there to us focusing on the independents and doing a good job for them, but I don't think it comes from pricing. The question about lumber coming up. We always talk about our gross margins and kind of an obvious way that it is partly driven by those costs, and it's partly driven by price. But I've also said that for the last couple of years now, I think the price we charge as an industry, but us as well for our homes is a little bit disassociated with the cost. It's been driven by the supply and demand of our homes. So I don't -- I guess, that's a way of saying given where we are now, I'm not sure I believe that we're going to necessarily be kind of correlating pricing uptick in lumber and OSB prices, if that makes sense. We'll be kind of looking at it more from the standpoint of our competitive position and the supply and demand of homes in all those local markets.\nJay McCanless: Sure. Makes sense. Could you talk about where chattel mortgage rates are now versus maybe last quarter and last year?\nMark Fusler: Yeah, Jay, this is Mark. So I can take that one. So they've been pretty consistent sequentially. So right now, they're still about 9.15% to about 9.4%.\nJay McCanless: Sounds good. And then, I guess, the other question I had, just thinking again about capital allocation, the new authorization. Could you maybe talk about whether you do more stock repurchase first or does it make sense to expand on the floor plan side? Maybe just some general thoughts about that.\nAllison Aden: Yeah, James, let me help with that. I think if you take a step back, we've been very diligent since our first authorization, which was a couple of years ago in using the repurchase authorizations, and we do have $35 million on our previous authorization. And the Board just gave us another $100 million. So we really use these stock buybacks as a balance sheet management tool that remains available to us as something that we do plan to execute upon. We recognize that this creates maybe too much attention to when we are and arenâ€™t in the market in a given quarter. We've had markets in the -- quarters in the past when we didn't see repurchase and there's a variety of considerations. And I wouldn't read too much into the fact that we werenâ€™t in the market except to say that we're not generally speculating our stock price when we make these decisions. We're really managing the balance sheet and making sure we're conservative about position of any non-public information. And we still invest around our strategic priorities, which are expansion of plant operations and ongoing evaluation of opportunities and lending operations that are right down the center of manufactured housing. So just taken as a whole, it's just our continued focus on using stock buybacks as a responsible way to manage the balance sheet.\nJay McCanless: God it. Okay, thanks. Thatâ€™s all I had.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn it back to Bill Boor, President and CEO, for closing remarks. Bill, please make sure your line is not muted.\nBill Boor: Thank you, it was. I apologize for that. Despite our reduced production schedules and our -- our plants are still operating efficiently. And our retail organization continues to proactively drive lead generation and sales, and we're providing valuable tools to our retailers and prospective homebuyers with our digital marketing advances. And all of this, combined with our strong balance sheet, puts us in a great position to take what the market offers at the moment and be ready to ramp up when the inevitable release of demand occurs. The housing affordability problem continues to worsen. And while near-term economic drivers can slow orders, the underlying need in demand is only increasing. So with that, I want to thank you, as always, for your interest in Cavco, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect."
