During our second quarter, we continued to advance our strategic transformation and execute well against the core elements of LV360. I significantly improving profitability was a key takeaway from our latest results. Adjusted EBITDA increased 289% year-over-year to $3.1 million. In the second quarter, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was up 450 basis points to 6%, reflecting ongoing efforts to strengthen our core business and drive productivity. We are very pleased with the trends we are seeing in revenue for consultants. In each of the last 4 quarters, which coincides with the introduction and implementation of several key LV360 initiatives, our revenue per consultant has grown at a solid double-digit rate. For example, in the second quarter, revenue per consultant increased over 13% year-over-year. While total revenue in the second quarter were down slightly versus last year, robust demand for TrueScience, liquid collagen, coupled with the positive trends we are seeing in consultant productivity and our performance in markets like Japan, where Q2 revenues were up 3.9% on a currency-neutral basis, give us a high degree of confidence in our long-term growth outlook. Revenue attributable to liquid collagen, including the Healthy Glow Essential Stack, which bundles liquid collagen with Protandim Nrf2 Synergizer exceeded $13 million in the second quarter, an increase of over 44% versus a year ago. In the Americas region, where the product was first introduced in June 2022, we continue to experience strong growth with sales up approximately 13% on a year-over-year basis. In the U.S., consultant penetration of liquid collagen rose to 31.6% in the quarter up from 27.2% in Q1 with a continued focus on Healthy Glow Essential Stacks. Customer penetration was 27.2% in the U.S. during this Q2 compared to 28.1% in Q1 and 26.9% in Q4 of fiscal '23. International sales of liquid Collagen accounted for approximately 22% of Q2 liquid collagen revenue, mostly reflecting results from Australia, New Zealand and Japan, where the product was first introduced in March 2023. In late September 2023, we expanded the international launch of liquid collagen with the initial rollout into Mexico, and this was followed by introduction to the Philippines and Canadian markets in November. We are also pleased with the recent progress on other new innovative products. For example, early in the second quarter, we introduced TrueScience True Renew daily firming complex, a clean cosmetic retinal alternative that is proven to tackle 11 visible signs of aging. Importantly, this unique product is a perfect complement to Protandim Nrf2 Synergizer and TrueScience liquid collagen, further building on the power of our core positioning around being the activation company, along with creating momentum for our TrueScience activated skin care line. A couple of weeks ago, we held our annual global kickoff event where we unveiled the launch date for the next phase of LV360 along with new sales incentives and additional consultant tools. Rise era was announced as a theme for the year with a strong call to action to consultants to rise and build on the strong foundation LV360 has laid for the future. We've streamlined and simplified the message for consultants to drive growth and success by focusing on 3 basic behaviors of network marketing, enrolling, retaining and rank advancing for [ERA] era. This focus is supported by a new Rise Eera incentive that enables consultants to earn enticing lifestyle and business prices including shareable items like luggage and travel vouchers based on achievement in enrolling, retaining and advancing. Cape Town, South Africa, including an African safari was revealed as the first-ever executive destination trip under the new Evolve compensation plan. Qualification criteria for this once-in-a-lifetime trip is based on era behavior and achievements through the year with travel scheduled for February 2025. New consultant tools were also launched at our global kickoff event, including the new Evolve Possibilities pathway, which emphasizes 4 pivotal consultant ranks within the Evolve compensation plan and what is unlocked at each stage to inspire and motivate rank advancements. Our major events continue to be an important element driving consultant behavior and capitalizing on the strength of our broader LifeVantage community. The global kickoff in January, set the tone for calendar 2024, and we will build on this excitement with our upcoming in-person Momentum academies in March. The next phase of our LV360 transformation will commence in a few days at the start of February, Evolve our contemporary compensation plan and reward circle our unique customer loyalty program, we'll be launching in Mexico, Canada and Europe. Recall, we first launched these programs in the U.S., Japan, Australia, New Zealand and March of 2023, as part of LV360 and they have been key elements of our success over the past year. In addition to our Rise Era initiatives in our Phase II launch, we've established an optimization team to lead ongoing strategic efforts to build our active account base. The team is focused on 3 areas: first, ensuring our enrollers, the group of consultants actively enrolling consultants and customers each month is increasing, arming our enrollers with a strong dollar per hour earnings potential message, so the business is seen as an enticing business opportunity for those looking for a side hustle. Second, that there is a clear replicable path to enrolling someone in your first 30 days as a consultant. And finally, that we are making it easy for our rating product fans to share their incredible results and our unique product story in new, innovative and compelling ways. We will be updating you on the progress of these optimization efforts in coming quarters. In summary, we are pleased with progress on our strategic transformation, LV360. Our improved outlook for profitability in fiscal 2024 despite a still challenging top line environment underscores our confidence in the trajectory of key initiatives as well as the strength of our competitive position. Engagement levels remain high across the entire organization. And we look forward to our business momentum continuing to build as we expand our efforts across all our international markets over the next several quarters. We remain focused on executing our plan while remaining agile to ensure we are optimizing the key elements of LV360 to drive sustainable, profitable growth and value for shareholders. Capital allocation continues to be a key area of focus. And during the second quarter, we remain steadfast in our balanced approach of returning excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase. Carl will cover this in more detail in his section. Now let me turn the call over to Carl Aure, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our second quarter financial results. Carl?\nCarl Aure : Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me walk you through our second quarter financial results. Please note that I will be discussing our non-GAAP adjusted results. You can refer to the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in today's press release for additional details. Second quarter revenue was $51.6 million, down 3.8% on a year-over-year basis and foreign currency negatively impacted revenue by $0.2 million. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, second quarter revenue was down by $1.8 million or 3.4% as compared to the prior year period. Revenue in the Americas region decreased 1.6% to $39.1 million in the quarter, primarily driven by a 9.5% decrease in total active accounts, partially offset by higher average revenue per account, resulting from changes in product mix due to continued penetration of our TrueScience Liquid Collagen product. Revenue in our Asia Pacific and Europe region decreased 10% to $12.6 million in the quarter, driven by an 18.2% decrease in total active accounts the closure of our e-commerce business in China and the negative impacts from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, second quarter revenue in our Asia Pacific and Europe region was down 8% as compared to the prior year period. The foreign currency impact continues to be driven by fluctuations in Japan, accounting for $300,000 of the impact. Adjusting for this impact, revenue in Japan increased 3.9% on a constant currency basis in the quarter as compared to the prior year period. Gross margin was 78.6% for the second quarter compared to 78.1% in the prior year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to changes in sales mix along with lower shipping related expenses in the quarter, resulting from changes in shipping methods. Commissions and incentive expense in the second quarter decreased $1.8 million year-over-year. As a percentage of revenue, commissions and incentive expense decreased 180 basis points to 42.1% versus 1 year ago levels, which was primarily driven by changes in sales mix, impacts from our Evolved compensation plan as well as the timing and magnitude of promotional and incentive programs. Non-GAAP adjusted SG&A expense was $17.4 million compared with $19.4 million in the prior year quarter and was down 230 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 33.8%. Adjusted non-GAAP operating income was $1.4 million, compared with a loss of $0.9 million in the prior year period. Adjusted non-GAAP net income was $1.4 million or $0.10 per fully diluted share in the second quarter, compared to adjusted net loss of $0.8 million or $0.07 per fully diluted share in the comparable period last year. We recorded a tax benefit of $0.5 million in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $17,000 in the prior year period. The increase in tax benefit was primarily due to changes in taxable income and the favorable impact of discrete items. We expect that our effective tax rate will fluctuate slightly during the remainder of fiscal 2024 as the impact of discrete items and other permanent differences are recognized. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $3.1 million or 6% of revenues compared to $0.8 million and 1.5% in the same period a year ago. Please note that all of the adjustments from GAAP to non-GAAP that I discuss today are reconciled in our earnings press release issued this afternoon. We ended the second quarter in a strong financial position, with $17.3 million of cash and no debt. We also continue to maintain $5 million of availability under our revolving line of credit. Capital expenditures totaled $0.5 million in the second quarter. We anticipate total capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $2.5 million. In addition to maintaining a strong balance sheet, we continue to focus on our capital allocation priorities to drive value for stockholders. During the second quarter, we used approximately $1.9 million in cash to repurchase approximately 288,000 common shares under our share repurchase authorization. And through the first 6 months of fiscal 2024, we have used approximately $2.7 million to repurchase approximately 433,000 shares. As of December 31, 2023, there is $24.2 million remaining under our stock repurchase authorization. We also announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.035 per common share of stock or approximately $450,000 in the aggregate. This dividend will be paid on March 15, 2024, to stockholders of record on March 1. Since the beginning of fiscal 2024, including this latest dividend announcement, we will have paid cash dividends of $0.505 per share or approximately $6.4 million in the aggregate. So far this fiscal year, we will have returned over $9 million in total value to our stockholders through share repurchases and dividends. Turning to our fiscal 2024 outlook. We anticipate our fiscal 2024 revenue will be in the range of $207 million to $213 million, from the previous range of $216 million to $226 million. Additionally, we continue to anticipate adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA in the range of $16 million to $18 million with adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.57 to $0.67 per share, increasing from the previous range of $0.52 to $0.62 per share.  For fiscal year 2024, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 22% to 24%. Included in our fiscal 2024 guidance is over $2 million of nonrecurring expenses related to an expiring sponsorship agreement and costs associated with the rollout of LV360 to our remaining markets. We remain committed to improving our adjusted EBITDA margins, and we believe we are on track to reach our long-term target of low double digits.  And with that, let me turn the call back over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will begin doing your question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Doug Lane with Water Tower Research.\nDoug Lane : Looking at the -- focusing on the top line here. Are we at some sort of inflection point between growth coming from mostly Americas having anniversaried the launches last year and now really, maybe we see a shift towards international being a bigger driver going forward?\nSteve Fife: Yes. We had a very successful launch 1.5 years ago or so in the Philippines. And that market has stabilized and more recently, actually has had some challenges to retain some of its leadership. But as we look back on LV360, we really slowed down our international expansion to focus on the compensation plan, our product strategy and other aspects of LV360. I anticipate that here in the future we'll pick up again a focus on opportunities internationally. We think that remains a growth opportunity for us. Right now, we're seeing strength primarily in the U.S. and our Japan and really our Phase 1 markets as those markets adopt Phase I and adopt our LV360 and the Evolve compensation plan.\nDoug Lane : Right, right. So there really is 2 stories internationally. You've got the Philippines and what's going on in China kind of working as a headwind versus the launches in China, I mean, Japan and Australia, New Zealand, which.\nSteve Fife: That's right. You would expect to get some traction. That's exactly right.\nDoug Lane : Okay. And how do we -- I mean, trying to small, I get it, but how do we see that playing out? Are we -- how far into that discontinuation of the business there are we?\nSteve Fife: In China or the Philippines?\nDoug Lane : No, China.\nSteve Fife: We're through that. It's -- Yes. We had relatively close to 0 in this current quarter.\nDoug Lane : Okay. Okay. Well, that's 1 issue that sort of resolved itself then. Okay. And what about the Philippines? Is there still more volatility there?\nSteve Fife: No. I think that we have stabilized the leadership group there we're starting to see some positive signs, and we've got some new corporate team members in place as well as we've we're attracting some new consultant leaders that I think we have upside in calendar '24 in that market. It's -- this business model can be -- is very attractive within the Philippines market. And like we had some success, we lost a couple of leaders that I'm cautiously optimistic that we're in the process of rebuilding that right now.\nDoug Lane : Okay. That's helpful. Another trend here that has been fairly persistent is a sort of steady decline in your active customers, but pretty nice increase in your revenue per active customer. So -- or I guess you say accounts because you include everybody in that number. So is this deliberate -- I mean is this going to be the model in the foreseeable future? Or are there plans in the works to focus on the active accounts and getting those numbers heading north again?\nSteve Fife: Yes. First, I'd say that focusing on that active revenue per account was a key element of the very beginning of LV360. We knew and anticipated that the launch of our Liquid Collagen product that has been a huge success, would help drive that average revenue per account, that's been continued as we have found additional synergies and bundling our Protandim Nrf2 Synergizer with liquid collagen and so that focus on increasing the revenue per customer was a very early and conscious decision. Now having said that, I think the drop off in our customer accounts, I think there's a real strong macroeconomic play in place here. We've seen it correlate pretty strongly with what's going on in the broader economy. And that, I guess, period, but we're also seeing kind of a stabilization within our consultant base as we now kind of come through the initial transition of our Evolve compensation plan, we're seeing that base stabilize and are really focusing our attentions right now in supporting that consultant base and providing them with the tools and those tools are videos, there's -- there's other trainings and products is an important element of that as they -- to enable them to go out and to attract new customers as well. So we are at an inflection point with that consultant base, having stabilized and now being equipped with some new tools to go out and attracting new customers as well as obviously other consultants.\nDoug Lane : Okay. No, that's good color. And then certainly, the margin story came through nicely. I guess, versus what I put together the big upside was in commissions and incentives are still running a little bit behind what I sort of see as a mid-40s kind of longer-term trend. Carl, do you think this is -- are we going to get back to that mid-40s soon? Or are we going to have -- are we still at the sort of low 40s run rate for a few more quarters?\nCarl Aure: Yes. I mean, part of it -- I mean it's likely to increase a little bit over time here. But 1 of the impacts here in Q2, as you look at in comparison to the prior year quarter, we're still seeing a larger not essentially bucket of noncommissionable revenue that's influencing that percentage as a percentage of total revenue. So that definitely was an impact here in Q2. But looking forward, as we roll out as Evolve gets rolled out to the other international markets, the plan starts to mature in the existing markets, it's likely that we'll see a bit of an uptick there, but I think that, that range of the low mid -- low 40s there is probably where it's going to settle.\nSteve Fife: And just to add, the non-commissionable revenue, that's primarily coming in from convention-related revenue and shipping-related revenue, those types of revenue items that as they grow or become a greater percentage of our overall revenue, from a percentage standpoint, it makes it look like the commission payout is a little bit lower, but it's really just comparing -- when you compare it to total revenue. There is included in that, some non-commissionable revenue.\nDoug Lane : But that non-commissionable revenue is unusually high these days and should normalize going forward?\nSteve Fife: Yes. In the quarter, we had a higher percentage than in previous quarters. But I don't know that there's enough to say that there's a trend or anything going on with that just in the quarter.\nDoug Lane : Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then on the outlook, I get the sales change and the EBITDA is the same and then you moved EPS up. So I assume that's mostly the tax rate there.\nCarl Aure: Yes. That's mostly -- there's probably 2 things in the EPS component. Stock-based comp is down slightly in our forecast for the rest of the year, and then it's primarily tax and then just the impact of interest income, in the other income section. So those 3 items are really what's driving the change in EPS.\nDoug Lane : Okay. That's helpful. And then just looking out the next several quarters, what are the key new product drivers that you guys are working on that -- just try to get a feel for timing of product launches. Obviously, if they haven't announced them, you're not going to announce them now. But just to get a feel for timing of new product launches over the next 3 or 4 quarters.\nSteve Fife: Yes. We have a, I'd say, a very robust pipeline. And I mentioned in March, we will be having in-person momentum academies. And those are country events. So every 1 of our countries will be holding in events. And we will be announcing a new product in those momentum academies. So next product will be coming in March.\nDoug Lane : That's soon. Okay. All right. That's very helpful.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'd like to hand it back to Mr. Fife for closing remarks.\nSteve Fife : Thank you for joining us. As we conclude, I want to express my appreciation to our committed employees, outstanding independent consultants, shareholders and faithful customer base. The strength of our distinctive platform, coupled with the competitive edge of our business model that empowers individuals to establish businesses on their own terms is complemented by a steadfast leadership team, a diverse range of unique products and engage consultant community and a robust financial position. This collectively emphasizes our strategic positioning for the future, enabling us to pursue long-term goals while we consistently build substantial value for our shareholders. Thanks for participating today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."

Our latest results once again demonstrate the effectiveness of LV360 coupled with our robust innovation portfolio to drive growth and improve profitability across the entire LifeVantage organization from consultants to customers, from corporate employees, to Board members, energy levels remain incredibly high as our key initiatives continue gaining traction. We delivered a 6.5% revenue increase in the US, while overall revenues were down fractionally year-over-year on a constant currency basis. TrueScience Liquid Collagen continues to be the key driver as demand has remained very strong. This product was introduced in the US in June 2022 and only recently began launching in international markets, which should set the stage for growth in those markets as fiscal 2024 unfolds. Profitability also continues to show solid improvement with adjusted EBITDA increasing over 41% to $4 million in the first quarter and an adjusted EBITDA margin, up 230 basis points to 7.8%.approximately $12 million or 23.5% of Q1 revenue was attributable to Liquid Collagen plus the Healthy Glow Essential Stack which bundles Liquid Collagen with Protandim Nrf2 Synergizer. In the US, customer penetration was 28.1% versus 26.9% in Q4 fiscal 2023 and compared to 24% at the end of calendar 2022. Reorder rates provide another strong indicator of the health of the product and strong demand as second month reorders were up recently at 77.8% versus 77% at the end of Q4 2023. Liquid Collagen sales are still predominantly driven by activity in the US but we are seeing our recent expansion of Liquid Collagen into the international markets ramp up steadily. As you may recall, Liquid Collagen entered Australia, New Zealand and Japan in March of 2023, and the results to date have exceeded our internal expectations. At the end of September, we launched Liquid Collagen into Mexico, and we are commencing sales in the Philippines in November, followed by our Canadian launch in December of 2023.  In addition to expanding into new geographic markets, we continue to advance our innovation agenda by introducing new products that broaden our unique health and wellness offering. For example, in early October, we relaunched a new product, TrueScience, TrueRenew, Daily Firming Complex to all US consultants and those in attendance at our global convention. TrueRenew is a cleaner kinder cosmetic retinol alternative that has proven to tackle 11 visible signs of aging. It is a perfect complement to the inter activation power of Protandim Nrf2 Synergizer and TrueScience Liquid Collagen and ushers in a new era for the brand's TrueScience activated skincare line. The product prelaunch to all consultants in international markets on October 20 and then to all consumers globally on November 2.  We also announced further enhancements to LV360 in early October, including the new Fast Track Reset incentive that launched in all markets currently operating with the new Evolve compensation plan. This incentive invites all consultants to focus on the next 90 days with bonuses that are typically only available to new consultants. For markets not yet on the Evolve compensation plan, a similar rank advancement incentive was launched. Both TrueRenew and the Fast Track Reset Incentive and the rank Advancement incentives were announced October 6 and 7 at our Global Convention where over 2,000 consultants joined us in San Antonio, Texas. The theme for this event was all in, and it serves as not only a celebration for our LV360 transformation and the milestone achieved thus far. In addition to the TrueRenew and the product promotions surrounding that product launch, convention attendees also received first access to our new limited-time flavors of AXIO,  Green Apple and Orchard pair DCAS as well as the new TrueScience TruePout Advanced Lip Duo, which is an exfoliating lip scrub and high-grading lip oil packaged together in a great giftable set. These limited-time products also went live to consumers in the US on November 2.  At Global Convention, we also announced our next phases of LV360 and in Canada, Europe, and Mexico, which will be transitioning to our new Evolve compensation plan in early 2024, with our remaining markets transitioning by the end of our fiscal year 2024. Convention attendees also received new consultant training as well as recognition for their recent achievements. LifeVantage events serve as an excellent community builder and global convention was no different. Consultants were able to join together with their teams and plan for the coming months, while also celebrating each other's success. Consultants' feedback on the event was overwhelmingly positive, and the excitement for the future of LifeVantage was palpable. We are looking forward to our next events, which include our Virtual Global Kickoff 2024 in January and our in-person Momentum Academy in March in Nashville for our US market. During the first quarter, we also continued to execute against our capital allocation priorities, returning value to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. We paid a total of $5.5 million or $0.435 per share in cash dividends during the quarter, including a $0.40 special dividend and utilized approximately $800,000 to repurchase 145,000 shares. As many of you are aware, we held our fiscal year 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on Monday, November 6th. Based on the preliminary results provided by the Independent Inspector of Elections, shareholders have reelected all seven LifeVantage incumbent Directors and approve all proposals, including the proposal to ratify the Stockholder Rights Plan. The Radoff-Sudbury Group has exercised its right to review and challenge the independent inspector's preliminary voting tabulation. We expect that process to take place over the coming days. We will report the preliminary results on a Form 8-K as required, and we will also disclose the final certified results once the review and challenge period has concluded. In the meantime, we would like to thank our shareholders for their constructive feedback, engagement, and attention to the annual meeting. We have learned from our dialogue with our shareholders and appreciate their continued support as we remain focused on executing our LV360 initiatives to drive sustainable, profitable growth and value creation. We do not intend to answer any questions on this topic during the call today. In summary, we are very pleased with the early progress on the key LV360 initiatives to drive consultant engagement and expect the positive trends to continue in the US, while broadening to international markets over the next several quarters. Strong demand for new products also continues to drive our optimism about the future as we build on the momentum of liquid collagen through expansion into new geographic areas and complementary offerings. Organizationally, we are firmly aligned with the future vision of LifeVantage and our strong balance sheet ensures we are well positioned to deliver significant growth and value to shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Carl Aure, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our first quarter financial results. Carl?\nCarl Aure: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me walk you through our first quarter financial results. Please note that I will be discussing our non-GAAP adjusted results. You can refer to the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in today's press release for additional details. First quarter revenue was $51.4 million, down 0.8% on a year-over-year basis and was down 5.3% from the fourth quarter. Foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted revenue by $0.3 million in the first quarter. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations, first quarter revenue was down slightly by $0.1 million or approximately 0.2%, as compared to the prior year period. Revenue in the Americas region increased 5.9% to $38.5 million in the quarter, including a 6.5% increase in the US as compared to the prior year period. This increase was primarily driven by a higher average revenue per account, resulting from the continued success of our Truescience Liquid Collagen product. Revenue in our Asia Pacific and Europe region decreased 16.6% to $12.9 million in the quarter, driven by a 17% decrease in total active accounts and the negative impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding the negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations, first quarter revenue in our Asia Pacific and Europe region was down 14.6% as compared to the prior year period. The foreign currency impact continues to be driven by fluctuations in Japan, accounting for $0.3 million of the impact. Adjusting for this impact, revenue in Japan declined 4% on a constant currency basis. Gross margin was 80.2% for the first quarter compared to 80.8% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to shifts in product sales mix, increased raw material and manufacturing-related costs and higher shipping expenses and warehouse fulfillment expenses during the quarter. Commissions and incentive expense in the first quarter decreased $1.3 million year-over-year. As a percentage of revenue, commissions and incentive expense decreased 220 basis points to 43.8% and versus year ago levels, which was primarily driven by changes in sales mix as well as the timing and magnitude of promotional and incentive programs. Non-GAAP adjusted SG&A expense was $16.6 million, which was consistent with the prior year quarter and was up 30 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 32.4%. Adjusted non-GAAP operating income was $2.1 million, compared with $1.4 million in the prior year period. Adjusted non-GAAP net income was $1.7 million or $0.13 per fully diluted share in the first quarter, compared to adjusted net income of $0.7 million or $0.06 per fully diluted share in the comparable period last year. We recorded tax expense of $0.2 million in the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the first quarter, our effective tax rate was 24.1%. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $4 million or 7.8% of revenues, compared to $2.8 million and 5.5% in the same period a year ago. Please note, that all of the adjustments from GAAP to non-GAAP that I discuss today are reconciled in our earnings press release issued this afternoon. We ended the first quarter in a strong financial position with $18.4 million of cash and no debt. We also continue to maintain $5 million of availability under our revolving line of credit. Capital expenditures totaled $1.1 million in the first quarter. We anticipate total capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 to be approximately $2.5 million. We will continue to focus on our capital allocation strategy in order to maximize shareholder value. During the first quarter, we used approximately $800,000 in cash to repurchase approximately 145,000 common shares under our share repurchase authorization. As of September 30, 2023, there was $26.1 million remaining under our stock repurchase authorization. We also announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.035 per share of common stock or approximately $400,000 in the aggregate. This dividend will be paid on December 15, 2023, to shareholders of record on December 1. Turning to our fiscal 2024 outlook. We continue to anticipate our fiscal 2024 revenue will be in the range of $216 million to $226 million, adjusted non-GAAP EBITDA in the range of $16 million to $18 million with adjusted non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.52 to $0.62 per share. For fiscal 2024, we expect our annual effective tax rate to be approximately 22% to 25%. Included in our fiscal 2024 guidance is over $2 million of non-recurring expenses related to an expiring sponsorship agreement and costs associated with the rollout of LV360 to our remaining mark, which will not be incurred in future years. We remain committed to improving our adjusted EBITDA margins and we believe we are on track to reach our long-term target of low double digits. And with that, let me turn the call back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Lane from Water Tower Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDoug Lane: Yes. Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. See, there's a lot of moving parts here. And I think the one that stands out to me is how successful and how quickly you've been successful in the U.S. with all these rollouts earlier in the year with the new comp plan and the new marketing program. Can you give us a sense for where the U.S. is vis-à-vis expectations six or nine months ago? And then how long do you think it will take to attain similar success in your international markets, which are still struggling a little bit?\nSteve Fife: Yes. Thanks, Doug. Good question. We are extremely pleased with just how quickly the U.S. market has adapted and adopted the evolved compensation plan. And I attribute it to a couple of things. One, just how solid the plan is itself. And when we set out to redesign a best-in-industry plan, we wanted to have a plan that would be appealing to individuals who were looking on to sell product and to earn income comparable to what social sellers or influencers can do, what part time people that are really looking for just a side hustle by selling products can do. But also a plan that continue to build on individuals that want to build an organization and have kind of long-term stability and are really entrepreneurs  interested in building a long-term business. And I think we've achieved that with this plan. And I think the adoption in the US is indicative of that. I think we did a phenomenal job with individuals, both the employees and our consultant leadership group in terms of the rollout and the communication of the plan. And so we were very clear with expectations and how they could optimize the plan. Going on to now our second and third launches in the remaining markets that we have, I'm even more optimistic because people in these countries, let's just say, the Philippines as an example or Canada, they've been able to witness and see the benefits that have come to the plan in the US market. And many of the top leaders in the US also have organizations in those international markets. And so I think we have a jump start, if you will. We've also been putting in place promotions in those markets that have been running and will continue to run that will help kind of mimic some of the behavioral changes that will come through the comp plan changes in those markets. So people are already starting to build and see the benefit of some of those changes of the experience. So I -- we remain very optimistic that the adoption and benefits that we are seeing in the US will be accelerated in our international markets as we roll this out.\nDoug Lane: Okay. And talking about Evolve specifically, it's an iterative process, right? I mean it takes a while to have it fully implemented in any given market, and then it's not been rolled out to all your markets yet. So you can just basically give us an idea of what inning do you think the Evolve implementation is in? And how long do you expect before it's fully implemented globally?\nSteve Fife: Yes. So we launched Evolve in the US, Japan, Australia and New Zealand in March -- on March 1 of this year. And we had a six-month transition plan in place for all of our consultants during that subsequent six months. So we are officially out of transition and in the full plan adoption and utilization of the plan in those four markets. And so now it's -- and that transition period really is to give those leaders time to adjust to the nuances of the new plan. Many of our leaders have been around for five, 10 years and built their business in a certain way and we wanted to allow them to have time to kind of retool their messaging to optimize this new plan. Our Phase 2 markets, which are Canada, Mexico and Europe, will launch in February of next year. And then all of the remaining markets in Asia will launch towards the end of our fiscal year. So by the end of our fiscal year, all of the countries that we currently operate on will be operating under the new Evolve plan. Some of them will still be in kind of a transitional period. But I think it's safe to say if you pass forward a year from now, it will be fully implemented and in full plan operations. So we'll be through transitions in all of the countries a year from now.\nDoug Lane: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I think you mentioned in your comments that liquid collagen is up to a 28.1% penetration rate, and that goes up quarter after quarter here. Where do you think that can ultimately get to when you would consider it to be fully penetrated?\nSteve Fife: Yes. I mean -- and not to skip over that too quickly, but the 28% penetration rate is really high. So we're pleased with that. I think it's 30%, 35% is a very realistic -- it's -- it's our target to where we think that, that can come as again, it's launching in additional countries now. A few months ago, we announced a new study that we have that articulates the benefits of our liquid collagen when taken with our Protandim Nrf2 synergizers -- and that again has -- gave a boost to us and especially in this stack or a pack that we call it our healthy Glow stack, which combines those two products together. So we think that there's still legs to grow on the penetration front both as people get more and more used to it as well as our launch into new countries with it.\nDoug Lane: Okay. That's helpful in putting some perspective on that number. And just one more for me. And that is, Carl, I noticed that commissions and incentives were down as a percent of sales. Is this onetime in the quarter? Or is there going to be a step function down from the new comp plan going in?\nCarl Aure: Yes, that's a good question, Doug. As we -- one of the big pieces to that in the quarter is with respect to promotional spend. One of the things that we had and if you look prior to the implementation of Evolve is that we had much higher promotional related spend. And in particular, in the comparable quarter last year, we had a specific promotion running around collagen to help boost the success of collagen. And so that number really is heavily influenced by the level of promotional activities that we have during the course of the quarter. And then the other thing that's impacting just that as a percentage of revenue is we have some higher non-commissionable revenue in the quarter related to shipping related changes and some of the other price increases that we've taken are influencing that percentage. So overall, the base comp isn't significantly different, but it's really the timing and the overall sales mix that is influencing that percentage this quarter.\nDoug Lane: Got it. All right. Thank you.\nSteve Fife: All right. Thanks, Doug.\nCarl Aure: Thanks, Doug.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to Steve Fife for closing remarks.\nSteve Fife: Thanks, operator, and thank you for joining us today.
