And now, I will turn the call over to the company's CEO, Rob Sarlls. Rob, please go ahead.\nRob Sarlls: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. We accomplished a major pivot in our business in the fiscal third quarter, with the permanent relocation of our consumer packaging functions to a third-party world-class co-packer in Utah. This co-packer will now handle all of the final assembly of our boxed and toted chocolates, fulfilling a critical need within our simplify and focus strategic objective. Labor availability has been a challenge in Durango for a while, particularly for our labor intensive packaging operation. It has historically taken anywhere between 15 and 50 people to hand pack assorted chocolate boxes and other toted items with manpower needs typically peaking during the holiday season. We had a particularly tough year with labor in 2023 such that we were frequently deploying chocolate manufacturing talent to fill and complete boxed chocolate needs. This not only reduced our availability to fully meet seasonal holiday production requirements, but also impacted our ability to capitalize on new business opportunities, including e-commerce. This difficult but critically needed transition, the third-party co-packing, came with additional one-time relocation costs, including additional transportation and expedited production costs to prioritize the delivery of inventory to our franchisee network and omni-channel partners. Although this had a temporary impact on margins, it was an essential step to ensure a positive outcome for our partners and to strengthen our long-term positioning. The combined effects of these factors prevented us from fully capturing anticipated holiday volumes, and we estimate the resulting impact would have been approximately in excess of $1 million in unrealized product sales. Despite the short-term impact, we are pleased with the net result of the packaging move to Utah, and I'm proud of the hard work by our operations and supply chain team to facilitate this relocation effort in the midst of our busiest season. As a consequence, we've eliminated the long-standing production ceiling we faced in Durango, and this move has created substantial additional capacity to meet future demand. As evidenced, in December alone, we produced in Durango nearly 50% more pounds of premium chocolate products than we did in the entirety of the fiscal fourth quarter of the prior year. This is a direct result of labor relief in Durango as our production team can now focus on what they do best, making even more high quality premium chocolate and confectionary products. This improved configuration empowers us to meet the higher demand volumes we anticipate from new and existing specialty retail omni-channel partners as well as planned expansion in e-commerce and our franchise network, which we plan to expand in the years ahead. Quickly turning to several other milestones that reflect the ongoing execution of our strategic transformation plan. To do more with less, we once again made meaningful reductions in G&A, marking our third consecutive quarter of double-digit sequential improvement. We also made continued progress in growing our product gross margins, which reached to double digits on an adjusted basis for the first time in a year. To amplify and elevate the Rocky Mountain Chocolate brand, we engaged an award-winning retail and hospitality design firm, Design Well Spent Co. to lead the aesthetic refresh of both company and franchisee owned storefronts. Additionally, as we announced in November, we completed the build out of our senior leadership team with the addition of Kara Conklin as our VP of Franchise Development, who joins us from Focus Brands. Kara brings nearly 20 years of franchise and operating experience. She has a proven track record with multi-unit operators, an area in which we are focusing on much more in the future, and as importantly, a passion for the transformation and elevation of our brand in the franchise business world. Kara is already out in front of current and prospective franchisees, pushing forward our stated plans to expand our franchise store base over the next several years. Turning to the Board, in December, we added the appointment of Steve Craig, a seasoned business strategist and successful retail developer, to the Board of Directors. For nearly four decades, Steve has developed, owned and operated commercial real estate primarily outdoor malls for retail shops and restaurants throughout the United States. He brings nearly 30 years of Executive and Board experience with both public and private companies. Steve is also committed to the development of aspiring entrepreneurial youth, having funded an endowment and founding the Steven L. Craig School of Business at Missouri Western State University. And in fact, the Craig School of Business Center for Franchise Development, which offers training to students interested in franchise ownership, has graduated 33 students who were awarded franchises, but this includes 15 alumni currently operating -- actually 10 alumni operating 15 Rocky Mountain Chocolate stores, some of which are among our best operators. Steve's direct experience as a multi-unit operator and franchisee of Rocky Mountain Chocolate since 2011 made him an ideal addition to our Board. To summarize the quarter, our new management team is fully built and laser focused on executing on our strategic transformation plan. The lessons learned from the holiday season and our relocation of our consumer packaging to Utah have us well equipped to better capitalize on the upcoming Valentine's Day demand cycle and other critical business opportunities going forward, including e-commerce and expanding business with existing and new specialty retail customers with much greater certainty. The hard work continues and we're nearing an inflection point as we prepare to return to growth and profitability in fiscal 2025. I will now hand it over to our CFO Allen to discuss our fiscal Q3 financial highlights before returning for closing remarks. Allen?\nAllen Arroyo: Thank you, Rob. Please note that all financial results discussed today are for continuing operations, while all variance commentary is on a year-over-year basis, unless stated otherwise. Moving on to our results. Total revenue was $7.7 million compared to $8.8 million in the prior year. The decrease was attributable to higher factory overhead and production constraints related to personnel at our Durango facility, the latter of which impacted fulfillment and offset strong holiday seasonal demand. Taking a deeper look at our sales, total product sales were $6.1 million compared to $7.3 million. Royalty and marketing revenue was $1.2 million versus approximately flat over the prior year. Retail sales at our company-operated stores increased 21% to $364,000 compared to $302,000. The increase was a result of opening of a second company-owned store in July 2023. Same-store sales for our company-owned store in Durango decreased 1.1% year-over-year, primarily due to the aforementioned production constraints. Same-store sales across all domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory locations decreased 2.1% during the quarter compared to the prior year. And franchise fee revenue was $41,000 compared to $49,000. Total product and retail gross profit was $0.7 million compared to $1.9 million, with a gross margin of 10.2% compared to 24.5%. The decrease was primarily attributed to the previously mentioned constraints, which led to lower product availability and overhead absorption. The decrease in gross margin was also due to one-time costs associated with the relocation of packaging operations to Salt Lake City, Utah. Total operating expenses decreased 7% to $8.5 million compared to $9 million. The improvement was due primarily to a decrease in professional fees related to the costs associated with the contested solicitation of proxies in fiscal 2023. Net loss from continuing operations was $0.8 million or $0.12 per share compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $0.2 million or $0.03 per share. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $3 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $1.2 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and gross margin, partially offset by lower sales and marketing expenses and franchise costs. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $2.1 million compared to $4.7 million at the end of fiscal year 2023. The net decrease in cash was primarily due to cash used in operations and the purchase of property and equipment, partially offset by the sale of [indiscernible] assets. For the nine months through the end of the third quarter, we spent $2.5 million in capital expenditures, the highest level for such time period in over a decade. In the near future, we'll be exploring the use of equipment-based financing as part of our capital structure. We ended the third quarter with total inventories of $3.7 million, roughly flat compared to the year-end fiscal 2023. As of November 30, 2023, we utilized $1.0 million from our line of credit. However, our balance sheet remains free of any long-term debt. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rob for closing remarks.\nRob Sarlls: Thanks, Allen. Looking to the close of fiscal 2024 and beyond, the actions we've taken over the past year have laid the groundwork for the future of the business. We're in a much stronger position going into the 2025 fiscal year to support and sustain our current business and take better advantage of new business opportunities than we were entering fiscal 2024. Our efforts and execution of the transformation plan are beginning to bear fruit, and we have the right team in place to accelerate the execution next year. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be glad to answer any questions now. Operator, back to you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from [Jim McIlree] (ph) with Dawson James. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah, thank you, and good morning.\nRob Sarlls: Good morning, Jim.\nUnidentified Analyst: I'm trying to understand the inventory levels and the issues that you had with the co-packaging. It seems like if you're having trouble with the co-packaging that you would have just shipped out as much inventory as you had and that inventory level should go down. I'm just -- if you can help me understand what's going on there?\nRob Sarlls: Yeah, sure. So, typically, our inventory builds going into, let's call it, the September-October timeframe, and we had challenges in labor throughout the fiscal year. Back in June, we had to institute a pretty meaningful hourly wage increase to attract new talent to work in the production facility. And then, we typically in past years needed to add on, again, as I said in my prepared remarks, anywhere from 15 to 50 folks to package final box products. So, we deliberately managed our inventory's lean going into the end of last fiscal year and it was the ramp up for the current fiscal year that was made difficult by the labor challenges. So, we would have probably had -- well, no, we definitely would have had higher inventory levels had we been able to recruit faster than we had anticipated. And the move to get the outsource of the final packaging, which had always been in our strategic plan, was accelerated to make sure that we met as much of the current holiday for '23 as we possibly could.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And then, I'm also trying to understand the packaging move. So, I know that it's been part of the plan, but was it delayed this quarter? Or did you have specific issues with the move this quarter?\nRob Sarlls: No. There was no scheduled move at the beginning of the current fiscal year. As the labor situation unfold at Durango, it became imperative that we find an immediate solution, because we could not get enough labor to do the very manual hand packing of individual chocolates into assorted boxes or dropping them into what we call these stand up totes. So, getting the co-packing into Utah the second week of October really ensured that we can meet the super majority of the demand, but not all of the demand that we possibly could. So, it was a very necessary, very immediately needed move. It happens to fit with the strategic plan, and it completely sets us up for the future where there's unlimited labor to access in Utah as we ramp up our business going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: And is that transition complete now?\nRob Sarlls: Yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Or is there -- are there any remaining issues that you need to address in order to finish up that transition?\nRob Sarlls: No. That transition was essentially completed while the bus was running at 100 miles an hour. The good news is some of the extra costs that we incurred in the quarter, we had a different charge from the co-packer was done with hourly rates of people, that is moving to per piece pricing as of 11 days ago. So, we're going to have much greater visibility and also accountability of our new co-packing partners be as efficient as they can be. And that will give us the benefit going forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And just two more if I might.\nRob Sarlls: Sure.\nUnidentified Analyst: You mentioned the capital spending. In the quarter, can you indicate what your capital spending needs are for this fiscal year and next if you have -- if you can?\nRob Sarlls: Yeah. Let me start and then I'll have Allen finish. So, the number we cited at $2.5 million, that was through November, so that's a nine-month number. And Allen, why don't you take it from there?\nAllen Arroyo: Yeah. No, we've essentially spent most of the CapEx for the fiscal year. We have some payments remaining, but essentially we're complete with that. We're currently planning our capital allocation strategy for fiscal '25, which, again, we had a strategic plan that we signaled earlier in the year that said, over the two years, it would be about $6 million to $6.5 million. So, we're currently evaluating that. Again our priority is to get into operating cash flow positive quickly, but we are monitoring that. But as far as this fiscal year, most of the spend has occurred.\nUnidentified Analyst: And when you said that over the two years the $6 million to $6.5 million, were you referring to fiscal '24 and '25 or '24 and '25?\nAllen Arroyo: No, '24 and '25 when we announced that earlier in the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And I'm sorry, just one more.\nRob Sarlls: Sure.\nUnidentified Analyst: The gross margin with the packaging now moved to Utah, is -- does that just get you back to what prior gross margins are, or should that result in, let's call it, nothing is permanent, but let's call it a permanent improvement in gross margins?\nRob Sarlls: That's a hard one to answer. Let me do the best I can and have Allen chime in. Clearly, we're looking to improve margins and doing everything we can to get there. This was really more of a function of ceilings and prevention to do what you can do in terms of meeting needs or expanding the opportunity of the business. So, there's always an \"added cost\" when you go outside versus inside. But the fact of the matter is that when you are either paying time and a half or double time to existing employees to shift away from manufacturing product to packing product and/or dealing with having to hire expensive temporary talent in Durango, the added cost becomes less of an issue rather than just actual availability to complete what you can complete. So, volume solves a lot, and margins get better with volume. We've been needing to ramp up volume for a couple of years, even preceding all of us that have joined in the last year-and-a-half or so. So, enabling to open up that volume capture without any limitation, that's going to provide more of this solve with respect to operating margins. And I think anything else -- Allen, anything to add?\nAllen Arroyo: No, I think that covers it. I think the outsourcing of the packaging itself doesn't improve it, but as Rob mentioned being able to increase throughput is what's going to bring the margin improvement overall.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Very good. Thank you. And I'll talk to you later. Thank you.\nRob Sarlls: Appreciate the questions, Jim. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Roger Lipton with LFSI. Your line is open.\nRoger Lipton: Yes, good morning, Rob and Allen.\nRob Sarlls: Good morning.\nRoger Lipton: It sounds like you're set up, I could say, finally. It hasn't been so long, it just seems that way if you own the stock. But you talked about being set up now to deliver against the new demand, omni-channel demand and so forth. In particular, what are the omni-channels that you expect to see this increased demand from?\nRob Sarlls: Great question. And just for everybody's benefit, realize that we have two primary businesses. One and the most important in our hearts is taking care of our franchisees and that is a super majority of our business as everybody knows. But we've had a long-standing multi-decade business of working with specialty retailers and also have a e-commerce opportunity that we've yet to fully hit the gas pedal on. And so, speaking backwards, e-commerce can be much better met and fulfilled when you have no ceiling on how much boxed chocolate you can make from a labor standpoint. So that will open up e-commerce at some point in the very near end future. With the specialty retailer, again, we've had multi-decade relationships. We've had a particularly excellent fulfillment with a couple of them despite the challenges we had that would like to see us do more volume. And then, Andrew Ford and his team have been actively courting other retail opportunities where we are now a more attractive option than some heritage brands that are in the marketplace. And we continue to pursue those and look forward to having further updates in future quarters.\nRoger Lipton: Okay. And you mentioned Steve Ells. Steve Ells, as I recall, was -- built Chipotle. Is there a relationship there?\nRob Sarlls: No, it's Steve Craig.\nRoger Lipton: Oh, Steve Craig. Okay. I'll use as Steve Craig. I could have sworn you said Steve Ells, but I could be wrong.\nRob Sarlls: No problem.\nRoger Lipton: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen. I still would love to come to Durango one of these days and -- or maybe Utah now to see the new package...\nAllen Arroyo: Yeah, come to Durango.\nRob Sarlls: Come to Durango.\nRoger Lipton: Well, that's okay, that's fine. It's easier to get to Salt Lake City than Durango, but whichever. Thank you very much. Talk to you soon.\nRob Sarlls: Great, Roger. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.\nAllen Arroyo: Thank you.\nRob Sarlls: Thanks, everyone, and thanks, Michelle.\nOperator: You're welcome."

And now I will turn the call over to the company's CEO, Rob Sarlls. Rob, please go ahead.\nRob Sarlls: Thank you and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we continued to remove impediments to the growth of the business through the execution of the 3 pillars of our Strategic Transformation Plan, do more with less simplify and focus our operations and amplify and elevate the Rocky Mountain Chocolate brand. These initiatives are expected to generate material revenue growth in the quarters ahead as we enter the holiday season. Specifically, the improvements we have made to our e-commerce business and the strong demand for products during the holidays are expected to lead to outsized results in the back half of our fiscal year. In fact, we expect the combination of e-commerce and Specialty Retail Sales. In our fiscal second half to exceed the sales from these channels for all of fiscal 2023. To begin with, I'd like to highlight the progress we've made towards the implementation of our long-term strategy. First, to do more with less. During the quarter, we reduced our driver fleet by 33%, while maintaining consistent and ever-increasing pound volume shipped from our Durango facility. This is a direct result of our logistics optimization efforts which include increasing the use of third-party logistics partners to deliver products. We believe there is additional leverage to be realized in our existing operations. And we recently announced that supply chain industry veteran, Scott Ouellet has been appointed as Senior Vice President of Manufacturing and Supply Chain to help further this objective. Since joining as an adviser last October, Scott's strong background in the confectionery industry has made him an invaluable asset to our leadership team. And I look forward to continuing to work with him as we execute our plan. During the quarter, we increased our employee compensation structure at the Durango production facility to reduce turnover and help establish a long-term foundation for more efficient and ultimately higher throughput. This has helped us to manage attrition and enabled us to attract former Rocky Mountain Chocolate employees to return to the company which provides a quicker ramp for productivity compared to new hires. Despite the increase in base pay for our processing team, we experienced a 16% reduction in labor salaries per pound produced compared to our fiscal first quarter. Second, to simplify and focus the operations, we completed the implementation of our streamlined franchisee Royalty Structure and Volume Discount Program. Which we recently showcased some of our highest performing franchisees during our 2023 Annual National Franchisee Convention in September. In addition to providing a royalty rate of as low as 4%, our franchisees, especially those with multiple units are now eligible to receive a volume-based discount of up to 5% of all purchases of products and supplies from Durango. We believe this empowers our top franchisees to deliver even more sales of Rocky Mountain Chocolate products, while also incentivizing franchisees to become multiunit operators. We're making continued progress towards our 25% SKU reduction target as we work to sunset underperforming SKUs and increase production of our most popular items. In time, we anticipate the alignment of product offerings with consumer preference will result in higher sales, cost savings through reduced waste and lower storage expenses as well as an improved experience for our customers and better store economics for our franchisees. Third, to Amplify and Elevate, we unveiled a transformational brand refresh during our 2023 Annual National Franchisee Convention which was our highest attended convention in the history of the company, a real reflection of our reenergized franchisee network. Our brand refresh provides a streamlined trade name and logo, building upon our rich history of bringing the Rocky Mountain Chocolate experience to customers for over 40 years. As I mentioned earlier, we made significant improvements to our e-commerce experience, including the removal of shipping fees at checkout. This has resulted in a more transparent online shopping experience leading to higher volumes. Since activating this benefit, we have experienced a tripling of transaction volume and a more than doubling of sales compared to the same couple of months last year. In addition to the shipping fee removal, we have increased our coverage for 2-day delivery service with shipments commencing from third-party facilities in California to serve our customers throughout the Western region. By adding California, we can now reach over 90% of the U.S. population within 2 days, something we could not do cheaply or easily from Durango. These enhancements were made possible by the recently completed rollout of our partnership with a nationally renowned cold chain logistics company. We expect these initiatives will support our return to growth as we enter the all-important holiday season. To further Amplify and Elevate, we participated in our first investor conference in nearly a decade this past quarter, inaugurating our reengagement with the investment community under the new leadership team. Our active participation in these events not only serve to reaffirm our commitment to proactive engagement with shareholders and prospective investors but also amplifies the reach of our message about the plans for the future of Rocky Mountain Chocolate. The improvements we're making today are foundational to our 3-year to 5-year transformation plan. Our strategy implementation is yielding strong operational improvements and we can continue to expect these initiatives to result in short and long-term financial benefits. In Other news, I'd like to highlight a few additional developments from company-owned stores, our Durango production facility and network and logistics. We increased sales by 7% year-over-year at our Durango retail store for the quarter, driven by higher average revenue per customer transaction. We celebrated the grand reopening of our Corpus Christi location in July which is now a company-owned store. This store exemplifies how our Rocky Mountain Chocolate store should be run, clean and well lit, fully stocked with fresh product, ample sampling and a passionate caring staff attending to our local customers. I was privileged to work with the team at that grand reopening. With the new management, sales for August were up 48% versus the prior year and has since remained well above 20%. Corpus Christi is a classic example of the impact store transformations can have on our underperforming locations and of the potential of generating substantial incremental sales from within our existing franchise network. We expect to see this trend continue, as we roll out updates of our storefronts nationwide as part of our brand refresh. Excluding the planned exit of 2 wholesale customers during our prior fiscal year, second quarter sales from our Durango facility increased modestly, despite headwinds from record high temperatures over the summer which impacted consumer demand for chocolate and confectionery products. Likewise, the same-store is pound shipped across the domestic franchise and licensed locations. We're also approximately unchanged compared to the prior year. And lastly, this fall, we partnered with a respected third-party co-packers to fulfill all our final consumer packaging needs, where final assembly of our box items will now take place. Labor has been a continuing challenge in Durango and we accelerated this planned move to handle not only this year's base holiday volumes but also to remove any labor constraints as our future Durango production volumes increase. This is crucial to the fulfillment of our strategic plan and necessary to handle higher volumes in the second half of this fiscal year and beyond. To summarize, we are working hard to implement our strategic transformation plan and our efforts are bearing fruit. We continue to position Rocky Mountain Chocolate for long-term growth and profitability and we're building a strong foundation to execute our plan as we progress through the remainder of this fiscal year. I will now hand it over to our CFO, Allen Arroyo to discuss our fiscal second quarter financial highlights before returning for closing remarks. Allen?\nAllen Arroyo: Thank you, Rob. Please note that all financial results discussed today are for continuing operations. While all variance commentary is on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated. Now, moving on to our results. Total revenue of $6.6 million was unchanged from the $6.6 million in the prior year. We benefited from the reopening of the Corpus Christi store in July which mostly offset lower shipments of products related to the planned exit of two out-of-network customers earlier this year. Looking further at our sales. Total product sales were $4.7 million compared to $4.8 million. Royalty and marketing revenue increased to $1.5 million compared to $1.4 million. Retail sales at our company-operated stores increased 17% to $309,000 compared to $263,000. This increase was partially due to a store closure in the prior year and the reopening of the Corpus Christi store. Same-store sales for our company-owned store in Durango were up 7% year-over-year. Same-store sales at all domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate locations increased 2.3% during the quarter compared to the prior year. And franchise fee revenue was $41,000 compared to $45,000. Moving on, total product and retail gross profit was $0.4 million compared to $1.2 million with a gross profit margin of 7.6% compared to 23.3%. The decrease was primarily due to lower production volume and higher costs related to wages and inflation as we resolved a labor shortage. This was partially offset by higher retail gross margins primarily attributable to cost, better cost management following the creation of the flagship operations manager role in our Durango store. Total operating expenses were $7.6 million compared to $9 million. The improvement was primarily due to lower professional fees associated with the contested solicitation of proxies in the prior year, as well as lower costs related to employee severance and relocations. This was partially offset by increased franchise and personnel costs. Net loss from continuing operations improved 68% to $1 million or $0.16 per share compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $3.2 million or $0.51 per share. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $600,000 compared to adjusted EBITDA of $700,000. The year-ago period benefited from a $2.8 million add-back related to professional fees associated with the contested solicitation of proxies as well as costs associated with employee severance and relocation. Turning to our balance sheet; we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $4 million compared to $4.7 million at the end of fiscal 2023. The decrease in our cash position was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by inventory reductions. We ended the second quarter with total inventories of $3.2 million compared to $3.6 million at year-end fiscal 2023. And as of August 31, 2023, the company remains debt free. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rob for closing remarks.\nRob Sarlls: Thanks, Allen. We remain laser-focused on executing our strategic transformation plan in an orderly and methodical sequence, designed to create sustainable value for all of our stakeholders over the long run. While some short-term pain was necessary to solidify the foundation for the future of our business, we are confident in our plan and believe we have laid solid groundwork to build a great company into the future. We look forward to providing updates as we continue on our journey and fortify Rocky Mountain Chocolate's position as America's premier chocolate ear. This concludes our prepared remarks. We will be glad to answer any questions now. Operator, back to you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Roger Lipton from Lipton Financial Services.\nRoger Lipton: Good, just a couple of quick questions. The refresh that helped Corpus Christi so much, what did you spend? And what are you asking our franchisees to spend in terms of -- you're encouraging them to refresh their stores?\nRob Sarlls: Yes. Thanks, Roger, for the question. That's really -- it's a 2-part question. Corpus Christi still has the \"old look\" although it's a relatively newer-looking store than most of our network. What we refresh there is how that run a good store and simply running it correctly with everything that I just went through. And you know from your experience, a well-run store with a great store experience which is what we deliver and offer and seek to do consistently across the network. That's where we're going. So we didn't have to spend a whole lot in Corpus. I mean it was maybe less than $20,000. As to the store refresh, you're talking about. That is a bigger deal. That will happen with our network over the next 12 to 24 months. We're in the process of engaging the firm that's going to help us with that right now and we're going to start with our Durango and Corpus Christi stores. And then spread it out sooner thereafter. And that's going to be a meaningful lift for our franchisees. It will be high 5 figures to low 6 figures.\nRoger Lipton: And what, there are a lot of moving parts here, obviously, in terms of, across your operations. The factors that so substantially affected your shipments in the most recent quarter, to what extent do you think over the next 6 months which is a large part of your year, those factors can be alleviated?\nRob Sarlls: Well, a lot of that groundwork was laid in, in the last 2 quarters, primarily with things that are logistical barriers to greater success. So I want to remind all of our shareholders, we used to send trucks from Durango to every single store. We just sent a truck from Durango every single co-brand store. All of those things have now been changed where the super majority of our full chocolate shops and nearly all of our non-full chocolate shops are having the final miles of delivery of product done to them by somebody not us. And that's part of the simplify and focus effort of our pillars which is we ran a full trucking company out of Durango and that's not our core expertise. And so if there's benefits to having that in terms of management focus and ultimately benefits to the franchisees in getting product fresher and done more quickly overall. In terms of E-com, there were fundamental limits to how many packages could leave Durango in a single day. And as I noted in my remarks, Gift2day [ph] was prohibitive or impossible from Durango. All those barriers are now gone. So our E-com can benefit from this. Our delivery to stores now and there's other enhancements coming down the line to make it easier for stores to buy more pounds. So we're looking to realign even the structure of how they order. All of those things are enabling them to ramp up and sell more.\nRoger Lipton: Okay. But e-commerce, you talked about the combination of e-commerce and specialty retail sales, obviously a lot higher in the second half. How much is that of your total revenue base?\nRob Sarlls: Well, if you look at fiscal year '23, what we called omnichannel in the 10-K was about 12%, 13% of total sales. And so we're looking for that number, the nominal number to be significantly higher in fiscal '24 and the super majority of that, of course, all hits in the back 6 months.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Peter Sidoti with Siodti & Company.\nPeter Sidoti: Two quick questions. One Allen, can you speak to, so your cash on hand, your cash burn and any need for future financing at this point?\nAllen Arroyo: So we started the year in good, great cash position. We have made significant investments in equipment, as we've mentioned and obviously, the first 6 months has not been cash accumulative. However, we believe with the cash on hand and with the cash coming in, in the last 6 months of the year, we still feel strongly about our cash position. We did recently renew our line of credit with Wells Fargo. And so we do have a revolver that we could tap into temporarily if we had to. So again, there's no again, there's no forecasted needs for long-term financing. However, if there is some necessity, we could go into the line of credit. But we feel very confident about our cash balance. Again, with a strong position we came in the year and with the back half of the year, the cash we're going to generate we should end the year in great shape.\nRob Sarlls: Also, our equipment is unencumbered and there's a possibility we'll look to put on some equipped financing. We're exploring that right now.\nAllen Arroyo: That is correct.\nPeter Sidoti: Rob, you came on board, you had [indiscernible] to get done. Can you give me a sense how far along you feel you're in the process? Are you in the first inning, the third inning, the fifth inning? How do you feel about it in terms of where you are at this point?\nRob Sarlls: Well, it's funny, Peter. The winning scorecard changes once you're in and that's true with all situations. Like this. I don't know, I'm feeling sort of late second to mid-three [ph], in terms of the total transformation. I think we've done a lot of the gruntwork, still more to go. I mean, really, the brand refresh is a huge thing for our network and a huge thing to present ourselves to consumers that have not encountered Rocky Mountain Chocolate before. We're insanely excited about the store refresh and with the new brand and new packaging come on, that gives us a lot of opportunity in specialty retail that we're bringing something to a buyer that's going to be really exciting. So we get to really hit the afterburners really come next year.\nPeter Sidoti: Okay. Well, you must be doing something right to have Roger Lipton on the call. So, thank you very much.\nOperator: And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.\nRob Sarlls: Thank you, operator.\nAllen Arroyo: Thank you."

During the quarter, we continued to lay the foundation of our strategic transformation plan and begun to develop critical groundwork for the future of the business. I'd like to spend time reviewing the three pillars of our strategic plan and highlighting the initial progress we have made to do more with less, simplify and focus our operations and amplify and elevate the Rocky Mountain Chocolate brand.  First, on doing more with less, major progress has been achieved on multiple fronts. At the end of our first fiscal quarter, we have successfully identified and executed on over $7 million in annualized cost savings or more than 60% of the $1.2 million annualized cost savings target introduced last quarter, ahead of our original expectations in terms of both magnitude and timing. These savings stem from: first, mitigating certain store delivery logistics towards now utilizing third party cross docking to reduce trips and maximizing pound volume on our own trucks shipped from Durango; second, eliminating two off-site third party warehouses as we have become more efficient with inventory management and demand planning as reflected by a 46% reduction of inventory compared to the prior year; and finally, we significantly reduced waste and scrap due to better staff training and the elimination of underperforming SKUs.  Our second key pillar is to simplify and focus the operations. As we upgrade our infrastructure to better enable data driven decisions, bring high volume SKUs back to the forefront of our production schedules and reinforce our chocolate first approach. Our commitment to running a chocolate first operation is best reflected by our recent exit of the frozen yogurt business as it was not true to our core operation or brand. Further, to simplifying our focus and operations, we are midway through plan to reduce 25% of underperforming chocolate SKUs, increasing our ability to produce significantly higher volumes of our most popular items going forward. Reducing underperforming items has already led to cost savings on third party storage and changeovers, while generating more efficient throughput to meet the high demand of our top selling SKUs.  And our third pillar, amplify and elevate. We recently completed a full overhaul of our franchise offering and documentation, establishing for the first time an area development opportunity to better attract multi-unit operators and we've sped up the deployment of resources to increase sales and improve store level profitability and provided critical bandwidth to grow our omnichannel sales. We have simplified our royalty structure and added incentives to increase the selling of Durango sourced product. A new royalty structure is now in line with other franchisor market offerings, but also has the added benefit of reaching a low 4% rate on store gross sales for those operators who sell Durango sourced product in excess of our new higher target. This should have the win-win benefit of both improving store level economics, while boosting sales from Durango, and provide strong incentive for more store openings, both from new operators, as well as our existing franchisees that are looking to expand their portfolios.  With the close of the sale of the frozen yogurt business, we allocated two senior franchise operator executives whose full time efforts are to generate additional sales and improve store level profitability, as well as encourage network wide Rocky Mountain Chocolate brand consistency across our entire franchise network. Only two months into their newly created roles. Momentum is underway on helping franchisees maximize their selling opportunities. We're shifting store staff towards selling as opposed to making in-store product. We are also focusing the network on selling our most popular and delicious items, ensuring case planograms are optimized and removing non-conforming and low volume products from the stores. All of which are designed to ensure our customers have the same delightful experience whenever and wherever they enjoy a premium Rocky Mountain Chocolate product.  We're excited about our omnichannel experience. We have begun to implement a new revenue enhancing logistics partnership with a nationally renowned cold chain logistics company to provide efficient nationwide two day delivery for online customer purchases, something we simply could not offer with Durango as a shipping origin. In addition to faster delivery, online customers will begin to experience significantly reduced shipping costs. The rollout of this partnership will continue over the next 12 weeks with an anticipated increase in sales volumes for both online customers and other key omnichannel customers. We expect to see increased sales from this initiative for the upcoming holiday season, and this is to diminish the cart abandonment that had occurred in the past.  With respect to our image transformation, our sales and marketing team is working closely with Crown Creative, our new branding agency, on elevating and upgrading our brand and trade dress and refreshing our identity. We will share more with you in the near term as this exciting evolution of our proud heritage and beloved Rocky Mountain Chocolate experience continues. Improvements we're making at the Durango production facility are all geared to drive improvements for our franchise network, which will take some time to see the downstream effect. However, the best example of the more immediate impact of all the changes we have been in our making are the results of our flagship store in Durango, our only company owned store at this time.  Fiscal first quarter revenue to Durango store was up 16% year-over-year, with June revenues coming in over 27% and customer count of 9%. Average transaction size, an important key performance indicator, was up 15% during the quarter as customers walked away with more of our delicious product in their basket after each visit. These metrics are early indicators that our efforts to improve the store are taking hold and Durango is on its way to becoming another $1 million plus revenue store.  As I mentioned, the downstream effect of our transformation plan for our franchise network will take time, but we are seeing improvements for the second quarter. Monthly pounds shipped increase in June on a year-over-year basis for the first time since November 2022, rising roughly 6%. Network same store sales were also up mid-single digits for the month of June as well. Since many of our improvements were implemented across the quarter, seeing these good results in June tell us that our plan is working.  Store activity is also robust. We opened two new stores in the first quarter and transferred three existing stores to new owners. Our transferred store owners are excited and with that excitement comes motivation that can significantly improve lackluster performance. To summarize, we continue to concentrate our efforts on laying the groundwork and implementing the initial phase of our transformation strategy. We made significant progress across all three strategic pillars and we're pleased with our progress. We are well on our way in positioning Rocky Mountain Chocolate to gain market share in what is a highly fragmented U.S. chocolate confectionery market.  Our strategic transformation plan is designed to do just that. We remain focused on laying the foundation of our multiyear plan and expect to continue seeing tangible results as we progress through the periods ahead.  I will now hand it over to our CFO, Allen Arroyo to discuss our fiscal first quarter financial highlights before returning for closing remarks. Allen?\nAllen Arroyo: Yes. Thank you, Rob. Please note that all financial results discussed today are for continuing operations, while all variants commentary is year-over-year -- on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise stated.  Now moving on to our results. Total revenue in the first quarter was $6.4 million compared to $6.9 million. The decrease was primarily due to $0.3 million of lower shipment of products related to the planned exit of customers. To further break this down, total Durango production facility sales were $4.8 million compared to $5.2 million. Royalty and marketing revenue remain roughly flat at $1.4 million. Retail store sales at our company operated stores were $192,000 compared to $250,000. We had one less unit this year. Same store sales at all domestic Rocky Mountain Chocolate Factory locations decreased 2.7%. And franchise fee revenue was $45,000 compared to $54,000. Total Durango production and retail gross profit was $0.3 million compared to $0.9 million, with gross margin of 5.1% compared to 16.3%. The decrease was primarily due to lower production volume resulting from our strategy to produce finished goods closer to final consumption, the reduction of non-core SKUs and higher costs related to new key production positions. This was partially offset by cost savings we realized from lower transportation expenses, reduced waste and scrap and lower warehousing expense.  Total operating expenses were $7.9 million, compared to $7.2 million. The increase was primarily due to increased staffing costs driven by new mid-level and senior leadership, including our CEO and our Senior Supply Advisor, working with our teams to drive previously noted operational improvements. Increased franchise support costs related to an increased network store visits, new store openings and transfers and annual convention costs that were previously biannual.  Net loss from continuing operations was $1.5 million or negative $0.24 per share, compared to net loss from continuing operations of $0.3 million or negative $0.5 per share. Adjusted EBITDA loss was $800,000 compared to an adjusted EBITDA of $700,000 with a decrease primarily driven by lower revenue related to the planned exit of certain customers, as well as the aforementioned drivers of gross profit and OpEx.  Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flows, we ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $5.1 million compared to $4.7 million at the end of fiscal 2023. As of May 31, 2023, the company remained debt free. We also generated $0.4 million in cash during the quarter. The cash increase was primarily driven as a result of the $1.4 million in proceeds from the sale of U-Swirl and a positive working capital change. These were partially offset by net loss and CapEx spend of $0.5 million. The working capital change was mostly a result of the reduction in inventories to $2.7 million from $3.6 million at year end.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Rob for closing remarks. \nRob Sarlls: Thanks, Allen. We are committed to our strategic transformation plan and look forward to providing updates in the quarters ahead as we work to position Rocky Mountain Chocolate not only as America's preferred premium chocolate tier, but as a business generating sustainable growth and profitability.  This concludes our prepared remarks. We would now open it up for questions. Operator, back to you. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from the line of Roger Lipton from Lipton Financial Services. Your line is open. \nRoger Lipton: Yes. Good afternoon. [Technical Difficulty]\nRob Sarlls: Roger, we are having a tough time hearing you. \nRoger Lipton: [Technical Difficulty]\nRob Sarlls: Operator, we're having a difficult time hearing Mr. Lipton. Can you hear him on your end or should he be dialing back in? \nOperator: Roger, if you have your line on speaker, please take it off speaker. Roger, if your line is on speaker please take it off speaker. You might have to dial back in. \nRob Sarlls: Hopefully, he's dialed back in. Next question. \nOperator: Roger, please dial back in. \nRoger Lipton: Hello. I'm sorry. Are you there?\nOperator: There you go. Much better. \nRob Sarlls: Yeah. We can hear you perfectly clear now. \nRoger Lipton: I'm sorry. Did you hear the question?\nRob Sarlls: No, we did not. Sorry, Roger. \nRoger Lipton: Yes. I'm sorry too. The question was, the $700,000 of savings that you've already implemented. My assumption is that not too much of that flowed through in the quarter, that that's sort of the rate that's in place as the quarter ended. Is that correct?\nRob Sarlls: Yes. So everything in the $700,000 was realized and partially recognized in at least the last month of first quarter, which means, they all start flowing in the second quarter. \nRoger Lipton: Right. Okay. And just another question which occurs to me since you mentioned, the flagship store is now -- that looks like another $1 million store. I'm curious to know how many stores in the system do over a $1 million?\nRob Sarlls: Well, sure. Actually, our top 37 stores average over $1 million and we have some phenomenal outperformance dragging that up. But I would say that our store count in the $1 million plus range at current rates is somewhere in the high teens to low 20s. \nRoger Lipton: Okay. And then you mentioned, of course, the lower volume because of the so called planned exit of a couple. I mean, could you elaborate a little bit on what that was all about? The planned exit from a couple of customers.\nRob Sarlls: Yes. We had an e-commerce and whole selling relationship that we had exited in the last fiscal year. So we weren't expecting recurring volume. And the biggest impact of that happens to have been in the first quarter, there will be no additional impact on results going forward. \nRoger Lipton: Okay. And then you made reference to the higher G&A because of the new staffing, is that pretty much in place at this point? Will -- another way to put it, will the G&A build further from the rates shown in the first quarter, or is that kind of the going forward rate of supporting G&A?\nRob Sarlls: No, it's a good question. So the staffing that was coming on started with me in May, Allen in August, and then we brought on Scott, our Supply Chain Advisor in September. So as the numbers roll forward in the subsequent quarters, those comparisons will start evening out more. \nRoger Lipton: Okay. And lastly, for the moment anyway, the lower inventory is obviously encouraging. Can you keep it down that way for the rest of the year? Or how do you expect the inventory to proceed through the balance of the February year? \nRob Sarlls: Sure. Well, Roger, in our business, if we're not building inventory now, we have to build for the holiday. So the [indiscernible] really being turned on as we speak. So that will come up. Suffice it to say, it'll be less on a year on year basis, all things being equal. We will be doing some pre-positioning of inventory with our third party logistics partner, and that's again to make sure that the product can get the consumers within 48 hours. But you can expect with this team tighter inventory management going forward, all things being equal. \nRoger Lipton: Okay. That's interesting. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. \nRob Sarlls: I appreciate the call, Roger. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. That will conclude our Q&A for today. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect your phone lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation.\nRob Sarlls: Thank you, operator. Thanks, everyone. Bye-bye."
