At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call over to Ian Cooney, Senior Director of Investor Relations at 23andMe to lead off the call. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nIan Cooney: Thank you, Valerie. Before we begin, I encourage everyone to go to investors.23andme.com to find the press release we issued earlier today reporting our financial results for the third quarter. A replay of today's webcast will also be available on our website. Please note that certain statements made during this call regarding matters that are not historical facts, including, but not limited to, management's outlook or predictions for future periods are forward-looking statements. These statements are based solely on information that is now available to us. We encourage you to review the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in our press release, which applies to this call. Also, please refer to our SEC filings, which can be found on our website and the SEC's website for a discussion of numerous factors that may impact our future performance. We also discuss certain non-GAAP measures, important information on our use of these measures and reconciliation to U.S. GAAP may be found in our earnings release. Joining us on our call today are Anne Wojcicki, our Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder; and Joe Selsavage, our Interim Chief Financial and Accounting Officer; Jennifer Low, our Head of Therapeutics Development; and Bill Richards, Head of Therapeutics Discovery; will join us for Q&A. I'd now like to turn the call over to Anne.\nAnne Wojcicki: Thank you, Ian. The third quarter was busy and productive at 23andMe. We made meaningful strategic progress across our three businesses. We introduced our first integrated care offering with Total Health, signed a non-exclusive research agreement with GSK and filed our second IND in Therapeutics. I am extremely proud of the effort put forth by our team as we work towards creating a new future of healthcare powered by genetics. Starting with our Consumer business. The third quarter saw the company execute on our strategic shift towards actively engaging with our customers on managing their health based on their unique genetics and lifestyle. In November, we introduced a new membership called Total Health, a personalized preventative care service. It includes clinical grade exome sequencing, biannual blood testing and access to clinicians from our Lemonaid acquisition with unique training in genetics. Members of Total Health received all the reports and features offered in our existing 23andMe+ membership along with personalized guidance for ongoing disease prevention and early detection. This is an exciting step in our vision to bring accessible genetics-driven preventative care to millions of our U.S. customers. In addition to the introduction of Total Health, added more value to the 23andMe+ membership with the introduction of 23andMe Health Action Plan and 23andMe HealthTracks. These personalized action plans are part of our broader effort to help our customers take action based on their genetic insights and other data. Over time, we will continue to add more dynamic recommendation content and intuitive ways to track phenotypic inputs with the ultimate goal of helping customers improve their health span. 23andMe HealthTracks is a digital health tool that helps customers gain a more holistic picture of the risk for developing a particular condition by integrating lifestyle and genetic factors into a single model for the first time with the goal of motivating behavior change. Health Action Plan helps customers take the next step to improve their health by drawing on genetics, health history and blood and biomarker data to provide tailored bite-sized health recommendations. We will continue to innovate in this area to create a dynamic, meaningful experience to help our customers optimize their health. We also continue to refine and improve our genetic reports and insights. Our updated BRCA test allows us to report 44 additional variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes known to be associated with higher risk for breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancer. Many of these additional variants occur more often in populations that have traditionally been underserved by genetic testing, including the African-American and Hispanic-Latino communities. As part of our August FDA clearance, we were granted the first-ever FDA predetermined change control plan, allowing us to continue to update our BRCA report with additional validated variants without additional pre-market review. As we continue to invest in our personal genomics service business, we also focus on creating value for our customers through the uptake of membership services. We see repeated engagement by our customers, and they have shown interest in learning more about their genetics and how to apply those learnings for their lives. We are focused on moving to a membership model so that we can meet customer demand for more services as well as develop a recurring revenue stream that will allow us to continue to innovate and grow the business in a way that is most helpful to our customers and shareholders. We continue to prioritize price and efficient marketing spend as we look to move our PGS segment toward cash flow breakeven. We recognize this effort is likely to cause some uneven results in our business in the short-term, and we saw some of that effect in Q3. PGS kit volumes were impacted in the quarter as we entered the holiday promotional period with firmer pricing discipline after raising prices for the first time since 2015. This, plus an environment of macroeconomic and consumer uncertainty led to lower PGS kit sales volume. We remain confident in our ability to transform our PGS segment into a sustainably growing and profitable business and we are incredibly excited to help build toward a future of personalized preventative health. Transitioning over to therapeutics. We continue to advance our pipeline of clinical and preclinical programs. In November, we presented positive safety and preliminary efficacy data from a Phase I/IIa clinical trial of our wholly owned immuno-oncology program, 23ME-00610 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer Annual Meeting. The study demonstrated that 23ME-00610 is well tolerated and shows promising preliminary efficacy in a number of patients with advanced solid malignancies. In December, we announced the further expansion of the ongoing Phase I/IIa study to include an additional 30 patients with advanced neuroendocrine and ovarian cancers, above the original enrollment goals. We are encouraged by the progress of 610 and anticipate reporting further data later this year. The company recently announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has cleared the IND application for 23ME-01473, a natural killer cell activator intended to treat cancer. 23andMe plans to evaluate 1473 in participants with advanced solid tumors in a Phase I clinical study beginning in the first half of 2024. 1473 targets ULBP6 to restore anti-tumor immunity through NK and T cells. ULBPs are stress-induced ligands found on the surface of cancer cells that bind to the receptor NKG2D on NK and T cells. Cancers escape immune cell recognition by shedding ULBP ligands from their cell- surface, which acts as immunosuppressive molecular decoys. Blocking the binding of soluble ULBP6 to NKG2D may restore immune cell recognition and killing of cancers. Further, 1473 is Fc-effector enhanced which provides an additional mechanism for NK cells to induce cell death of ULBP6-expressing cancer cells. 1473 also has the potential to address a major unmet need in cancer treatment. Patients who may have or may develop tumor resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. By combining NK and T cell activation, 1473 may initiate a broader and deeper response of the immune system to treat cancer cells and delay tumor resistance seen in treatment with traditional checkpoint inhibitors. This program validates the power of the 23andMe database for identifying novel therapeutic targets and highlights the team's ability to develop molecules and advance them into the clinic. I also want to highlight that we launched our new therapeutics website at the end of December. We think the new site does a great job explaining how our team turns genetic insights into potential new therapies with a higher probability of success in the clinic and provides a great initial diligence resource for potential partners, collaborators and investors. I encourage everyone to visit the new site at therapeutics.23andme.com. Moving to the research business. In Q3, extended our collaboration with GSK into the sixth year. The new one-year non-exclusive data license pays 23andMe $20 million upfront in exchange for GSK using the 23andMe database to conduct drug target discovery and other research. Importantly, this new collaboration is a sign of the significant value in the 23andMe database and the potential for continuous new insights and discoveries as we grow in size. The new collaboration is important for 23andMe as it generates $20 million and enables us to continue to collaborate with GSK, but in a non-exclusive way. We are actively pursuing new partnerships with other therapeutic companies. The excitement around AI and data opens up a tremendous opportunity for 23andMe as companies are establishing their data strategies. Genetics is fundamental to the world of AI-driven drug discovery. We look forward to updating you as discussions progress. As I look to 2024, I'm excited about the opportunities for 23andMe. There is a growing recognition about the potential for data and AI and drug discovery, and we have an incredible asset that can accelerate and improve drug discovery for the industry. For customers, we are getting closer to our ultimate vision of having a complete solution for people who want to actively engage in their wellness and prevent disease. We look forward to an exciting year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Joe to review our financial results for the quarter.\nJoseph Selsavage: Thank you, Anne, and hello, everyone. I'd like to reiterate Anne's excitement about the future of Precision Healthcare 23andMe, and I'm proud of our ability to execute while maintaining cost discipline amid our shift towards a more sustainable operating profile. Revenue for the quarter was $45 million, representing a 33% decrease on another strong prior year comparable. Similar to last quarter, the year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily due to the conclusion of our exclusive discovery term under the GSK collaboration in July as well as lower consumer services revenue in our PGS Kit and telehealth businesses. The decrease in consumer revenue was driven primarily by lower sales volume as we entered the holiday promotional period with higher pricing than prior years. These efforts were intended to increase product margin to improved average selling prices and advertising efficiency, which remain a core focus of the company, but resulted in lower-than-expected unit sales for the quarter as we believe the combination of higher prices and extended macro headwinds placed the temporary damper on demand for our products. These decreases were partially offset by non-recurring payments from other research partners in the current quarter and continued growth in our subscription services. Looking at the composition of our revenue, consumer services revenue represented approximately 96% of total revenue for the quarter. And research services revenue, which was primarily derived from other research partners accounted for approximately 4% of total revenue for the same period. As a reminder, the new GSK data license announced in Q3 is expected to have minimal impact on this year's results with the majority landing in fiscal year 2025, given the terms of the agreement. Our gross profit for the third quarter was $20 million, representing a 35% decrease over the same period in the prior year. The decrease in Q3 gross profit was driven primarily by the decrease in research services revenue, while subscription revenue and improved telehealth margins following the August 2023 disposition of Lemonaid Health Limited in the UK helped to offset through continued margin accretion within their respective categories. Turning to our expenses. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $301 million compared to $128 million for the same period in the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to a $199 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge taking over the quarter, which was partially offset by lower personnel-related expenses following workforce reductions in prior quarters and the disposition of the UK entity. A non-cash impairment charge for intangible assets in the prior period and lower therapeutics-related R&D spend due to significant IND-enabling activities also in the prior year. Looking at the bottom line, net loss for the quarter was $278 million compared to $92 million in the prior quarter. The increase in the third quarter net loss was driven mainly by the lower revenues and goodwill impairment charge mentioned previously. Next, our adjusted EBITDA. For details on how we define adjusted EBITDA as well as the corresponding reconciliations to GAAP, please see our earnings press release. Total adjusted EBITDA deficit for the third quarter was $48 million compared to a $43 million deficit for the same period in the prior year. The increase in the adjusted EBITDA deficit was primarily due to lower revenue, partially offset by lower personnel costs and lower R&D spend described previously. We ended the quarter with $242 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $387 million as of March 31, 2023. We intend to be judicious with our cash usage and believe the current level of cash supports 23andMe's plans for targeted investment and high ROI growth initiatives. Now turning to our guidance. As a reminder, the company's full-year fiscal 2024 guidance is based on the conservative approach, recognizing challenges in recent performance, continuing uncertainties in consumer sentiment, the macroeconomic environment and geopolitical conditions. The company is adjusting its full-year guidance for fiscal year 2024, which ends on March 31, 2024. For revenue, we are updating our fiscal year 2024 guidance to be in the range of $215 million to $220 million, with net loss adjusted to be in the range of $520 million net loss to $525 million net loss. Full-year adjusted EBITDA deficit is adjusted to be in the range of $180 million deficit to $185 million deficit for fiscal year 2024. Our focus within the existing lines of the PGS and telehealth consumer businesses remain unchanged. We continue to prioritize margin expansion and progress towards cash flow profitability. These efforts include remaining disciplined with our pricing strategy to realize higher average selling prices, ongoing value additions to our current services like the Health Action Plan and HealthTracks features within 23andMe+, expanding the recently introduced Total Health membership to a broader audience and streamlining the expense profiles of our Consumer and Therapeutics segment. Within the therapeutics and research businesses, we are investing only in projects we believe are most strategically and financially valuable and continue to explore potential partnerships and collaborations. Wrapping up, we are pleased with the company's strategic progress and improved operating discipline. Given the current operating environment, we are being prudent in our planning and project prioritization, while remaining incredibly optimistic about the future of the company and our ability to help people access, understand and benefit from the human genome. With that, let's open it up to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question that we have today will be coming from Steve Mah of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nSteven Mah: Oh, great. Can you guys hear me? Hello?\nAnne Wojcicki: Yes.\nSteven Mah: Oh, hi. Yes. Okay, great. Yes, sorry. Apologies for the background noise. Could you comment on the recent – Anne – this question is for Anne. A no kind of came across the wire. Could you comment on your recent interview you gave on the consideration of splitting the consumer and therapeutics business? How would that look? Would it be a spin out of the therapeutics business into a private company with external financing or some other structure? How should we think about that?\nAnne Wojcicki: Yes. So you've said this before, that we are definitely pursuing and exploring all different options for being able to fund progress going forward on the therapeutic side. So as you know, discovering and developing drugs is expensive. So if you look at where we are with a Phase II program with P006 and just initiating P014 into the clinic as well as a very robust pipeline behind it, that's going to require capital. So we have not made any definitive decisions about what we are going to do, but there is definitely opportunities and things that we are exploring with potentially having therapeutics be independent versus consumer. These are all just ideas that we are exploring right now. There's nothing definitive. But it is opportunities that we're considering about what's going to be the best way to make consumers successful in the therapeutics group.\nSteven Mah: Okay. Thanks. Yes, appreciate the color. And with regards to 1473, are you still on track to initiate Phase I clinical trials in the first half of this year?\nAnne Wojcicki: Yes, I have Jennifer Low here as well, if you want further questions. But yes, we are on track for that.\nSteven Mah: Okay. Got it. Okay. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks.\nAnne Wojcicki: Okay. Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from David Lebowitz of Citi. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys. John on for David. Thanks for taking our questions. Got a few on our end. So building off of that report in Bloomberg about the potential split between the Consumer business and the Therapeutics business. Just want to dive into that a little bit more if you guys don't mind. When thinking about potential implications as it relates to the different segments in your business, you have the consumer business, tech business and a biotech business, basically all in one. I guess, can you just again talk to the implications as it relates to maybe expanding your investor base and better teasing out the individual value of the components within your business?\nAnne Wojcicki: Sorry, do you want to repeat the – like the core part of the question?\nUnidentified Analyst: Sure. Just as it relates to a potential spin out, can you talk about the potential implications as it relates to expanding your investor base and potentially better teasing out the value of the individual components of your business?\nAnne Wojcicki: Yes. I mean, look, I think that you – again, you deal with – you interact with different investors all the time, and you recognize that people have very specific mandates. So there are some investors who are only looking at biotech and some investors that are only looking at consumer and others that are focused on AI. And you are absolutely right that we are an unusual company in that we have all of that. We have a very robust consumer business. We have a very robust research database business, and we have a very robust therapeutics business. So that has definitely been brought to our attention that there's a number of different businesses within this and what's the best way to make sure that we're maximizing value.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then one on the product launch. With respect to Total Health, can you just walk us through some of your key learnings from the soft launch over the holidays and how you plan to use that experience to inform your rollout going forward?\nAnne Wojcicki: Yes. Total Health – I think Total Health has an incredible potential. And where we look at that we be taking off is in the world of self-pay preventive care. I guess the market that I think does not – people want it and it doesn't really exist right now. So Total Health right now goes in the lineup, if you look on the website. It goes in the lineup with other tests. You have ancestry, you have health and ancestry, you have health and ancestry plus and you have Total Health. What we're really offering here is care, it’s an opportunity to engage with a clinical product that – or clinicians, healthcare providers that are looking all across your genome and really thinking thoughtfully about how can you leverage your genetic information, your blood information, your wearables, your lifestyle, your family history, your medical records, to think about a true preventive care plan. So it's a real – we've soft launched it really with knowing that there's going to be an early market of people who just want an exome, but the product is a very different type of experience. And I think that's more and more what you can imagine us doing with Total Health is being able to help people not just get access to this information, but to leverage it and integrate it into their life.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then one more, one last one just on your new drug candidate, 1473 targeting ULBP6. Can you just talk a little bit more about the target? Like how it was determined, if there are any other therapies going after ULBP6? And if there's any clinical data that you're aware of that has helped to validate or de-risk the target?\nAnne Wojcicki: Yes. Let me point you over to Jennifer Low.\nJennifer Low: Hi. The ULBP6 target was one of those that has been identified through our genetic database. It's the premise of how we've been discovering potential targets at 23andMe therapeutics, and this was right along that lane. And we're really interested in this because it highlights a different way of approaching immune cells to attack cancer. And there are a lot of different other modalities out there right now that are activating NK cells are trying to co-opt NK cells. We believe that our new drugs that we're bringing into the clinic addressable lot of shortcomings of other programs. And so we – this is a dual mechanism antibody that has monoclonal antibodies like half-life. It should be tolerated. It should really provide a novel way of activating NK cells and address an unmet need.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then just to the last part. I'm sorry if I missed that. Did you say if there's any clinical data that you're aware of that has helped to validate or de-risk it?\nJennifer Low: There are other programs that are also looking at the NK pathway, but we have a lot of reasons to believe that this is a better way of addressing the issues that have plagued certain other programs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Got it.\nJennifer Low: We are very aware of the competition. But we really think that this is a novel and better way of addressing NK cell activation.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. Thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And we have a follow-up from Steven Mah of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nSteven Mah: Yes. Hi. Great. Thanks for taking the additional question. Apologies again for the noise up back here. Maybe just digging in a little bit more on the Total Health launch. Maybe give us some color on how that's going, how you guys are measuring internally the success of that launch. And then yes, if there's any learnings that could be instructive to the launch into the existing customers, which I believe is slated for the spring.\nAnne Wojcicki: Yes. We're not giving much on Total Health. I think that more and more just – it's the first real integration with Lemonaid and being able to have on one system access to care, being able to order blood, being able to order medications at some point, being able all in one and all on the 23andMe brands. So I think that is one of the big milestones for us. I think what you can also anticipate in the future is more and more, how do we bring what we're learning from Total Health also to all of our existing customers. So the 14-plus million customers that we have, how is it that they can get a version of this type of care platform. So I think there's a lot that we've learned. Every time we have launched something new to customers, I think there's a fair amount that we can learn about what is it they want. How are they adopting with the right way to explain it to them. As I mentioned before, I think that this is a – it's a big shift for us to – from just being a test where people are getting information and learning about themselves to where they are now getting that information, but we are helping them apply it. I also would just point to things like HealthTracks, as a way that in Health Action Plan as ways that we are looking more and more to be able to give you your genetic information, your wearables, self-report data all into a score that helps you understand really where you are at on a risk curve for specific disease conditions. So I think more and more, you can see us integrating lots of different data sets to give you something that is truly personalized towards you. And I think you can see us emphasizing more and more subscriptions, which we call membership, membership products that help people get affordable preventive care.\nSteven Mah: Okay. That's helpful. And one more question. On the effort and the BD effort in terms of partnering…\nAnne Wojcicki: We lost…\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Ian for further questions.\nIan Cooney: Thank you. Steven jumps back on. I will now read the top shareholder questions from our Say Technologies Q&A platform. I'll probably go through five or six here. The first one, which is top of mind for shareholders is what is the plan to stay compliant with NASDAQ listing requirements?\nAnne Wojcicki: Yes. This is something that's obviously top of mind for us as well. We are actively monitoring markets, staying on top of it in discussions considering things like a reverse stock split, but also most importantly, just continuing to execute on the business and showing and confirming shareholder value.\nIan Cooney: Great. And sort of on that same shareholder value team, a big kind of the second most popular question was what are you doing to increase the value of the company? I know we've talked about some of that stuff on the call that maybe you can go ahead and reiterate.\nAnne Wojcicki: Yes. So three areas that I think are really key for people just to remember where we focus on value. So as I mentioned, on the consumer side, we really focus on expanding the offerings we can provide to customers. So it's been very much of people buy our product, and it is a one-time sale. And we think about lots of opportunities where we can engage people to come back. We can provide true value for them in the world of preventive care and we can also establish a truly viable membership business where our customers are returning value, and it is a solid and stable recurring business model for the company. So that is number one in consumer and that is very much where we are focused this fiscal year. On research, research is a fascinating area right now, particularly because of the incredible interest in the world of AI and companies that are looking at how to really change their approach to drug discovery, it can start in many different ways, but the foundation is genetics. Understanding human genetics, understanding how that translates to biology and how you can leverage genetic information to identify drug targets and be more efficient in the entire process. So we are very excited about the collaboration that we signed with – the partnership we signed with GSK, the opportunity to do more and for us to really be a leader in AI drug discovery. Last, in therapeutics. It has been a long journey and a very exciting journey, translating our data into novel therapeutics. And I'm very excited about 1473 and seeing the potential and the opportunities in patients. So we look forward to updating you on 1473 as that progresses. But I am very inspired and excited about what we have been able to do with that translation of data into patients.\nIan Cooney: Great. Thank you, Anne. Next one, what is the cost of the data breach? And what is the plan to increase data security and restore trust in the company?\nJoseph Selsavage: We've incurred $2.7 million in expenses related to the data breach or data in success cybersecurity incident. To date, we have also booked $1 million in our financials that you see in the 10-Q as we actually booked $1.7 million in anticipated insurance recoveries. We continue to invest in data security. We now require two-factor authentication from all of our customers. And we realize that our business really runs on the trust of our customers, right? It's what we hold in the highest regard. And we intend to be doing this for a long time and continuing to drive innovation and using genetics to help people manage health risk and improve their health span. And for us, we're continuing to look at how we can continue to increase data security at 23andMe.\nAnne Wojcicki: And just to jump in there, I would say the company, it has been a top priority since we started this company, that data security and privacy and transparency are core values for this company. So we have, as Joe mentioned, we have instituted two-factor authentication. It is core for us, a critical priority for us to be leading in privacy. And you will see us continue to be privacy leaders as we sort of enter into a new era of how people are thinking about all such data.\nIan Cooney: Great. Thank you. Next question, you touched on this a little Anne, but maybe we can dig into a little further, AI is causing a new gold rush for quality data. You have some of the best quality data out there. Are you engaged with any one specifically for AI use cases and how do you create value in that arena for the company?\nAnne Wojcicki: Yes. Honestly, it's a very exciting time because it is – you've seen data transform all these other industries and you see it now coming fast and furious for the entire healthcare space and is particularly exciting for the world of drug discovery because drug discovery is so challenging and so expensive. So anything you can do that is going to make it more efficient and have a higher likelihood of success is going to really trickle down and have huge consequence, huge benefits for the entire world. So we see a lot of opportunities for our data. We have the world's largest recontactable genotype phenotype database that is out there. It has been designed and set up since we started the company. It's been designed for research. So we have been engaging in research projects almost since the inception of this company. We have a tremendous amount of experience with translating that data in for therapeutics. So we are working on partnerships that want to mine the data and leverage it. There's all kinds of varying abilities in the industry of people who are very familiar with AI models and that this could fit in with some of the work that they're already doing. And then you get other groups that have different types of approaches of how they leverage genetics for drug discovery. But it's a very exciting time, there's no doubt that having lots of data is going to be a foundation for therapeutic discovery in the future. We are also leveraging all this data for 23andMe internal research meaning that we are translating that for customers, what are ways that we can leverage all of these insights and the world leaders in risk prediction. We're also doing a fair amount of work understanding how you could do DNA language models and how we can be best at predicting financial target, target identification for therapeutics. So there's a lot of great opportunities out there, and we continue to stay on top of this industry.\nIan Cooney: Excellent. So last one here for Joe, can you address – to the extent that you can anyway, how do you plan to move the business towards profitability?\nJoseph Selsavage: We were pleased with the progress we've made to date over the past year in moving the business to profitability. It's really a two-pronged effort, but the most important being driving our growth in both membership and research businesses to have ongoing recurring revenue. And we can also continue to look at how we can optimize our cost structure and really have a high bar for how we invest in the business in the near-term.\nIan Cooney: Great. That's it for us.\nOperator: Thanks for joining us. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great evening."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Anne. \nAnne Wojcicki : Thank you, Ian. To kick off the call, I would like to start with an update on our strategy. 23andMe's mission has always been to help people access, understand and benefit from the human genome. The 23andMe brand is most known for how we transformed access to genetic information and enabled over 14 million people to learn about themselves, their ancestry and their health risks.  Over the last 5 years, we have increasingly put more effort and resources into how customers will benefit from the human genome. Over 80% of our 14 million customers, trust and consent to using their genetic information and phenotypic insights for research, creating the world's largest set of re-contactable genotypic and phenotypic data in the world. We have a world-class team of statistical geneticist, bio-informaticist, computational biologists and data scientists leveraging the data to create consumer products and discoveries for therapeutics development.  As a reminder, we have 3 main businesses powered by our database in creating a new future for health care powered by DNA. First, our consumer business. Where we are taking a precision health approach in generating insights to help customers improve their health and health span based on their unique genotypic and phenotypic profiles. We are moving toward a more subscription-based longitudinal model so we can have a positive impact and help our customers take action to improve their health over time. The subscription business also offers a much more sustainable and attractive operating model for us to create value for our customers and investors.  Second, our research business. This is where we are in discussions with collaborators in pharma, biotech and adjacent industries to sell them licenses to our database. They can then come up with their own insights to help make drug discovery in development more efficient or care delivery more effective.  And third, our therapeutics business, where for the past 7 years, we have interrogated our database to pursue targets and develop therapeutics that will, hopefully, one day help many of our customers directly. We currently have 1 immuno-oncology asset in the clinic in Phase 1/2a with encouraging early efficacy activity. Another IO asset with a particularly exciting profile and a pipeline of molecules targeting immunology and inflammation in the discovery phase. We focus the business on creating value from our dynamic data assets and expect to continue to do so in the future. As we move toward building a model that helps our customers take action from their genetic and health data, we aim to meaningfully increase the percentage of subscription-based offerings so we can provide long-term value and insights to our customers. As therapeutics assets develop, we expect to partner them out to create near-term and longer-term value inflections for our shareholders while also getting them in the best hands to develop through approval and commercialization for the eventual benefit of our customer.  Moving to the second quarter and recent events. Yesterday, we launched a new subscription membership called Total Health, a continued effort to be the world's best at risk prediction. Total Health is our most advanced prevention-based health membership. It includes clinical grade exome sequencing, biannual blood testing and access to clinicians with unique training and genetics. Members of Total Health will also receive all the reports and features offered in our existing 23andMe membership. Through the combination of comprehensive genetic data, blood biomarkers, personal and family health history and genetics trained clinicians, Total Health will provide members with personalized guidance for ongoing disease prevention and early detection. This membership is for the consumer looking for access to advanced genetic risk testing so they can focus on ongoing health management through direct access to mitigate or prevent disease. This is precision health with the support of a clinician who specializes in genetics.  In addition to the launch of Total Health, we continue to add more value to our 23andMe membership. Last month, we introduced 23andMe Health Action Plan, a new digital feature that draws on your personalized genetic reports, health history survey data as well as blood and biomarker data to provide tailored, bite-sized health recommendations for subscribers to take action. In addition to suggestions on altering activities like sleep, diet and exercise, eligible members may also receive recommendations for further clinical actions like getting a blood test, which now can be ordered directly through 23andMe. We also recently launched 23andMe HealthTrack, a digital health tool aimed at driving behavior change by integrating lifestyle and genetics into a single model for the first time.  In July, we launched a new FDA-cleared pharmacogenetics report for 23andMe Plus members on a commonly prescribed statin called Simvastatin. In 2020, about 8 million people in the U.S. were prescribed Simvastatin, making it among the most prescribed medications in the U.S. This new report allows people to understand how their genetics may impact how they respond to the statin and whether or not they may experience side effects. We have another milestone FDA clearance in August to report additional BRCA variants for all 23andMe Health Plus ancestry customers. This allows us to report 41 additional variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes known to be associated with higher risk for breast, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic cancer. Many of these additional variants occur more often in populations that have traditionally been underserved by genetic testing, including the African-American and Hispanic-Latino communities.  As part of the FDA clearance, we were also granted the first-ever FDA predetermined change control plan, allowing us to update our BRCA report with additional validated variants without additional premarket review. You can begin to see the significant investment we've been making in our product and report innovation within our consumer business over the last few months. This includes continuing to provide value in the form of membership services, while expanding margins. We've seen better-than-expected results after increasing our kit and subscription pricing with higher margins, partially offsetting reduced kit sale volume.  Transitioning to therapeutics. We completed the restructuring of the organization with a clear focus on the areas where we believe our data insights provide us with the greatest strategic advantage. This includes continuing to advance our immuno-oncology assets, certain programs stemming from the GSK collaboration as well as focusing on the immunology and inflammation therapeutic areas. This allows us to pursue the most impactful programs in the most efficient manner in terms of capital and resources.  In Q1, we discussed pursuing nonexclusive collaborations with pharmaceutical companies for target discovery. We continue to pursue these collaborations across an array of structures and are excited about the opportunity to attract multiple and varied partners in this business. Last week, we announced progress in this area with a new 1-year nonexclusive data license with GSK, which extends our collaboration. Under the agreement, we will receive a $20 million upfront payment, which enables GSK to conduct drug target discovery and other research using the 23andMe database. The license also includes access to certain research services such as further analyses of the 23andMe data set not provided in the core data release. The collaboration with GSK has been hugely successful, and this collaboration extension validates the power of the 23andMe database to consistently produce novel insights for therapeutic development rooted in human genetics. As part of this agreement, we have made the strategic decision to take the royalty option in lieu of the opt-in on 3 programs we previously initiated together, which will help us reduce our cash burn and allow us to focus on our wholly owned program. We also continue to advance our pipeline of clinical and preclinical program. Last week, we presented positive safety and preliminary efficacy data from the Phase 1/2a clinical trial of our wholly-owned immuno-oncology program, 23andMe 610, an antibody targeting CD200R1.  In two presentations at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer and Annual Meeting, we showed the therapy is well tolerated at our highest dose level. We also reported stable disease in 52% of response evaluable participants in our Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the study. This includes preliminary clinical activities of 23andMe 610 and a patient with neuroendocrine cancer, showing a maximum reduction of 19% in target lesions with a single lesion achieving a sustained 58% reduction in the longest dimension. The participant continues on study drug past 40 weeks with stable disease at the time of data cutoff.  Overall, we've demonstrated that 23andMe 610 is well tolerated and shows promising preliminary efficacy in patients with advanced solid malignancies. We are continuing to enroll the Phase 2a portion of the trial and anticipate reporting further data next calendar year. We are also continuing to advance a preclinical program, P014, an investigational antibody that has dual mechanism, targeting ULBP-6, -5 and -2 to restore antitumor immunity through NK and T cells and inducing Fc receptor mediated killing of ULBP-2, -5, -6 expressing cancer cells. With these programs advancing, the extension of our GSK collaboration and our streamlined focus on immunology and inflammation, we're excited about the progress and direction of our therapeutics group.  In closing, I'd like to provide a brief update on the ongoing cybersecurity investigation that we initiated early last month. Detailed information can be found in an 8-K we filed with the SEC and on our blog. At this time, we do not have any indication that there has been a data security incident within our own system. Data privacy and security remain a top priority. We have recently required all customers utilize 2-factor authentication, and we will continue to invest in protecting our systems and data.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe to review our financial results for the quarter. \nJoseph Selsavage : Thank you, Anne, and hello, everyone. We remain well positioned to continue advancing our consumer and therapeutic goals. Our margin expansion momentum continued this quarter had the impact of PGS kit and subscription price increases to date have been better than expected, as Anne mentioned earlier. Revenue for the quarter was $50 million, representing a decrease of 34% on a strong prior year comparable. The year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily due to the conclusion of our exclusive discovery term under our GSK collaboration in July, providing 1 month of collaboration revenue in the quarter compared to a full 3 months in the prior year as well as nonrecurring payments from other research partners in the prior year. It also reflects our continued focus on driving improved product margins through higher average selling prices and marketing efficiency, resulting in lower overall volume of PGS kit and telehealth orders. These decreases were partially offset by continued growth in our subscription services.  Looking at the composition of our revenue, Consumer service revenue represented approximately 97% and of total revenue for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023, and research services revenue, which was primarily derived from the GSK collaboration, accounted for approximately 3% of total revenue for the same period.  Our gross profit for the second quarter was $22 million, representing a 43% decrease over the same period in the prior year. The decrease in second quarter gross profit was driven primarily by the decrease in research services revenue, while subscription revenue and improved PGS kit selling prices helped to offset through continued margin accretion within their respective categories.  Turning to expenses. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $101 million compared to $106 million in the same period in the prior year. The improvement in operating expenses was primarily driven by reductions in marketing advertising spend aimed to boost efficiency as noted previously. This improvement also reflects lower personnel-related expenses following the reductions in force in June and August earlier this year as well as the disposition of Lemonaid Health Limited in the U.K., also in August. This decrease was partially offset by continued investment in therapeutics and portfolio advancement and also includes onetime severance and related charges related to the workforce reductions and transaction-related expenses for the U.K. disposition.  Looking at the bottom line. Net loss for the quarter was $75 million compared to net loss for the same period in the prior year of $66 million. The increase in second quarter net loss was driven mainly by the lower research services revenue mentioned previously, partially offset by our improved operating expense profile and an increase in interest income from cash held in money market times.  Next, our adjusted EBITDA. For details on how we define adjusted EBITDA as well as the corresponding reconciliations to GAAP, please see our earnings release. Total adjusted EBITDA deficit for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023, was $45 million compared to $30 million deficit for the same period in the prior year. We ended the quarter with $256 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $387 million as of March 31, 2023.  As always, we are actively evaluating the use of our capital for both the consumer and therapeutic businesses, including responsibly opting in or out of therapeutics programs based on opportunity potential and timing of returns as appropriate given market conditions.  Now turning to our guidance. As a reminder, the company's full year 2024 guidance is based on a conservative approach, recognizing current uncertainties in consumer sentiment, the macroeconomic environment and geopolitical conditions. Our focus within the existing lines of the TGS and telehealth consumer businesses remains unchanged. We continue to prioritize margin expansion and progressing towards cash flow profitability. These efforts include ongoing value additions to our current services like the recently announced HealthTrack and Health Action Plan features within 23andMe. The newly launched Total Health membership, our most advanced and comprehensive precision health service and the reorganization of our consumer segment to streamline our expense profile. Within the therapeutics business, we continue to invest in programs we believe are most strategically and financially valuable. With the end of the exclusive discovery term under the GSK collaboration in July, we decided to narrow our discovery and development efforts to areas that best align with our core strength. This resulted in a workforce reduction in August as we realigned our resources to the revamped structure and the more recent decision to take the royalty option on several programs initiated together with GSK, which will allow us to reduce cash burn and focus on our wholly owned programs. We expect these decisions to yield meaningful economic benefit in future periods.  While we're pleased with this year's progress and excited for the launch of Total Health, we remain prudent with our outlook given current uncertainties in the macro environment. Similarly, although, the new GSK data license announced last week serves as further validation of our databases value, we expect the deal's $20 million revenue to have minimal impact on this year's results, with the majority of landing in fiscal year '25 given the terms of the agreement. The company is partially adjusting its full year guidance for fiscal year '24, which ends on March 31, 2024.  In terms of revenue, we are updating our fiscal year 2024 guidance to be in the range of $240 million to $250 million, with net loss reaffirmed to be in the range of $325 million to $345 million loss. Full year adjusted EBITDA deficit is reaffirmed to be in the range of $160 million deficit to $180 million deficit for fiscal year 2024. This updated outlook is a result of our commitment to delivering critical insights and values to our customers through impactful new services while improving our cash flow through better unit economics and cost discipline. Also, a reminder that adjusted EBITDA is our best proxy for cash burn.  And now I'll turn the call back over to Anne. \nAnne Wojcicki : Thanks, Joe. I'm optimistic as we head into fiscal year Q3. We've made incredible progress through the innovation happening within the consumer business, both by increasing the value of our 23andMe Plus membership with new features and reports as well as launching Total Health, a new comprehensive subscription offering that positions us to be the world's best at risk prediction. Our therapeutics team continues to demonstrate progress advancing our pipeline of clinical and preclinical programs. And our new GSK nonexclusive collaboration extension demonstrates the value of our database as we continue to pursue new opportunities with pharmaceutical and biotech companies.  With that, let's open it up to questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chad Wiatrowski with TD Cowen. \nChad Wiatrowski:\nJoseph Selsavage: I can take that question. We haven't really seen any impact on the -- from the cybersecurity incident on revenue to date. We're continuing to -- on the cybersecurity incident investigation, and we don't have any specific guidance on cost estimates of that yet or the insurance recoveries, but what will be updating in the future and future quarters. \nAnne Wojcicki : Just one thing I wanted to add was just we've had a very intentional push on revenue -- sorry, on margin expansion. So again, I just want to be able to push that to you as well is that our -- not on the cybersecurity side, but it has been very intentional for us as a company to be disciplined with our marketing disciplined with our costs and like really focusing on the margin expansion, which is why we took down that top line because we are not focusing as much on that top line acceleration, but really on margin. \nChad Wiatrowski:\nAnne Wojcicki : So I think obviously, I can take that advance. So I -- there's a whole world, I think, that is out there where people are looking for access and ease of use for ways that they can make themselves healthier. And I think you see an explosion of whether it's a watch or it's a wearable of some store or an MRI service where people want to get -- be focused on being proactive. So Total Health is all about empowering our customers to really have a comprehensive assessment of themselves with their genetics, with blood, with medical guidance, and those costs are obviously higher, like that is very different than the 23andMe company ancestry product that we have, but this is an ongoing. We absolutely anticipate with these customers that we are going to have an ongoing relationship with them, where we can really get involved, we can coach, they can have interactions with health care providers, we're going to keep following them up with blood, making sure that they're getting a level of care about themselves that's going to be optimal for prevention. So we did do a fair amount of market research on this. We did do a fair amount of assessment of the -- what our pricing flexibility could be. There are obviously more costs associated with this product, but I believe there is a significant market at this price level. \nOperator: Next question come from the line of David Lebowitz with Citi. \nDavid Lebowitz : With respect to the increased kit pricing, could you comment if it's had any impact to this point on your marketing strategy, or how it might change your -- what you plan to do into the holiday season? \nAnne Wojcicki : So, this is Anne. So I assume you mean the base pricing on the health and ancestry and not solo health? \nDavid Lebowitz : Yes. \nAnne Wojcicki : I think that has definitely been a priority for us. Our customers see incredible amount of value from the subscription product. They see a tremendous amount of value from the health and ancestry service. So it was absolutely -- and if you think back on how long we had at a $99 or $199 price point, it has been a long time since we have raised those prices. So we're quite happy to see the response from customers, continued uptake on our subscription part of the product, that obviously, as we have increased margin from all of our products that absolutely allows us the opportunities to do more with our marketing spend, and particularly top of the funnel marketing spend, where we can have more brand awareness. So you should definitely be looking for us to do more with TV and more marketing in -- especially for holiday season and going forward. \nDavid Lebowitz : Got it. Given the nature of the Total Health product, is there -- is it primarily going to be a direct to consumer, or is there consideration for looking into alternate approaches may be coming from the health care providers themselves, to try to grow the overall product. \nAnne Wojcicki : Yes, that's a great question. I think we're in the earliest days of launching this. It is really a soft launch so far. We see demand. We see that there is -- there are absolutely clinicians who are out there who would like to offer a comprehensive exome to their patients, but don't necessarily have that interpretation experience. They don't necessarily have the genetics training, and that's where we could potentially partner in the future. So I would look for us to focus on direct-to-consumer in the short term, but absolutely, we are exploring what are those additional opportunities as the product continues to go. And I just want to cite, and I don't have the specific numbers in front of me, but we did talk about in the past, these Medscape surveys that we did, where there is 90-plus percentage of physicians that are interested in integrating genetics into their practice. And so we see ourselves as a global leader in the delivery of genetics-based preventative care. So how is it that we can enable all of those clinicians who are eager to do more to actually be able to do that. So I think this is a product that will absolutely have a direct-to-consumer feel as well as a potential health care provider appeal. \nDavid Lebowitz : And on the $20 million payment, are we to assume that it's basically going to be paid, amortized over the year, so kind of $5 billion per quarter type thing? \nJoseph Selsavage: From a cash perspective, we expect to receive $5 million in this -- in Q3 and the remainder in Q4 of fiscal year '24. From a revenue perspective, there's only a small amount in fiscal year '24 because it will be amortized over the period of the agreement. So the majority will land from a revenue GAAP perspective in fiscal year '25. \nDavid Lebowitz : Got it. And just jumping over to the other side of the world. We recently reported data at SITC. Could you, I guess, characterize the 52% greatest stable disease give us a sense of how that might translate ultimately into clinical response when you -- in your Phase 2a. \nJennifer Low: I think the way to interpret that data, this is a Phase 1, all solid tumor cancer patients. The primary goal was to look at safety. We were very pleased to have some patients who did have a longer time on study, and so we wanted to communicate that. But we are really happy that this is monotherapy, this is our patients who generally do not have a lot of options, who had multiple prior lines of therapy in this group that was once a month. This was also during the dose escalation, and so many patients who are receiving sub-therapeutic doses. So it's -- I think this really sets us up well for the upcoming Phase 2a data that we hope to present that we've been enrolling this year. And I think it's just -- it's really also a sort of proof that 23andMe Therapeutics, so we've created a really solid molecule that has with PK and has safety is consistent with the mechanism of this drug. \nDavid Lebowitz : One last follow-up here. With respect to the candidate, is there any mechanistic rationale you can provide for what cancers you might ultimately choose to target? \nAnne Wojcicki : So the nice thing about the target that we've chosen in CD200R1 and its ligand CD200, it is expressed in a variety of tumor types. And these tumor -- that expression will probably play a role in which patients we chose to move forward with. But for the Phase 1a the disease areas that we chose to do our expansion cohorts and was primarily driven by CD200 and 200R1 expression and the likely populations we would have in the late-stage Phase 3 population. In other words, we have in therapy. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And now I will turn it over to Ian for any further questions. \nIan Cooney: Thank you, Carmin. I will now read the top shareholder questions from our say technologies platform. This one is for Anne. What are you doing to increase the value of the company? \nAnne Wojcicki : That is a great question. This is obviously a top priority for all of us within 23andMe. I just want to remind you all, we are all shareholders. I am a large shareholder. It is a top priority for us to be able to demonstrate and get the value that we think that we all should be getting from the company. So first and foremost, the consumer business is full of incredible opportunity. And that is why we -- obviously, we have the health and the ancestry products. We have been pivoting into a subscription product more and more for all of our customers. Total Health, I think, is the future of where we are thinking about everything. There is absolutely an opportunity to be able to have more and more people getting access to an exome access to their blood, access to clinical care that is focused on prevention. So I absolutely believe there's an incredible opportunity for all of us on the consumer side. On partnerships, you can see that we already did our GSK partnership, which we announced. There is a real opportunity for 23andMe to be helping the entire therapeutics and research business, world about how they can recruit better, how they can eventually promote, how can they can leverage genetics to their drug discovery and be more efficient and more likely to be successful because of the utilization of genetics. So by being at the end of the GSK collaboration, we really have a significant opportunity now for doing those types of collaborations.  So last, I am thrilled about our therapeutics team and our opportunities that we have here, the IO program that Jennifer just stated, I think our goal potential, the SITC data, I think, shows that. We have our P014 asset which is slated to file IND short -- as we said shortly, as well as we have the opportunities for all of our discovery that will be wholly owned now by 23andMe. So we have previously said that will be focused on inflammation and immunology. We have a team that has been working for years with GSK on moving from data to the end process of actually having programs in the clinics with humans filing the INDs ourselves, actually going from, again, the very beginning all the way actually into humans. And I think that there's a huge opportunity for us there.  And then lastly, I just want to conclude with the fact that genetics, I think is a critical part that needs to be part of everyone's like their health care, how they are actually making decisions in their health as well as part of the therapeutic process. And we have -- we just want to reiterate the fact that if you start with human genetic information, you are more than twice as likely to be successful with your discovery. So again, genetics should become an integral part of our life, whether it's in our personal life and our health or in our therapeutics life, and how we are taking medications and developing medication. \nIan Cooney: Thank you, Anne. Next question is for Joe. What is the company's plan to address liquidity and decreased cash burn? \nJoseph Selsavage: Thank you, Ian. I mean, first and foremost, the company is trying to increase its revenue. And basically, as Anne mentioned, really focus on the growth of margin. For us, that means less promotions, and we increased prices of our kits and subscriptions, which has been well received by consumers. And really, we've seen better-than-expected results there. We've also launched new products. Basically, we talked a little bit of health, now paying Total Health, which we launched yesterday. And then we actually announced the GSK deal, which also provided $20 million in additional cash for the company. And our corporate development team is continually working on additional potential deals as well. And then on the cost structure, we've taken significant efforts in this fiscal year to reduce our cost structure. First, we announced previously, we've done reductions in force to rebalance our employee headcount. Next is we are also working with our therapeutics team and making sure we're utilizing our capital on the assets that really will drive the most shareholder value there. And help us also reduce our cash and cash burn. I mean, all of these efforts will help us decrease our cash burn and extend our current cash runway. So we're pleased with the efforts to date. \nIan Cooney: Thanks, Joe. This one is for Jennifer. Can you explain the historical lack of transparency around your drug development efforts? And do you plan to be more transparent moving forward? \nJennifer Low: Thank you. We have been and continue to be somewhat constrained in what we can talk about with our GSK collaboration programs, and largely, those we do not talk about. However, we are -- as you can see, we've been publishing quite a bit on 610. We will, like many other companies, continue to announce scientifically relevant data out scientific conferences, and we do have a lot of information that we're planning on just those things just like we did at SITC last week. We're also excited to be talking more about our new program with [014] program. It's an NK cell activator, and you're going to hear more from us about that mechanism and our plans moving forward. And finally, we're updating our therapeutics website to be launched within the next few months, and that will also provide more information than we have in the past. \nIan Cooney: Thank you, Jennifer. This one has already been asked in a way, but it was a top question online, so I'll ask it again, maybe for Anne. While the recent security incidents of customer accounts affect future business opportunities in any way? \nAnne Wojcicki : A couple of things here. I want to just point out how we did just sign a new partnership accessing the 23andMe data set being able to leverage that for drug discovery with a partner, GSK, who's been, obviously, a long-standing partner for us. So I think that it is something that obviously we have notified individuals about. We have commented on I think it's very important about how we react. As you can see, we also have implemented 2-factor authentication. So I think that we are learning, we are taking the necessary steps forward to adapt to an environment where things like credential stuffing is happening more and more. We are being very proactive about how we are thinking about data and security. And I think you can see based on collaborations that we are entering now that there is still enthusiasm. And I think based on our BD calendar and the meetings that we're doing, there is absolute enthusiasm for the projects you're doing. There is not -- the incident has not diminished the opportunities for genetics to still really revolutionize health care for consumers or for the industry. \nIan Cooney: Great. Last one, it is for Anne. You've recently announced another subscription business and the consumer business. Do you expect to continue to move in that subscription model direction, or how should we think about the future of the consumer business? \nAnne Wojcicki : The future of the consumer business is absolutely about subscription. And the reason for that is that we see from our customers and the behavior we've had over the last 17 years is that our customers are eager to get more, they're eager to engage, and they're eager to keep learning about themselves. So for us to be able to financially support that kind of innovation and additional data that our customers are looking for, we need to evolve from a onetime payment to a subscription model. And I think that both with the needs of the company is actually having a sustainable consumer business or rather a thriving consumer business as well as hit our customer goals of being able to get affordable direct access to meaningful information but continuously seeing it innovate and evolve and continuously enabling themselves to learn more through their genome as well as the additional data that we provide back. So yes, the future is subscription, and we're very enthused about 23andMe Plus as well as Total Health offerings. And I think you can look to us to continue to put more products in the subscription and add more features there. \nOperator: And thank you all for participating and joining us. This concludes today's conference call, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."
