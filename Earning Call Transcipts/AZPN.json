After the speaker’s presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, Justin. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, ending December 31, 2023. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, AspenTech’s President and CEO; and Chris Stagno, AspenTech’s Interim CFO. Please note we have posted earnings presentation on our IR website, and we ask that investors refer to this presentation in conjunction with today’s call. Starting on Slide 2, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may different materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that have caused these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K and other subsequent filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this presentation, we present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measure is included in today’s earnings press release and investor presentation, both of which are available on our Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Brian, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Let me start by reiterating that I’ve never been as excited about the future of AspenTech as I am today. The AspenTech team has done an excellent job working through a dynamic macro environment to deliver solid results in the second quarter. With an expanded portfolio and team, we’re uniquely positioned to capture and benefit from the numerous opportunities available in the energy transition from efficiencies and sustainability use cases. Now, starting on Slide 3 with our quarterly results. In Q2, we saw solid demand for our products and solutions. Annual contract value, or ACV, was $914 million, increasing 9.6% year-over-year, while free cash flow was $29 million. These results reflect the delay in renewing a large customer agreement that was scheduled to be renewed in Q2 and reduced ACV growth by approximately 0.6 points. We now expect to close this customer agreement in Q3 with a corresponding benefit to Q3 ACV growth. In addition to this, I would like to highlight four key takeaways regarding our Q2 results. First, our overall term software pipeline has continued to increase. We’re seeing growth in the number and size of opportunities across our businesses, which is in line with our sales channel investments over the past several quarters and the contribution from the DGM and SSE suites resulting from the transformation of those two businesses. We will start converting more of this pipeline to sales in the second half of fiscal year 2024. Second, the macro environment and demand for our products and solutions has remained strong in most end markets, consistent with our commentary from the last couple of quarters. Third, we made significant advances in upgrading our product portfolio and advancing new sustainability-related use cases in Q2. With the successful launch of our V14 software update, we have introduced enhancements to our products that we believe will drive incremental growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 and longer term. Fourth and final taking all these factors into consideration, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our ACV growth target of at least 11.5% for the full fiscal year. We recognize that we need to have two strong quarters of growth in the second half to achieve this target, and we continue to believe that we’re in a good position to deliver on this outcome. Turning to Slide 4, I will now provide an update on our end markets and suites, starting with digital grid management, our utility solutions business. DGM has enjoyed an excellent first half of the year as it continues to benefit from the mission-critical nature of its products and solutions alongside a robust demand environment. Importantly, today’s utilities are in the early stages of an unprecedented investment cycle to expand the electrical grid, introduce renewable energy, and enhance cybersecurity capabilities to meet the growth in electricity demand driven by the energy transition and the energy security requirements of countries around the world. Our transformation initiative to align the DGM business with the Heritage AspenTech model over the past 18 months are also producing their expected results. These initiatives have included launching and growing DGM’s term software licensing model, expanding its sales channel and global footprint to capitalize on the growth opportunities we’re seeing and ramping up its ISP network. For example, in Q2, we won several large term license deals, including one with a leading North American power utility where we displaced the competition as part of their holding company’s vendor standardization program. Our energy management solutions proven track record of delivering value as well as our longstanding relationships with other utilities in this holding company’s portfolio were key catalysts for us in this win. Both in the U.S. and internationally, DGM’s product strength, hardware agnostic stance, and ability to form a strategic long-term partnership with customers, are driving growth. We expect to see continuous strength from this suite in the second half of fiscal 2024 and believe this will be a high growth business for AspenTech going forward. Now, turning to our Subsurface Science & Engineering suite, SSE performed to expectations in the first half of the fiscal year, benefiting from a strong CapEx spending environment and new use cases driven by sustainability, especially in carbon capture and sequestration. SSE has long been the upstream industry’s most comprehensive offering and the AspenTech go-to-market model is serving as a catalyst to help fully unleash its potential. In Q2, for example, SSE gained further momentum as we closed a large deal with a national oil company in Asia. While many vendors competed for this opportunity, the strength of our subsurface formation evaluation and geological modeling capabilities combined with the strength of our relationships across organization allowed us to ultimately win this deal. We continue to work closely with this customer and see clear pathways to expand this strategic relationship at additional sites with more solutions. SSE is also benefiting from synergies with our engineering suite and the positive momentum from its tokenization rollout. As with our other suites, we continue to see that the combination of a term license model and tokenized suite is a true win-win situation, allowing our customers to benefit from our latest innovation and supporting faster product update. Overall, we expect CapEx budgets in calendar 2024 to remain consistent with last year’s, supporting the demand for SSE products in the second half of fiscal 2024 in line with our expectations. Now moving to Slide 5, let’s review our Heritage AspenTech business, starting with our engineering suite. Strong CapEx trends in traditional upstream markets and newer sustainability-related use cases are driving greater usage by EPCs and our owner operators. On the back of this favorable spending environment, our engineering suite’s modeling, simulation, and analysis capabilities have remained in high demand, supporting the strongest growth this suite has seen in many years in the first half of fiscal 2024. In Q2, for example, we won a large-scale deal with a new EPC logo that is executing several projects for a large energy company in the Middle East. Prior to working with AspenTech, this customer was using a variety of tools from different vendors to manage its process engineering workflows. The customer was interested in standardizing their engineering software solutions toolset and conducted a competitive evaluation process, resulting in the selection of AspenTech due to the breadth of capabilities. By engaging with AspenTech, they are now able to leverage our full portfolio of innovation and product synergies to execute on their project backlog. Separately, our engineering suite has continued to see solid traction with the small-to-medium business segment of the market through our high-velocity sales organization. During the quarter, this business continues to win engineering deals with customers in non-traditional industries for AspenTech that are looking to decarbonize their operations or see a business opportunity in sustainability, including such areas as the aviation biofuels, hydrogen, ammonia, LNG, direct carbon capture, or DAC, and more. Now, turning to our manufacturing and supply chain suite, the MSC results in the first half of 2024 reflected the ongoing weakness in the chemicals market, as well as the delayed renewal that I referenced earlier. Nevertheless, even this business’ typical seasonality, strong pipeline, and expected closing of the delayed renewal agreement, as well as the continuation of solid refining demand and our ongoing innovation efforts, we expect a stronger performance in the second half of this year. As part of our recent V14 software update, we have made substantial improvement to our new Aspen Unified platform environment for asset planning and scheduling in MSC. Specifically, we have introduced tighter and better model integration, improved data management capabilities, deeper AI capabilities and a more scalable architecture. This represents the most significant update to our Unified platform’s planning and scheduling solutions in over a decade. While we are still in the early phase of this rollout, customers are already responding positively to this improvement. For example, in Q2, we received a green light from one of the world’s largest integrated energy companies to implement our updated Aspen Unified planning and scheduling solution across their asset base. This customer highly values the strength of our latest innovations, and ultimately, our ability to support better operational decision-making across their global teams. We’re excited to work with them on this project over the next several months and see additional opportunities to support their digitalization initiatives going forward. Finally, our asset performance management suite continues to gain industry recognition and grow its customer base. For example, in Q2, our APM team closed an exciting win with a large global pharmaceutical company to implement our Mtell product at one of its European manufacturing plants. This deal was supported by our commercial agreement with Emerson, who also has a strong relationship with the customer via their offerings, including the DeltaV control system. While this deal was for one initial site, the customer has shown strong interest in rolling out the solution across its entire manufacturing base to drive further operational and sustainability excellence. Turning to Slide 6. We will discuss our sustainability initiatives. As I highlighted previously, sustainability related topics contributed to accelerated engineering suite growth in Q2. We believe that the strong tailwind we’re seeing in sustainability is being driven by the energy transition and the alignment of corporate strategies with government policy and funding. This was further validated to me at COP28, the United Nations Climate Change Conference. As part of this event, public and private organizations alike made pledges to reduce carbon emissions by increasing renewable energy production and usage and driving higher energy efficiency. To do this, companies must not only accelerate their digitalization journeys but also leverage the potential of new and existing asset optimization technologies. We remain focused on partnering and co-innovating with customers in these areas in Q2 to accelerate their use case development. For example, we advance our collaboration with a large global player in renewable wind energy that aims to also secure leadership in the production of green hydrogen and ammonia. While this customer currently leverages our modeling and DMC3 process capabilities to drive efficiency, we’re now also partnering to improve their electrolyzer modeling capabilities. Additionally, we’ve built on our existing relationship with a refining company in Europe to implement our emissions management solution for better CO2 tracking, reporting, and modeling. This customer already relies on our solutions to run its assets more efficiently and sustainably and is excited about the potential to leverage our emissions management solution to better manage its carbon footprint going forward. As an organization, we also recognize that the challenges presented by the prevailing energy megatrends are considerable and we remain committed to doing our part. To that end, I’m proud to announce that we made a formal commitment last week to achieve net zero emissions as an organization by 2045. As part of this commitment, we will build a decarbonization plan over the next 12 months to 24 months to achieve net zero for Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 and across Scope 1 to 3 by 2045 in line with the science-based targets initiative. Now, turning to Slide 7 for our innovation initiatives. In November, we successfully launched enhancements to our version 14 and a new version 14.2 aspenONE software. This update included enhanced industrial AI, further OT data integration, and additional sustainability capabilities with more than 140 sustainability models now available to customers. As mentioned previously, this latest rollout is garnering positive customer response and helping us to win additional business. We look forward to showcasing the full range of our innovations at our optimized 2024 conference in Houston this May. I would also like to take a moment to speak about how our latest V14 update incorporates artificial intelligence. While we have been using industrial AI in our products for years, this latest update leverages the technology in ways that are new, innovative, and represent exciting growth drivers for us. For example, with this latest release, we have integrated additional AI capabilities including neural networks into Aspen Unified and Aspen HYSYS Dynamics Hybrid Models. These AI enhancements extend and build upon our ability to employ non-linear hybrid modeling in both traditional and sustainability related use cases to improve modeling accuracy. We have also incorporated generative AI based assistance into our strategic planning capabilities for sustainability pathways. This innovation helps to solve the cold start problem for users by using their queries or prompts to automatically create a new superstructure workflow, saving them time and allowing them to focus on more creative and high value of tasks. These are just a few examples of the way AspenTech is leveraging AI across our portfolio today. As always, our ability to leverage these innovations alongside the industry expertise and first principles know-how remains a competitive differentiator for us and highly valued by our customers. In closing, on Slide 8, we remain confident in our ability to deliver ACP growth of at least 11.5% year-over-year in fiscal 2024. Our confidence in reaffirming this guidance is primarily based on the following factors. First is the strength of our pipeline resulting from a positive macro environment, resilient demand and sales channel expansion. Second, the adoption of the DGM suite term licensing model is accelerating in the market and contributing to increasing growth. Third, the SSE suite and its tokenization continues to gain momentum in the market. Fourth, is the continued demand strength for our engineering suite, driven by upstream and sustainability CapEx. And fifth and final, an expanded sales channel will have a greater impact on pipeline conversion in the second half of the fiscal year. Specifically, on Q3, we now expect sequential ACV growth in the mid to high 3% range. This accounts for the closing of the delayed renewal agreement mentioned earlier, as well as the factors just referenced in support of our fiscal year guidance. Stronger Q3 and Q4 quarters are in line with our historical cadence as AspenTech’s result have traditionally been more weighted to the second half of our fiscal year. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chris for a discussion of our Q2 financial results. Chris?\nChris Stagno: Thank you, Antonio, and hello, everyone. I’m excited to be with you here today and to help lead AspenTech through this CFO transition process. Turning to our Q2 performance, I will start out by highlighting that our earnings presentation includes explanations regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. We have also included definitions of Annual Contract Value or ACV, bookings and free cash flow among other metrics in our earnings presentation now available on our IR website. We ask that investors refer to these definitions together with today’s call. Starting on Slide 9, annual contract value was $914 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, up 9.6% year-over-year and 1.8% quarter-over-quarter. As Antonio mentioned, we had one large renewal, approximately $5.4 million, or 0.6 points of growth that we expected to close in the second quarter but was delayed. We now expect to close this deal in Q3. Total bookings were $233.4 million in the second quarter, decreasing 3.9% year-over-year, consistent with our expectations. Total revenue was $257 million for the second quarter, up 5.9% on a year-over-year basis. Please note that revenue in our model is heavily impacted by contract renewal timing and variability under ASC Topic 606. This includes the impact of the larger deal that was pushed out of Q2. Now turning to profitability. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported operating income of $89 million in Q2, representing a 34% non-GAAP operating margin. This compares to Non-GAAP operating income of $87 million for a Non-GAAP operating margin of 36% a year ago. The year-over-year increase in expenses was driven by increased headcount and compensation costs consistent with our sales expansion efforts and other business initiatives. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period to period due to the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter. Non-GAAP net income was $88 million in the quarter, or $1.37 per share, compared to non-GAAP net income of $23 million or $0.35 per share. Please note that the difference in non-GAAP net income between periods was mainly due to the change in computing our tax provision, which initially occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $131 million of cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the impact of share repurchases under a $300 million share repurchase authorization and $197 million available under our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 375,000 shares for $72 million under our $300 million share repurchase authorization for fiscal year 2024. Year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 955,000 shares for $186 million under the same authorization. On cash flows, we generated $30 million of cash flow from operations and $29 million of free cash flow in Q2, compared to $50 million in cash flow from operations and $48 million in free cash flow a year ago, mainly due to higher cash tax and the variability of contract cycle renewals and billings between that. Turning to Slide 10, I would now like to close with guidance. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we are reiterating our outlook across all metrics. We continue to expect ACV growth of at least 11.5% in fiscal 2024. As Antonio mentioned, we are seeing pipeline strength, a healthy demand environment, several other notable tailwinds across our business that support our conviction as we move into the second half of our fiscal year. In addition, our non-GAAP EPS range has increased by $0.02 from our prior guide to reflect the impact of our share repurchase activity in the second quarter. There was no impact to GAAP EPS. Now turning to Slide 11 for linearity. As Antonio noted, we now expect to deliver sequential ACV growth in the mid to high 3% range in the third quarter. On free cash flow, we expect Q4 to come in slightly above Q3. On revenue, we continue to expect our fiscal 2024 revenue linearity to be similar to that of fiscal 2023. This includes expectations for bookings up for renewal of $580 million in fiscal 2024 with $173 million up for renewal in Q3 and $195 million up for renewal in Q4. For a complete overview of our fiscal year 2024 guidance and linearity commentary, please refer to our earnings presentation slides now available on our IR website. In closing, we delivered a solid Q2 performance to close out the first half of our fiscal 2024. With a strong foundation in place, we continue to make investments in those areas that can support growth, while also remaining disciplined in our execution to return to our historical profitability levels over time. Looking ahead, we are excited about the opportunities we are seeing across our end markets and confident in our ability to deliver on our fiscal 2024 financial targets. With that, I will turn it back over to Antonio for closing comments.\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Chris. As I mentioned earlier, we recognize that we need two strong quarters of growth in the second half to achieve our fiscal 2024 guidance targets. We believe that we’re in a good position to deliver on this outcome. Our confidence is supported by the factors we laid out today. We’re also excited by the growth potential of our innovation efforts. Across our portfolio, we continue to roll out new and enhanced capabilities to help our customers better meet their efficiency and sustainability objectives. As global leaders in industrial software, AspenTech has a long track record of partnering closely with customers to understand their needs, support their digitalization efforts, and drive positive business outcomes. We remain fully committed to this work going forward. With that, we will open it up for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rob Oliver from Baird. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Rob.\nRob Oliver: Great. Hi, Antonio. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two. My first one is, just I know you’ve called out the sort of back-half-weighted nature of the ACV guide, and you provided some details around that. I think even with the deal that slipped, at least in our model, it shows up as something markedly more back-end loaded than historically you guys were. So just some of the things you mentioned pipeline, channel expansions, I guess, maybe if you could just home in on kind of one or two things that gives you the most comfort here as we look at that sort of big ramp you guys need in the second half. And then typically in the past you guys provided a range, and this year you guys said that that would be sort of the minimum, is that now the goal, in other words, the chance of kind of beating that number and that being the minimum kind of off the table now. And then I just had a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, I mean, like, first of all, we remain to our guidance, which it’s always been at least 11.5% and that is the goal. And time will tell what that means, but at least 11.5% over that number. Look, with regards to how weighted this year is to the second half, first of all, of course, that delayed renewal, which is about 0.6 points of growth, and unfortunately through complications and internal alignment and administrative issues with that customer, that deal didn’t get renewed on time. This isn’t the first time that something like this happens. This is certainly the largest deal that we’ve had to experience that with. Normally, it’s much smaller transactions, but it’s not unusual, and this is the first time that we’ll probably have to disclose something like this. With regards to our confidence on the second half, look, it starts with the volume of the pipeline. Our pipeline over the last 12 months, January to January, our total pipeline for the company has grown over 30% and this is certainly supported by the channel sales expansion, but also by the macro environment that we see, the demand from our customers, and certainly the market leadership position of our products. But more specifically, look, we’re very excited about the fact that now after 18 months, some of the transformation initiatives that we started working at the beginning of fiscal 2023 are starting to bear fruit. The outcome for DGM on term software licensing in the first half of the year was a great outcome. The term software pipeline for DGM is expanding very rapidly. As a matter of fact, it’s grown by almost 500% in the last 12 months, and the majority of our customers are now accepting term software. So we’re very excited about that, and we have a positive outlook for the DGM suite for the full year. Equally, the transformation of the SSE suite into a token suite, they used to do term deals, mostly one-year deals, now it’s tokens, and we’re expanding the duration of those deals. It continues to gain momentum. This is gaining the attention of our customers, but look, I also believe it’s catching the attention of our competition, because it is starting to eat into the market position of some of our competitors. So we’re also very excited about SSE, and we also have a positive outlook for that suite for the full year. Look, equally, the growth that we’re seeing on the engineering suite that started last year, last fiscal year, but has continued this year and we expect it to continue through the full fiscal year is very exciting. It’s driven by both the cap expand, but also sustainability cap expand, and we expect that suite to perform very well for the full fiscal year and most likely above planned. And then, look, we now have an expanded sales team that’s in place for the most part that is now familiar with our motion and cadences, and we expect them to be very, very engaged converting that pipeline here in Q3, Q4. But I also want to say the following, because in a way, with Heritage AspenTech, after 40 years of taking those products to market, we relied on volume to deliver our results in the past, and once in a while we had deals of significant size. What we are now seeing with DGM and SSE is that we have a larger number of more sizable deals in our pipeline that come through as a result of the spend that utilities have to put in place in order to upgrade their systems. These are very large systems that required a lot of software and technology. Therefore, the size of these deals is seven figures and sometimes deep in the seven figures. And with SSE, we’re also seeing deals that are larger than historically had deal. So when we look at our pipeline, it’s not only volume but also size, especially as we talk specifically Q3 and Q4. So there are many reasons for this. As I said, very excited about what I see going forward. And of course, we know that we need to hit on all cylinders to deliver Q3 and Q4 and my expectation is that we will.\nRob Oliver: I appreciate all the detail, Antonio. Thank you. Just quickly as a follow-up, if you could just comment because the question we’ve been getting from investors is around your relationship with Aramco. And I know that you guys do have a co-innovation model with Aramco, and they’re an important customer. Could you just comment on what the recent production cut from Aramco could mean in terms of their CapEx and if that might have any impact at all on Aspen? I know you do a lot with them. Thank you very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Aramco is one of my – our most important customers. We’ve had – we’ve been doing business with Aramco for probably 30 years. Certainly, with SSE relationship has expanded with Aramco. But look, it’s a relationship that existed and spend that existed before they announced that we’re going to expand their production from 12 million to 13 million barrels. And now that they’ve announced that they’re going to not do it and stay at 12 million barrels. I don’t think it changes our outlook for Aramco. As a matter of fact, Aramco has been a heavy user of our engineering suite. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about the opportunities or advantages that our customers are seeing from leveraging the synergies around the engineering suite and the SSE suite. So we’re engaged with Aramco. And furthermore, what I will say is that on a global basis, oil and gas companies have to replace 4 million to 5 million barrels of oil production every year because of depletion in their reservoirs. So there is a lot of CapEx that has to be put to work to just maintain production, let alone increase it. So we’re still very optimistic about our outlook in the Middle East overall.\nRob Oliver: Great. Thanks again, Antonio. I appreciate it.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Matthew Pfau from William and Blair. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Matt.\nMatthew Pfau: Hi. Great. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to first ask a follow-up in terms of the back half ramp for ACV. So if we exclude the deal, the renewal that got delayed, is the back half ramp still in line with your expectations from the previous quarter? Or did it get more back-end loaded absent that the impact of that renewal?\nAntonio Pietri: Just slightly – slightly higher in the second half. If you were to put that deal back into Q2, it’s just a few percentage points higher at the second half, but nothing that material.\nMatthew Pfau: Okay, great. And then on DGM, good to hear the commentary on that pipeline being up 500% over the past 12 months for term deals. What about in terms of implementation capacity there? I know that building out the ecosystem has been a focus. Do you feel you have enough implementation capacity to implement those deals?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, I think this is something that we remain very focused on. This is the reason why we continue to progress building the implementation services partner network that – that we talked about already 12, 18 months ago. But also equally, part of that demand is new business that we’re generating in other regions of the world and we’re setting up teams in those regions as well, including developing these partnerships. So we’re confident in our ability to meet the demand, working closely and collaborating with these customers as these agreements get signed and the implementation plans get defined.\nMatthew Pfau: Okay, great. Appreciate it guys.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Mark Schappel from Loop Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Mark.\nMark Schappel: Hi. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question here. Antonio, I was wondering if you could just provide some additional details around that slipped [ph] renewal contract in terms of, say, industry or geography. And also, too, I mean, what’s giving you confidence that that slipped renewal will close in Q3.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well – so Mark, just for reasons of confidentiality and considering that our friendly competitors may always be listening, we won’t talk about the geography, what technologies or products this is about. As we said, it’s about – it’s a renewal that got delayed, it’s about $5.4 million in value. We expect that it will close in Q3. We have a very detailed sequence of events, and we are about three quarters through the sequence of event already. So we expect that transaction to close in Q3.\nMark Schappel: Okay. That’s fair. Thanks. And then regarding your joint commercial agreement with Emerson, is there an immediate or maybe a near-term industry focus around that agreement? So for example, you did a pulp and paper joint deal with them last quarter. It looks like a pharma – a nice pharma deal this quarter. It appears that the commercial agreement is focused more on process manufacturing industries outside of the core oil and gas business. So I was wondering if you could just comment on that.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, I think in the first 12 months of the commercial agreement, mostly fiscal 2023, as we learned about each other, it became clear that focus was going to be very important in succeeding initially in the partnership. So we have – we are targeting very specific areas of engagement, both areas like pharma, but also areas where Emerson has a lot of strength in their businesses, whether it’s geographies, whether it’s types of projects that they pursue and other areas where Emerson has a very strong presence and also non-traditional industries for AspenTech. We’ve been very focused on that in this fiscal year. Our efforts are very targeted in that regard. And we believe that this is paying off and will pay off more handsomely in the future as we ramp up those go-to-market activities.\nMark Schappel: Great. Thank you. That’s all for me.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: And thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Jason Celino from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jason.\nJason Celino: Hi, thanks. Yes. Hi, Antonio. Now that we’ve – well, not we’ve, but now that most of your customers have kind of set their budgets for the year. How are global CapEx rates looking for this year? And maybe how does that maybe compare to last year?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. No. Look, actually, we’re very excited about what we’re hearing and seeing. Oil and gas CapEx are more or less in line to last year or up depending on the customer segment or geography. And by that, I mean, probably 5% to 10%, but mostly in line with last year, which was healthy and good for our business. Refining customers equally, CapEx spending in line with what they’ve traditionally done and what they did last year. Chemicals is more of the same. So we don’t expect a recovery in the spend – OpEx spend by chemical customers. In calendar 2024 the fact is that the sort of soft patch that they are going through will probably extend through the full calendar year. And then utilities, look, utilities more and more CapEx is being targeted at global electrification and in that utilities. But part of that CapEx in global electrification is going into renewables, whether it’s solar and wind. But that renewable – that electricity produced from renewables has to be put into or connected into the grid. And therefore, utilities then have to spend to upgrade their systems, deal with the complexity of more and more renewable energy electricity into their networks. And this is one of the main drivers for them to have to spend to upgrade their systems. We’re very excited about what we were hearing from utilities. And look, it used to be a very sort of a steady-state industry 30, 40 years ago. Today it is an incredibly exciting industry. It’s an industry that absolutely will have to rely on technology to deal with the complexity of the grid to maintain the grid imbalance and in operation but also to cybersecurity. And our conversations not only about delivering our software to these customers, but also co-innovating and accelerating co-innovation because part of – one of the challenges that if you talk to utilities customers is they feel that there needs to be an acceleration of innovation for them to keep up with the complexity that they’re having to manage. So we’re very excited about this over the last 12, 18 months and especially the last six months of last calendar year, I traveled to main utility customers around the world. Not only am I excited about what I just mentioned, but also about the role that now new AspenTech with the DGM suite plays around global electrification and global infrastructure. AspenTech and the Monarch SCADA system in the DGM suite is responsible not only for managing, but keeping the electrical grid in balance for the entire country of India, for example, but also the entire country of Vietnam, but also for Southern California, the lights in Southern California are kept on through the use of our outsource technology and systems. 40% of utilities in the United States are using now the DGM products and solutions that AspenTech is key to them. But also we’ve made great progress moving into Europe. And now we’re going to be basically the foundation technology for multiple countries in Europe and certainly in the Netherlands, TenneT is a well-known installation that’s been going on for two, three years now. But we’ve also won business in two or three other countries where our technology is going to be the base technology to run the grid in those countries. And I won’t mention them because just recently signed agreements but equally, our expansion into Latin America, we run the largest transmission network in Latin America using our technology, the entire gas distribution network in Spain is run using the Monarch SCADA system in the DGM suite. And look, every time we win a deal we’re displacing the competition. we’re displacing industrial that have been in the market for many years, but now their solutions having kept up with the needs of the industry. And this is then where OSI and now AspenTech are stepping into the bridge and being very successful. So we’re very excited about what we’re seeing with DGM. I think this is a game-changing suite for us. And as I said, it’s not only the volume but also the size of deals. And I think that’s part of what gives us confidence about the success we’re going to have in Q3 and Q4.\nJason Celino: Okay, awesome. Good stuff on DGM. Maybe to follow-up on Matt’s earlier question, so apologies, but if we strip out that chemicals deal slipping and you think about the pipeline moving a little bit more back half weighted what area moved back if it was a specific vertical, or was it chemicals? Curious on how you would kind of characterize it.\nAntonio Pietri: Well, look, I don’t want to confirm or deny that deal that slipped, is a chemical deal. We haven’t said anything about what vertical it is in. But putting that aside, look, as we said, certainly, the MSC suite, what we’ll say is that deal certainly is a transaction that is all MSC software. So, that impacted the performance of the MSC suite in the first half of the year. Chemicals was a little flat. So, we do expect a stronger performance for MSC in the second half of the year. APM has continued to behave in the same manner that it has now for a couple of years. But we’re also excited about our performance in engineering because we do think that we’ll be able to make up if necessary, for any shortfall that we may see around MSC or APM. But our goal is to get certainly the MSC suite to plan and, if possible, also APM. And look, what we’re seeing with DGM and SSE is also exciting. So overall, we were confident there’s work to do here. We’re going to execute and we have two quarters to do at least 11.5%.\nJason Celino: Okay, great. Thank you, will get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Nay Soe Naing from Berenberg. Your line is now open.\nNay Soe Naing: Hi, everyone, thanks for taking my question. I actually have a few [indiscernible] if I may. Just on these developments…\nAntonio Pietri: Nay Soe, you are breaking up. You are not coming through. Operator, I think we lost Nay Soe.\nOperator: One moment please. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from Arsenije Matovic from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Arsenije.\nArsenije Matovic: Hi, this is Arsenije – hi Antonio how are you? This is Arsenije on for Josh. Thanks for taking my question. So seeing that this delayed renewal impacted about $5.4 million of ACV in the quarter, what gives you more confidence in the visibility to ramp in the second half? Was this idiosyncratic to the company up for renewal? Or could this maybe show more weakness in their respective end market then was initially expected for the second half of 2024. And then I have a brief follow-up on DGM. Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: No, look Arsenije, the specifics around these deals that didn’t renew have nothing to do with the macro environment or demand. It’s just some internal issues and administrative issues with this customer. We thought the deal was going to get renewed and it didn’t. So it will happen now in Q3. So nothing to do with demand at all. Look, what gives us confidence, we’ve said it. A pipeline, the strength that we’re seeing in DGM, SSE Engineering, a bigger sales organization that is now in place to convert that pipeline. So overall, those are the factors that we think will get us there.\nArsenije Matovic: Got it. Thanks for that. And then given the traction you’re seeing in DGM, is the 2.5 percentage point starting point for the contribution to ACV that you expected for growth conservative? Can that be a stronger contribution to growth? And then just very briefly on the renewal impact, what was the specific impact to free cash flow in the quarter from the renewal? Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Let me first address the question on DGM, and then I’ll have Chris talk about that impact, but if any. Look, 2.5 points is the goal. 2.5 points of growth contribution is the goal for DGM. Hopefully, we’ll exceed it, but we’ll keep that as the goal for the moment. The pipeline looks solid, but let’s see what we get to at the end of Q4.\nChris Stagno: Yes. And then as it relates to free cash flow, there was an impact as it related to that renewal being pushed out. It was the ACV amount that we quoted of about $5.4 million. We do expect that, like Antonio said, the deal will close in the third quarter, and then we’d collect that in the second half of the year.\nArsenije Matovic: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Clarke.\nClarke Jeffries: Hello, thank you for taking the question. Antonio, it sounds like the growth in the pipeline is broad-based, but I wanted to specifically ask around the sales capacity expansion and the sales capacity that seems to be coming online in the second half. Can you remind us, is that broad-based across the business? Is that weighted to DGM? Is that really the primary driver, even in first half, in terms of the pipeline growth? And any assumptions around close rates based off of that expansion of capacity coming on in the second half? Trying to understand if this is a particular product category or all rounds of business getting a capacity increase. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, as you would expect, certainly a significant portion of the sales investment went into DGM, the expansion of the sales organization in DGM into other regions, but also in North America. Expansion of the high velocity sales organization are small to medium sales team because we’re seeing accelerated growth in that team, so that team also benefited from an important expansion in the headcount. That team is pursuing mostly engineering business that comes through consulting, engineering consulting companies or companies that are first customers of AspenTech – first-time customers of AspenTech. This is a team that has obtained companies like Tesla, Meta, Google to be customers of AspenTech. So there’s a very active team and a team that has grown materially for us over the last two, three years. But also we added especially solution consultants in our Heritage AspenTech team as we focus also on driving more enterprise-type deals with our customers in that area, considering the critical mass of business that we already have with some of these customers, we believe there’s an opportunity there for us to do more with those customers. And a little bit of as we reorganize SSE into our head sales organization, we’ve also made a little bit of investments to the SSE team as well.\nClarke Jeffries: Perfect. And just one follow-up on that. At this point, I mean, imagine there’s a lag between the hiring and the actual capacity, the reps being ready. But are you at the point where you’re still on the upswing in terms of hiring ambitions or growing headcount? Or is this all about maturity of kind of previously hired individuals trying to understand if there’s further ramps coming even beyond fiscal 2024?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, I mean, look at the – we’re pretty much done with expansion in fiscal 2024, that, that this investment cycle started in Q4 of fiscal 2023, so last April, nine months ago, we’re done. Most of the sales headcount is in place. It’s been in place for a number of months. So this is why we expect to see – we’re seeing the benefit on the pipeline and we expect to see the benefit on the conversion. Now, having said that, now for fiscal 2025 coming up, we’ll look at what investments we need to make around expanding the DGM sales organization into other parts of the world and what other sort of tweak investments we have to make in other parts of the sales organization. But this was an important ramp up in headcount, and now we also want to see that additional headcount increase in productivity. So good investment, a little bit more investment in fiscal 2025 around DGM and a few other areas. And look, now that I talked about pipeline and conversion, there was a question just before about the conversion rate for our pipeline. Look, the – we tracked certainly the conversion rate for our pipeline quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, and we expect that the historical range of conversion that we’ve seen in order to deliver our goals is what we need to have in Q3, Q4 to achieve at least 11.5%. So we do – the team does a good job of tracking the performance against historical and as a forebearer of what’s going to come.\nClarke Jeffries: Really appreciate the color. Thank you very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. And I’m showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Antonio Pietri.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. Over the coming months, we will attend two investor conferences. In February, we’re going to attend the Wolfe Investor Conference, and in March, we will attend the KeyBanc Emerging Technology Summit. So please reach out to our Investor Relations team for more information on these two events, and we look forward to catching up with many of you soon. Thank you, everyone, for joining, and we will see you on the road. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 ending September 30, 2023. With me on the call today are Antonio Pietri, AspenTech’s President and CEO; and Chantelle Breithaupt, AspenTech’s CFO. Please note, we have posted an earnings presentation on our IR website and we ask that investors refer to this presentation in conjunction with today's call. Starting on Slide 2, I want to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today’s press release and in our annual report on Form 10-K and other subsequent filings made with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. During this presentation, we present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today’s earnings press release and investor presentation, both of which are available on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Antonio. Antonio?\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks, Brian, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Beginning on Slide 3, these are the four key takeaways for today's call. First, Q1 was a solid quarter, which once again delivered double digit ACV growth. We have hit the ground running to start the new fiscal year, shifting our focus from integration and transformation to execution and expansion. Second, demand remains strong in most end markets. More than ever, our products and solutions are mission critical and uniquely positioned to help customers meet their profitability and sustainability objectives. Third, we continue to see promising signs of growth across many different sustainability pathways that are expanding our market opportunity. We are highly encouraged about the potential to help new and existing customers achieve their sustainability objectives through partnership, collaboration and co-innovation in different use cases. And fourth, we remain confident in our ability to deliver against our guidance targets for the full fiscal year. Our ability to generate double digit ACV growth and expand free cash flow margins while also making strategic investments for growth is a great example of the scalability of our business model. Looking at our quarterly results in more detail, Annual Contract Value or ACV was $898 million, increasing 10.9% year-over-year and free cash flow was $16 million. As I stated last quarter, our cash flow is generally lowest in Q1 due to the seasonality of cash collections in our business. Turning to Slide 4, I will now provide an update on the dynamics we're seeing in our end markets, where demand remains strong excluding chemicals. In upstream and midstream energy, customers are experiencing favorable market conditions and healthy demand growth with recent acquisition announcements by U.S. oil majors demonstrating their confidence in the industry's long-term prospects. Strong demand combined with a persistently tight supply environment has led to higher oil prices and increased upstream CapEx investments, especially from national oil companies. CapEx investment is not only targeted at increasing oil supply, but also at sustaining existing production rates as the depletion rate of oil fields is a major area of focus. With the addition of the SEC suite, we can now offer an even more compelling lifecycle solution to manage and optimize the entire value chain. And we expect demand in these markets to remain positive for AspenTech going forward. In refining, while margins have fluctuated over the last three months, they remain strong as industry players benefit from a combination of increasing demand for fuels and capacity rationalization in Europe and North America. These same owner-operators remain focused on extending asset lifespans and reducing emissions through CapEx and OpEx investments, targeting improvements in operational efficiencies where digitalization plays a fundamental role. We remain well positioned to support refiners with their initiatives through our ability to drive higher efficiency and therefore improve sustainability. E&C customers are benefiting from positive CapEx trends in both traditional energy and energy transition projects driving higher pipeline and industry optimism. As we have mentioned in the past we believe that sustainability initiatives will ultimately support faster and less cyclical growth than we have seen historically in this end market. We're encouraged by the trends we see with the with the E&C customers and expect they will continue. The environment for chemicals remains consistent with the first half of this calendar year as industry players manage operating costs to support margins in response to weaker demand. While this is impacting our growth in the chemicals market, chemicals customers remain interested in AspenTech solutions to help drive efficiencies, reduce emissions and plastic waste and accelerate the development of the circular economy. This gives us confidence that we will deliver faster growth from this vertical as market conditions improve. Finally, demand in the power T&D industry remains robust as the industry benefits from an immense and ongoing investment cycle to expand, modernize and strengthen the grid. This is being driven by increasing consumer and industrial demand for electricity, rapid adoption of renewables and significant government funding. For example, the International Energy Agencies or IEA's most recent update to its net zero road map for 2050 predict that $680 billion in global annual grid investment is needed by 2030 to meet the expected increase in electricity demand. The IEA also predicted that nearly 70% of this investment will be used for distribution grids with the aim of expanding and strengthening and digitalizing networks, all of which were well prepared to help support through our DGM suite. We're bullish on the long-term growth potential of this market and it remains a key strategic area for investment going forward. Turning to Slide 5, I'd like to provide an update on our sales efforts as we kicked off the year. As I highlighted on Slide 3, we're making investments to increase sales capacity in both new and existing markets. We believe this investment combined with our Emerson commercial relationship will enable us to capitalize on the numerous growth opportunities we see across our business in the years ahead. We began this process in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and have made significant progress in these efforts since then. We expect to start benefiting from this additional capacity towards the end of fiscal 2024 and realize its full impact in fiscal 2025 and beyond. I'd now like to provide some additional color around software transactions closed in the quarter. Our customers continue to recognize the exceptional value and breadth of our innovation for their businesses, both to meet their needs today and their long-term development objectives. As a result, we have continued to win new business while also deepening our relationships with existing customers. The first customer reference is a world leader in industrial gases that is in the process of expanding from its traditional role in the production of industrial gases to become a leader in the production of green hydrogen. As part of this journey, this customer is using our software to design next generation process technology and estimate investment cost for green hydrogen, green ammonia and renewables. This customer doubled their engineering suite token entitlement as foundational technology for their ambitious growth objectives with plans to explore further standardization on our offerings going forward. The second customer is a leading refiner that decided to more than double their business with us citing its condition and the capabilities of our engineering suite and intention to explore additional use cases in alternative fuel development. This latest transaction built on our long-standing relationship with the customer and we're excited to continue partnering with them going forward. Third, for DGM we secured a large scale perpetual license transaction with a U.S. power utility. The utility was in search of a better way to manage its transmission network and recognizing the strength of our monarch platform chose us over the incumbent following a competitive process. This customer is interested in additional DGM Suite products and we plan to continue working with them to expand the relationship going forward. The fourth and final reference is from our collaboration with Emerson where we displaced an incumbent in the pulp and paper business of a leading global manufacturer. Emerson's existing relationship with this customer through its DeltaV install base provided valuable insights into its evaluation process and helped us identify that the value of our adaptive process control technology for more efficient and sustainable plant operations would be a key differentiator. We see room for expansion across this customer's asset base and remain confident in our ability to continue partnering with Emerson in pursuits going forward. Moving to Slide 6, I would like to provide an update on the sustainability opportunities we're seeing. The global mega trends of the energy transition and net zero targets continue to drive significant investment into the development of existing and novel technologies that can scale to achieve customers net zero ambitions. As a result, customers interest in our solution to support this type of sustainability projects is growing. This is manifested through ongoing CapEx spend, which drives increased interest and use in our engineering suite and represents most of our growth in this market today. These assets are still in their initial design phase. However, overtime we expect to see a benefit from sustainability related projects in our manufacture and supply chain and asset performance management suites as well, since we provide customer value across the entire asset life cycle from the basic design phase to asset operation and maintenance. The customer reference mentioned a moment ago around green hydrogen is an excellent example of these land-and-expand opportunities and we continue to see many other compelling projects in different areas of sustainability. We also won in the quarter several sustainability related opportunities through our high velocity sales team. These wins included companies still in their initial startup journeys and later stage companies that have advanced into the testing and development stages of a specific sustainability use cases. By leveraging our technology, these companies are developing solutions in areas such as carbon capture, plastics recycling, green hydrogen, renewable fuels and batteries. We're excited about the potential to help them scale up their digitalization initiatives going forward. Turning to Slide 7, I will now provide an update on our innovation initiatives. In Q1, we continued to drive innovation across our portfolio to help customers run their assets safer, greener, longer and faster, resulting in the planned release of enhancements to our current V14 software and a new V14.2 update later this month. These upgrades will include new machine learning and newer net capabilities across many of our products to enhance their hybrid modeling functionality. Expansion of our sustainability application library and product integration for Emerson Ovation power generation control system among other areas. We also remain focused on helping our partners reach their sustainability goals through co-innovation in the quarter. For example, we have completed the productization of the technology license from Aramco, Architect 3 to be released as Aspen's strategic planning for sustainability pathways. This product holds significant potential to help our customers make more informed decisions in their carbon management strategies and over time, it should also incorporate capabilities to help customers better navigate multiple other sustainability pathways. In its initial release the product will simultaneously consider economics, process design and operating constraints to help customers optimize their carbon management strategies. Additionally, as announced this afternoon, we're expanding our relationship with OMV Group, a multinational, integrated energy company based in Austria to accelerate the company's energy transition initiatives. As a first step in this partnership, we will focus on the renewable fuel optimization strategy by helping them better leverage their industrial data and develop a simplified integrated supply chain model across OMV's fuels and chemical supply chain. Now turning to Slide 8, I will discuss our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We remain confident in our ability to deliver ACV growth of at least 11.5% and free cash flow of at least $360 million. Industry demand for greater operational efficiency coupled with higher investment levels to support sustainability goals and energy transition initiatives is driving strong demand for our innovation. Macro trends remain consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year and we're closely monitoring the ongoing conflict in the Middle East for any potential impact on market dynamics which so far has been minimal. I would also like to give an update on the AspenTech team in Israel. Our priority has been the physical and mental safety of our team members there. We remain focused on these and we will continue to make sure we're doing all that we can to support our affected employees. We also want to extend our heartfelt condolences to all those directly and indirectly impacted by this event in Israel and throughout the region. Lastly, as announced a few weeks ago, Chantelle will be stepping down from her role here as CFO at the end of December. Chantelle has been a great partner to me and a leader for the organization. On behalf of the entire team here at AspenTech, I'd like to thank her for her many contributions and wish here all the best in the next chapter of her career. We have full confidence in Chris Stagno, SVP and Chief Accounting Officer to step into the interim CFO role after Chantelle's departure should we need additional time to complete our search for a permanent CFO. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Chantelle for a discussion of our Q1 financial results. Chantelle?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you for the kind words, Antonio. It has been a privilege to serve as CFO for the past two and a half years at AspenTech. I am highly appreciative of your leadership, vision and commitment to the company. I am proud of what we have accomplished and I'm very confident in AspenTech's ability to continue delivering strong top and bottom line growth going forward. I remain committed to working with Antonio, Chris and the entire team to ensure a successful transition. Turning to our Q1 performance, I'd like to start out by highlighting that our earnings presentation includes explanations regarding the impact of ASC Topic 606 on our financial results. We have also included definitions of Annual Contract Value or ACV, bookings and free cash flow among other metrics in our earnings presentation now available on our IR website. We ask that investors refer to these definitions together with today's call. Starting on Slide 9, annual contract value was $898 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, up 10.9% year-over-year and 1.4% quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, Q1 typically sees the lowest number of transactions closed given our historical sales cadence. In addition, ACV performance in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 included one-time transformation and integration benefits from SSE and our acquisition of Inmation, which together represented approximately $10 million of net new ACV or 1.3 points of sequential growth in Q1 of fiscal 2023. Total bookings were $212 million in the first quarter, decreasing 5.4% year-over-year. As a reminder, bookings are impacted by the timing of renewals, which were down year-over-year, consistent with expectations. We expect $131 million in bookings up for renewal in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue was $249 million for the first quarter, which was approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. Please note that revenue in our model is heavily impacted by contract renewal timing and variability under ASC topic 606. Now turning to profitability, on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes the impact of stock based compensation expense, amortization of intangibles and acquisition and integration planning related fees, we reported operating income of $78 million in Q1 representing a 31% non-GAAP operating margin compared to a non-GAAP operating income of $93 million for a 37% non-GAAP operating margin a year ago. As a reminder, margins will fluctuate period-to-period due to the timing of customer renewals and the resulting impact on license revenue recognition in a given quarter. Additionally, on expenses, please note that the increase was driven by increased headcount and compensation costs in line with Antonio's commentary around our expansion initiatives in fiscal 2024. This increase in expenses was expected and is consistent with our fiscal year 2024 guidance. Non-GAAP net income was $75 million in the quarter or $1.16 per share compared to non-GAAP net income of $142 million or $2.20 per share a year ago. Please note that the difference in non-GAAP net income between periods was mainly due to a lower benefit from income taxes in the first quarter compared to a year ago, driven by the change in our approach to computing our tax provision which originally occurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $121 million of cash and cash equivalents, reflecting the impact of share repurchase under our $300 million share repurchase program. In addition, we had $198 million available on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 580,000 shares for $114 million under our $300 million share repurchase authorization announced in fiscal year 2024. We also settled our $100 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter to receive an additional 107,000 shares. Please note that the $100 million ASR program was paid for in full in fiscal 2023. For cash flow, we generated $17 million of cash from operations and $16 million of free cash flow in the quarter compared to $5 million in cash from operations and $4 million in free cash flow a year ago. As Antonio noted, this was in line with our expectations as Q1 has historically been our lowest cash flow quarter due to the amount of cash available for collection in the period. Turning to Slide 10, I would now like to close with guidance. For the full year of fiscal 2024 we are reiterating our outlook across all metrics. This includes at least 11.5% of ACV growth and a free cash flow target of at least $360 million for the period. We continue to expect total bookings of at least $1.04 billion with $580 million of bookings up for renewal in fiscal 2024. Our non-GAAP EPS range has increased by $0.06 [ph] from our prior guide to reflect the impact of our share repurchase activity in the first quarter on shares outstanding. There is no impact to GAAP EPS. For a complete overview of our fiscal 2024 guidance, please refer to our earnings press release and presentation available on our IR website. As investors think about linearity for the remainder of the year, we continue to expect a cadence consistent with our historical performance. This includes fiscal 2023 when adjusting for the one-time contributions from SSE Inmation in Q1 that I discussed earlier. We expect to generate net new ACV in the low 60% range in the second half of fiscal 2024. In addition, we expect that we will begin to see the impact from our sales investments in the second half of fiscal 2024 consistent with the assumptions we provided around our fiscal year 2024 guidance on our last quarterly earnings call. Please refer to Slide 13 of our earnings presentation for a detailed overview of our linearity expectations. To wrap up, we delivered a solid start to fiscal year 2024. We remain on track to meet our full year targets while also strategically investing in different areas that are supportive of our long-term growth objectives. We believe AspenTech is in a great position to benefit from many of the largest and most important investment trends impacting asset intensive industries today, which should support our ability to generate attractive levels of growth and profitability for the foreseeable future. With that, I will turn it back over to Antonio for closing comments.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, Chantelle. Q1 was a solid quarter where we once again delivered double digit ACV growth. Following our initial foundation building year, we have shifted focus to execution and expansion in fiscal year 2024. We're investing in areas that can drive our growth while also managing our expenses for a return to best-in-class profitability overtime. We're pleased to report that demand remains resilient for our mission critical solutions across most end markets. We also continue to see encouraging signs of growth in different areas of sustainability as I have touched on today. Our team is clearly energized to continue helping our customers with their sustainability initiatives going forward and we remain confident in our fiscal year 2024 guidance targets. With that, we will open it up for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Matthew Pfau with William Blair. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Matt.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Hi, Matt.\nMatthew Pfau: Hey, Antonio and Chantelle. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask on some of the momentum you're seeing with sustainability, CapEx and investments. Is there any way to size how much new business is being driven by these initiatives and how does that compare to perhaps a year ago?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, Matt. Let me address that and then Chantelle can add her thoughts as well. So we have an initiative internally to certainly first of all size the opportunity, the total addressable market that we believe will come to us from sustainability, CapEx investments and eventually OpEx as well as these plans are built, our manufacturing supply chain and APM solutions will play a role in all of that. Now in in the near-term what we're seeing is opportunities in sustainability and different use cases flowing through our inside sales organization, our high velocity sales organization and the benefit that we're seeing is from CapEx investments and the initial front end engineering design for those assets. We're also seeing a little bit of MSC opportunities for customers that already have facilities that that that are running. Our advanced control technology again seems to be a target for some of these customers. But in general we do have a sense today for the amount of business that sustainability is generating and this is the reason for the investments that we're targeting in our high velocity sales organization which are specifically to really position us better to capture that opportunity in that market and eventually over the -- throughout the broader market that we have.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think the only thing I would add Antonio to your point is yes, definitely in specifics Matt, such as the high velocity sales that Antonio referred to, those are specific measures and that a more macro level for us, the engineering suites where we look first and then that eventually falls into MSC as we build out land-and-expand. And our engineering suite saw the strongest growth it has out of 13 quarters. Last quarter we said engineering was the strongest out of 12. This is even stronger and up 13. So that's where we see it at a macro sweet level. And then Antonio had some specifics there that that kind of bolster it together.\nMatthew Pfau: Great, very helpful. And then I wanted to just perhaps get an update on how you're thinking about acquisitions now that it seems like the Emerson integration is going well and also the Micromine acquisition has gone away?\nAntonio Pietri: Go ahead Chantelle.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes, we're still committed to M&A in the sense of it's still a part of what we're looking for and focused on. I think that we have everything from tuck-in to larger pieces from that perspective Matt. We've remain committed to pursuing them as primary use of our capital and I think that we're waiting to see, we can't always time the market but we have, we definitely have a list of things from tuck-ins to larger that we're looking at. So it's still a good part of our capital allocation strategy.\nMatthew Pfau: Great. I appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you.\nAntonio Pietri: Thanks.\nOperator: Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Rob.\nRob Oliver: Hi, Antonio. Hi, Chantalle. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I had two. One, I was wondering if you could provide an update for us that you guys obviously got through a big period of last fiscal year in the SSE business with the contract timings and now you're moving into that conversion from legacy perpetual to term and I know that is expected to be a contributor to ACV growth this year. So I know we're only one quarter in, but just wanted to see if I can get an update on how that is progressing so far? And then I had a quick followup.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, let me take that. So look, the way the year flowed last year with SSE, certainly an important transformation benefit in the Q1 fiscal 2023 quarter as we cleaned up distances and we aligned the recognition of the spend in those contracts to our ACV policy. A lot of the renewals happened in the Q3 fiscal 2023 quarter. So we expect the Q3 fiscal 2024 quarter to be a big quarter for SSE and a quarter where we've been -- we hope to see the results from our focus on growing and expanding the SSE business. Of course, the growth is what will have an impact on ACV, but we're also targeting to expand the term length, which would have a benefit on the revenue side of the equation. But look, we're excited about SSE, especially with national oil companies we're seeing a lot of investment, CapEx investment flowing for oil and gas. And it's not only, as I said on the call, it's not only to increase production, but to replace a production that is naturally lost as oilfields deplete. And then is the use of SSE around carbon capture sequestration, also geothermal energies, we are engaged with a couple of customers as well starting the possibility using SSE to also store hydrogen in the subsurface as a storage resource. So we're optimistic about SSE and the potential that we see. But all the work that we're doing right now, we expect to see it in the Q3 and Q4 quarters as we focus on most of the renewals that we have for SSE.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. And I think that the other -- one other thing I would add too is that from a model perspective, Rob, we're seeing, we're pleased with the initial kind of conversations on tokenization. So you mentioned perp to term, and then SSE is now doing term to token, and we're pleased with how that tokenization conversations are going. That's the only thing I would add as well as far as progressing the transformation agenda.\nRob Oliver: Great, helpful. That's really helpful color from both. Thank you. And then Antonio, just one followup for you. I appreciated your comments, not seeing any impact from what's going on in the Middle East. And I know last quarter you had made some comments relative to China and Russia and I think Russia, you guys kind of moved to renewals only and China was slow. I just would be curious to hear an update on those two geographies from you. Thank you very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, on Russia, as you said, last quarter, we announced that we're going to move to a renewals-only business, and that is the case. And we're working renewals, some renewals already happened in Q1 and will continue to happen. And look, we also continue to monitor sanctions there just to make sure that we comply with any requirements from the U.S. government. On China, look, China is interesting in that our business continues to grow in China. Certainly, the Chinese government is driving an emphasis on local sourcing for technologies, meaning by local companies, Chinese companies. But we also see Chinese customers continue to buy our technology, which I believe speaks to the innovation and differentiation that still exists between what we do and our products and any native locally developed capabilities in the country there. So...\nRob Oliver: I appreciate that. Thank you very much.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from David Ridley-Lane with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Hi, this is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin. I was kind of wondering a little bit more about the competitive displacement you had at that DeltaV customer. Is there understood that you're sort of saying expect the ACV contributions from the Emerson channel to ramp more in the back half? But is there a way of helping put sort of the number of Emerson-driven opportunities that are in the pipeline today? In context, how is that versus a year ago? Just help us an investors better understand how that opportunity is building?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, sure. I mean, look, let me first say that a lot of work and a lot of goodness happened in fiscal 2023. We -- what I would say is, we synchronized the two organizations on what was possible, considering the trajectories of the two companies in their own markets. We now in fiscal 2024 expect to start seeing some of that benefit, and the reference that you mentioned is an example. What excites me and excites all of us is the huge installed base of systems that Emerson has in the market, not only in our core market, but in other markets, as you saw. That was a pulp and paper reference, which is typically not a market that AspenTech pursuits. So a huge installed base of DeltaV systems, huge installed base of Asian systems in power. Huge installed base of maintenance systems, Emerson maintenance technology capabilities that we believe are also opportunities for our asset performance management solution and especially the Mtell solution. The AspenTech organization now has access to all that installed base. It's engaged with the Emerson sales organization and the different account teams. And from a standpoint of estimating the opportunity, you need to look at the Emerson installed base and then you would have to determine what is the possibility there for AspenTech. But we also know that customers are very excited about what's possible between AspenTech and Emerson. And this is something that we'll be talking about during our global conference coming up at the end of April next year. So more to come, but it's about their installed base and then how AspenTech can be accelerated into that installed base.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. And then were there any sort of meaningful levels of digital grid management perpetual license bookings this quarter? And just an update on the pipeline, how the customer receptivity is for term license proposals that you're putting across the table?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, the fact is that we -- we exceeded our expectations for the quarter around perpetual licenses for DGM. That continues to be a play for us. This is a transition that will happen over many years. Some customers are more willing to go to term than others. But what I want to emphasize is that certainly, a perpetual license contributes to revenue, contributes to upfront free cash flow, but it also generates GACV from the maintenance support that is in those agreements. And that's normally somewhere around 19% of the licenses, the perpetual licenses. So while, of course, eventually, we will prefer to have all that business be term, there is an important benefit from perpetual licenses that is reflected in the growth expectations for DGM in the year. But look, our pipeline is supporting both perpetual licenses and term. What I'll say about term, it's a new licensing model for customers. There's – like it happened with HAT, it was the beginning in 2009, 14 years ago. Customers have to get familiar with the model, have to get familiar with the terms and conditions. And therefore, that aspect of the negotiations takes a little longer. We saw good business in the quarter, and we have good engagement around term deals as well. So look, this is a transition that will happen over many years, but good benefits overall.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you. And if I could squeeze one more in. So if I understood your sustainability comments around the high velocity sales force, you're starting to sign up engineering and construction firms for incremental tokens around these projects today, and you expect that to build as you go through the year?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. We find EPCs to be very bullish about the -- how sustainability CapEx is flowing to them. And therefore, it's driving more use of tokens. One of the customer references that we talked about, while that customer is not an EPC, they've made a very strategic decision to focus on growing green hydrogen. And they doubled their entitlement with AspenTech. This is a seven-figure doubling of entitlement. So that benefit is absolutely now flowing through our growth, and we expect it to continue to be more and more so going forward.\nDavid Ridley-Lane: Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jason Celino with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Jason.\nDevin Au: Hey Antonio, hey Chantelle, it's actually Devin on for Jason tonight. Thanks for taking our questions. Just want to start off, I just want to get a little more detail on the ACV growth and in the quarter. I mean it decelerated a little bit on a year-over-year basis. And when I look at kind of the balance of the year, I think you mentioned expecting SSE to have a pretty big second half. But any other commentary you can share on just what's giving you the confidence that ACV growth is really going to accelerate in the back half year?\nAntonio Pietri: Okay. Go ahead, Chantelle and I'll help you.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think to the point I've add any additional color, when you take the current -- the Q1 period year-over-year, if you look at -- if you remove the onetime benefits of the SSE commercial transformation and Inmation, we actually had a 1% growth in Q1 last year versus the 1.4%. So if you look at organic growth, it's actually expansion of 1% to 1.4%, which I think is really critical from a run the business operational perspective and we're pleased with that underlying growth. If you look at the remainder of the year, there are several things we're confident in, and I'm sure Antonio will add some color. But everything from the SSE terminals in Q3, the sales productivity ramping that we talked about, the investment in Q4 last year, Q1 this year. The benefit of the DGM pipeline growing in the sense of both the pipeline term and aftermarket sales and then traditionally HAT has had stronger linearity in the second half. So we see quite a few factors. And Antonio, if you want to add any color to those five things?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. I mean, Chantelle is right. Look -- we're excited. I'm very excited about what's happening here. Of course, there's a lot of foundation building and now expansion because, in a way, AspenTech accelerated from $700 million to $1.1 billion in revenue and the related ACV overnight. So now it's expansion. If you look at Q1, as Chantelle said, look, in Q1 2023, there were benefits from transformation of SSE, significant benefits and then the Inmation inorganic benefit. On an apples-to-apples basis, it's a 40% improvement in the performance in the Q1 quarter versus last year. But look, what excites me is, okay, we're starting to see the flow of sustainability benefit through our high velocity sales organization. But if you go to Europe, for example, our installed base of customers there are incredibly focused on sustainability. Today, we announced that press release related to our partnership with OMV in Austria and where they're doing around biofuels and synthetic fuels, but – but you also have many other customers working on this type of use cases. So they will believe also – there will be an important benefit to have, not only in engineering, but MSC as well, and I believe also in APM. SSE, significant sustainability benefits. If you look at DGM and as I travel around the world, and I have over the last 18 months, talking to DGM customers, the opportunity is incredible. Look, we manage our technology, manages the largest transportation grid in Latin America. We -- our technology is responsible for managing the entire gas distribution network of Spain. The entire India grid is managed by the Monarch technology, the entire India grid. This is the largest synchronous electrical network in the world in one country. And the opportunity in India, as I meet with customers and the successes that we've had over the last 12 months in Europe around transportation, but also distribution, the 40%-plus market share that we have for DGM in North America as well. And we're only getting started outside of North America. We're doubling our sales organization in the field outside of North America to pursue opportunities, and that will continue to happen in future years as well. And the expansion of HVS [ph] is about sustainability. So as we look at all the macro indicators, the quality of the technology that we have and the opportunity and the CapEx that are starting to flow around global electrification and sustainability is very exciting. So the point that Chantelle made, look, this is a year is 12 months and four quarters. We just completed our first quarter, and now we're excited about Q2, Q3 and Q4.\nDevin Au: Got it. Got it. I really appreciate the clarity here. Just one quick followup. I think last quarter, you also mentioned seeing some good cross-sell interest from your chemicals and refining customers and looking into some of the microgrid management capabilities. I'm just kind of curious if those cross-sell interest crystallized in the quarter or showing up more in the pipeline in the near term here? Thanks.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Yes. No, look, it will -- it is showing up in the pipeline and it will be down the road because the conversation started to happen really in the last six months to nine months around microgrids. I had a meeting with a customer in India last week that has been a customer of HAT for 30 years. And when they found out that our capabilities around microgrids, but more -- I think more importantly, the fact that we are now -- our technology is responsible for maintaining the India electrical grid imbalance. And in operations, I mean, our technology keeps the lights on in India. It was very exciting for that customer also the fact that we actually managed to transmit the distribution of electricity in some of the major cities in India. And therefore, that gives credence gives credibility to them, the capabilities that we can bring to bear around their own microgrids and their own utilities as they start incorporating renewables, as they start generating power from renewables because this customer is making a huge investment in solar power as well, even though there historically been chemical -- so petrochemical company. So this is also going to be an opportunity. But again, customers are only starting to learn about all of these, and those opportunities will be in the pipeline down the road.\nDevin Au: Great. That's great to hear. Thanks for taking my question.\nAntonio Pietri: Yes, you're welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Josh Tilton with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. \nAntonio Pietri: Hi Josh.\nArsenije Matovic: Hi, Antonio, hi Chantelle. This is Arsenije on for Josh. Thanks for taking my question. Looking at seasonality, you reiterated with the 60% range of net new ACV in second half, that implies a significant step up in 2Q. Can you elaborate on what provides confidence in that outlook, especially as a higher concentration of attrition as expected? Because I think it would be the largest 2Q quarterly net new ACV step-up and the second largest quarterly increase ever realized. And then just a brief followup. Thanks. \nAntonio Pietri: All right. Well, look, I think Chantelle reiterated some of the reasons why we think not only Q2 and by the way, yes, I know we talked about the linearity of the year and what it means for Q2, but there's also Q3 and Q4 here. Look, I think more immediately, it is starting to see the impact from the hiring, the incremental headcount that we've been putting into sales since the beginning of Q4. We made also significant progress in that area in Q1. And then our pipeline of business, this is something that is -- our pipeline is continuing to grow across all three sort of historical businesses, HAT, OSI and SSE. And then okay, Q3, we've talked about the SEC renewals and in general. But look, historically, Q2 is the end of a fiscal year for most of our customers in HAT, also customers in SSE, DGM. Frankly, we haven't seen any seasonality to DGM because of the way those opportunities flow, mostly RFPs in the initial projects and then aftermarket sales and by the way, something that I want to say about the DGM business. The sales cycle for new customers in DGM is very long. We talked about it, 12, 24 months. But there's a business, once you're installed, that is much more accelerated. The name of that sales team inside AspenTech is aftermarket. I'm sure we'll change that name at some point. But that business is a shorter sales cycle business, is add-on once you're installed is adding new applications or new capabilities to what's already installed. And that's an area we're significantly increasing headcount. Sales cycle there, it can even be three months, but more normally six to 12 months. So this is an area where we see the opportunity to accelerate growth because of the cyclicality and then the focus on the incremental headcount that we're seeing there. And we expect to see some of that benefit in Q2 as well. But I don't – linearity is important, of course, because you have to be building the business in the year to eventually deliver a final outcome. But we still have three quarters. And Q2 is an important one, but Q3 and Q4 are also very important.\nArsenije Matovic: Got it. Thanks for that. And on DGM, you mentioned strength in perpetual license. Also, I think last year, because it was still bundled, you mentioned there would have been $16.9 million in DGM ACV in fiscal 2023 Q1. When I'm thinking about kind of the strength in the perpetual license this quarter, could you provide color into how strong DGM ACV was this quarter, assuming that there was probably some perpetual SMS tailwind, given that strength of perpetual license? Thank you. \nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, I mean, normally, we don't like to disclose outcomes in quarters because quarter performance can be given by many reasons. We had a solid quarter in some areas of DGM, and we're tracking in other areas. We still believe that we'll meet or exceed our number for the fiscal year for DGM, and that's what we're focused on. But the business continues to be very successful. And as I said, from my interactions with customers, I think this is a business that as we expand globally through headcount and engagement with customers, engagement with our own historical customers in HAT, this is going to be very exciting and interesting.\nArsenije Matovic: Thank you, Antonio.\nAntonio Pietri: Yep, you’re welcome.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Mark Schappel with Loop Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAntonio Pietri: Hi, Mark.\nMark Schappel: Hi Antonio, hi Chantelle. Antonio, I want to turn to your chemical business. I wonder if you could just talk or speak to the parts of the overall chemical market that you're seeing and the most pressure, like say, bulk chemicals, ag chemicals, specialty chemicals. And then also maybe if you could also address what you're hearing from your chemical customers with respect to the potential likelihood of their businesses snapping back next year?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Look, I do think if you listen to the earnings calls from chemical customers over the last couple of weeks, two, three weeks, there's a little bit of a more positive narrative from these customers. If I think back over the last 12 months, there's no doubt that Aspen Chem [ph] remain sort of a positive area for chemical customers, bulk chemicals, less so. And that's where I think a lot of the herd was, depending on the region. It was destocking or demand. In Europe, it had to do with cost and the implications of the Russia-Ukraine war and so on. Now what we're starting to see and hear from customers is improving demand, sort of the – the green shoots of improving demand around bulk chemicals. I think spec chem has continued to remain solid. And they've also differentiated between their commitment and ability to again sustain their CapEx investments even through this down cycle because that's a longer-term investment versus OpEx. And that's what we benefit from. So I know that's been a question for investors between Emerson and AspenTech. I believe Emerson benefits tremendously from CapEx. We benefit from OpEx. Now we're here in budgeting season and I'm not so sure that the outlook for these chemical companies will change dramatically. Therefore, their budgets might be equally subdued for next calendar year, their next fiscal year. But we'll see. But clearly, there's -- you're starting to hear a little bit of more positive remarks around their macro demand environment than we've heard over the last six, nine months.\nMark Schappel: That's helpful. Thank you. And then Chantelle, real quick. Last quarter, I think it was noted that there were a few customers, particularly in Latin America and Asia that were just taking a little bit longer to pay. And I was just wondering if it's fair to assume, based on the good cash flow print this quarter, whether that trend has kind of corrected itself this quarter?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I think that we've seen the amount we expected to see in Q1. If you remember, I said it would kind of come in over a few quarters, and the Q1 met what we expected from the Q4 from those countries that paid late. So I think it was absolutely in line, and we're definitely pleased with our Q1 free cash flow performance.\nMark Schappel: Thank you. Great.\nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Nay Soe Naing with Berenberg. Your line is open. \nNay Soe Naing: Hi both, hi thank you for taking the questions. I've got two, if I may. If I could start with the strategic investments that you mentioned, please. I was wondering if you could share a bit more color on which parts of the business that you're investing into? And also the high-velocity sales force, are there any particular opportunities that the sales organization is pursuing? And then my second question is on the divisional or segmental performance of the business. I think if I heard you correctly, I think you mentioned the engineering was -- had a really strong quarter, up about 13% year-on-year, so wondering if I could get some high-level segmental update for the rest of the business, please. Thank you. \nAntonio Pietri: Go ahead Chantelle, do you want to lever?\nChantelle Breithaupt: Yes. I just didn't want it. So I think from an investment perspective, we're pleased with a few very specific areas of investment. The first one you mentioned is the high velocity sales, and there, as we ramp that headcount through the year, we're very much seeing those kind of new logos that we mentioned, some of the start-ups, new ventures, which are very exciting for us as new growth. And the land and expand opportunities for some of the other plays that we're seeing, so definitely high velocity sales for those two factors. The other investment area that we continue to ever since Q4 is the DGM business, mostly rest of world with an intent on Europe. So we're pleased on the sense of the investments we've made for sales going into Europe and the team that's been built out there and continues to work with closed pipelines. And then the third investment that's related to sales is setting up the services ecosystem for DGM. And so that's related to sales, to delivering the sales, and those are the three specific ones. And we're pleased with the growth we can get with those things being enabled. I think from a segment perspective, if I understood your question correctly, so we commented that this quarter was the highest growth for engineering over the last 13, not specifically given the amount that you quoted. But generally, the concept there is we're very pleased with the engineering growth. We don't usually disclose segments on a quarterly basis, but Antonio, maybe you could provide some anecdotal commentary?\nAntonio Pietri: Yes. Well, I mean, look, I'll just stay at a high level. But certainly, significant increasing headcount is going into DGM, both field sales as we expand internationally into Europe. But we're also adding some head count in other parts as well, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia. Aftermarket sales, which in a way, it's mostly an inside sales organization as well for DGM. We're making a significant investment in that area. Look, we're increasing the number of enterprise sales consultants for HAT because we believe there's a bigger opportunity that will start flowing through for HAT as a result of also sustainability and the combination of sustainability use cases with our traditional technology. And then a material increase in the overall number of headcount in the company. And it takes a while to make all these people productive, but that's also something that we focused on, the sales enablement and how do we accelerate that. And as a matter of fact, I'll also say that we've learned from Emerson since they have a much bigger sales organization, how they've scaled sales enablement. And that's sort of a best practice that we've been able to take from our relationship with Emerson. So I'm very encouraged, and it's an exciting time in AspenTech at the moment.\nNay Soe Naing: Understood. Thank you very much both. \nChantelle Breithaupt: Thank you. \nOperator: I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Antonio for closing remarks.\nAntonio Pietri: Thank you, operator. Look, I'd like to highlight here to close. Again, we believe in our ability to deliver on our guidance for the year, our ability to grow double-digit ACV growth and at least 11.5%. We're very encouraged by the macro indicators in – across most of our industries. And as I said, chemicals looks like it's improving the macro demand for bulk chemical producers. So that's good. As I travel around the world to talk to DGM customers or SSE customers, I just marvel at how now relevant Aspen technologies is for global electrification and the role we are playing, and we will be increasingly playing in that area. I think sustainability is real. Certainly, some regions of the world are making bigger investments at this moment than others. But overall, the sustainability CapEx is starting to flow. And eventually, there will be OpEx with that, which will benefit our business, our MSC, APM suites. And then overall, look, very confident. There's a lot of work happening here. Now it's about execution and expansion. And then focusing in the remaining time that we have in the fiscal year to exceed your expectations. So with that, I want to thank you all, and look forward to talking at some point in the future.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
