At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Brian Johnson, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Business Development. Please go ahead, sir. \nBrian Johnson : Good morning, and thank you for joining us to discuss the results from our third quarter ended January 31, 2024.

With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Darren to discuss our third quarter results. Darren. \nDarren Rebelez : Thanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. We're thrilled to discuss third quarter as it once again demonstrated the strength of the Casey’s team and the resilience of our business model. Now, let's review the results.  Diluted EPS finished at $2.33 per share, 13% decrease from the prior year. The company generated $87 million in net income, a decrease of 13% and $218 million in EBITDA, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. As we mentioned in last quarter's call and the press release, all of these metrics were comparing against the prior year and included a one-time operating expense reduction due to the resolution of a legal matter. This resolution benefited the prior year by approximately $15 million or $0.31 per share.  I'm proud of our team members for producing solid third quarter results. As the team navigated a less favorable fuel cost environment than in the past year, as well as challenging weather in most of our footprint in January.  I'd now like to go over our results and share some of the details in each of the categories. Inside, same source sales were up 4.1% for the third quarter or 9.9% on a two-year stack basis, with an average margin of 41.3%. Same store prepared food and dispensed beverage was particularly strong, and sales were up 7.5% or 12.9% on a two-year stack basis, with an average margin of 59.6%, up approximately 230 basis points from the prior year. Whole pies performed well in the quarter, but we also saw strong performance with hot sandwiches and dispensed beverages.  Margin was favorably impacted by softening commodity costs, notably cheese, as well as modest menu pricing adjustments during the quarter. Prepared food continues to be a key differentiator for Casey's, and I'm very pleased with the sales growth in March.  Same store grocery and general merchandise sales were up 2.8% or 8.8% on a two-year stack basis, with an average margin of 33.9%, a decrease of approximately 10 basis points from the prior year. We saw positive momentum in the category, notably in both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, and our private label program continues to be a great value option for our guests, with Casey's chips and bottled water performing well in the quarter.  For fuel, same store gallons sold were nearly flat, with a fuel margin of 37.3 cents per gallon. This marked the 11th consecutive quarter, with fuel margins above 34.5 cents per gallon. Our volume continues to outperform our geographic market as well, as OPIS Fuel Gallon Sold data shows the mid-continent region down approximately 5% in the quarter. Our fuel team is doing an exceptional job balancing volume growth and margin, and the results continue to show it.  Operating expenses were up 10.3% versus the prior year, but only 2.5% on the same store excluding credit card fee basis. Our team continues to get more and more efficient operating stores, while at the same time integrating multiple acquisitions. This is a testament to the outstanding work and maturity of our integration team.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve to discuss financial results from the third quarter. Steve? \nSteve Bramlage : Thank you, Darren, and good morning. I'd also like to thank the team for their great work during the quarter. Our results were solid, especially inside the store, where we continue to grow sales and expand margin. This was accomplished during a quarter of heavy integration that required stores across our footprint. Overall, this was another quarter of effective operational execution in what is shaping up to be a great fiscal 2024.  Total revenue for the quarter was $3.3 billion, a decrease of $3 million or 0.1% from the prior year, due primarily to the lower retail price of fuel. Total inside sales for the quarter were $1.2 billion, an increase of $106 million or 9.5% from the prior year.  For the quarter, prepared food and dispensed beverage sales rose by $36 million to $349 million, an increase of 11.4%. Grocery and general merchandise sales increased by $70 million to $866 million, an increase of 8.8%. Results were also favorably impacted by operating approximately 7% more stores on a year-over-year basis.  Retail fuel sales were down $106 million in the third quarter, as an 11% decline in the average retail price of fuel was partially offset by a 6.9% increase in fuel gallons sold. The average retail price of fuel during this period was $2.98 a gallon compared to $3.34 a gallon a year ago.  We define gross profit as revenue less cost of goods sold, but excluding depreciation and amortization. Casey’s had gross profit of $787 million in the third quarter, an increase of $49 million or 6.7% from the prior year. This is primarily driven by higher inside gross profit of $50.9 million or 11.3%, offset by lower fuel gross profit of $5.3 million or 2%. Inside gross profit margin was 41.3% and that's up 70 basis points from a year ago.  Prepared food and dispensed beverage margin was 59.6%, up 230 basis points from prior year. The category margin benefited from lower commodity costs, specifically cheese, which was $2.06 per pound for the quarter compared to $2.30 per pound last year, a decrease of 10% or approximately 80 basis points.  Margin also benefited from a lower LIFO charge than in the prior year as our broader input costs softened, benefiting margin by over 40 basis points. Modest menu pricing adjustments also helped.  The grocery and general merchandise margin was 33.9%, a decrease of 10 basis points from the prior year. The change was primarily due to lapping favorable vendor-funded promotions in the prior year, partially offset by lower LIFO charge and private label continuing to increase its share of our mix.  Fuel margin for the quarter was 37.3 cents per gallon. That's down 3.4 cents per gallon from the prior year. Fuel gross profit benefited by $3.4 million from the sale of RINs, and that's up $0.5 million from the same quarter in the prior year.  Total operating expenses were up 10.3% or $53.2 million in the third quarter. Approximately 3% of the increase is due to lapping a one-time benefit to operating expense last year from the resolution of a $15 million legal matter. Approximately 6% of the total operating expense increase is due to unit growth and integration spending as we operated 167 more stores than the prior year.  Same store employee expense accounted for approximately 1% of the increase, as modest increases in wage rates were partially offset by the reduction in same store hours. Depreciation in the quarter was $89 million. That's up $10.9 million versus the prior year, and that's primarily due to operating more stores. Net interest expense was $14.1 million in the quarter. That's up $2.4 million versus the prior year, primarily due to less interest income as we funded several acquisitions in the quarter out of cash-on-hand. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.1% consistent with the prior year.  Net income was down versus the prior year at $86.9 million, a decrease of 13.2%. EBITDA for the quarter was $217.6 million compared to $221.7 million a year ago, that's a decrease of 1.9%.  Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition, and we have significant financial flexibility. On January 31, we had total available liquidity of $1.1 billion. Furthermore, we have no significant maturities coming due until our fiscal 2026. Our leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our senior notes, is 1.6 times.  The third quarter tends to be our seasonal trough for cash flow generation. For that quarter, net cash generated by operating activities of $123 million, less purchases of property, plant and equipment of $150 million, resulted in the company using $27 million in free cash flows, and that compares to a generation of $27 million in the prior year.  At the March meeting, the Board of Directors voted to maintain the quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $30 million of stock, and we have $310 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization.  Investing in EBITDA and ROIC accretive growth investments remains our primary capital allocation priority, but currently given our low leverage levels and strong cash flow, we are repurchasing more shares than in the past.  We have had an excellent unit growth year so far, especially with M&A. During the third quarter we closed on a transaction to enter our 17th state in Texas, and through the end of the quarter, we have built or acquired over 125 stores.  As we prepare to finish fiscal year ‘24, we are reaffirming all of our fiscal year guidance as outlined in the third quarter press release. And before we get into our fourth quarter experience to-date, just a reminder that February had an extra day due to the leap year, and that will equate to an approximate 100 basis point increase to both same store results and total OpEx for the fourth quarter.  Our results for February, excluding the impact of the leap day, were as follows: Inside same store sales are near the top end of our annual outlook range. Fuel gallons were near the low end of the annual outlook range. CPG was a touch below the mid 30s. Please note that February tends to be seasonally low in terms of fuel profitability, and that this February's result is a couple of cents per gallon higher than the same period last year. Current cheese costs are modestly favorable versus the prior year.  And one last comment on total operating expenses. We expect to finish the year at the high end of our annual outlook range, and that will be driven by some discretionary fourth quarter year-end charitable contributions, as well as incremental incentive compensation expense due to the company's strong performance.  I'd now like to turn the call back over to Darren. \nDarren Rebelez : Thanks Steve. I'd like to thank the entire Casey’s team for another strong quarter. You may have seen we recently added a new team member, our new Chief Pizza and Beer Officer, Nebraska native Joe Cruz. Joe was selected from over 500 applicants, and we're thrilled to have him. Now the hard work begins as he's busy tasting our handmade delicious pizza and our refreshing ice cold beer pairings, which you can follow along with on our social media channels.  Our team members across the organization continue to execute our strategic plan extremely well, and the results are proving that the hard work is paying off. We continue to roll out programs to make the stores run more efficiently, including the launch of our digital production planner. This tool allows us to use our robust data and analytics capabilities to give team members the technology to manage food production more effectively in order to reduce waste and save team members time.  The Casey's brand, both with private label and our prepared food offering, continues to prove to be our strength in the industry, as evidenced by our robust inside same-store sales, both in the quarter and on a two-year stack basis. This allows for strong guest support for food innovation, and in January we rolled out a refreshed chicken sandwich and cheeseburger that guests are already gravitating towards. Just another example of guests trusting that Casey's will deliver. Our prepared food program continues to drive strong results and gives us a unique competitive advantage in the industry.  The commitment of our team members in stores to serve guests with high quality products at a great value has translated to results. Our private label program continues to shine as we saw positive growth in units and gross profit versus the year. More and more guests continue to join Casey's rewards as we have over 7.7 million members today, as growth in the third quarter was accelerated by our 24 days of Casey's campaign.  With help from the continuous improvement team, our store operations team continues to operate the stores more effectively and efficiently. With their efforts, we had another quarter reducing same-store labor hours, marking the 7th consecutive quarter of same-store labor hour reduction, while increasing both guest satisfaction and team member engagement scores.  There's more to come as we're excited about what's in the pipeline for the next 12 to 18 months regarding store simplification. We look forward to giving our team members even more tools to make a great guest experience.  On the fuel side of the business, we performed well despite lapping a highly profitable quarter last year. Wholesale price move in was less favorable, but we still posted a 37.3 cents per gallon margin, while outpacing our geography on fuel gallons sold. We're positioned to thrive in this environment with our team and the capabilities that we've stood up.  Regarding store growth, we're off to a great start on our commitment to add 350 stores by the end of fiscal 2026. Our two-pronged approach of new store construction as well as M&A allows the company to ratably grow without reaching for acquisitions. As we approach the end of fiscal 2024, I'm proud of how we started our three-year strategic plan. I'm extremely excited about the outlook of the business. Now that the world and our industry has evolved to a more normalized post-pandemic environment, our unique business model is proving to be both highly differentiated and resilient. We have abundant growth opportunities on the horizon and the team and balance sheet to capitalize on. This gives me great confidence in our team and our ability to execute the strategic plan.  We'll now take your questions. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Your line is now open. \nBen Bienvenu : Hey, good morning, everybody. \nDarren Rebelez: Good morning, Ben. \nDarren Rebelez: Good morning, Ben.\nBen Bienvenu : I wanted to ask first about the results in the prepared food business. Very strong same-store sales results, very strong margins. I'd love to hear a little bit about the composition of the same-store sales growth that you saw during the quarter. How much is ticket versus traffic? And as you look forward to some of the new product innovations that you have in-store and the store simplification, what impact you think that might have on the prepared food business versus the rest of the business more broadly? \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah Ben, this is Darren. Sales bills were driven by a few things. We had real strength in whole pies. Whole pies are up about 11% in the quarter. Our bakery products as well were up about 11%, and then we saw apps and side items up around 9%. So that was pretty good.  Overall, when you look at the inside sales mix, I was really happy with how inside worked out this quarter. It struck a really nice balance. We're up about 2.2% in transactions and about 1.9% in check. So, really you see a little bit of modest inflation, but you also see the strength coming from driving traffic to the stores, and that's really a good spot to be in from that perspective.  With respect to innovation, I tell you, I think we're really starting to hit our stride, and this quarter had some impact of that with our chicken sandwich and our burger platforms. The culinary team did a fantastic job of basically rebuilding those products and up-leveling the quality of all the ingredients, changing the builds, making those more compelling and adding a new crispy spicy chicken sandwich which really resonated well.  And in doing that, up-leveling that quality and also negotiating better cost of goods, we were able to raise price by about $0.50 a unit and the velocity has accelerated almost triple digits, and so we're really seeing some nice results there. And so that innovation can really not only have an impact on the velocity, but also have an impact on the margin at the same time. \nBen Bienvenu : That's great. My second question is also in the prepared food segment, but more as it relates to the margins and in particular the cost of cheese. Steve, I think the last update that we got is that you are 80% lost for the balance of the year, so that would be the fourth quarter. Spot cheese costs are down considerably. Is there anything that you can share with respect to how you are thinking about forward buying your cheese needs for fiscal ‘25 and what potential benefit that might afford for Casey's? \nSteve Bramlage: Sure. Ben, good morning. So, as it relates to the fourth quarter first, we're now about 90% locked for our fourth quarter buy and so I think we got a lot of visibility into that. I would expect us to be something like 5% or 6% to the good on a year-over-year basis for the all-in cost of cheese. That would compare to about a 10% or so benefit that we had in the third quarter, so favorable, but modestly less favorable.  As we enter into FY’25, we will continue to be opportunistic as we think about how we can forward buy cheese on a favorable basis. If we get an opportunity to forward buy it, so that we can lock in deflation on a year-over-year basis, we take advantage of that, and that's what our sourcing team is focused on.  And so we certainly are not locked into the level that we are for FY’24, but we will continue to take advantage of that opportunity going forward. When we get to the end of the fiscal year this year, we'll give some more forward visibility as to exactly what those positions are entering FY’25. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Bonadio with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. \nAnthony Bonadio : Hey, good morning, guys. So it looks like OpEx growth in Q3 came in quite a bit below what you guys had guided to last quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more about what drove that upside versus what you guys were planning? And then maybe more broadly, what you are doing on the cost side that's working so well right now? \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, Anthony. I'd say we had another really strong quarter on OpEx, and that was -- the favorability was really driven in the stores with labor management and the stores continue to perform exceptionally well in taking unproductive labor hours out. And it's somewhat of a virtuous cycle as we make the job in the stores more simple for people to execute.  It takes less hours to do the jobs, but it also reduces turnover. When you reduce turnovers, you reduce overtime, you reduce training hours, and people get more productive in their jobs because they stay in them longer, and so we're seeing all of those things happen. And then the great side benefit of all that is team member engagement scores go up, overall satisfaction scores go up, both of which are the highest we've ever seen in our company. So everything's working pretty well on that, but the primary driver was labor hour reduction. \nAnthony Bonadio : Got it. That's helpful. And then I just wanted to dig in on fuel margins a little bit. I realize there's sort of a price element to the softness we are seeing of late, but I also know you guys have a uniquely good read on the health of the marginal operator, given you are looking at a lot of these chains as potential tuck-in deals. Can you just maybe talk a little bit more about what you are seeing there, as we sort of look to assess the impact on fuel margin breakeven for those players? \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, with respect to fuel margin and other operators, I mean we are seeing other operators as we look at stores that we are acquiring. We'll see operators that are taking more fuel margin. Their fuel margin will be higher than it was prior year, but in many cases, their EBITDA is lower than it was in the prior year. And so what they are having to do is raise price on fuel, take more margin.  They are chasing off gallons in the short term, and that math works in the short term. It doesn't work over a sustained period of time, and that's still not enough to cover the losses that they're experiencing in the cigarette category or the inflation that they are experiencing in OpEx, because typically these smaller operators are over-indexed to tobacco, and they don't have any scale to negotiate better services agreements with service providers that ultimately impacts their OpEx. So that's kind of what we're seeing on that front. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. \nBonnie Herzog : Alright, thank you. Good morning. \nDarren Rebelez: Good morning, Bonnie. \nBonnie Herzog : I had a question about, your inside sales were really quite strong, which is great, and you are executing very well, but I guess I was wondering if you are changing your strategy a bit in terms of what you earn at the pump versus maybe driving traffic in the store.  I guess I'm asking because your fuel margins were strong, but they have decelerated sequentially this year. So, is this more a function of a shift in strategy on your end or maybe just some industry pressures? And then if it's the latter, can you give us a sense maybe of why industry margins have been declining over the last few months? \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, Bonnie. I would say first, there is no change in strategy for us on fuel, and we've been very consistent in that we always strive to maintain a balance between volume and margin and try to optimize gross profit dollars in that equation. And if you look over this past fiscal year, every quarter has been either favorable or positive by 30, 40 basis points or negative by 30, 40 basis points. It really toggles within a pretty tight range around flat, and we've had good margin.  This quarter obviously, the margin was lower than prior year. Prior year margin was over $0.40 a gallon. We've never really had a goal to achieve any sort of margin, frankly. It's really to maximize those gross profit dollars, so no change in strategy.  We were actually really pleased with the fact that when you look at the mid-continent data from OPIS that we're about 500 basis points better than the industry. From a volume standpoint, we're still north of $0.35 a gallon on fuel margins.  So we like that math, especially when it maintains traffic in the store. We have positive traffic in the store, which is where all the real margin is, and that's our true strength and differentiator. So the model is working exactly as we would describe it to work. \nBonnie Herzog : Okay. It definitely makes sense. And then just maybe a quick follow-up on that, because Darren, I think you mentioned that you've made some modest retail price adjustments. So would love to just hear a little bit more color around this. And what I'm talking about is at the pump and then your ability to maybe take even more pricing in the future, in the context of sort of what you just said. Thank you. \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah. We took some modest pricing in grocery and general merchandise. The tobacco pricing I'd set aside, and you know how that works Bonnie. It's a quarterly cadence. We pass on those cost increases to the guest.  Outside of that, as we turn the page on the calendar year, we had some cost of goods, increases primarily in some of the non-alcohol beverage categories. We were able to pass those on. But by and large, this was not a real inflationary year compared to the last several that we've experienced. And like I mentioned before, we had a really good balance in the quarter of driving traffic to the stores and throwing that check just a little bit vis-a-vis inflation or mix to get to a pretty good outcome at a little over 4%. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. Your line is now open. \nBobby Griffin: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter in a tough wholesale environment. I guess first up for me, I want to maybe switch gears and talk a little bit about the recent M&A. I think you guys have acquired about 145 stores over the last 12 months, more of the tuck-in side versus the bigger, larger acquisitions like you did with Bucky's a couple years ago.  Can you maybe just talk a little bit about how the integration is going on some of those? Any interesting learnings from these recent ones versus kind of times in the past? And then maybe, I know it's early, but just touch on how the expansion in Texas is going. \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, Bobby. Yeah, it's been a real active M&A environment recently, and our M&A team's doing a fantastic job with a lot of these tuck-in acquisitions. That being said, we're also having discussions on larger potential deals, but we just haven't gotten anything over the finish line yet. So, more to come on that.  But yeah, I'd say we've done so many of these now, these I’ll call them under 100 store size acquisitions. Our integration team has really got a good process down, and they are really efficient and effective at doing that. I think we've learned how to get our prepared foods into these acquisitions more quickly.  Historically, this has taken us a long time to do, and to the extent that some of these stores that we acquire have some level of kitchen space available, our team's gotten really effective at getting equipment in early and getting the food into the stores quicker, which obviously accelerates the same-store sales capture and the synergy capture in those acquisitions. So, yeah, I think we get a little bit smarter and a little bit better on every one that we do. \nBobby Griffin : And then, Darren, just on the whole pie growth, I mean 11%. Just curious, can you unpack a little, or do you have any details on what is driving that? Is that the carryover from just obviously adding thin crust as part of like, we haven't fully lapped that yet, I believe? Or is Casey's pricing versus peers in the core markets just becoming more compelling on a whole pie basis, given your size is getting bigger or anything else there to maybe talk about what's driving that growth?\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah Bobby, I think it's a combination of things. Certainly, the thin crust has helped. It's about hanging in there, it’s about hanging in there at about 12% of the mix now and a good portion of that was incremental and we won't lap that until June. So we definitely have some favorability there.  We've also seen really strong growth in single topping pizzas and that tends to be more of a value play. And one of the interesting things we're seeing as we dig into our guest insights, we're finding that although we are not really overly exposed to the lower income consumer, about three quarters of our guests make over $50,000 a year. That other cohort that makes less than $50,000, they are spending more money on prepared foods and they are finding that value proposition really compelling, and so it's been an interesting dynamic.  I mean the other income cohorts are also going to prepared foods, but the fastest growth is coming from the lower income demographic, as I think they try to find that right value and quality equation. And frankly, when you look at a lot of the other pizza players, a lot of them are franchised and a lot of those franchisees have taken a lot of price. And when we compare our numbers to any of the other publicly traded pizza competitors, we stack up really well in relation to them. I think that's because of our ability to maintain that right value equation in that space and we're seeing the growth as a result of it. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nMichael Montani : Hey guys, good morning and thanks for taking the question. \nDarren Rebelez: Good morning. \nSteve Bramlage: Good morning Mike. \nMichael Montani : Just wanted to ask if I could to discuss a little bit the inside margin outlook into the fourth quarter. So, if we went to the midpoint of the full year guide, it suggests that there could be some pressure coming up there in terms of less expansion for sure. So just wanted to kind of get a sense, how to think about that.  And then secondly, I guess, to the extent you have visibility on input costs and pricing, do you think we're seeing kind of a bottoming of disinflation at this point and potentially there could be some uptick there? How should we think about that? \nSteve Bramlage: Yeah. Hey, good morning Mike. This is Steve. I'll try to start with that. I think as we sit here today, halfway through the fourth quarter, I don't think there's a radical change in the experience we've had around input costs broadly vis-a-vis what's happened here in the last couple of quarters. As we mentioned on an earlier question, cheese may be a touch less favorable for us in the fourth quarter on the prepared food side of the business than it was, but it'll still be favorable year-over-year.  Broadly speaking, in prepared food, we continue to have year-over-year deflation, usually disinflation at worst on most of the commodity categories with the exception of beef. And so I do think we continue to have a tailwind that's likely to stick with us here for a little while on those categories.  And then on the grocery side, that's a contractual business for us. And so as Darren had mentioned earlier, most of those prices reset for – most of those input costs reset for us at the beginning of the calendar year, and we were able to make retail price adjustments accordingly. And so I would expect us to be in a position to preserve the grocery category margins pretty consistently with what we've seen here for most of the year as we finish out this year. \nMichael Montani : Got it. And then if I could sneak one more, and just on the LIFO front, how should we think about that into the fourth quarter? \nSteve Bramlage: You know, LIFO is just reflective of what our input costs ultimately are and the way the accounting rules have us make adjustments to inventory balances. And so generally, the direction of LIFO charges will follow what's happening with input costs. And so with the exception of tobacco, where we consistently are going to be taking LIFO charges, because we're consistently getting price increases, generally speaking, LIFO will be less of a headwind on a year-over-year basis for us as we continue to see deflation on the prepared food side. And so I would expect LIFO, as we sit here today, probably to consistently be modestly favorable on a year-over-year basis for us as we finish out the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nKelly Bania: Good morning. I was wondering if we could just talk about gallons. You are tracking flattish, which sounds like some pretty significant market share gains in your region. Just wondering if you could talk about maybe what's driving the broader decline in gallons. It seems several quarters in a row now. And do you anticipate that that's kind of the new normal where gallons are kind of weaker across the industry? And is your strategy to maintain flattish gallons there going forward? \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah Kelly, I think this goes back to what I was saying before. If you look at some of the smaller operators, you got to look at the composition of their business. So, if you set gasoline aside for a second, in the inside of the business, they are heavily leveraged to tobacco. Typically 30% or more of their inside mix is tobacco, ours is about 18%.  And that category is declining, call it 8% to 10% a year. They don't typically have prepared foods. They don't have rewards. They don't have a lot of scale to leverage. So, they don't have a lot of levers to pull to try to offset the inflationary pressures and the decline in the tobacco category and inside overall.  So they are raising price on fuel to try to offset that, but the consequence of raising that price on fuel is chasing away some of those gallons, and we're able to have a more balanced approach to that because we have such a strong inside offering. And we do have scale, and we do have rewards, and we do have prepared foods and we have a lot of those other things that they simply don't. So we make money another way. And remember for us, about 70% of our transactions are non-fuel anyway.  So we've got a lot of business coming to the stores that helps us offset some of those other areas of softness in some of the other categories. So we're able to afford to have a better balance of fuel volume and margin.  At the same time, there are some structural things that are going on with fuel that would put some pressure on gallons overall if you just think about fuel efficiency in vehicles overall. With an average car age of about 12 years, every year you drop off the oldest, least efficient vehicles in the fleet and replace them with the newest and most efficient vehicles that have been made.  And so there's always going to be some pressure on gallons consumed in the industry. And so we kind of feel that in that type of environment, if we're flat to slightly up on gallons and we have strong margin, that's a really good balance for us. And we convert that fuel traffic into store traffic, which is where we have the strongest margins and the most profitability. \nKelly Bania : Thank you. Also just wanted to ask with store simplification, I think you mentioned seven quarters in a year, so in same store hours declining. Just curious if you could talk about how much more opportunity is there? It sounds like there's more to come, but maybe you can just give us some color where the opportunity is. \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, we do think there is some more to come. Frankly, whenever you start off on an initiative like this, you go off to the low hanging fruit first. So, I think some of the big chunks that were available to us, we've taken. So, it gets a little more challenging and we have to get a little more sophisticated. But we've got some good initiatives in the pipeline from workforce management tools to some process changes that really we think will make a difference.  But, I think overall where we'll see the real benefit is just simplifying the work in the store, giving the store back some slack hours is what we call it, where we don't necessarily take hours out, but we've eliminated work, which makes the job of the team members in the stores easier. That has a positive impact on turnover. With less turnover, you spend less in training, you spend less in overtime, you get more productive in your job. All of that helps to reduce labor.  So, we haven't given any guidance on what that's going to look like over the next couple of years. We'll probably get a little sharper on that in our next quarter when we give guidance for fiscal ‘25. But suffice it to say, we still think we have more opportunity there and we'll continue to go after that. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Irene Nattel with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. \nIrene Nattel : Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just coming back to the recent fuel margins, I think that investors are just struggling a little bit to understand why we've seen this more recent compression in recent weeks relative to prior weeks. So I guess my question for you is, are you seeing anything fundamentally different in the competitive set and in the way they are acting that would play into that sort of slightly lower trend on fuel margins? Or do you think it's just more a seasonal issue? \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah Irene, we're not seeing anything dramatic. I mean, competitors ebb and flow in their behavior and then we always react to that and they do the same with us, but I'm not seeing any wholesale changes in anybody of any scale that would make a difference. And I would just remind everybody that, yeah, our margins were a little bit thinner than they have, and we're talking off of $0.40 a gallon though. Nobody, at least I know of, is really banking on $0.40 fuel margins being the new normal. And so the fact that we ended up at $0.37, I think is a pretty good outcome. No, it's not $0. 40, but it's definitely a pretty good outcome.  And I think this time of year in general, as we start to go into refinery turnaround, that supply starts to get a little bit tighter, the cost curve goes up. I mean, since the beginning of the calendar year, wholesale costs have risen $0.50 a gallon. Now, what we do know is that at some point, that curve is going to inflect and the cost curve will come down as the refineries come back online. And as that cost curve comes down, margins tend to widen out.  What we don't know is when that curve is going to inflect. It could inflect next week and we'll have a nice six-week run before the end of the quarter of widening fuel margins. It can inflect in four weeks from now and we'll only have two weeks in the quarter. At the end of the day, it's not going to matter, because the curve will run its course and we'll make the margin that we are supposed to make.  The timing of it and when it lands neatly into a quarter or not is really anybody's guess at this point. But to get back to your original point, we're not seeing anything structurally different with fuel margins at this point. \nIrene Nattel : That's really helpful. Thank you very much for that. And then just coming back to sort of the consumer behavior, you called out that sort of your lowest 25% is sort of you are seeing better results on prepared food. But just wondering sort of more broadly speaking, what you are seeing around consumer behavior and any sort of heightened sensitivity around promotional or spending or anything like that. Thank you. \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah Irene, really overall, I think I'd have to say that the consumer's proven to be pretty resilient. We're not seeing a lot of real changes. We tend to see changes in fuel when times get tight. They'll switch to more heavier ethanol blends. They'll buy less premium. We're not seeing any of that right now.  We've seen good growth in our private brands. There's a 5.5% same store in the quarter, but not a huge shift. Like I mentioned, the lower income cohorts are doing what you would expect lower income cohorts to do, which is gravitate a little more towards value. Our prepared foods and our private label satisfy that need. But with the other income cohorts, they are continuing to spend like they have been, and so we're not really seeing anything different at this point. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. \nKrisztina Katai : Hi, good morning and my congratulations on a good quarter. So, I had a follow-up question on prepared foods and some of the recent launches, thinking about thin crust, the four new sandwiches. So if you could just talk about the value that you see Casey providing relative to just your broader competition, looking also at QSR competition. You could make any comments about what they are doing from a pricing perspective that could give you an opportunity to gain further market share. And then if you could also contextualize for us where you see Casey’s market share today in the various day parts compared to maybe a year or two ago. \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, Krisztina, I think with some of the recent innovation, like I mentioned in the sandwich category in particular, we were able to take some price, but our price points are still significantly below what you would find in a QSR for a comparable quality sandwich. I mean, a couple of dollars cheaper.  So we think it poses a unique value. And look, the guest is going to buy on quality first and then hopefully try to maximize on price. And I think our culinary team like I mentioned before, did a really nice job of taking some products we already had and tearing them down to the studs, improving the quality of every ingredient in those builds and making them a better product and then layer in some innovation along with that with a new build, and it's a good recipe and very much a value.  I don't have good market share data in those subcategories right here as we speak today, but I know historically when we do something like this, we tend to take some share from the largest players. So the last time when we did a similar exercise on breakfast, we saw the most share actually come from McDonald's, believe it or not. And that's primarily because they have the most presence and they are the biggest player. So I would imagine that once we get the data in on the sandwich platform, it may look something similar to that, but I just don't have the data at my fingertips right now. \nKrisztina Katai : Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. On private label, I think Darren you said that volumes were positive, but did you provide where penetration ended in the quarter? And then just broadly, how are you thinking about new product launches or the number of SKU launches that you are planning over the next six to 12 months? \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, the penetration in the quarter was about where it had been. It was right around 10% in units and gross profit dollars. I’ll just remind you that third quarter is seasonally the softest quarter for private label, because it's the softest quarter for beverages and we have a big beverage presence with our private label product. So it's always going to be a little bit less penetrated this time of year than it would be here in the next few quarters.  I'm sorry Krisztina, what was the other part of your question? Oh, new products. Yeah, we've got a pipeline of about 40 or 50 new products that we are planning to enter into the assortment. We are kind of phased in over the next several months, summer being the biggest part of it. Not prepared to really discuss the details of any of those, but we are pretty excited about what we've got coming this summer. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. \nCharles Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone. Great quarter. In looking at your prepared food margins, they've been trending upward. And would you care to comment, can you get back into the 60s? And I'm curious about what the role of redeeming private label rewards is on the prepared foods part of your business, and will that hold it back, the margin back? \nSteve Bramlage: Sure. Good morning, Chuck. This is Steve. I'll maybe start with that. I think, first of all, we're pleased with the progress of kind of margin recovery broadly in prepared foods. As you know, we consciously have taken a position of trying to improve margins in that category by kind of pricing through the commodity cycle. And so unlike the grocery business, which is contractual, we've got a lot of commodities, and so when all the commodities went up at the same time a couple of years ago, we chose not to chase dollar for dollar with price increases at that point. So we raised prices, but not as much as the input costs went up.  And we expect over time commodities will inflect. And ultimately on the downside, as we hold retail prices steady, we'll recapture that margin over the course of the cycle, and that's exactly what's happening right now in our experience, and I think we've got further to go in that direction.  So the 60% number for prepared foods, we're close to it now. The high water mark a couple of years ago was a little bit higher than 60%. I would remind you a couple things structurally have changed. And you kind of hinted at that, right. We did not have a rewards program at that particular point in time, and the cost of the rewards program in terms of points that are accrued is a reduction in margin. It's about a 50 basis point reduction in margin on prepared foods as we sit here today.  We also did not have third-party aggregator delivery of any significance at the time. So that previously was an operating expense where we delivered out of the stores, and now it's a cost of product in the fees. And so those things structurally have changed, and so the high water mark probably has been reset accordingly.  But I think we feel good about a glide path to 60. We're on it right now. Input cost remains favorable, and I think we feel good that the approach we've taken has allowed us to maximize gross profit dollars inside the store and maintain the value proposition. And I would expect we'll continue to run the play in that regard. \nCharles Cerankosky : Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And our next question will come from the line of Corey Tarlowe with Jefferies. Your line is now open. \nCorey Tarlowe : Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about growing organically versus through acquisition. It sounds as if the environment has become more conducive to growth through M&A, given it sounds like marginal player EBITDA has been a little bit pressured, elicited by the cents per gallon and traffic headwinds that these peers are facing. I'm curious to get your view on that and how that informs what your outlook is going forward as you think about growing through those two levers, organic versus M&A. \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah Corey, this is Darren. Yeah, I’d first say that we like to strike the balance between organic growth and M&A. We don't ever want to put all our eggs in either one of those baskets, because situations can change. So what we are seeing right now is that the M&A environment is pretty attractive. The cost of construction has gone up and at the same time the challenges for the smaller operators have gone up as well.  So what we're finding is we're able to buy some assets, pretty good quality assets, invest close to $1 million in putting in kitchens and remodeling and fixing deferred maintenance and all those other things, and essentially have a brand new store for less than replacement cost than it would cost us to build it brand new. And so we like that math.  We look at a lot of things when we're assessing valuation on M&A, but one of those checks is replacement cost. Can we build it cheaper than we can buy it and fix it up, and so we stay pretty disciplined on that. So right now, it's been very favorable. We've been able to buy a lot of stuff for below replacement cost, all in.  That being said, we're still going to build in the neighborhood of 50 new stores this year. We have a pipeline of organic growth that continues to build. If we have a lot of M&A, we always have the option to land bank our real estate and continue on M&A. And then if the M&A market turns a little bit soft, we can just pivot back over to our land bank and continue to grow organically and maintain that steady ratable growth that I think people are counting on from us. \nCorey Tarlowe : And then just as a follow-up, how are you thinking about leveraging technology to not only improve those same-stores hours that you pointed out, but I wanted to ask about AI and your intentions there and how you think that could benefit the business as well going forward? \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah. So a couple of things there. I think with technology, we are using some technology to help on the labor side. More recently, we just launched our digital production planner, which enables us to take what was a manual paper-based process and make that fully automated. So that saves people, store managers in particular, time on having to manually do calculations and manually write things down to get to a production planner for the kitchens to execute again. So it's one example.  We're also rolling out here before the summertime a workforce management tool that will allow our store managers to get even more efficient in labor scheduling and deployment and give our team members flexibility from a scheduling standpoint. So that's on the labor side.  With respect to AI, we're looking at a couple of different things. Probably the best example we have is what we just rolled out, what we call our automated voice assistant, or AVA as we call her, which essentially answers the phones in the stores. And even though about 80% of our food orders that come into our kitchens are digital, that still leaves close to 10 million phone orders a year where people will call a store and talk to a person in the store to place an order.  And as you can imagine, that becomes disruptive during peak periods when people are trying to get food out of the kitchen and they are having to stop and take orders and it's noisy and disruptive. So AVA takes care of all that. It's AI driven. We trained it with natural language processing and machine learning.  So when a call comes in, it can take the order, it can suggest a sell, it can help build that order, and it goes right into the order management system in the kitchen. So the phone calls are drastically reduced in the kitchen. It makes it more efficient to get the food out. And we are right now at about, 11% of the orders that come in are being handled by AVA at this point. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Royall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. \nJohn Royall : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I know we're short of time, so I'll just ask one. Can you discuss any impact you had from weather in January? I know the Midwest got kind of pummeled with some winter weather. You saw fuel comps off a little, but very strong inside the store comps. So I guess I was a little surprised to not see much of a material impact there. Can you just talk through any weather impacts in the third quarter? \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah. It was really a tale of two parts. The November, December were pretty favorable. And so we had good inside comps and we had positive fuel comps in November, December, and in January, that turned on us. I think we were on fuel. We were up 0.9% in November, 0.6% in December, and down 2.6% in January. And so we ended up down a little bit.  On the inside, we never turned negative. We were positive 5%-ish and 6%-ish in November, December positive. A little bit over 1% in January. You know, netted out to the 4.1% overall. So again, I think weather certainly has an impact. And you know, in this part of the geography, we had about 10 days or so where temperatures didn't get above zero and the news was telling everybody to stay home and don't go outdoors. So it's not great for business, but I think overall, it felt really good about how we came out of January considering how tough it was and ended up with a really strong quarter. \nJohn Royall : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of John Lawrence with The Benchmark Company. Your line is now open. \nJohn Lawrence : Yeah, great. Thanks for squeezing me in. Darren, when you talk about, obviously you are looking at some larger chains for acquisitions. We've watched you and witnessed all the leverage points in years past. Can you talk a little bit about how this restructured gas margin in the 30s, how does that affect the math as you look at these larger chains? Does that give you another leverage point on scale as you look at making the chain a lot larger? \nDarren Rebelez: Well, if I think I understand your question, I mean, when we're looking at these chains, those dynamics that I described earlier are still consistent that most other operators are heavily relying on fuel margin because the inside business isn't as resilient.  For us, when we look at these things, we try to model those based on our experience, not necessarily the experience of the previous owner, because we are going to have an approach to how we price fuel and how we procure fuel.  Typically, these assets are in our existing geographies or adjacent to us. We're pretty familiar with the fuel supply and pricing dynamics in these markets, and we understand how our stores perform there. So we don't really put too much stock in how they do it today. We take much more, put much more credence into how we're going to operate them moving forward, and we model it accordingly. \nSteve Bramlage: Yeah, I think John, I would add that on the fuel over the last two years, we've been talking a lot about the sustainability of higher fuel margins in the industry. I think broadly speaking, in M&A, as a potential buyer, there's a general recognition that higher fuel margins and LTM EBITDAs are more reasonable than they might have seemed two years ago just because of the dynamics in the industry and people adjust accordingly.  Again, fuel margin for the smaller players is often the only lever they have to drive EBITDA to wherever it's going to be. So I would say it's a little bit more the tail on the dog and that the small operator remains under pressure for all the reasons we've talked about inside the store and with operating expense. And they are pulling a lever on fuel that's really trying to help them right-size what's happening inside as opposed to having a strategic point of view on what they are doing with fuel within their own business. \nJohn Lawrence : Great, thanks. Just one follow-up. You mentioned chips and water on the private label side. What can you say of – how does a brand name in those large categories, the brand name provider respond? And what have you seen as you've grown those private label categories to the competitive response? \nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, it's a little bit of a mixed bag. In some cases, we have national brand manufacturers that are producing our private label products for us. And others, like you mentioned, with chips, that's not the case.  Look, I think we have pretty candid discussions with them. Our goal isn't to win with private label at the expense of national brands. Our goal is to grow the categories. And so what we do within those categories is we try to offer guests an alternative for something that in some cases is more affordable or maybe has a flavor profile that the national brand doesn't offer or a pack size that they don't offer.  And so there's a few different things that we do with private label that makes it complementary to the national brand assortment. And I would say in the case of snack chips in particular, we've had really good growth in our private label snack chips. Our national brand partner has also had really good growth in our stores with their chips. And so this doesn't have to be a win-lose. This can be a win-win when we approach it from a category perspective, and that's what we try to do. And so I think it's working pretty well so far. \nOperator: Thank you. This completes our Q&A portion. I'll now turn the call back over to Darren Rebelez, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer for closing remarks. \nDarren Rebelez : Alright, thank you and thanks again for taking the time today to join us on the call. And before we sign off, I just want to, again, thank our team members for all the hard work this quarter, and they did a fantastic job. So I hope everyone has a great week. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."

With that said, I would now like to turn the call over to Darren to discuss our second quarter results. Darren?\nDarren Rebelez: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We'll discuss the excellent second quarter results in a moment. First, I want to thank our team, including the new team members in our 17th state of Texas for their dedication and hard work. We're excited to welcome the great state of Texas to the Casey's community. I know that I speak for our entire team when I say we're extremely humbled by the response from our caring guests and dedicated team members to our annual veterans giving campaign in November. This year's campaign resulted in over $1.2 million, just an outstanding outcome and for two great causes. Hope For The Warriors and Children of Fallen Patriots. We are so grateful to our communities and guests for their generous act of rounding up their purchase. As a veteran and myself, I know the great sacrifices these families have made and the challenges they face. Thank you to our partners at PepsiCo, who contribute to this campaign, our Casey's team members and especially to our guests who truly do good when they shop at Casey's. Now let's discuss the results from the quarter. Diluted earnings per share finished at $4.24 per share, a 16% increase from the prior year. Inside sales remained strong, driving inside gross profit dollars up 10% to $553 million. The company generated $159 million in net income, an increase of 15% and $306 million in EBITDA, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Inside the store, same-store sales were up despite lapping a very strong second quarter last year, while margins improved both sequentially and year-over-year as ingredient costs improve. On the fuel side of the business, we continue to strike the right balance between volume and margin. Similar to the first quarter, there are no significant macro events that impacted wholesale fuel costs. With each passing quarter, it becomes more evident that higher industry fuel margins are here to stay. With another strong quarter, which led to our highest EBITDA in the first six months in the company's history, the strength of our unique business model was again on full display. The team continues to do an excellent job operating the business efficiently and effectively, both inside and outside the store, as evidenced by same-store labor hours being down 2%, while our overall guest satisfaction score was up over 400 basis points over the prior year. I would now like to go over our results and share some of the details in each of the categories. Inside same-store sales were up 2.9% from the second quarter or 11% on a two-year stack basis with an average margin of 41.1%. We saw notably strong performance in whole pizza pies, bakery and dispensed beverage. We're also very pleased with the continued inside margin expansion this quarter. Same-store prepared food and dispensed beverage sales were up 6.1% or 17.2% on a two-year stack basis with an average margin of 59%, up approximately 230 basis points from the prior year. Whole pies performed well in the quarter, and we also saw a strong performance with appetizers and sides. Margin was favorably impacted by softening in commodities, notably cheese during the quarter. Same-store grocery and general merchandise sales were up 1.7% or 8.7% on a two-year stack basis with an average margin of 34%, an increase of approximately 70 basis points from the prior year. We saw positive momentum in the category, notably in alcoholic beverages, and our private label program continues to be a great value option with bottled water and Casey's Chips performing well in the quarter. For fuel, same-store gallons sold were flat with a fuel margin of $0.423 per gallon. Our fuel team is striking the right balance between volume growth and margin and the results continue to show it. This quarter marks for the tenth quarter in a row with fuel margins about $0.345 per gallon and five of the last six quarters have been over $0.40 per gallon. Our volume continues to outperform our geographic market as well as OPIS fuel gallon sold data shows the mid-continent region, down approximately 5% in the quarter. I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve to discuss the financial results for the second quarter. Steve?\nSteve Bramlage: Thank you, Darren, and good morning. Our performance was excellent in the second quarter as we saw great results inside and with fuel, while we continue to operate the stores efficiently. This was despite a challenging comparison from the second quarter last year and that's a testament to the resiliency of our business model and our team's execution. Total revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, an increase of $86 million or 2% from the prior year due primarily to higher inside revenues. Total inside sales for the quarter were $1.3 billion, and that's an increase of $78 million or 6% from prior year. For the quarter, grocery and general merchandise sales increased by $47 million to $964 million, an increase of 5.2%. Prepared food and dispensed beverage sales rose by $31 million to $382 million, an increase of 8.9%. Results were also favorably impacted by operating more stores on a year-over-year basis. Retail fuel sales were up $11 million in the second quarter, as a 4% increase in gallons sold to $730 million was partially offset by a 3.5% decrease in the average retail price per gallon. That average retail price of fuel during the period was $3.62 a gallon compared to $3.75 a year ago. We define gross profit as revenue less cost of goods sold, but excluding depreciation and amortization. Casey's had gross profit of $886 million in the second quarter, an increase of $75 million or 9.2% from the prior year. This was driven by both higher inside gross profit of $48.8 million or 9.7% and higher fuel gross profit of $24.4 million or 8.6%. Inside gross profit margin was 41.1% and that's up 130 basis points from a year ago. The grocery and general merchandise margin was 34%, an increase of 70 basis points from prior year. The increase was due primarily to favorable vendor-funded promotions and volume discounts, a lower LIFO charge than in the prior year as well as private label increasing its share of our mix. Prepared food and dispensed beverage margin was 59%, up 230 basis points from prior year. The category margin benefited from lower commodity costs, specifically cheese which was $2.12 a pound for the quarter compared to $2.24 a pound last year, a decrease of about 5%. Margin also benefited from a lower LIFO charge in the prior year as generally input costs softened. Fuel margin for the quarter was $0.423 per gallon up $0.18 per gallon from the prior year. Fuel gross profit benefited by $8.4 million from the sale of RINs, down $2.7 million from the same quarter in the prior year. Total operating expenses were up 7.5% or $40.5 million in the second quarter. Over 3% of the total OpEx increase is due to unit growth as we operated 129 more stores year-over-year. Same-store employee expense accounted for another 1% of the increase, as increases in wage rates were partially offset by the reduction in same-store hours, Darren previously mentioned. The company also incurred higher variable incentive compensation, repair, maintenance and insurance expense that composed 2% of the total increase. Depreciation in the quarter was $85.6 million, and that's up $7.5 million versus prior year, primarily due to operating more stores. Net interest expense was $12.3 million in the quarter, down $1.2 million versus the prior year, aided by rising interest rates on our cash balances. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.6%, consistent with the prior year. Net income was up versus prior year to $158.8 million, an increase of 15.4% and EBITDA for the quarter was $305.9 million, compared to $271.7 million a year ago, an increase of 12.6%. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition, and we have ample financial flexibility on October 31st. We had total available liquidity of $1.3 billion. Furthermore, we have no significant maturities coming due until fiscal 2026. Our leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our senior notes is now 1.6 times. For the quarter, net cash generated by operating activities of $253 million was purchases of property and equipment of $107 million resulted in the company generating $146 million in free cash flow. This compares to generating $115 million in the prior year. At the December meeting, the Board of Directors voted to maintain the quarterly dividend at $0.43 per share. During the quarter, we also repurchased approximately $30 million of stock and have $340 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. Investing in EBITDA and ROIC accretive growth investments remains our primary capital allocation priority, but as we mentioned in our Investor Day, our balance sheet affords us the opportunity to be more opportunistic than in the recent past with regards to share repurchase. Our M&A pipeline remains strong, and our integration capabilities continue to expand. The transaction with EG Group mentioned last quarter has closed and that transaction as well as the other announced deals are being funded with cash on hand. The majority of these payments either occurred in the second quarter or they will occur in the third quarter. And this includes the transaction of 22 stores in our 17th state of Texas, which closed on November 16. As a result of the strong financial performance and unit growth year-to-date, we are updating our fiscal 2024 outlook as follows. Fiscal 2024 EBITDA growth is expected to be in line with the long-term strategic plans goal of 8% to 10%. The company also expects to repurchase at least $100 million in shares throughout the fiscal year. Same-store inside sales are now expected to increase 3.5% to 5%. Net interest expense is expected to be approximately $53 million, and the tax rate is now expected to be approximately 23% to 25% for the year. As discussed in the first quarter, the company expects to add at least 150 stores in fiscal 2024. That's more than the originally planned 110. As a result of this, total operating expenses are now expected to increase approximately 6% to 8%, though same-store operating expenses, excluding credit card fees are expected to only increase approximately 3% for the year. Depreciation and amortization are now expected to be approximately $350 million for the year. The company is not updating its outlook for the following metrics. We expect inside margin to be approximately 40% to 41%. The company expects same-store fuel gallons sold to be between negative 1% and positive 1%. And the purchase of property and equipment is expected to be $500 million to $550 million. Our results for the current quarter are as follows. First, November inside same-store sales are consistent with the updated range of the annual outlook. Fuel gallons are near the midpoint of the annual outlook and CPG is nearly $0.40 per gallon. Current cheese costs are modestly favorable versus the prior year. And now on a final note, as a reminder, in the third quarter of fiscal '23, we had a onetime operating expense benefit of approximately $15 million due to the favorable resolution of a legal matter. This benefit will not recur. Thus, total third quarter operating expenses will be up near the low teens in percentage terms, and that's primarily due to lapping the onetime benefit as well as store growth and several million dollars of onetime integration costs. If we were not lapping this onetime benefit from the prior year, total OpEx would be up approximately 8% to 9% in third quarter. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Darren.\nDarren Rebelez: Thanks, Steve. I'd like to thank the entire Casey's team for another quarter of outstanding results. We know that it's a challenging time for consumers everywhere. And we're so proud of the ability of our team members and stores to serve those guests with high-quality products. Our private label program continues to shine, and we saw positive growth in units and gross profit dollars during the quarter and continue to see a favorable impact on inside margin. And our guests are gravitating towards Casey's Rewards as we have over 7.3 million members today. On the prepared food and dispensed beverage side, Thin Crust Pizza continues to do well and has achieved a 13% share of whole pies throughout the quarter. The innovation team also moved to the breakfast daypart for the launch of the Ultimate Waffle breakfast sandwich, which has come out of the gate strong. Our continuous improvement team deserves price for all it has done to operate the stores efficiently and effectively while maintaining or improving guests and team member satisfaction. The team was able to take out another 2% of same-store labor hours in the quarter. We continue to expand our store count with complementary geographic growth. Recent acquisitions have strengthened our Eastern footprint in Kentucky and Tennessee, while we've also ventured into Texas, which we think is a hand and glove fit in our Southwest footprint. All of the stores are within our existing distribution radius, it fit the Casey's playbook of rural and suburban geographies. On the fuel side of the business, we had another strong quarter, both in fuel margin and gallons. With each passing quarter, we are becoming more confident that our industry has the necessity due to higher operating expenses, reset to a higher fuel margin environment. And with our team and the capabilities that we've stood up, we're focused on continuing to maximize gross profit dollars. As we look ahead to the second half of fiscal '24 and beyond, I'm excited about Casey's and our ability to execute our strategic plan. Our balance sheet affords us the ability to be disciplined but opportunistic with our store growth and our capabilities throughout the organization will allow for that growth to be efficient and innovative. We'll now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Bienvenu with Stephens. Your line is open.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nDarren Rebelez: Good morning, Bienvenu\nBen Bienvenu: Good morning. Steve, I want to follow up on the commentary you gave on quarter-to-date. You noted that the inside same-store sales results in the month of, I guess, November, and I don't know if that includes the stub period of December, but it's within the range of the annual guidance. Does the composition of the same-store sales growth looks similar to 2Q and that prepared foods is outpacing grocery. And any color that you can offer on kind of that divergence grocery moderating in the second quarter while same-store sales in prepared foods remains very strong, would be helpful.\nSteve Bramlage: Sure, Ben. I'll answer the first part of that and let Darren talk a little bit about the experience in the second quarter. The commentary is meant to be quarter-to-date, so it includes a little bit of a stub period into December. And yes, generally, were within the annual range for total inside and prepared food quarter-to-date is running a little bit stronger than Grocery similar to what we experienced in the second quarter. Darren, do you want to add a couple of comments on that second quarter experience.\nDarren Rebelez: Yes. In the second quarter, Ben, we saw a little bit of softness on the grocery and general merchandise side that was primarily in the tobacco category, specifically cigarettes. And I think you've seen that throughout the industry that cigarette volume was significantly softer in the second quarter, and so that offsets some strength in some of the other categories. We also encountered a little bit of weather anomalies, which I don't typically like to talk about, but it does impact the beverage business to a certain degree, and we saw some of that in October as well. But I didn't see anything trend-wise outside the cigarettes that was very concerning. And I think what was encouraging to us is that our prepared food growth actually accelerated from the first quarter into the second. And so a very strong two-year comps plus 17%. And so we're seeing the overall business perform very well.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Great. My second question is related to your operating expense growth guidance. You raised that -- you noted that 3Q growth year-over-year will be elevated and implied in kind of the updated guidance that you've given in the 3Q commentary that you've given is a pretty substantial step down in growth from 3Q to 4Q. Is it just a function of comparisons or what else is going on there? You made nice progress in the period on labor hours.\nSteve Bramlage: Yes, I'll start with that, Ben. I would expect year-over-year total OpEx growth to be the highest in the third quarter, and that's purely a function of lapping the benefit we had last year and then you're combining that with the fact that now all of these year-to-date acquisitions, all of which have closed relatively recently, certainly the EG and the Texas transactions, we'll have several million dollars of integration-related activity and almost all of that will hit us in the third quarter. And so I would expect that we would be back to almost back into the number mechanically in the fourth quarter, but we would be back into a more normalized run rate in the fourth quarter, albeit with a higher number of units coming into the system. But that 3% number we gave for same-store OpEx, excluding credit cards, that number should be very consistent quarter in and quarter out, just -- and that's a testament to how well the mothership is managing OpEx at the stores right now.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Anthony Bonadio with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAnthony Bonadio: Yeah, hey, good morning, guys. Congrats on the nice quarter. So I just wanted to ask about fuel margins in the context of the new guidance. I'm getting something in the mid $0.30 per gallon, maybe a little higher implied in the back half to get to that new 8% to 10% EBITDA growth number. I guess, one, is that the right way to think about it? And then two, can you just talk about why that's the right number? And then just different puts and takes around that.\nDarren Rebelez: Yes, sure, Anthony. With respect to the fuel margin, we tend to prefer to be a little bit conservative on those forecasts because as you well know, it's a pretty volatile category. That being said, we've seen five out of the last six quarters be in that $0.40 range. So we're not -- we don't see anything specifically that would cause a pullback in fuel margin, but we're just being conservative on that front. And so that's really about it in terms of the modeling.\nAnthony Bonadio: Okay. Got it. And then just on inside margins. Obviously, another very strong quarter there. I know you guys have kind of talked about being comfortable around that 40% level over the long term. It seems like the current environment, as I think about things like mix as well as a lot of the things you guys are doing internally sort of remains favorable. I guess can you just talk about the sustainability of what we're seeing today? And just how you're thinking about the trade-off between sort of flowing that through versus investing in value?\nDarren Rebelez: Yes. Well, we think the margins are sustainable for a couple of reasons. When you look at how the mix is evolving with the tobacco category being one of the lower-margin categories in the assortment and that the size of that category shrinking as a percentage of the total business, that's favorable to a margin rate as that mix becomes more heavily reliant on the higher-margin categories. The second piece of that is our prepared foods business. Our prepared foods business continues to grow, and you saw the margin expansion in that business. And so when you combine those two, that's a more sustainable margin mix. And the third thing I would say is our private label continues to grow inside the portfolio, which also blends up the margin. So those three things are all working for us. Now with respect to investing in value, we do invest in value to a certain extent today primarily through our private brand. And so with our private label products, even though they represent significant value to the guest, those are highly margin accretive to us. So that works out well. And more recently, what we're seeing from a consumer standpoint is it at the lower end of the economic spectrum, you're starting to see consumers shift heavier over to prepared foods as opposed to grocery and general merch. I think that's just a function of the relative value that our prepared food represents versus some of the other snack products and packaged good products you see on the other side. So all of that is constructive to margins and so that's why we think that's sustainable and we don't need to engage in extreme value offerings to maintain and drive the traffic.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nBonnie Herzog: Thank you. Good morning. I had a question on your grocery and general merchandise. First, your same-store sales were a bit soft. So hoping for a little bit more color on the drivers of this? And more color on CIG sales in the quarter, Darren, I know you called that out, but just curious to hear if your CIG business decelerated versus Q1 and wondering if you're making any changes to your nicotine category or possibly pricing on CIGs to mitigate some of these pressures.\nDarren Rebelez: Yes. Sure, Bonnie. I think on the CIG category itself, just combustible cigarettes were down about 4% in the quarter. And typically, what we've been able to do is pass on price and have that price flow through and with the unit decline offset and still stay relatively positive on the dollars and the category. That was not the case in this last quarter. I think to a large extent, that's a reflection of where the consumer is right now. As you know, the cigarette consumer tends to be a lower income consumer generally. And so what we've seen is a bit of trade down from that consumer into either not buying cigarettes as frequently or trading down to lower-tier brands. And so our team is assessing where to go from here on the cigarette category. But also that's not as significant a category for us as it is for others. So we don't feel the need to knee-jerk react. I mean, we still had a strong quarter. We were still constructive on margin. Our gross profit dollars are growing at an accelerated rate relative to our peers. And so we don't feel any sort of undue pressure to do something different. We'll have to see how things play out with that category over time.\nBonnie Herzog: Yes. That makes sense. And then curious to hear your color on the consumer and maybe how things have changed in the last few months and maybe your outlook and also just in the context of that color on your dayparts, maybe where stronger or weaker than expected, especially the morning daypart. Thanks.\nDarren Rebelez: Yes. I guess if I step back and I look at our consumer base, I'd just remind everybody that about 3/4 of our consumers make over $50,000 a year. And given our geographic footprint, we are in a very low cost of living geography. In fact, the most expensive state we operate in is ranked 27th in cost of living. So that $50,000 tends go a long way. So with that cohort of guests, 75% or so, we're really not seeing any change in consumption behavior. The changes we're seeing is on the other 25%, which are lower income consumers. And so we've seen a couple of things there. They're gravitating more towards our private label. Their cigarette purchases have been impacted, both in unit velocity and in just what they are buying when they do buy, like we were just mentioning. They're pulling back on premium fuels and opting more towards ethanol-blended fuels. But generally speaking, that's for that cohort of guests. So as we look forward, we still feel really good about the value proposition that we offer. 80% of our guests believe that we offer a good value for the money. And our traffic was flat over the quarter inside the store and our gallons were flat outside of the store. And so we're not suffering from a lack of traffic and we're seeing people gravitate more towards the prepared foods as a relative value proposition. So we think as we look forward to the balance of the year, we still feel really good about the resilience of the consumers in our geography.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nBobby Griffin: Good morning, buddy. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess the question for me is, is it possible for you to size what the tobacco drag was on the grocery segment, just so we can get a little bit of a better flavor of how kind of the business performed ex tobacco?\nSteve Bramlage: Yes, Bobby, we would have been about 100 basis points higher top line growth ex tobacco and grocery.\nBobby Griffin: Perfect. That's very helpful. And then, I guess, secondly for me is just on the labor hours reduction and other great performance this quarter. Is the team finding new task and opportunities inside the store, and those are kind of the reduction? Or is this a function of kind of the lower overtime that we've discussed in the past, given that turnover continues to move in the right direction as well? Or is it a combo of both, I guess?\nDarren Rebelez: Yes, Bob, I'd say it's a combination of both really, it's primarily driven, though, by the continuous improvement team, identifying non-value-added work that we can take out of the stores. That would be the primary impact. So that's a 2% reduction in labor hours. The overtime and training year-over-year has actually flattened out in terms of dollars, but we're using less hours when you factor in the wage rate. So if you think about flat dollars, but our average wage year-over-year is up about 3.5%. So that over time came down a bit, training was about flat. So we think it is a combination, not as dramatic as it was last year when we were really taking big swaths of overtime and training out with the reduced turnover. The turnover continues to reduce, but just not at the same rate as it was last year.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Your line is now open.\nChuck Cerankosky: Good morning, everyone. Great quarter. I've got another question about the labor hours. What are you still able to do around fine-tuning the store hours and the number of stores that are doing pizza delivery and the number of days they're doing pizza delivery. How much of that is still available to help the store labor hour calculation?\nDarren Rebelez: Yes, Chuck. I would say that there's probably limited upside on that front as we sit here today. Our team constantly evaluates operating hours overall to determine whether we need to make adjustments there. But I would say that, that process is pretty dialed in at this point. So to be just fine-tuning here and there. In terms of labor relative to delivery, we have a small number of stores that are still doing delivery. I think it's a couple of hundred at this point.\nSteve Bramlage: About 10% of our stores we deliver ourselves.\nDarren Rebelez: Yes, about 10%, so call it 250 stores. They're delivering ourselves. And the rest of it is through third parties. So that's not a labor impact for us. It is a margin impact when we have that delivery. But because that we only pay per delivery, we don't have a delivery driver at the store, waiting for another delivery order to come in. It's a far more efficient way for us to do delivery. So that's probably running for us as well.\nChuck Cerankosky: Okay. And then private label products, where are you at on number of SKUs? And where is your goal on that?\nDarren Rebelez: Yes. We've got 310 SKUs in the assortment right now, and that's a result of adding a number of SKUs in the last quarter and then taking some out that just weren't performing as well as we expected them to. So still, it's the highest SKU count that we've had on private label since we've started. There's still plenty of runway there. The team's got a pipeline of products that we'll be introducing over the next several quarters. And then we're also starting to evaluate different tiers of private label. So think of premium products that would still be a significant value versus national brand, but elevated quality and uniqueness. So still a lot of way to go there.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Wood: Hi. Good morning. This is Ben Wood on for Kelly. Thank you for taking our questions. So for the past three quarters, you've had flat gallons, which seems to be outpacing public peers down low single digit and outpacing the broader industry where you compete in where your commentary seems to be pointing towards down mid-single digit for that period, implying pretty solid market share gains. So first, can you provide any color on what you guys think is driving those market share gains? Is it loyalty or the value proposition inside the store? Or are you investing some fuel margin to get the bargain hunting customer? And then second, just more generally, if the industry and your competitors are losing gallons at a mid-single-digit pace, is that sustainable longer term? Or at some point, are the independents and small chain operators going to have to change strategy to try to drive some more gallons through their stores.\nDarren Rebelez: Yes, let me take the first part first. The flat gallon and now we're driving it. If I step back, our stated strategy, which has not changed since I've been here in the 4.5 years I've been here, for our fuel team is to drive gross profit dollars in fuel and to maximize gross profit dollars in fuel. That's going to be a combination of balancing gallon growth and fuel margin. And so we don't look at a fuel margin number and try to achieve that number in any given quarter. Our goal is to balance those two to maximize gross profit dollars. And so I think this was a great example in this quarter of doing that. We maintained flat gallons. And like you said over the last several quarters, we've maintained those flat gallons, and we were north of $0.40 a gallon on margin. Now if you were to look at the OPIS numbers, and I think this is reflective of what's going on in the industry right now, OPIS would say that fuel margin in our geography was about $0.48 a gallon. So that was higher than where we were clearly. It also said that gallons were down 5.2% in the quarter, significantly below where we are. To your second question, that is not sustainable for them. It clearly isn't. But what it is, is it's a reflection of the challenges that smaller and midsized operators are facing with inflation and in particular, the impact that the tobacco category has on them. If you look at what their mix is, their mix is probably 40% to 50% cigarettes. And so when that category underperforms like it has in the last quarter or two, that's going to have a material impact on their P&L. They don't have a choice. They're operating in survival mode right now. And so they're taking that higher margin and willing to sacrifice those gallons to get it. And that's, in the short term, that can work if you're trying to survive, in the long term is not sustainable. For us, we're not in that position. We're not as exposed to the tobacco category as the others. And we benefit from keeping that traffic in the store because we have high-margin prepared foods to sell people and high-margin private label to sell people that a lot of those others don't have. So it's important for us to keep that balance to keep that traffic. And you can see in the EBITDA results where most are going backwards in EBITDA, we had double-digit growth in EBITDA. So that is not just one metric or the other. It's a combination of all of these things working together that really makes our algorithm work for us.\nSteve Bramlage: Yeah, Ben, maybe I would add one thing there is it just it also continues to drive smaller operators out of the industry in the long run. It's just more and more difficult for small independent operators to compete not just against us, but just anybody with any reasonable amount of scale and so part of the -- we believe part of the long line of consolidation opportunities that exist today in the industry is a function of it's just getting harder and harder for the smaller operators to do business. And we just don't see that trend changing anytime in the near term, partially because of all the dynamics we just discussed.\nBenjamin Wood: Okay. Great. And then I know, so I know we're only two quarters in, but with the guidance update, you're now expecting EBITDA growth within the long-term plan compared to kind of originally pointing us towards flat. And one of the discussion points at your Analyst Day was that your original plan seemed to imply an acceleration in EBITDA growth we calculated to kind of the 12% to 15% range in year two and year three. Have expectations for the cadence changed or is some acceleration in the EBITDA growth and eventually getting above that 8% to 10% long-term plan, still the right way to think about it?\nSteve Bramlage: I'll take a crack at that. I would not divide anything into our updating here midstream in the first year around what we're saying in the out years of year two and three. We're committed to an 8% to 10% CAGR over that three-year period of time. The reality is that the year has clearly started off stronger than we anticipated that it would be. And some of that's clearly fuel margin related, and some of that's just really good performance across the operations. And so we'll take a stronger start than we anticipated every day of the week, and we still feel equally good about all of our longer -- medium and long-term prospects for driving growth as we did when we had the Investor Day.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nKrisztina Katai: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. So, on private label, which has been very successful for you, I was just curious to get an update on how your joint planning is going for the new calendar year with your national brand partners? Are they noticing or potentially responding to Casey's taking unit share in grocery? And anything you can share on expectations around pricing starting in January? And if you think that there's any possibility that maybe prices are going to start to roll back?\nDarren Rebelez: Yes, Krisztina, I guess, on joint planning. We are in the process of wrapping that up as we speak. And I think the planning sessions have gone really well so far. We've had good success over the last couple of years working with our primary CPG partners and growing their business and ours together. And so we enter into all of these discussions with that spirit, and I think we have some really good plans during the final stages of development working right now. With respect to the private label, it really kind of depends on the category and the manufacturing we're talking to. Our goal always and we communicate this with our partners is not to steal share from a national brand. It's to grow the overall category and growing the category both with national branded products as well as private label products. And I've used chips as an example. In the last quarter, we had a really strong quarter in chips. The national brands grew 10% and 2% positive unit growth. That's a good result in the quarter. Our private label chips grew 38% and 33% units in the quarter. So it is possible to do both and to have the success at both. And so that's what we're striving for with all of this is to achieve that. In some cases, our national brand manufacturers or also the manufacturers of their respect to private label products. So we have varying degrees of integration on that front. In terms of pricing, I'm not really prepared to talk about price. Those conversations are still underway, but we would anticipate some low single-digit inflation probably being passed through somewhere around the beginning of the year -- calendar year.\nKrisztina Katai: Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up on some of your comments around the low-end consumer trading down, do you think that you're attracting a new customer in your prepared foods business as part of the trade down? Or is the acceleration that you saw in the second quarter, all organic? So how do you think about opportunities for customer acquisition in this environment? And essentially walking them into our loyalty program to make sure that they stay with you. Thank you.\nDarren Rebelez: Yes. I like our opportunity here in this sort of economic environment. Our prepared foods business really does represent a tremendous value for consumers. You can get a whole pie and two sides for far less money than it would cost to take the family out to the QSR as an example. And so we have the opportunity to attract new guests to our stores based on the fact that it's just at our normal pricing, it's a strong value. And then again, like I said, what we're starting to see on the -- with our lower income consumers is that they're making a choice about what food to buy and they're gravitating more towards prepared foods as opposed to packaged foods because the prepared foods offer incremental value there. So we see the ability to grow that business on both sides, which is great for us because it's the highest margin category that we operate.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our final question comes from the line of John Royall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJohn Royall: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So could you dig in a little on some of the ingredient costs tailwinds in prepared foods. And what are your expectations for the second half of the year for ingredient costs? It looks like you're tracking at the top end of your guidance range for inside margin. And you made some adjustments to guidance, but you didn't adjust that one. So should we assume that margin may come in a little in 2H? And just anything there on what looks like maybe a conservative second half guide on the inside margin. Thanks.\nSteve Bramlage: Hi, John. Good morning. This is Steve. I'll start with that. Cheese, let's start with cheese. That's obviously the biggest input cost and the one that gets the most attention. We're about 80% hedged or locked I should say for the second half of the year on cheese costs. And so I would expect that to be modestly favorable at current spot prices year-over-year, similar to what it was in the second quarter. So somewhere between 5% and 10% favorable based on the current strip for cheese for the rest of the year. Most of the other input costs on the prepared foods business are not contractual, a lot of commodities with proteins, et cetera. And so right now, we don't have a reason to believe that protein cost experience for the second half will be significantly different than what it was in the first half, which is just a modest slow improvement on a year-over-year basis. I think that would be somewhat similar. You've seen that really in the LIFO charge experience we've had in the first half of the year, specifically in prepared foods, right? We still have LIFO expense, but we have less year-over-year. And that's really just a function broadly of what kind of inflation pressure we're having in that business.\nJohn Royall: Great. Thank you. And then my next question is on the buyback guide, $100 million on the year. You used the word opportunistic, but putting on a guide for the year, I think, suggests that maybe it's becoming a little more entrenched maybe in your capital allocation framework. Can you just talk about how we should think about the buyback as part of the framework going forward?\nSteve Bramlage: Yes. Listen, I think, your point -- it's a point well taken. You obviously had not been active and share repurchase for the last couple of years. We tried to message the folks at the Investor Day that as the company grows and continues to generate more operating cash flow and that cash flow outstrips in the short term, our ability to allocate it back into growth, which is always going to be the first stop on the bus for us if we can grow EBITDA and ROIC, do it accretively that's where we'll put the money. It just gives us more flexibility around capital allocation. And so as the leverage level continues to slowly tick down. I'm not sure that necessarily serves us well, letting that continue to get lower. It's driving up the cost of capital. We've got ample flexibility now. And so share repurchase just becomes kind of a logical next stop. We've been pretty disciplined on how we pay the dividend around 15% to 20% payout ratio and trying to match EBITDA growth over the medium term. We're not going to walk away from that. We've raised the dividend, I think, for 24 years in a row at this point. And so we're proud of that. But we simply have more available cash and share repurchase feels like an appropriate part of the capital allocation when you put all of the pieces of the balance sheet and just cash flow generation together. And so it's not going to be nearly as significant as what we're reinvesting into growth. I would not want to set that expectation. But the reality is I do think it has a part to play more so than it has over the last couple of years.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Mr. Darren Rebelez for closing remarks.\nDarren Rebelez: All right. Thank you and thanks for taking the time today to join us on the call. Before we sign off, I want to thank our team members for all their hard work this quarter and wish everyone a happy holiday season and a new year.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day."

With that said, I'd now like to turn the call over to Darren to discuss our first quarter results. Darren?\nDarren Rebelez: Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We'll get to the excellent first quarter results in a moment. First, I want to thank our team for their dedication and to getting the fiscal year off to a great start. As our guests and communities shifted into back-to-school season, Casey's held its annual Cash for Classrooms giving campaign in August. Thanks to our generous guests and passionate team members, we raised over $700,000. These funds will support needs and projects for schools, students and teachers in our local communities. The grant application process opens in October, and we encourage schools, teachers and parent-led organizations to apply. Now, let's discuss some results from the quarter. Diluted EPS finished at $4.52 per share, an 11% increase from the prior year. Inside sales remained strong, driving inside gross profit dollars up over 10% to $556 million. The company generated $169 million in net income, an increase of 11%, and $316 million in EBITDA, an increase of 8% from the prior year. As you may have seen in our Investor Day presentation, we launched a thin crust pizza offering in the first quarter. This addition to the lineup has been a great success and demonstrates the blueprint for innovation at Casey's. Our Guest Insights team identified a gap in our menu. Our culinary team created a delicious product. Our marketing team worked with our advertising partner to create a great marketing campaign and, ultimately, our operations team brought to life in our stores and communities across our footprint. And I think the results speak for themselves. This type of strategic innovation and teamwork is something that will help us achieve our goals for the three-year strategic plan. On the fuel side of the business, we continue to strike an appropriate balance between volume and margin. However, one notable difference with this quarter's performance is there were no significant macro events that influenced margin. It was a relatively benign quarter from a wholesale cost perspective, and we believe this is a strong indicator that higher industry fuel margins are here to stay. Overall, I think this quarter truly illustrates the strength of the unique Casey's business model, particularly in a more normal times and shows our three-year strategic plan objectives are very achievable. The team continues to do an excellent job operating the business efficiently and effectively both inside and outside the store. I would now like to go over our results and share some of the details in each of the categories. Inside same-store sales were up 5.4% for the first quarter or 12.1% on a two-year stack basis, with an average margin of 40.6%. We saw notably strong performance in whole pizza pies and bakery, as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Our team, with support from our supplier partners, continues to find the right product mix and promotional activity to drive sales and profitable results. Same-store prepared food and dispensed beverage sales were up 5.9% or 14.8% on a two-year stack basis, with an average margin of 58.2%, up approximately 260 basis points from the prior year. The previously mentioned innovation with thin crust pizza helped drive sales as we saw great results with our whole pizza pies, in addition to strong performance in bakery. Margin was favorably impacted by softening in commodities, notably cheese during the quarter. Same-store grocery and general merchandise sales were up 5.2% or 11% on a two-year stack basis, with an average margin of 34.1%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points from the prior year. We continued our strong momentum in beverages, with non-alcoholic beverages, specifically energy drink, showing fantastic results. Alcoholic beverages also performed quite well as we continue to leverage our competitive advantage of approximately 1,500 stores with liquor licenses. For fuel, same-store gallons sold increased 0.4% with a fuel margin of $0.416 per gallon. Our fuel team is striking the right balance between margin and gallon volume and the results speak for themselves. This quarter marks the ninth quarter in a row with fuel margins above $0.345 per gallon and four of the last five quarters have been over $0.40 per gallon. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve to discuss the financial results from the first quarter. Steve?\nSteve Bramlage: Thank you, Darren, and good morning. Each of the three areas of our business performed well in the quarter, and that's a testament to our business model and the execution of our teams. Total revenue for the quarter was $3.8 billion, a decrease of $585 million or 13% from the prior year due to the lower retail price at fuel. Total inside sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, an increase of $103 million or 8% from the prior year. For the quarter, grocery and general merchandise sales increased by $74 million to $997 million, an increase of 8%. Prepared food and dispensed beverage sales rose by $29 million to $373 million, an increase of 8.5%. Results were also favorably impacted by operating approximately 3% more stores on a year-over-year basis. Retail fuel sales were down $669 million in the first quarter due to a 24% decrease in the average retail price per gallon that was partially offset by a 3.6% increase in gallons sold to $714 million. The average retail price of fuel during this period was $3.40 a gallon compared to $4.49 a year ago. As a reminder, we define gross profit as revenue less cost of goods sold, but excluding depreciation and amortization. Casey's had gross profit of $878 million in the first quarter, an increase of $42 million or 5% from the prior year. This is driven by higher inside gross profit of $52.2 million or 10.3%, partially offset by a decrease of $11.2 million or 3.6% in fuel gross profit. Inside gross profit margin was 40.6%, up 80 basis points from a year ago. The grocery and general merchandise margin was 34.1%, that's an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year. The slight increase was due to a favorable mix shift with further penetration of private label products, a lower LIFO charge than in the prior year and favorable vendor funding. Prepared food and dispensed beverage margin was 58.2%, that's up 260 basis points from prior year. The category margin benefited from lower commodity costs, specifically cheese, which was $2.04 per pound for the quarter, that compares $2.49 per pound last year, a decrease of 18%. This positively impacted PF and DB margin by approximately 130 basis points. Margin also benefited from a lower LIFO charge in the prior year, as our input costs softened, which had an approximate 120 basis point impact. We are in the midst of adjusting certain benefits associated with our Casey's Rewards platform. And during the quarter, these one-time changes positively impacted PF and DB sales and margin by approximately $4.9 million. However, because we were concomitantly running a summer long promotional campaign of $0.89 fountain drinks, we did not see much of a net benefit from the program change. Fuel margin for the quarter was $0.416 per gallon, down $0.031 per gallon from the all-time high prior year's quarterly CPG. Fuel gross profit benefited by $20.2 million from the sale of RINs, and that's up $2.5 million from the same quarter in the prior year. Total operating expenses were up 3.2% or $17.6 million in the first quarter. Nearly 3% of the total operating expense increase is due to unit growth as we operated 82 more stores than the prior year. Credit card fees decreased approximately $6 million due to lower retail fuel prices and that offset essentially all remaining operating expense increases. Same-store employee expense was approximately flat, as the increase in wage rates was offset by the reduction in same--store hours. Depreciation in the quarter was $82.9 million, that's up $6.6 million versus the prior year, primarily due to operating more stores. Net interest expense was $12.5 million in the quarter, down $1.3 million versus the prior year, aided by rising interest rates on our cash balances. As a reminder, about 16% of our debt is floating rate. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% compared to 24.6% in the prior year. That decrease was driven by a one-time benefit that we recorded due to an income tax rate reduction in the state of Nebraska. Net income was up versus the prior year to $169.2 million, an increase of 10.7%. EBITDA for the quarter was $316.9 million compared to $293 million a year ago, an increase of 8.2%. Our balance sheet remains in excellent condition and we have ample financial flexibility. On July 31st, we had total available liquidity of $1.3 billion. Furthermore, we have no significant maturities coming due until fiscal 2026. Our leverage ratio, calculated in accordance with our senior notes, is now 1.7 times. For the quarter, net cash generated by operating activities of $229 million, less purchases of property and equipment of $69 million, resulted in the company generating $160 million in free cash flow. That compares to generating $194 million in the prior year. At the September meeting, the Board of Directors voted to maintain the quarterly dividend at $0.43 per share. During the first quarter, we also repurchased approximately $30 million of stock and have $370 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. Investing in EBITDA and ROIC accretive growth opportunities remains our primary capital allocation priority. But as we mentioned at our Investor Day, our balance sheet affords us the opportunity to be more opportunistic than in the recent past with regards to share repurchase. In our press release and during this call, we have and will mention several pending acquisitions. These acquisitions will be funded with cash on hand. The pending transaction with EG Group is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close this calendar year. As a result of the pending transactions, Casey's expects to add at least 150 stores in fiscal 2024. We will revisit the entire annual outlook following our second quarter earnings call. Our August results for the current quarter are as follows: Same-store sales, both inside and fuel gallons, are slightly below the midpoint of their respective annual outlooks. Fuel CPG through August was in the high-$0.30s. At current spot, cheese prices are modestly favorable versus the prior year, but less so than we experienced in the first quarter. Total operating expenses will be near the high end of our annual growth range in the second quarter and that's primarily due to timing. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Darren.\nDarren Rebelez: Thanks, Steve. I would like to express my gratitude to the entire Casey's team for delivering another great quarter. We're off to an extremely strong start to our fiscal year in our three-year strategic plan. Our M&A and real estate teams have been hard at work as we're very excited about the pending acquisition with EG Group and their 63 stores in Kentucky and Tennessee. These stores are located in rural and suburban markets, and we look forward to bringing more of our delicious pizza to Kentucky and Tennessee. It is complimentary to our existing footprint and within our distribution center's radii, further leveraging our scale and infrastructure. In the first quarter, we also introduced a refreshed app design that makes it easier than ever for our loyalty members to track their points, redeem for rewards, and see how much they've saved by shopping with Casey's Rewards. The program is nearing 7 million members, and we're excited to see the way our value proposition is resonating across the Midwest. Our guests have also gravitated to our private label products, and we exited the quarter approaching 350 items in the assortment with over 40 new items in the pipeline for the remainder of the calendar year. And the results are there; achieving nearly 10% unit share and over 10% gross profit share in the first quarter, with same store sales of 26%. On the ESG front, we released our third annual sustainability report in July, and it's available on our website. Our team has put in a lot of work to build a more sustainable business for Casey's, and we're excited to share our progress on this journey. As we look ahead to the second quarter of fiscal '24 and beyond, I'm excited about what Casey's has to offer. Our balance sheet gives us the ability to be disciplined but opportunistic with store growth and our capabilities throughout the organization will allow for that growth to be efficient and innovative. The plan we laid out in June has been well received and we have the team in place to execute on that plan at a high level and continue to deliver the kind of results our investors have come to expect from Casey's. Looking forward to seeing the results of our hard work in the quarters and years ahead. We will now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Anthony Bonadio of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAnthony Bonadio: Yeah. Hey, guys. Congrats on the nice quarter.\nDarren Rebelez: Good morning.\nAnthony Bonadio: So, I guess just starting with fuel margins, clearly a lot stronger than some of us were expecting. Seems like a pretty normal environment in terms of price action, but there does seem to be a growing consensus that breakevens are sort of drifting higher. I guess just any thoughts on underlying drivers of that dynamic? And then, how are you thinking about that mid-$0.30s number that you talked about as a modeling assumption when you gave the '24 guidance?\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, Anthony, this is Darren. I'll start with that. Like you said, it was a relatively normal quarter from a fuel margin standpoint. We had some -- a little bit of volatility here and there, but nothing of note. And I'd first just say that I think our team did a really great job of balancing that volume and margin. And when we look at volume numbers for the industry, [indiscernible] had those volume numbers down about 4.1% in our geography. So, I think our positive gallon growth was great. In terms of the outlook moving forward, I would prefer to be a little more on the conservative side, but I have to say that the more recent history, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks of nine quarters over $0.345, I think it would suggest that those margins may tick up a bit higher. And the pressure that we've talked about over the last couple of years with the smaller operators is still there. The cost of operating the business is still a challenge for a lot of those folks that don't have scale. And I think in the current environment the continued erosion of the cigarette category is putting additional pressure on those smaller operators. So, I would say if anything there's probably an upward bias on fuel margin moving forward.\nAnthony Bonadio: Got it. That's really helpful. And then, just quickly on operating expenses. Obviously, a very impressive quarter on costs. But on guidance, you raised your unit growth guidance by, it looks like, about 2% for fiscal '24, but left OpEx growth unchanged. So I guess one, why is that? And then two, assuming that still holds and fiscal Q1 is certainly a good data point, I guess what makes you more constructive about your progress there?\nSteve Bramlage: Yeah. Hey, Anthony. This is Steve. I'll maybe start with what's in or out of the guidance. So, we did raise the unit number that we expect to close for the year just based on the strong start to the year that we've had. We don't know the timing of exactly when any of those units are going to come into the system, so to speak, and the EG transaction, as we mentioned, that does require us to get regulatory approval. So all of our guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year was predicated on that initial unit number and so our numbers from an OPEC standpoint are still based on that original unit count. We haven't adjusted total OPEC's expectations for when those new units will come in yet because we just don't know when we'll get clearance to close those. So when we revisit the total outlook at the end of the second quarter, we'll be halfway through the year, I think we'll have a lot more clarity around exactly when those units come in and you know what impact they may have on all of the various metrics and we'll try to be as transparent as we can at that point in time.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens Inc. Your line is open.\nBen Bienvenu: Hey, good morning, guys.\nDarren Rebelez: Good morning.\nBen Bienvenu: So, I'm going to ask, you provided helpful color on quarter-to-date trends. My understanding or recollection is that August was probably a reasonably difficult comparison, just given last year, that was a period where we saw a precipitous drop in fuel prices off of a very high base following the onset of the Ukraine war. So, I'm wondering what does that mean for the compare in the period? And I know it's just the first quarter and the year, and you typically don't revisit guidance until you get a little bit further into the year. But how much does kind of what you're seeing quarter-to-date play into the decision not to address full year guidance?\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, Ben, this is Darren. I would say that, that's got nothing to do with our decision to not update guidance at this point. It's just been our standard practice to wait until the midpoint of the year where we have a bit more visibility into what's going on. So I would just emphasize, you should read nothing into the fact that we didn't update guidance other than the fact that we're one quarter into it, and we have another quarter before we typically do that. We did make the adjustment on the stores, because we already have under contract more stores than we had plan to open for the year. So that one, just mathematically, we felt obligated to adjust. But everything else, we're just going to wait till second quarter and with respect to how August played out, it was just, like Steve mentioned in his remarks, we were just slightly below the midpoint of our guidance on fuel and inside the store. And so I think that's what you should read into that.\nBen Bienvenu: Okay. Fair enough. Great. My second question is on M&A. You noted the balance sheet is still in a great position. The performance of the underlying business continues to improve. I know you've already had a pretty brisk pace with M&A to start the year. But presumably, your appetite is still there. And are there options out there in the market that are intriguing to you?\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah. I would say yes to both. I mean, we definitely have the flexibility on the balance sheet to do more deals, and we have the appetite for that. We're really only limited by what's available out there. And I think the macro environment is setting up really favorably for us. Like we've mentioned, costs have still been higher to operate, especially for those who don't have scale. The tobacco mix is starting to have an impact on folks, we believe. And so, we've seen a pretty good uptick in the opportunities that are out there for us to pursue. And we have -- our dedicated M&A team has been busy looking at all of those that makes sense for us, and we'll just have to see how that process plays out, but we're definitely in the market for that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBonnie Herzog: All right. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about your inside sales, which were quite healthy. So, maybe just hoping for a little bit more color on some of the key categories where you saw maybe the most growth? And then, also on your private label performance, maybe you could share with us just sort of where you're at with that business that you've rolled out and maybe how it trended throughout the quarter, especially in the context of the consumer? Thanks.\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, Bonnie, I'd say I was really happy with the inside sales performance, and it was -- we had strength across a lot of categories. I'd start with our prepared foods, up 5.9%, and that was cycling over 8.5% from the prior year. So really, really strong performance there. And what we really like about that is that it was led with our core with whole pizza pies. And so, the innovation around thin crust was something that was a gap in our menu and has really resonated well with our guests. And we've hit about 15% mix right out of the chute with that product, and that's about where we expect it to be, actually a little bit higher than what we expected to be compared to the industry overall. So that was strong. We have some other innovation in the hot lunch sandwich category with our barbecue brisket sandwich on the King's Hawaiian Buns. We did a nice collaboration from there, and that category was up 30% during the quarter as a result of that innovation. On the grocery and general merchant side, we saw real good strength in non-alcoholic beverages up about 8%. Our grocery category was up 7% and alcoholic beverages were up 6%. So really, really good strength across the board. Really the only area where we have some softness was in tobacco. And I think that's more of a driven by an industry dynamic more than anything else. With respect to private label, again, we're up 26% same-store in private label. Units were up close to 16%. So, what that indicates is that we had good velocity on the unit side, but we're also able to take a little bit of price and still keep that relative value proposition for the guests. And so that's been resonating with our guests, and we're really happy to explore where we're at on that one.\nBonnie Herzog: Okay. Helpful color. And if I may, just a follow-up on that. Just thinking about your inside margin expansion, which was also quite healthy. You did attribute it -- a lot of it, it sounded like to the softening of ingredient costs, specifically cheese. So curious to kind of hear how we should think about your margin performance for the rest of the year? And then, thinking about some of what you just mentioned, Darren, and some of the innovation that's driving growth, how has that been impacting margins? Is it accretive as you think about as you continue to evolve what you're offering in your store? Thanks.\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah. With respect to the innovation, I'll start there, and I'll let Steve talk a little bit more about the margin cadence. But, with the innovation we've really leaned heavier on that to drive traffic and to drive sales and less focused on some of the more aggressive value offers. I mean, we did do a little bit of that over the summer with a fountain drink promotion, and that worked out really well to drive traffic. But when we look at innovation on the food side, we've not had to discount that innovation, and we've been able to drive volume. And so, we think our team is really hitting its stride in terms of understanding what the guest needs are. And our culinary team is really developing those products. They are specifically hitting those needs, and that's what's resonating with the guests. And so, it's allowing us to drive that incremental growth without having to do a lot of discounting to get there.\nSteve Bramlage: Yeah. And Bonnie, this is Steve. I think we certainly continue to expect inside margin to improve year-over-year, that's reflected in the guidance on the grocery side of the business. The private label mix change in conjunction with, generally speaking, tobacco, becoming gradually a smaller part of the mix is going to naturally flatter the grocery margin and the real opportunity, as you know, is on the prepared food side of the business. And so, we're 80% hedged on our cheese buy for the remainder of this year. And so, less exposed to spot variability here in the out quarters. We were 18% to the good on cheese in the first quarter. We're kind of mid to high-single digits to the good in Q2, Q3 and Q4 as we sit here right now with spot, but the 80% hedge will won't give us quite as much upside as we saw in the first quarter, but I feel good about year-over-year deflation generally on the cheese side of the business. And by and large, there's still less pressure on the protein side of that business. And so, I think we still feel good that we will continue to show improvement year-over-year on the margins on the prepared food side of the business as the year progresses.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKelly Bania: Good morning. Thanks for taking our questions.\nDarren Rebelez: Good morning, Kelly.\nKelly Bania: Good morning. I wanted to just circle back to the inside comps in August. Sounds like maybe a little bit of a deceleration there, but can you give color on what you're seeing with traffic, ticket, grocery, prepared food? Or is this just maybe a little bit of cycling off this fountain drink promotion that was done over the summer? Or just anything that we should think about that's impacting kind of the trend near term?\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, Kelly, we still saw -- well, first, I'd say we had good traffic throughout the quarter. We were up a little over 1% in actual foot traffic into the store. And we saw that trend continue into August. So -- and we were running that fountain promotion at the same time throughout August. So really nothing there. I mean, it is really a cycling issue more than the deceleration issue, in my opinion. In the two-year comps, I think, we're pretty consistent with where we had been in the first quarter. So -- and again, we've got some higher comps coming into September as well. So I don't -- when we cycle over those higher comps, I start to focus a little bit more on the two-year stack and to make sure that we're still maintaining that momentum there. And so, so far, that's what we've seen. And so, I don't have any concerns about the absolute number being a little bit lower than where we were in the first quarter.\nSteve Bramlage: Yeah. I think, Kelly, just for reference, our inside number in the prior year was almost 8%. So, we're cycling that. And August would have been indicative of that. And so, it's really just what are you lapping in the prior year more than anything.\nKelly Bania: Great. That's very helpful. I was also just wondering if you can talk about with some of these new prepared food innovation, if you're able to use your data, your loyalty to analyze if you're getting incremental customers that you weren't maybe reaching before, or if you're simply cannibalizing kind of prior products, or maybe what your early read is on how this innovation is reaching your customer base?\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah. So far, we've been really happy with the performance on the prepared food side. And we think about, on the thin crust pizza in particular, we think about half of that has truly been incremental to the business. And what some of our loyalty data would suggest is that about 16% of those sales were by new buyers into the pizza category. So, in other words, people that weren't buying pizza from us before, about 12% were new guests entirely. And so that's been really helpful. And that was really our hypothesis going into the thin crust was that there are certain guests that that's all they want. And that's going to be a veto vote in a family if we don't have that offer. And so far, that's all played out. And the rewards data would validate that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Bobby Griffin of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nBobby Griffin: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions.\nDarren Rebelez: Good morning.\nSteve Bramlage: Good morning.\nBobby Griffin: I guess, first, I wanted to maybe talk about have you seen any small change in customer behavior or anything as you start to see gas prices move up sequentially? Still not at the peak levels we saw back last year, but we have started to see them move up. So, just anything curious about if you're starting to see behavior similar to what was happening in the prior period of very high gas prices?\nDarren Rebelez: No, Bobby, we haven't seen a dramatic shift in that. And gas price is still about $1 a gallon, below where they were last year when we hit the peak. So, the pressure is probably not as acute on gas. Where we do see some changes in behavior is really on the lower-income consumer. As a reminder, we are not overly exposed to that consumer. We only have about a quarter of our guests would fit in that category, about three quarters are -- make more than $50,000 a year. And so, they're out of that lower income. And so, for that lower-income consumer, we do see some shifting around on fuel. They're buying higher ethanol blended fuels and our E15 offering at about 15% gallon growth in the quarter. So that would be indicative of that. Private label is purchased more frequently by them, and we are seeing some pressure in some categories that were a little more EBT sensitive like take-home dairy and some edible grocery, but that's primarily from the lower-income consumer. And obviously, even within that grocery category, with a little bit of pressure in some subcategories, we're still up 7% year-over-year. So, we think while there is a little bit of that behavior changing at the lower end, overall for the total gas space, it's not having a big impact.\nBobby Griffin: All right. I appreciate it. That's helpful. And then maybe secondly for me is just on the ongoing strong performance in OpEx with the store hour reductions and optimization. Just anything more detail on kind of where you are in that journey, kind of what you're still finding and where areas of the store are getting optimized? And I guess, secondly, is it across the network that you're seeing these savings, or is it more like, hey, we've identified a subset of stores in certain regions that we're getting better optimization out of? Just any further clarity around there, because the performance has been very strong.\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah. Thanks. No, I'm really proud of the continuous improvement team that's been working on this. And this has been going on for over a year now. And what I'd tell you first is that they're really taking a scientific approach to where those bottlenecks are in our store operation, where we are spending labor that is just not having an impact on the business and how we can change those processes or employ technology to make them more efficient. And so, I feel really good about the fact that we've taken these hours out, but our engagement scores are up among our team members and our OSAT scores are up among our guests. So, it's an indication that we're just simply running this business more effectively and not having a negative impact on the guest experience or our team members. In terms of the sustainability, obviously, whenever you go into one of these exercises, there's some low-hanging fruit and you get that first. But our team has a pipeline or a roadmap for the next three years of discrete initiatives that they've identified that we can implement and continue to take OpEx out of the store or give the store more slack to run the store better. So, we feel this is sustainable, and we still have a few years to go in terms of capturing all these opportunities.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Irene Nattel of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nIrene Nattel: Thanks, and good morning everyone.\nDarren Rebelez: Good morning, Irene.\nIrene Nattel: Good morning. I wanted to come back to the subject of gas margins, which obviously is a great interest to all investors. So, as you noted, it's what, five quarters that you've been in and around that $0.40 range. What would it take for you guys to get more comfortable with sort of a soft guide towards something in the high-$0.30s or even $0.40 versus the mid-$0.30s?\nDarren Rebelez: Well, Irene, that's a really nuanced question. For me to get more comfortable, I just have to see more of it, I suppose. Admittedly, it took me a while to get comfortable with mid-30s. But we got there because we just kept doing it. And so, I think we were able to get to $0.40 this last quarter. I would say last year, with everything going on in the Ukraine, we saw that spike in those $0.40s kind of came through more of an exogenous event. So, I would want to see a little bit longer timeframe of more normal -- of a more normal macro environment and margins at this level before I'd feel comfortable underwriting that, at that level, at the upper $0.30s, low $0.40s. But the mid-$0.30s, because we've been there for so long. I'm very comfortable at that level.\nIrene Nattel: Fair enough, and that's very helpful. Thank you. And then just a couple of follow-ups. One, you noted that you're 80% hedged on cheese prices. At what price? And you also noted an uptick in M&A activity. What are you seeing on multiples in terms of expectations?\nDarren Rebelez: Well, I'd say with multiple expectations, it's an interesting dynamic, because I would say that the EBITDA for some of these smaller operators has actually gone down, so the multiples are kind of hanging in there, but at a lower level of EBITDA. And I know that's counterintuitive given the margins that we're seeing, but I think it's really indicative of the fact that these smaller players that lack scale haven't been able to offset a lot of the cost increases in a way a company like ourselves has been able to. And so, they're just under a lot of pressure even though they've got those higher margins. And so, I think that's worked out to our benefit. And I forget the second part of your question.\nSteve Bramlage: Maybe, I'll try to answer that. So, we are 80% hedged, that's correct, and at the current spot. We, obviously, hedge the commodity, that's a little bit different than the all-in cost that we pay. But the all-in equivalent for the out quarters looks a lot like what we incurred in the first quarter. So kind of that [$2.12] (ph) or low-teen number is about what our strip looks like here for the rest of the year at the current spot.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please, for our next question. Our next question will come from Daniel Silverstein of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nDaniel Silverstein: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Just one on the EG acquisition. So that deal add some stores, which will serve denser, larger metro areas like Bowling Green and Lexington, Kentucky. Just wondering if you're seeing more opportunities to penetrate larger markets given the landscape today? And how you view the opportunities and challenges of bringing the Casey's brand to those denser areas? Thanks.\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah, Dan. When we think about markets like Bowling Green and Lexington, those aren't real or significantly larger markets than a lot of the markets we operate in today. Lexington is a city that's comparable to in size to Des Moines where we're based. And so, we're very comfortable at that level. This isn't a Chicago or Los Angeles or New York type of scenario by any stretch. And so, if I've been to both of those markets. Bowling Green is a fantastic market for us. Lexington will be a great market for us. So -- and we're very comfortable operating in towns of this size. So, I don't have any concerns there.\nDaniel Silverstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nKrisztina Katai: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on private label. So that 10% unit share and the gross profit contribution you shared with us is a great result. Maybe can you talk about where you are in the process of that rollout? Any particular areas where you're seeing significant strength? I think you called out 16% unit growth. So, my question is, is that broad-based? Or are there any particular areas that are driving that performance?\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah. Krisztina, we're still continuing to evolve the private label portfolio. We've got another 40 items that will go into the assortment by the end of the year. And we're -- at the same time, we're optimizing products. So, as some products start to atrophy a little bit, we'll remove them from the assortment and we bring in new innovation. And so that's a constant process that our private label team is operating with. With respect to where we saw some strength, certainly bottled water was probably our strongest, up about 70% in sales. And now our bottled water is about 50% of that bottled water category, our private labels. So, really strong performance there. Obviously, that's a little bit seasonal in the summertime, but we're seeing great growth year-over-year in that. Another category that's been really strong is chips. In chips, it's usually a pretty tough one because it's a very competitive category. But we had some new innovation with some new flavors that were seasonal just for this summer and saw north of 70% same-store sales in that category as well. And now that category is about 25% penetrated. And again, with the competitive landscape in that category, that's a big statement. So, we like where we are there. And we've seen some broader base strength, but those are the really kind of the standouts that we've seen so far.\nKrisztina Katai: That's great. And then just my follow-up. I was going to ask around pizza and, in particular, the 12% new guests that you mentioned, I think, following the thin crust introduction. Have you seen any competitive response to you taking pizza share? Or do you anticipate any changes in the promotional landscape or anything around pricing?\nDarren Rebelez: Not at this point. We -- it's a little bit hard for me to say whether we've taken share from any of the major competitors. For the most part, pizza is our primary competitor in most of our markets, if we have one. In a lot of cases, in our more rural markets, there may not be a competitor, or if there is one, that's more of a mom and pop. So really difficult to say, but I couldn't tell you that we've seen an uptick in promotional activity from competitors since we've launched the thin crust. I think the other pizza players have struggled a little bit from a velocity standpoint. So, I think they're starting to get a little more promotional anyway, but I haven't seen any change as a result of what we've done.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please for our next question. Our next question will come from John Lawrence of Benchmark. Your line is open.\nJohn Lawrence: Good morning, guys.\nDarren Rebelez: Good morning.\nJohn Lawrence: Would you discuss a little bit about the new markets? How quickly does some of this innovation, some of the new products, does that help get those maybe the class of new stores in the last couple of years up and running and ramping a little faster? And what have you noticed with product innovations and maybe the app in some of those new markets?\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah. John, I'm not so sure that we've seen a difference in terms of the impact innovation has had in the new stores. That being said, we've been really happy with the way our new stores have ramped in the last couple of years. I think that's really a testament to the real estate team and their ability to use more advanced analytics to identify high potential sites and get those sites under contract. And so, we've just seen an increase in how quickly those stores have ramped in general. I think the innovation only helps in that respect, and it gets more people interested in the stores and helps feed that traffic into those stores.\nJohn Lawrence: Great. And secondly, remind us a little bit on that fuel margin. You talked at Analyst Day about some of the things, some of the tools you're using to help with the analytics on that data, on gas prices, et cetera. Would you remind us of that, please?\nDarren Rebelez: Yeah. We've had for -- a number of years, we've had some more analytic tools. We've essentially just given the pricing analysts the information that they need to make more informed decisions. So they've got a real-time credit card data that allows us to see where competitors are priced. We've got information feeding to them from the commodity market, so they know where cost is moving at any given time. And so, they really have a -- and then they have inventory information from the store. So, at any given time, they really have a complete picture of all the factors that would influence price within a particular trade area. And so, they're just simply able to make more informed decisions as a result of that.\nOperator: Thank you. I see no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the conference back to Darren Rebelez for closing remarks.\nDarren Rebelez: Okay. Thank you for taking the time today to join us on the call. And before we sign off, I want to thank the team members for all their hard work this quarter, and everybody, have a great rest of the day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day."
