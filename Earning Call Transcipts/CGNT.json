Now I would like to turn the call over to Elad.\nElad Sharon: Thank you, Dean. Welcome, everyone, to our third quarter conference call. I want to start to thank our employees, customers, partners, investors and friends for standing with Israel and for the inspiring show of solidarity. Our hearts go out to those affected by a horrible attack in Israel and its consequences. Cognyte's mission is to help make the world a safer place and we strive to meet this commitment every single day. The company knows how to respond to challenging circumstances, and we've made the necessary adjustments to continue to effectively run the business. We remain focused on our mission, and we continue to deliver on our commitments to our customers, bringing them the highly advanced technology they need to make the world safer. Now turning to our results. We are pleased with our continuing improvement in our performance over the last two quarters. In Q3, revenue, gross margin, operating income and adjusted EBITDA came in ahead of our expectations. Revenue grew both year-over-year and sequentially and came in at $79 million. Non-GAAP gross margin came in at 70.2% and gross profit grew faster than revenue, and we delivered positive operating income ahead of our expectations. During the quarter, we continue to win deals with both new and existing customers, recognize the strength of our innovative technology and its ability to deliver to them high value. The visibility we currently have into our business, together with our Q3 performance allow us to raise guidance again for the year. Now I'll start with a review of several of our significant wins. Then I'll elaborate on how AI continues to drive valuable decision intelligence to our customers. And lastly, I'll further discuss our updated outlook. Let me share a few of our recent wins that help illustrate how our advanced solutions are differentiated and why customers choose Cognyte. Our investigative analytic solutions have national security, law enforcement, national intelligence and other organizations to accelerate and perform more effective investigations. The first win is for approximately $50 million with an existing national security customer for its threat hunting mission to prevent cyberattacks on a national level. We believe we were selected because of our customer successful experience with our previous deployment and our unique ability to fuse and enrich large amounts of data and deliver insights that are vital to identify cyberattacks on a nationwide scale. The second win is for approximately $50 million from an existing national law enforcement agency to combat criminal activities. It was a single source deal to upgrade the existing solution to address the customers' evolving needs. We believe we won because of our high value we deliver and track record of strong execution. The third win is with a new federal agency to help them be anonymize the illegal cryptocurrency transactions in real time. The deal is for approximately $3 million and it's a multi subscription. We believe the customer chose our solution because it quickly provides unique value using our innovative AI and proprietary algorithms for pattern recognition within high volumes of data. We continue our focus on expanding in the U.S. And during Q3, we had two wins with new customers. Both deals are competitive, and we believe we won because of our superior technology and the high value our solutions deliver. Customer engagement remains a focus area for us. Last month, we participated in Milipol Paris, which is a leading security industry conference. During the conference, we had good customer traction and many productive conversations. We believe that our cutting-edge solutions and deep domain expertise drive our leadership position and help us to continue to win significant deals from both existing and new customers. In our recent calls, I gave a few examples of how our customers leveraging the artificial intelligence that we continue to incorporate into our solutions. I will now further elaborate on how AI helps driving valuable decision intelligence to our customers. Customers view us as a strategic trusted partner that provides innovative solutions that help them improve the speed, accuracy and success rate of their investigations and make timely decisions by generating critical insights from enormous amounts of diversified data. We help them do this by utilizing decision intelligence capabilities. Decision Intelligence involves advanced analytics and AI, including machine learning technologies along with data fusion, data virtualization and collaboration tools to augment and improve decision-making. The goal is to empower humans to make faster and more accurate decisions. Our Decision Intelligence enabled solutions provide our customers a holistic accessible view of their data and deliver actionable insights that would be virtually impossible to obtain through legacy technology or manual analysis. These capabilities provide significant value to our customers. With increasingly sophisticated capabilities of bad actors, together with the challenge of constantly evolving technology and data overload, the ability to make smarter and timely data-driven decisions that become even more critical and complicated. Traditional analytical tools tend to simply summarize trends or provide insights that are sometimes insufficient and limit the ability to take actions. With more powerful analytics solutions are deployed. These tools are often only available to a limited group of data scientists or technical experts. Our solutions address those challenges by rapidly uncovering and delivering critical insights and making those insights accessible to technical and non-technical experts, including analysts, investigators and decision makers. It also empowers personnel to ask questions, challenge ideas and make use of data-driven insights rather than relying on historical trends or gut instincts in making key decisions. We continue to leverage the latest AI developments for commercially available models and our own AI research lab to further enhance our solutions' ability to deliver impactful results to our customers. We believe our ability to continue and embed the latest innovations together with our domain expertise in investigative analytics will further enhance the value we provide to our customers and our differentiation. Turning to our outlook for this fiscal year. Given our performance during Q3 and current visibility, we are raising our revenue guidance for the year to $311 million, plus or minus 1%, representing approximately 10% year-over-year growth at midpoint on an SCS adjusted non-GAAP basis. With revenue expected to grow by about 10%, we now expect gross profit to grow faster at more than 20% year-over-year on an SCS adjusted non-GAAP basis. We now expect adjusted EBITDA for the year to be about $8 million. Looking beyond this year, we believe that the combination of positive industry trends, our innovative technology and our large global customer base position us well for growth and improving profitability. To summarize, our customers continue to face significant and growing challenges across many use cases and look to us for solutions that help them accelerate investigations, make decisions faster through decision intelligence and mitigate a variety of threats. Our customers' U.S. domain experts and a trusted partner and frequently tell us that our solutions significantly improved the results enabling them to effectively perform their missions and make the world safer. Our established long-term relationship with customers continue to be a significant asset for us. We are pleased with our third quarter results and our return to profitability and our raising guidance for the current year. Looking beyond this year, we expect continuing revenue growth and further improvement in profitability. Now let me turn the call over to David to provide more details about our Q3 results and outlook. David?\nDavid Abadi: Thank you, Elad, and hello, everyone. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. The conciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available, as Dean mentioned, in our earnings release and in the Investors section of our website. Our website also include a financial dashboard with a tab that detail our historical results, excluding the divested Situation Intelligence solutions. We are very pleased with the continuing improvement in our performance over the last few quarters. In Q3, revenue, gross margin, operating income and adjusted EBITDA came in ahead of our expectations. We continue to win significant deals from both existing and new customers, reflecting the demand for our cutting-edge investigative analytics solutions. Q3 revenue grew both sequentially and year-over-year, coming in at $79.4 million, up $2.3 million from Q2 and $17.9 million from Q3 last year. Gross profit grew faster than revenue and was up 4.5% sequentially and 48.4% year-over-year. Q3 gross margin was 70.2%, up 910 basis points from Q3 last year, primarily due to the increase in software revenue. We are pleased with our software gross margin of 78.9%. Our gross margin reflects our competitive differentiation and ability to continuously create value for our customers. Our Q3 non-GAAP operating expense were $54.5 million similar to the level in previous quarter. Our Q3 non-GAAP operating income was $1.2 million and adjusted EBITDA was $4.6 million. In the first nine months of the year, our overall revenue grew by $18 million, representing 8.5% year-over-year growth, and our software revenue grew by $19 million representing 10.1% year-over-year growth. Our year-to-date non-GAAP gross margin increased 730 basis points to 69.3% and our non-GAAP gross profit increased approximately 21% year-over-year as a result of our high software revenue and the value we deliver for our customers. All the metrics I just discussed are on SAS adjusted non-GAAP basis. We are pleased with our execution and we see trend of continuing improvement in our financial performance. Our revenue growth, coupled with improved gross margin and cost structure to drive margin expansion and operating income. During the first nine months of the year, we generated $4.7 million of adjusted EBITDA ahead of our expectation. Turning to cash. For the first nine months of the year with a positive cash flow from operations of $24.8 million. The positive cash flow from operation was driven by our improved financial results and strong cash collection. In terms of balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash of about $74 million and no debt. Our long charter RPO continued to be strong. Total RPO at the end of Q3 was $585.7 million, and short-term RPO was $290.9 million. In our view, this healthy backlog, combined with our continuing solid results allow us to increase our outlook for the current year for the fourth consecutive quarter. For fiscal 2024, we are now raising our revenue outlook to $311 million, plus or minus 5%, reflecting approximately 10% year-over-year growth on an SAS adjusted non-GAAP basis at the midpoint of the revenue range. Now let me share with you more color about our outlook. We're increasing our full year non-GAAP gross margin expectation to 69%, an improvement of 100 basis points versus our previous outlook and year-over-year improvement of 620 basis points on an SAS adjusted non-GAAP basis. For our non-GAAP operating expense, we continue to expect total expenses of approximately $220 million for the full year. Given our strong performance in Q3 and our expectation for Q4, we now expect to have positive adjusted EBITDA of about $8 million for the full year at the midpoint of the revenue range an increase of about $6 million versus our previous outlook. We continue to work on optimizing our cash tax payments. As a result of this work, we're expecting to record a non-GAAP tax provision of about $8 million for the year, an additional improvement of $1 million versus our outlook last quarter. In terms of EPS, we are now expecting a $0.24 annual non-GAAP EPS loss at the midpoint of the revenue range, an improvement of $0.09 versus our previous outlook. Q4 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be loss versus a gain in Q3 as a result of fluctuation in our non-GAAP tax expenses. We believe that the combination of positive industry trend our loyal and global customer base, together with our innovative technology and our LC backlog positions us well for growth and improved profitability. To summarize, we believe we are a market leader in investigative analytics and they have a strong and lengthy track record with customers around the world. We continue to add capabilities and improve the performance of our solution by leveraging the latest technologies, including emerging innovations in artificial intelligence. We believe these innovations increase the value our customers generate from our solution and help drive demand. The combination of our cutting-edge technology, large and lower customer base and the opportunity to address the needs of existing and new customers position us well profitable growth. We are very pleased with the progress we made this year, including raising our annual guidance every quarter and improving our visibility and profitability. Looking forward to next year, we expect another year of revenue growth and margin expansion and plan to provide guidance for FY '25 during our Q4 earnings call. With that, I would like to hand the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question coming from the line of Mike Cikos with Needham. Your line is open.\nMike Cikos: Hi, guys. Congrats on the solid execution here in a couple of quarters that have been shrunk together at this point. Good to see for the Cognyte story. So hats off on that. I did want to start on the revenues. And I know that you guys are discussing the significant number of new deals - or I'm sorry, a significant number of deals that were won during the quarter from both new and existing customers. Can you help us think about what you guys are actually seeing out there in the market? And where I'm going with this is the deals that are being won for - from both new and existing customers, like you obviously have a good line of sight and visibility into these deals. Are customers demonstrating increased confidence with respect to their budgets? Or is it potentially -- is there any movement in sales cycles or sales velocity increasing? If you could talk through budget and sales velocity, those two would be helpful.\nElad Sharon: Yes. Thank you, Mike. So our customer mission is to increase the speed, accuracy and success rate of investigations. The demand drivers are strong and solid, which means, first of all, the bad actors are more sophisticated. They're more organized, well-funded, using the advance technology themselves and better at hiding. Customers also have to deal with data volumes and diversity that are growing quickly. And as a result, the complexity for uncovering critical insights and conclude investigations successfully and on time is becoming more complicated for them. And for that reason, they need the investigative analytics technology. It's a race because this is not a static situation. Customers - you mentioned existing customers, for example, existing customers, have to continue and buy more in order to scale up their solutions to deal with more data and more diversified data and they also need to add more functionality in terms of more analytics, more AI in order for them to uncover more insights out of their existing data sets. And this is driving the need of the customers. About the examples I gave earlier in the call, -- so we had two significant deals from existing customers. One of them added another use case for threat hunting. It's related to cyber threats on a national level. The other one is an upgrade of functionality and having more capacity and capabilities to generate more insights. And the third one is related to crypto currency. So you can see many different use cases. And all of them require the technology, which means fusing and analyzing data at scale with strong analytics to uncover hidden insights. So we see that many customers, existing and new ones need this technology. The traction is very good with customers and we feel good about the growth opportunity.\nMike Cikos: Got it. And while we're on the top line conversation around those customers as well? I know in your prepared remarks, you cited those two new customer wins in the United States specifically, right? And good to hear that there were competitive wins and you guys went out on technology and the value proposition. Can you give us an update on progress in the U.S. market? How are we trending as far as building out pipeline and getting more of these deals ideally across the finish line?\nElad Sharon: Yes, sure. So first of all, about the U.S. market, we keep our decision to expand process in the U.S. We think that it presents an opportunity for us. Market penetration is obviously takes time. It's a process. It's not like a repeat business from existing customers. We had to adjust some - to make some product adjustments. We have to work on brand awareness. And mainly, we have to push out incumbents. So we see interest in our products. We were able to deliver already for customers from previous deals we had and in Q3, actually, what we saw is that we are able to win deals that both were competitive wins. It was in two different states. In both, it was replacing incumbents. And in both we won because of the high value our technology delivers. We see it as a process, and we believe that we'll be able to gradually grow the business in the U.S. over time. About the general market, I think you asked before, we do see more and more countries having better visibility into the budget. And for that reason, for this reason, we were able, first of all, to be ahead of our expectations in Q3, but also improve visibility and increase - give guidance or raise guidance for Q4 and for the year. I hope this answers, Mike.\nMike Cikos: It did. It did. And maybe one more question before I turn it over to my colleagues, but I know good to see the gross margin guidance here creeping up by another point for that 69% you're talking to for the full year and the gross margin growth actually coming in at 20% plus on a year-over-year basis, right? So I just wanted to get a sense, is there any reason why from Q3 where you did 70.2% versus Q4, why gross margins would decline? Is there something we should keep in mind either from what you guys see in your backlog? Or maybe anything that's more seasonal in nature? Any reason why that gross margin would be declining sequentially?\nDavid Abadi: Yes. Mike, it's David. In general, gross margin may reflect - in general, gross margin can fluctuate between quarter-over-quarter. But overall, as you can see, the trend is very positive. You can see that over the last few quarters, our gross margin is growing in the software and also in the - overall in the professional services. So you can see that the dynamics behind the gross margin are the right dynamics. The more revenue for software, you see the better gross margin. In any given quarter, there may be, I would say, limited fluctuation that can take place. Given the current backlog that we see in the scheduling for Q4, we are focusing now 69% for the full year. But it is always an opportunity like to improve the gross margin over time. We believe that given the strength of our solution and the technology advantage that we bring to the table, we can get gross margin on the right direction and continue with this trend over time.\nMike Cikos: Got it. Thank you, David. And thank you, Elad for the thoughtful responses. I’ll turn it over to my colleagues.\nElad Sharon: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question coming from the line of Peter Levine with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nPeter Levine: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question here and I thought it's a great way to go out to you and your families back at home. But maybe the first question appreciate the color in the quarter, but anything that you can kind of help guide us for fiscal '25 in terms of when - how do you think about an inflection in the business? And then when you think about the top line, maybe just help us understand the visibility you have today and the confidence that back to your commentary around seeing some reacceleration into next year. Just maybe help us frame that out for - as we think about our models.\nElad Sharon: Yes, hi Peter. So we have a strong global customer base. We have differentiated technology. We have a lot of traction with customers. We do see their needs. We are pleased with the execution that we had in the last few quarters. We have good visibility into our backlog and it's reflected in Q3 performance and also in the guidance we gave. We believe that we should see more growth and margin expansion over time. The reason for that is that the demand drivers, as I mentioned before, which is the bad actors that are becoming more sophisticated, the data volumes that are growing and customers have to scale up their solutions, and also the fact that it's more difficult to uncover hidden insights and actually prevent threats before they unfold is becoming more and more complicated. We see this - those demand drivers continue and becoming a stronger over time. And for that reason, we believe that we can continue and growing top line and with margin expansion going forward. About the specifics of the numbers for next year, we'll give guidance for FY '25 in next earnings call in Q4 call.\nPeter Levine: Perfect. And then maybe share with us in terms of metrics for the business, net retention, gross retention in the quarter, any changes that you've seen nine months since your fiscal year, you can share with us any color in terms of metrics that get you more excited about the outlook.\nDavid Abadi: Hi Peter, it's David. So from a KPI perspective, there was no - I would say, there was not any indicator that show us that something goes to the wrong direction. Actually, the opposite. We do see the positive trend. Overall, we are continuing to deliver and execute our plan ahead of our expectations. On top of that, we were able to bring the backlog to higher levels. So overall, if you look at the KPI that we are looking on the day-to-day, we're seeing a positive trend. We are not sharing customer retention and stuff like that. But in general, we do see strong renewals and a positive trend across the execution.\nPeter Levine: Perfect. Thank you very much for taking my questions.\nDavid Abadi: Thank you, Peter.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I see no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to Dean Ridlon for any closing remarks.\nDean Ridlon: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. We are planning to visit the U.S. early next month and hope to see some of you then. In the meantime, should you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me. And we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you all for attending.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Welcome, everyone to our second quarter conference call. I'm pleased to report that our positive momentum continues. During the quarter we continue to win deals with existing customers, as well as with new strategic customers, recognize the strengths of our innovative technology and the value it delivers. Our team executed very well and we had another quarter of solid results. Revenue grew both year-over-year and sequentially on an SIS adjusted non-GAAP basis and came in ahead of our expectations at $77 million. We also saw further improvements in gross margin, which was up 450 basis points over Q2 last year. And gross profit increased 13% year-over-year on an SIS adjusted non-GAAP basis. Adjusted EBITDA was positive for the quarter, two quarters earlier than projected and free cash flow was positive again this quarter due to the positive EBITDA and continuing strong collections. As a reminder, we took many actions last year to address the challenges we faced and put the business back on track. We focused the business on fewer agendas, divested SIS, adjusted the cost structure, improved our capital structure, and focused our investment on high potential opportunities in R&D and sales, including investing in AI. We are realizing the benefits of our actions and improved execution. We regained visibility, resumed guidance, and have raised our outlook for the year three quarters in a row. We believe the positive momentum will continue and we are on a path of sustainable growth. Now, I will start with a review of our significant wins, then I'll share with you a few use cases that illustrate how our use of AI and other innovations differentiates our solutions and delivers a significant value to our customers. And lastly, I'll discuss our updated outlook for the year. I will now review some of our recent significant wins that highlight our market-leading differentiated technology. Our investigative analytics solutions help national security, law enforcement, national intelligence, and other security organizations to accelerate and perform more effective investigations. The first win is for more than $20 million with a new national security customer for its mission to combat terrorism and national threats. We believe we are selected because of our cutting edge technology, including how we leverage artificial intelligence, which delivers the impactful results. We consistently outperform solutions from other vendors during a variety of real-world operational scenarios. In addition, we believe the customer valued our deep domain expertise and views us as a strategic partner to help them address their long-term evolving needs. The second win is for approximately $4 million from a new unit inside an existing national intelligence customer to combat terror activities. We replaced an incumbent vendor and believe we are selected because of our higher investigation value. The customer was seeking a state-of-the-art solution to address the evolving needs by enabling a broader group of users with varying skill sets and expertise to maximize the intelligence value delivered. The third win is with a new national intelligence customer for approximately $2.5 million to identify and prevent threats during operations. The customer chose us after a competitive process due to our superior technology. We delivered better operational results during comprehensive field trial in different operational scenarios. Also, we recently had another new customer win in the U.S., we replaced an incumbent vendor for an competitive bid, and we continue our focus on expanding in the U.S. market over time. Our cutting-edge solutions and deep domain expertise drive our leadership position and help us to continue to win significant deals from both existing and new customers. Customers view us as a strategic trusted partner that provides innovative solutions that help them generate timely critical insights from their data, accelerate investigations, and improve the speed and accuracy of their decision-making. In our last call, I talked about the reuse of artificial intelligence in our solutions. Now I'll drill down a bit more on our innovative technology and examples of a few customer use cases. Cognyte’s focus is on investigative analytics to help our customers improve the speed and success rate of their investigations by effectively analyzing enormous amounts of structured and unstructured data and generating timely impactful insights. We have been doing this for many years and developed unique domain expertise and a vast technology in investigative analytics. We believe that recent investments in AI technology is accelerating our innovations and positions us as a highly differentiated leader in the investigating analytics market. We have embedded AI models in our solutions to improve velocity and accuracy of customers' insights from data. For example, the introduction of cutting-edge AI technology for pattern recognition enables our customers to reveal previously undiscoverable connections among entities under investigation, such as bad actors and financial transactions. This technological advancement improves investigation success rates and accelerates down to resolution. Customers are reacting positively to these recent advancements. To help illustrate customers' benefits for our solutions, let's look at two security use cases. The first use case is for combating drug trafficking. Law enforcement units better responsibility of detecting and preventing drug trafficking activities along major international borders. This illicit trade often involves organized groups that exploit well-established routes, conceal their identities, and attempt to master illegal activities as legitimate ones. Within our solutions, AI models play a pivotal role in expediting the analysis of our customers' data sources. Our software helps customers identify suspicious activities, such as unusual behavior, and automatically trigger alerts for users by using AI pattern recognition. In addition, our use of AI enables our solutions to more quickly predict potential hotspot and routes for drug smuggling activities. Those valuable insights help investigation units in closing cases faster and more effectively. The second use case is related to detection and prevention of terror activities. Financial intelligence units are tasked with detecting and disrupting the flow of funds to terror organizations. Terror funding involves illicit financial transactions, money laundering, and other covert activities that facilitate terrorist activities. The challenge lies in the fact that these transactions are often masked as donations, charity, and fraudulent purchasing of goods. Our solution utilizes the algorithm to analyze vast amounts of financial transaction data from various customer data sources, including bank records, money transfer services, and cryptocurrency exchanges. The system utilizes their part of recognition algorithms to continuously monitor these data streams to identify patterns and anomalies in financial transactions that may indicate potential terror-funding activities. We continue to leverage the latest AI development for commercially available models and our own AI research lab. Looking ahead, we believe our ability to embed the latest AI innovations quickly, together with our domain expertise in investigating analytics, will further enhance our differentiation and the value we provide to our customers. We continue to invest in AI to generate demand and contribute to driving long-term growth. Turning to our outlook for this fiscal year, given the important visibility and our performance during Q2, we are raising our revenue guidance for the year to $307 million, plus or minus 2%, representing 8.5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint on an SIS adjusted non-GAAP basis. With revenue expected to grow by 8.5%, we now expect gross profit to grow faster at more than 15% year-over-year on an SIS adjusted non-GAAP basis. Given our positive adjusted EBITDA in Q2 and our improved revenue outlook and profitability, we are now expecting positive adjusted EBITDA for the year. Looking beyond this year, given the recent innovations in AI, we have identified potential opportunities to expand our business with both existing and new customers. We believe that the combination of positive industry trends, our innovative technology, and our large global customer base positions us well for growth. Before I summarize, I would like to recognize the significant contributions Dan Bodner had made to Cognyte over the last three decades in his roles as Verint CEO and after the spin-off as Cognyte’s Chairman of our Board. Dan had a tremendous impact on the creation and growth of our business over the years, and his wisdom and knowledge were a great asset to Cognyte. I personally I’m appreciative for all his support and advice. We then stepping down as a Director, I'm looking forward to collaborating with Earl Shank in his new role as our Chairman, and with the rest of the board to continue to drive growth and profitability at Cognyte. To summarize, our customers continue to face significant challenges across many use cases and looked to us to help them accelerate investigations and mitigate the right variety of threats. We have established a long-term relationships with many of our customers and they view us as domain experts and trusted partners. These relationships will continue to be a significant asset for us. We are pleased with our second quarter results and positive momentum and are raising guidance for the current year. Long-term, we expect continued growth and improved stability. Now, let me turn the call over to David to provide more details about our Q2 results and outlook. David?\nDavid Abadi: Thank you, Elad, and hello everyone. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available as Dean mentioned in our earnings release and in the investor section of our website. Our website also includes a financial dashboard with a tab that details our historical results excluding the divested situation intelligence solutions. We are very pleased with our improved performance over the last few quarters. In Q2, revenue, gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, and cashflow from operation came in ahead of our expectation. We continue to win deals from both existing and new customers, reflecting the demand for our cutting-edge investigative analytics solutions. Q2 revenue grew both sequentially and year-over-year, coming in at $77 million, up $3.7 million from Q1 and $4.2 million from Q2 last year. About 87% of our revenue was software. Gross profit grew faster than revenue and was up 6.2% sequentially and 13.1% year-over-year. Q2 gross margin was 69.2%, up 450 basis points from Q2 last year, primarily due to the increase in software revenue. We are pleased with our software gross margin of 77.4% and our professional services gross margin of 16.1%. Our gross margin inflates our competitive differentiation and ability to continuously create value for our customer. All the metrics I just discussed are on SIS adjusted non-GAAP basis. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating expense were $54.3 million, similar to Q1 level. Over the last few quarters, we focused the organization and improve our cost structure, resulting in sequential revenue growth, higher gross margin, and return to positive adjusted EBITDA and significantly reduced operating loss. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating loss was $0.9 million and adjusted EBITDA was positive $2.3 million. We generated break-even adjusted EBITDA for the first-half of the year ahead of our expectations. Turning to cash. During Q2, we delivered positive cash flow from operation of $6.3 million. For the first-half of the year, we had positive cash flow from operation of $25.2 million. The positive cash flow from operation was driven by our improved financial results and strong cash collection. In terms of balance sheet, we entered the quarter with cash of about $77 million and no debt. Our long and short-term RPO continued to be strong. Total RPO at the end of Q2 was $581 million, and short-term RPO was $282 million, approximately the same level as Q1. This healthy backlog coupled with our continuous solid results allows to increase our outlook for the current year for the third consecutive quarter. For fiscal 2024, we are now raising our revenue outlook to $307 million plus or minus 2%, reflecting approximately 8.5% year-over-year growth on an SIS-adjusted non-GAAP basis at the midpoint of the range. Now, let me share with you more color on how we see the remainder of the year evolving. For revenue, we expect Q3 to be at a similar level to Q2. We're increasing our full-year non-GAAP growth margin expectation to 68%, an improvement of 150-basis points versus our previous outlook and year-over-year improvement of 520 basis points on an SIS adjusted non-GAAP basis. Gross margin may fluctuate between quarters based on the revenue mix. For our non-GAAP operating expense, we expect total expenses of approximately $220 million for the full-year. Our improved cost structure combined with revenue growth will allow us to improve operating margins over time. Given our strong performance in Q2 and our expectations for the second-half of the year, we now expect to have a positive adjusted EBITDA of about $2 million for the full-year at the midpoint of the revenue range. We continue to work on optimizing our cash tax payment. As a result of this work, we are expecting to record a non-GAAP tax provision of about $9 million for the year versus our initial estimation of $12 million. In terms of EPS, we are now expecting a $0.33 annual non-GAAP EPS loss at the midpoint of the revenue range, an improvement of $0.20 versus our previous outlook. Our non-GAAP EPS for the second-half of the year is expected to be about zero, due to fluctuation in our non-GAAP tax expenses, we currently expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be slightly positive and offset by similar negative non-GAAP EPS in Q4. To summarize, we are very pleased with our improved performance over the last few quarters. We continue to leverage our financial results and drive revenue growth and margin expansion. Our healthy backlog coupled with our continuing solid results allow us to increase our outlook for the current year for the third consecutive quarter. We are a market leader in investigative analytics and have a strong and legacy track records with customers around the world. We continue to add capabilities and improve the performance of our solutions by leveraging the latest technologies, including emerging innovation in artificial intelligence. We believe these technological innovations increase the operational value our customers generate from our solutions and help drive demand. Looking beyond FY ‘24, we believe our financial result will continue to benefit from the recent positive momentum. The combination of our cutting-edge technology, large and loyal customer base, and the opportunity to address the needs of existing a new customer position us well for growth. With that I would like to hand the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mike Cikos with Needham. Your line is open.\nMike Cikos: Hey, thanks for getting me on the Q&A. Mike Cikos here from Needham. And I have two questions here. The first two, Elad, so Elad, congratulations on that new customer went for over $20 million. I wanted to ask, can you give us additional insight, I know that you have discussed use cases for AI, like drug trafficking as an example, but for this customer specifically, that $20 million new customer, some of the use cases or some of the AI capabilities that Cognyte has which allowed you to win that new customer? And also any comments you have as far as how competitive this competition was versus maybe other solutions out there on the market. That would be very helpful.\nElad Sharon: Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. So our customer's mission is mainly to increase the speed, accuracy and the success rate of the investigations and time is of essence here. And actually, it was a competitive bid with a few bidders. The need was actually to be able to uncover hidden insights relations between entities and patterns and anomalies in behavior out of this data. Over the competitive process, we're able to demonstrate over POC, our capabilities, the competitors did the same. And actually, over time, both of them were disqualified and we were the last one to meet the technical needs. So the win was a competitive win, a new customer, a National Security One. His main challenge was -- is related to investigate terror activities and predict terror risks. The data is a large amount of data that he has to deal with. And the idea is to be able to accelerate investigation in a way that they'll be able to find and -- actually hidden relations and hidden behaviors that cannot be done with legacy technology. So AI, in this case, was playing a major role. In addition to being able to deal with a large amount of data and diversify data and also being able to do this in a very efficient manner in terms of user flows. So this is a very important win for us, and we are pleased to have another new customer, a large one. And also the others are wins from -- one of them is from another new customer, the other one is new department of existing customers. So it's very good to see that the customers appreciate our technology differentiation and advanced technology.\nMike Cikos: That's great. Thank you, Elad and congratulations again on that large customer win. If I just turn to the financials for a second and probably a follow-up here for David. But one of the things that kind of struck me when we were going through this is the spike in professional services revenue? And I just wanted to get a better sense, when we see pro serve revenues jump like this. Is it fair to think that, that is a reflection of the new customer wins that Cognyte is talking to here? Or is there something at play where you might have an incremental professional service benefit tied to servicing, let's say, existing customers. Can you help us think about that as well as potentially what benefited that professional services revenue during the second quarter here?\nDavid Abadi: Yes. So in Q2, actually, we had slightly more revenue that's coming from professional services, and they came also with the 60% of gross margin. But again, like the majority of the revenue 87% of the revenue came from software. When we -- looking from a trend perspective, you can have at a given quarter a little bit more professional services. But if you look at the H numbers, you will see that almost 88% or 89% of the total revenue came from software. So I don't think that it's a peak or it’s just a fluctuation that may take place between quarter-over-quarter. As for the wins, the wins took place this quarter, but obviously, the revenue will be recognized over a future period. Usually, this type of deals that are large deals can recognize over multiple quarters. So it didn't impact the Q2 revenue.\nMike Cikos: Got it. Thank you. And one quick follow-up as well. I know that you guys are taking up the gross margins for the full-year as well. That improvement that we're seeing, it seems to be a reflection of the growing software revenue mix. Is there anything else that you guys are doing internally to help that software gross margin? And I'm wondering if it's just a matter of tighter procurement from your vendors or engineering on your side to figure out a better way to drive efficiencies in your own cost in delivering these solutions to your customers? Anything there on the software gross margins and what you guys are doing to drive that improvement would be beneficial as well? And then I'll turn it over to my colleagues. Thank you, guys.\nDavid Abadi: So we are very pleased with the gross margin in H1 and Q2. And actually, we are very pleased that we are able to increase our gross margin to 68% for the full-year, and it represents 520 basis points more than our initial plan. Looking at the trends and what drives the gross margin, I think the gross margin is the clear evidence of our differentiated solution and how the customer appreciate the value we provided. Elad mentioned the deals that we’ve been, but those that are not in the revenue, but they’re consist with what we see in the market and how the backlog looks. We're seeing good backlog with the high quality that will allow us to drive a gross margin. So from that perspective, this will be also an impact in the future. When we're looking what changed, you could see that one of the things that changed this quarter is the professional services and it's basically as a result of actions that we took to improve our professional services cost structure to allow us to be in a better position. Overall, when we look at the gross margin, we're monitoring carefully if it's like from a cost perspective, but I think that the major thing that impacts gross margin is the ability to sell our solution as a premium solution, the customer demonstration of our appreciation for this value that allow us to sell it in the right pricing.\nMike Cikos: Thank you very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dean.\nDean Ridlon: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. Elad, David and I are planning to visit Boston and New York early next month and hope we can see some of you then. In the meantime, should you have any questions, please feel to reach out to me, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day."

Welcome, everyone, to our first quarter conference call. I'm pleased to report a good start for the year with solid Q1 results across several key metrics. Revenue grew sequentially came in ahead of our expectation at $73 million. I'm very pleased with our gross margins increasing by [800 basis points] [ph] compared to Q1 last year and gross profit increasing 7% year-over-year on a network adjusted non-GAAP basis. Free cash flow was very strong coming in at $70 million also ahead of our expectations. Today, I'll start with a review of our first quarter of significant wins in market dynamics. Next, I'll discuss our differentiated technology and how we believe we're well-positioned to leverage the latest AI innovations to increase customer value. And lastly, I'll discuss our updated outlook for the year. I would now like to review some of our significant wins in the quarter that highlight our differentiated technology and deep customer relationships. Our investigating analytics solutions help national security, law enforcement, national intelligence, and other security organizations to accelerate investigations. The first deal is for approximately $8 million with an existing national intelligence customer for its mission to combat drug trafficking and other high impact crimes around the borders. We believe we're selected because of our cutting edge technology that consistently outperformed solutions from other vendors during the variety of operational activities performed by this customer. The second deal is with an existing national security customer for approximately $9 million. It represents an expansion of our customers' capabilities and functionality for its mission to address an increase of terror and criminal activities in the country. We believe we're selected due to our ability to accelerate security investigations and the long-term relationship we have with this customer. The third deal is for approximately $5 million from an existing national security customer. The deal is to expand capacity and widen the operational capabilities of their solution to more effectively combat our activities. We believe we're selected based on our long track record of success in value creation. The common thread we see through these wins is our innovative and differentiated investigating analytic solutions and our ability to help customers successfully create operational volume. Looking at the current market dynamics, we see a noticeable change versus what we saw last year. A year ago, many customers suffered from budget uncertainties, which impacted the visibility and ability to plan ahead. This year, more customers are expressing confidence in the budgets and plans. Our customers increase confidence, support our expectations for the year, and is translating into more discussions about future needs. For example, at recent industry conference, we saw a higher level of attendance and interest from customers. Overall, we clearly see more customers returning to normal behavior this year, compared to what was happening a year ago. Next, I would like to discuss our innovation and differentiation. Our customers face unique challenges when it comes to investigating analytics and decision making. They have to fuse and analyze data at scale from a large variety of different sources, including sensitive data. The objective is to uncover insights quickly to accelerate investigations. Cognyte is focused on investigating analytics in order to uncover hidden connections inside large diverse data sources. We have been doing this for many years by continuously improving the [investment analytics] [ph] and incorporating artificial intelligence models in our solutions. The recent developments in AI provide us with new opportunities. We are currently focused on leveraging the latest innovation to enable our customers to derive even greater value from the data. We believe there are new market segments that face investigating analytics challenges that present us with good expansion opportunities over time. We believe that our long-term market leadership in investigating analytics combined with our technological strength and our strong relationships with our large customer base across the globe position us well to leverage AI innovation and drive long-term growth. Looking at our outlook for this fiscal year, given the improved visibility, we are raising our revenue guidance for the year to $303 million, plus or minus 2%, representing 7% year-over-year growth at the midpoint on an SIS Adjusted non-GAAP basis. With revenue expected to grow by 7%, we now expect gross profit to grow faster at more than 10% year-over-year. As for cash flow, we are now expecting positive cash flow from operations for the full-year. Looking beyond this year, given recent innovations in AI, we have identified potential opportunities to expand our business with both existing and new customers. We believe that the combination of positive industry trends, our innovative technology and large global customer base position us well for long-term growth. To summarize, our customers continue to face significant investigative challenges across many used cases. Our mission is to help them accelerate investigations and mitigate a wide range of threats before they unfold. And our customers view us as domain experts and trusted partner. We are pleased with our first quarter results and positive momentum and are raising guidance for the current year. Long-term, we target continued growth and margin expansion. Now, let me turn the call over to David to provide more details about our results and outlook. David?\nDavid Abadi: Thank you, Elad, and hello everyone. Our discussion today will include non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available as Dean mentioned in our earnings release and in the Investors section of our website. Our website also includes a financial dashboard with a tab that details our historical results, excluding the divested situation intelligence solutions. We are pleased with our Q1 financial results as we add solid performance across revenue, gross margin, cash flow, and bookings. The ongoing demand for our cutting edge investigative analytics solutions continued to be strong during the quarter and we continue to win deals from a variety of customers. Q1 revenue came in at $73,000,000, up $2,000,000 from Q4, Total revenue came in at $25 million, representing 6% sequential growth and 11% year-over-year growth. Gross profit was up 9% sequentially and 7% year-over-year and our software gross profit grew faster than software revenue and was up 90% sequentially and 80% year-over-year. Q1 gross margin was 68.4%, up 250 basis points from Q4 and up 800 basis points from Q1 last year, primarily due to an increase in software revenue. Our gross margin reflects our competitive differentiation and ability to create value for our customers. All of the revenue, gross profit, and gross margin growth rates, I just discussed are on SIS Adjusted non-GAAP basis. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses were $55.7 million, slightly higher than the Q4 level. Over the last few quarters, we improved our execution, better focused the organization, and improved our cost structure resulting in sequential revenue growth, higher gross margin and a significant reduced operating [cost] [ph]. Our Q1 non-GAAP operating loss was $5.5 million and non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss was $2.3 million. Turning to cash. We generated a significant positive cash flow from operation of $19 million during Q1. The positive cash flow was driven by our improved financial results and strong cash collection. In terms of the balance sheet, we entered the quarter with cash of about $73 million and no debt. Our long and short-term RPO continued to be strong. Total RPO at the end of Q1 was $581 million, and short-term IPO was $283 million, approximately the same level as of Q4. This healthy backlog and continued demand allow us to increase again our outlook for the current year. Turning to fiscal 2024. For the full-year, we are raising our revenue outlook to $303 million, plus or minus 2%, reflecting approximately 7% year-over-year growth on an SIS Adjusted non-GAAP basis at the midpoint of the range. Our revenue outlook is driven by our current view of the backlog deployment schedule for this year and assumes in similar macro environment conditions. Let me share with you more color on how we see the remainder of the year evolving. For revenue, based on current short and backlog deployment schedule, we expect Q2 revenue similar to Q1 and the second half to be higher than the first half. As a result of the strength and quality of our backlog, and recent booking, we're increasing our full-year non-GAAP gross margin expectation to 66.5%, an improvement of 150 basis points versus our previous outlook and year-over-year improvement of 375 basis points on an SIS Adjusted non-GAAP basis. Gross margin will fluctuate between quarters, based on the revenue mix. For our non-GAAP operating expenses, we continue to expect total expenses of about $220 million for the full-year and to be relatively flat throughout the year. Our improved cost structure combined with revenue growth and higher gross margins will allow us to improve operating margins over time. We remain on track to achieve our goal to drive positive non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA during Q4 of this fiscal year. As a result, we are now expecting a smaller annual EPS loss. The midpoint of the revenue range, we are now expecting a $0.53 annual non-GAAP EPS loss, an improvement of $0.07 versus our previous outlook. Our non-GAAP EPS will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, partially due to our non-GAAP tax expenses. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP EPS loss to be larger than Q1, primarily as a result of our non-GAAP tax methodology. Turning to cash flow, given the strong cash flow from operation we generate in Q1 and improved financial outlook, we are now expecting positive cash flow from operations for the full-year. We continue to expect about $10 million of payment for CapEx, partially offset by additional receipts from the SIS divestiture related to the holdback and price adjustment, which we expect to receive during the second half of the year. To summarize, we are a market leader in investigative analytics and have a strong and lengthy track records with customer around the world. We continue to add capabilities and improve the performance of our solution by leveraging the latest technologies, including emerging innovation in artificial intelligence. We believe this technological innovation increased the operational value our customers generate for our solution and help drive demand. We are pleased with our first quarter results. We now expect about $303 million of revenue, plus or minus 2% and improving gross margin and profitability for FY 2024. We're expecting positive cash flow from operations for the year. Looking beyond FY 2024, we believe that the combination of our cutting edge technology, large and loyal customer base, and the opportunity to address the needs of new customers position us well for long-term growth. With that, I would like to end the call over to the operator to open the line for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mike Cikos of Needham.. Your line is open.\nMike Cikos: Hey, guys. Mike Cikos here. Appreciate the pronunciation on the last name there, but thanks for getting me on here. Wanted to start out with the quarter itself and then going over some of the upside and outperformance if you guys were able to deliver? First, obviously revenue was above what we had anticipated. I know you guys were talking about flat sequentially versus this up, right? So, can you help us think about how the revenue came together in the quarter that was able to help you guys deliver that outperformance? That's the first question I'd like to delve into. And then I have a couple of follow-ups.\nElad Sharon: Yes. So, hi Mike. Yes, indeed, we see a healthy demand [positive momentum] [ph] in the market over the last two quarters already and we're continuing to win significant deals. The reasons for the – being ahead of expectations for Q1 is mainly related to backlog conversion scheduling. That's the reason we're able to deliver more within the quarter.\nMike Cikos : And just to pull it out because like your backlog bookings, right, if I think about the disclosures you guys provided today with RPO and current RPO climbing, from 4Q to 1Q by a couple of million dollars, right? So, when you're calling out that backlog conversion, should I interpret that as like backlog came in earlier than you guys had anticipated and you were still able to backfill that based on the fact that those RPO and current RPO balances climb sequentially? Like can you tease that out?\nElad Sharon: Yes. So, maybe before talking about the RPO, I want to share with you a little bit about the market dynamics today because I think it's important. We discussed the active demand, discussed the positive momentum, we have strong backlog long and short-term, but we also see more and more customers that are more confident in the budgets and plans. And the – actually the Q1 results are derived by accelerated customer readiness and for us being able convert more backlog into revenue within the quarter. And that's what, what we see. Actually, we see more and more customers in better position. And this is the reason we were able to deliver more in Q1 and also raise the outlook for the year for [303] [ph].\nMike Cikos: Got it and appreciate it. And I know that you guys had also, again, coming back to the RPO for a second. The RPO and current RPO, you guys said that's flat sequentially. If I go back to my notes, it's actually up by a couple of million dollars. So, call it flat on a percentage basis, but the – you did grow it from 4Q to 1Q. One of the things that I'd like to hear, what has the typical cadence been? Like, if I go from 4Q to 1Q last year, the year before that, traditionally, is RPO and current RPO climbing sequentially from Q4 to Q1 or no?\nDavid Abadi: So, RPO is reflected by multiple elements, including multiple year support contract and other elements that can impact on the total. There's no specific pattern like, we could see like that the RPO in general can grow from quarter-on-quarter, but overall our RPO is very strong and our ability to convert more backlog in Q1 and giving the Q1 overall result gave us the ability to improve our outlook for the year. I believe that the RPO that we have, the short-term and the long-term support our future growth and it's very solid.\nMike Cikos: Thank you for that, David. I do appreciate the fact that you guys are talking about the 1Q outperformance with this backlog conversion and customer readiness, but at the same time, both RPO and current RPO balances remain strong. So, thank you for calling that out. I think the latest item that I really wanted to talk to you, appreciate the color on Q2 and the fact that you're able to maintain that flat OpEx for the remainder of the year, which I know we had spoken about last quarter. But if I look at the gross margins, that's the last item I really wanted to hit on with you guys before I turn it over to my colleagues. With gross margins, obviously, you guys were well ahead of expectations. So, can we do a similar, I guess line of questioning versus what we just did with revenue? First, for gross margin, what helped drive that outperformance in Q1? And then second, what provides you the confidence to now take up gross margin, 150 bps for the year versus what we had anticipated previously?\nElad Sharon: Yes. So, Mike, maybe I'll start and then David will continue. We do see higher quality of the bookings. So, the mix is better. Mix better means more softer revenue in the mix. And this drives higher gross margin overall. We do see also that we do expect that when revenue goes up, the gross margin will also improve over time. About the specifics, David, do you want to add?\nDavid Abadi: Yes. I will elaborate on that. So, obviously we are very pleased with our gross margin in Q1 and also the ability to improve our outlook for the year. In total we believe that year-over-year will be almost 400 basis points, 275 basis points improvement. The main reason behind it is the quality of the booking more software revenue, we see also in the mix in Q1 that our total software revenue were in a higher mix, it was almost 90% of our revenue. This trend that we are able to continue to deliver our – and we said our premium solution with high margin and drive the gross margin over time. And now we are looking for the year with the 6.5%, and the main reason is the Q1 performance continue with last year and overall backlog which give us the confidence that we'll be able to drive it.\nMike Cikos: That's great. And I know we're talking about the mix. So, just to put a final point on it. So, the assumption is that I guess the mix will normalize a little bit for the rest of the year and that's why we should expect Q2 through Q4 to come down from the 60% level in Q1. But at the same time the bookings quality is what's benefiting that overall gross margin. Is that a fair characterization?\nDavid Abadi: Yes, that's fair.\nMike Cikos: Terrific. I'll turn it over to my colleagues. Appreciate it. Thank you so much.\nDavid Abadi: Thank you.\nElad Sharon : Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And our next question will come from Peter Levine of Evercore. Your line is open.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thanks guys for taking my question here. Elad, your commentary earlier on the call, you said better budget discussions seems like customers are returning to normal behavior of our last year. Can you kind of just maybe dive into that a little bit deeper, explain to us, kind of what you're seeing on the top of the funnel conversion rates and then your expectations, I think, throughout the rest of the year in terms of the macro impacting your ability to further reaccelerate?\nElad Sharon: Yes, sure. Thanks, Peter. So, we see a healthy demand and positive momentum and it's over the last two quarters already. We continue to win large deals. The backlog is strong as we discussed before and also our customers saying – most of our customers are saying that actually they are more confident about the budgets and the plans. And we also expect the demand for our solutions to continue and increase and there are actually few drivers for that.  First of all, we discussed it earlier in the call that customers challenges are becoming more complex and growing. So, in order for them to be able to do the job, they need [monolithics] [ph] more and more capabilities related to dealing with big data and it's really important for them to get this technology. Also, our customer's objective is being able to accelerate in time the investigation, this is one. Second, to improve the accuracy of the investigation. And third, to make it successful. Make it successful means to reach conclusive outcome. So, it's about time, strength of the insight that they generate from the solution, and being able to conclude investigations. And more analytics and more AI capabilities are extremely important for them, and actually present even greater value over time. So, for that reason, we see the demand of customers improving along the way. And we believe that the recent developments will also generate more demand. I can give you an anecdote just to give you more color. We participated an industry tradeshow a couple of weeks ago in Europe, big one. And actually, we saw that is well attended more participants than we used to see before. Many requests for meetings and demos, lots of interest in modernizing the technology with more analytics, more AI, customers are now unlike last year that they were talking about pressing current needs. They were talking to us about future needs and what else needs to be done in their side in order for them to be able to accelerate their performance. So, all of those are very encouraging signs. So, I feel good about where we are today and I feel good about being able to continue growing in the long-term. I hope this gives you some color about the dynamics of the market.\nPeter Levine: Yes. Thanks for the color. And maybe the last one is, good to see free cash flow tick higher. Maybe just talk about the levers that you're pulling internally on the sales and marketing side, R&D side, what's the trade off? I mean, if you're going to deliver a little bit more leverage, maybe talk about what the trade-off is or maybe just, again, just emphasize on, kind of where you're cutting costs while still being efficient in terms of growth? Thank you.\nDavid Abadi: So actually, just to make sure that we understood the question, the question is about our margin expansion and the ability to trade-off between increased investment on OpEx versus growth. Is that correct?\nPeter Levine: Correct.\nDavid Abadi: So, last year we had like to make a lot of decision about our cost structure and versus the opportunity. And when we look at, we believe that the opportunity is here. We are playing in this market for a long time. We're market leader. We know our customer base for a long time. Our solutions are very innovative and customer love what we provide them. We need to think about like cost structure and what is the right thing to do, you need to balance between your short-term and long-term. I think that we build a very well organized organization that allow us to be there when the growth will come and capture it. I think that you can see that in Q1 the results we are growing, we are improving our margin, and then we look that it will continue over time.\nPeter Levine: Perfect. Thank you for the color guys.\nOperator: I'm sorry. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Shaul Eyal of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Hi, good morning, good afternoon guys. Of the three contracts that you've mentioned during your presentation, are these all existing clients or are these also new clients? Any displacement opportunities that you're seeing out there?\nElad Sharon: Yes. So, the examples that I used this quarter are existing clients. It’s upgrades of capacity and functionality. We did have also new logos there in the quarter, and we did give few examples large deals coming from new customers in previous quarters. So, timing is changing from time-to-time whether it comes from existing or new customers, but those examples are with existing customers. And the reason they upgrade is that they have the solution, they have the value that they need. And the drivers for expansions and upgrades are either functionality, adding more analytics, more AI in order for them to be able to accelerate what they need to do or they're dealing with more data. So, those are the drivers and we see it more and more with large customers that are expanding given further as the value is greater now with analytics.\nShaul Eyal: Got it. Thank you for that. Maybe I want to maybe double-click on [indiscernible] prior reply to Peter, was alluding to the fact when growth returns. What internal steps have you taken to be ready for what might be the next cycle not seeing the stability and maybe even reacceleration? What steps have you taken internally?\nElad Sharon: So, given the situation, the macro environment last year, we took several steps. The first one was to focus on where the highest opportunities are in terms of market conditions, going to countries and to organizations that have more pressing needs, but also have the budget. This is one second. We restructured organization and adjusted the operating expenses to where it should be. And David mentioned that actually we balanced it in a way that in one hand, we are able to overcome this macro environment, the conditions of the temporary disruption, but on the other hand, continuing to innovate in order for us to be able to capture the growth when market is recovering and that's what [indiscernible] now. We flattened the organization. We actually slowed down a roadmap that was more to modernize infrastructure and focusing more on value to customers and more analytics and actually focuses and realign the sales force to countries where we see more opportunities. So, we in one hand focused on the market. If I have to summarize, we focus on markets and countries where we see the potential that is higher and they have budgets, one hand. On the other hand, adjusting the OpEx and prioritizing the activities to increase customer value versus modernizing their platforms. Those were the highlights for last year. And I see now that I think we took the right decision. I see now that this is actually working for us.\nShaul Eyal: Thank you. Appreciate the color.\nElad Sharon: Thank you, Shaul. And I would now like to turn the call back to Dean Ridlon for closing remarks.\nDean Ridlon: Thank you, operator, and thank you everyone for joining us on today's call. Should you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out to me and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
