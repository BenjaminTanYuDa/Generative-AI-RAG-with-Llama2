And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Ryan: Hey thanks Scott and welcome, everyone, to the call. Today, we're reporting record fourth quarter and annual financial results, even stronger organic growth and further improvements to our operating margins. We're excited to go over these results with you and give you some perspective about the business environment we see right now. But first, let me give you a roadmap for the call. I'll start by hitting some highlights of last quarter and some aspects of how our business performed, then I'll hand it over to Allan, who will go over the Q4 and annual financial results in more detail. I'll then come back and provide an update on how we see the current business environment and how our business was calibrated as we entered the new fiscal year. And finally, we'll open it up to the operator to coordinate the Q&A portion of the call. So, let's start with the quarter that ended January 31sr. Key metrics we monitor include revenues, profits, cash flow from operations, operating margins, and returns on our investments. For this past quarter, we again had outstanding performance in each of those areas. Total revenues were up 18% from a year ago, with services revenues up 20%. Adjusted EBITDA was up 19% from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA margin was at 44%. And excluding the impact of earnout payments we made on past acquisitions, which Allan will explain later, we generated $63.6 million in cash from operations, representing 96% of adjusted EBITDA. At the end of the quarter, we had almost $321 million in cash and we were debt-free, with an undrawn $350 million line of credit. We remain well-capitalized, cash-generating, have strong organic growth, and remain ready to continue to invest in our business. We had a strong quarter of organic growth in our core services revenues from a year ago. Many of the key drivers are similar to past periods. The biggest growth areas were in real-time visibility, Global Trade Intelligence, and routing and scheduling solutions. So, let me touch on a few of those. First, in real-time visibility. The core of our real-time visibility solutions is MacroPoint. In this market, there are three important types of logistics players; carriers, these are companies who have vehicles, ships, planes, and trucks that move goods. Two, we have shippers, these are companies that have goods to be shipped, the manufacturers, retailers, and distributors. And three, intermediaries, these are companies who help manage parts of the movement of goods on behalf of shippers and carriers, including booking. These are sometimes called freight brokers, forwarders, or third-party logistics providers. When freight is booked, it's not always the shipper booking it with the carrier, it's often an intermediary booking for multiple shippers with multiple carriers. So, if a shipper wants to know where a particular delivery is at any specific point in time, it could be challenging because the shipper didn't make the booking and doesn't know what vehicle the goods are on. Enter real-time visibility solutions. We provide a network that sources information from carriers, shippers, and intermediaries and present it in a way that makes business sense. The most common answer we're providing to shippers and intermediaries is to the question, where is my stuff? Knowing the location of a shipment and when it's going to arrive is critical to serving your customer and running your business. But even more importantly, knowing where your stuff is versus where it's meant to be when things aren't going to plan and getting updated ETAs is critical if you want to set yourself apart from the competition, and that's exactly what we help our customers do. To get our strong growth in Q4, it comes from two things; one, we're winning more deals; and two, our existing customers are tracking more loads than they have in the past. I believe there's four key reasons for this. First, our solutions are better at attracting loads than our competitors. A key operational metric for this business is the percentage of loads submitted that are able to be successfully tracked. There can be challenges with tracking a load as you can't get tracking information from a driver. There are challenges with the carriers' data or systems or if you have incorrect information about a load. We've invested a team of dedicated professionals and systems focused on resolving any challenges with tracking a load to maximize our customers' ability to know where their goods are. We believe we have the largest network of connected carriers to get tracking information from. If carriers aren't already connected, we've got self-connect tools to help our customers get even more location coverage across their network of carriers. Ultimately, we're aligned with our customers' interest because our customers pay us by the number of successfully tracked loads. Our tracking percentage improved again in this quarter and we believe we have opportunities to improve it further going forward. Our improvement in tracking percentages has outpaced any recent decrease in industry shipping volumes. The second is visibility that's embedded in many Descartes solutions. Our real-time visibility solutions work with a host of other Descartes solutions. Key integration area is our transportation management solutions, allowing shippers and intermediaries to manage their relationships with carriers from booking through invoicing, while getting visibility to shipments in motion. We believe we offer a more comprehensive suite of solutions than our competitors. Third, we're experienced in multiple transportation modes. We have a long operating history with solutions and customers in all transportation modes: truck, rail, ocean, and air. We believe we have a more comprehensive global logistics network than any other provider in the industry. And finally, we're a reliable, stable, and growing partner. Our customers take a lot of comfort from working with Descartes as a large public company with a long track record of financial stability. We have a long history of operating secure cloud services across the globe. This makes us a service provider of choice in the real-time visibility market. The second area is Global Trade Intelligence solutions. These solutions fall into three main categories. First, competitive intelligence, which is understanding trade flows and goods classifications through research and our extensive database of manifest information. Second is tariff and duty intelligence, which is researching and using our database of global tariffs and duties to help you manage your global trade and shipments. And a third is sanctioned party screening, which is reviewing customer shipments, employees, guests, and otherwise against our extensive list of domestic and international sanctioned parties to help ensure you're operating your business in accordance with the law. To oversimplify, these solutions become more important to our customers when things are changing. When trade flows change, our customers need to adapt their relationships and systems. When tariffs and duties change, it may impact sourcing, manufacturing, and logistics decisions. And when sanctioned parties change, businesses need to reevaluate who they're doing business with for legal compliance purposes. There's been a lot of change in the world over the past years. It's been a big driver for our Global Trade Intelligence business, and there are some areas of change that are happening right now, which will help drive demand for our solutions. The first is the Red Sea disruption. Military conflict, terrorism, piracy have made following traditional logistics route through the Red Sea, a very perilous thing for ocean carriers. Many ocean carriers have rerouted their vessels to instead travel around the Cape of Africa. This added time and cost of sailings and reduced available capacity. Shippers scrambled to secure space on ocean vessels for their shipments and readjust their supply chain for delays. Carriers adjusted prices, added surcharges, and reallocated to vessels capable of making the Cape journey. This has created demand for many Descartes solutions such as our ocean rate management, booking and tracking solutions, but has also impacted demand for competitive intelligence and compliance screening for new trading relationships. Second, additional sanctioned parties. This past quarter has once again seen additional international sanctions imposed primarily as a result of the war in Ukraine, activities in Israel and Gaza and on the specific companies using forced labor. Even after our fiscal year ended in February, the U.S. announced 500 additional sanctions against Russia as a consequence of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the death of Alexei Navalny. An expanding world of sanctions presents difficult compliance challenges for our customers, so we've had to be on top of updating lists and able to meet the increased demand for sanctioned parties list. And finally, the Panama Canal. The Panama Canal Authority has had to restrict ship transit due to low water flow levels in the canal. This has reduced the available capacity of sailings through this route and correspondingly increased the price. Many shippers have sought alternative trade routes or mechanisms, including shifting a portion of their journeys to being by rail or truck. These creative approaches have pushed demand for competitive intelligence and screening as many parties established brand new trading and logistics relationships. And the last area is in our routing and scheduling solutions. These solutions help you manage your own fleet of vehicles rather than hiring space on other people's vehicles. We believe we have the premier routing and scheduling solutions in the market. Our customers have faced pressure to use their vehicles efficiently, whether it's due to cost pressures, limited labor, or environmental concerns. This is particularly so with the current focus on climate reporting and compliance. So, we've seen continued good demand. We've also made recent investments to help our customers with delivery challenges and to deliver an enhanced delivery experience to consumers. Our customers recognize that the delivery experience is a key part of the customers' purchase experience. So, they're very interested in being able to provide delivery recipients with time-definite delivery windows and an Uber-like delivery visibility experience in the final miles. Our innovations in this area continue to drive customers with complex delivery challenges to Descartes for solution. So, those were some of the key areas of organic growth for us in the quarter. We also saw some growth in our customs and regulatory business, principally as a result of new custom standards in Europe gaining traction. However, overall, there have been challenges in the global freight market, challenges that were predicted earlier in the year and that we've been planning for. While aggregate transportation volumes in the industry have been negatively impacted, we focused on delivering enhanced value to our customers for shipments that they're processing and that's contributed to the results we've reported today. Our organic growth was complemented by the contribution of previously completed acquisitions. Several previous acquisitions performed better than we had originally planned for, resulting in more earnout being accrued and paid in the quarter. Allan will get into that in more detail in his section in a few minutes. Separate from earnouts, let me to touch briefly on the operational contribution of GroundCloud to our business. We've now got almost a full year of experience with GroundCloud safety and compliance solutions. GroundCloud helps identify safety incidents faced by drivers and provides responsive and targeted video training on the challenges that drivers face. They also help companies manage delivery obligations as they have subcontractors to other delivery brands such as Federal Express. When we first combined, we indicated -- we anticipated some impact on our overall adjusted EBITDA margin, which we saw in Q1 and Q2. We've made good progress on integration and our aggregate adjusted EBITDA margin was back up to 44% for Q3 and slightly improved in Q4. The GroundCloud business is now less dependent on professional services revenue and continues to deliver great value to its customers. We believe driver safety is an area of continued importance and interest for the global logistics community. So, let me just summarize as I hand it over to Allan to give the full financial details of the quarter and the year. We had record financial results, the business performed well, and we believe that's a good reflection of the value that our customers continue to get from our solutions and the hard work that our team continues to put in for our customers. We ended the quarter with $321 million in cash, $350 million in available credit, and a market opportunity where we can continue to grow the business for our customers, both organically and through acquisition. We remain focused on profitable growth, so that we can continue to ensure that our customers have a secure, stable, and growing technology partner that can help them with their challenges well into the future. My thanks to the entire Descartes team for everything they've done to contribute to a great quarter and continuing to have our business in an enviable position for future success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Allan to go through our Q4 and annual financial results in more detail. Allan?\nAllan Brett: Okay. Thanks Ed. As indicated, I'm going to walk you through our financial highlights for our fourth quarter and year ended January 31st, 2024. We are pleased to report record quarterly revenues of $148.2 million this quarter, an increase of just over 18% from revenues of $125.1 million in Q4 of last year. Our revenue in the mix -- revenue mix in the quarter continued to be very strong, with services revenue increasing over 20% to $135.7 million from $113.4 million last year in the fourth quarter, with services revenue increasing to 92% of total revenue this quarter, up from 91% of total revenue in Q4 last year. Removing the impact of both the recent acquisitions as well as a small impact from foreign exchange rates, we would estimate that our growth in services revenue from new and existing customers would have been approximately 10% this quarter when compared to the same quarter last year, which is up slightly from the increase of approximately 9% in the past few quarters of FY 2024. Professional services and other revenue, including hardware revenue, came in at $11.1 million or just over 7% of revenue, up from $10.0 million or 8% of revenue in the same quarter last year, mainly as a result of the GroundCloud acquisition early in FY 2024. In addition, license revenue came in at $1.4 million compared to $1.7 million last year in the fourth quarter, pretty consistent at roughly 1% of revenue. For the year, our revenue was a record $572.9 million, up 18% from revenue of $486 million in the previous year. For the year, services revenue came in at $520.9 million, up almost 20% from $435.7 million last year, with just more than half of this growth coming from growth in revenues from new and existing customers, while the remainder of the growth can be attributed to growth from acquisitions. Gross margins came in at 76% of revenue for the fourth quarter of the year, down slightly from gross margin of 77% for the fourth quarter last year and for the entire period last year. This slight decrease in gross margin was mainly a result of the impact of lower gross margins experienced in the businesses that we acquired during the year, including GroundCloud. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter and for the year increased primarily related to the impact of recent acquisitions, including GroundCloud, but also increased slightly as a result of additional investments that we made in our business over the past year, primarily in the area of sales, marketing, product development, and network security. As a result of the above, adjusted EBITDA came in at a record $65.7 million in the fourth quarter or 44.3% of revenue, up a solid 19% from adjusted EBITDA of $55.4 million, also at 44.3% of revenue in the fourth quarter last year. After having our adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue weakened early in the year with the lower margins from the GroundCloud business, strong operating leverage from organic growth as well as improvements from the GroundCloud margins during the year resulted in this recovery of our adjusted EBITDA margin by the fourth quarter back to last year's Q4 ratio. Looking at the annual results. Again, as a result of strong revenue growth, we continue to see strong adjusted EBITDA growth to a record of $247.5 million or 43.2% of revenue for FY 2024, up 15% from $215.2 million or 44.3% of revenue last year. With these solid operating results, cash flow generated from operations came in at $50.8 million or 77% of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. However, we should note that this cash flow figure was negatively impacted by the payment of $12.6 million in earnout payments on past acquisitions that were larger than the original estimates that we made on those acquisitions. As we've mentioned in the past, when an earnout payment is greater than the earnout amount originally estimated at the time of acquisition, the accounting rules require us to separate that earnout payment in two parts on the statement of cash flows; first, the portion of the earnout payment that was estimated at the time of the acquisition is charged against cash flow from financing activities; second, the excess amount of the earn-out payment arising from better-than-expected performance of those acquisitions is charged against cash flow from operations. So, if we were to exclude this unusual accounting treatment of higher earnout payments, then our operating cash flow in the fourth quarter would have been $63.4 million or 96% of adjusted EBITDA in Q4, up 25% from operating cash flow of $50.6 million or 91% of adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, cash flow from operations, excluding the impact of these higher earnout payments in both periods, was $220.3 million or 89% of adjusted EBITDA, up 11% from $198 million or 92% of adjusted EBITDA last year. Going forward, we expect to continue to see strong operating cash flow conversion in the range of 80% to 90% of our adjusted EBITDA in the years ahead, of course, subject to unusual events and quarterly fluctuations, including adjustments related to future earnout payments that exceed our estimates made at the time of acquisitions. From a GAAP earnings perspective, net income for the fourth quarter came in at $31.8 million, up 7% from net income of $29.8 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, net income was $115.9 million or $1.34 per diluted common shares, up 13% from 142 -- from $102.2 million or $1.18 per diluted common share. Overall, as Ed mentioned earlier, we're certainly pleased with the operating results for fiscal 2024 and as our continued revenue growth has allowed us to invest in several areas of the business, while still allowing us to achieve 15% growth in adjusted EBITDA, maintain a strong adjusted EBITDA margin and achieved solid growth in our cash flow from operations. If we turn our attention to the balance sheet. Our cash balances totaled $321 million at the end of January. However, for the year, our cash balances increased by approximately $45 million as we generated pro forma operating cash flow of just over $220 million, as I just mentioned. While offsetting that, we've deployed $143 million in capital towards new acquisitions and also paid an additional $31.7 million in earnout payments on past acquisitions in FY 2024. So, after ending the year with just over $320 million of cash and an undrawn credit facility of $350 million, we are clearly well-capitalized and positioned to consider all acquisition opportunities in our market, consistent with our business plan. As we look to the current year we are in, our fiscal 2025, we should note the following. After incurring approximately $5.6 million in capital additions this past year, we expect to incur approximately $5.5 million to $6.5 million in additional capital expenditures in this coming year. We expect that amortization expense will be approximately $57.5 million for fiscal 2025, with this figure being subject to adjustment for foreign exchange rates and any future acquisitions. After paying contingent consideration or earnout payments of $31.7 million on past acquisitions, this past year, we would currently anticipate that we will make an additional earnout payments of $34 million in FY 2025. Of that $34 million estimate to be -- estimated amount to be paid, $7.7 million relates to the portion of the earnout arrangements accrued for at the time of the acquisitions and will be reflected in cash flow from financing activities, with the remaining balance estimated at $26.3 million will be reflected as a reduction in cash flow from operating activities, the majority of which is likely to be paid in Q1. Our income tax rate in the fourth quarter came in at approximately 20.6% of pre-tax income, resulting in a tax rate for the year of 23.3% in FY 2024, which is lower than our statutory tax rate, mainly as a result of the reversal of certain uncertain tax positions during fiscal 2024. Looking forward to FY 2025, we are expecting the tax rate will be in the range of 23% to 28% of our pre-tax income, which means it will be something on either side of our blended statutory tax rate of approximately 26.5%. So, as always, we should add that our tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter from one-time items that may arise as we operate internationally across multiple countries. And finally, we currently expect stock compensation expense will be approximately $13.4 million for fiscal 2025, subject to any future equity grants as well as any future forfeitures of stock options or share units. I will now turn it back over to Ed.\nEd Ryan: Great. Thanks Allan. We're a month into Q1 and the end of our fiscal year. Q1 is generally one of the more challenging quarters as the market recovers from the holiday rush and the shipping deals with freight disruption caused by the Chinese New Year. Recent ocean volumes have been stronger than in other non-pandemic years. However, we're monitoring to see the impact of the Red Sea and Panama Canal diversions on our volumes. We keep these things in mind as we set our calibration for the quarter, our business is designed to be predictable and consistent. We believe that stability and reliability are valuable to our customers, employees and our broader stakeholders. To deliver this consistency, we continue to operate from the following principles. Our long-term plan is for our business to grow adjusted EBITDA 10% to 15% per year. We grow through a combination of organic and inorganic or acquisitions. We take a neutral party approach to building and operating solutions on our global logistics network. We don't favor any particular party. We run our business for all supply chain participants, connecting shippers, carriers, logistics service providers, and customs authorities. When we overperform, we try to reinvest that overperformance back into our business. We focus on recurring revenues and establishing relationships with customers for life. And we thrive on operating a predictable business that allows us forward visibility to our revenues and investment paybacks. In our annual report, we've provided a comprehensive description of baseline revenues based on calibration and their limitations. As of February 1st, 2024, using foreign exchange rates of $0.75 to the Canadian dollar; $1.08 to the euro, and $1.27 to the Great Britain pound, we estimate that our baseline revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 are approximately $130.5 million and our baseline operating expenses are approximately $81 million. We consider this to be our baseline adjusted EBITDA calibration of approximately $49.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 or approximately 38% of our baseline revenues as at February 1st, 2024. We continue to expect that we'll operate in an adjusted EBITDA operating margin range of 40% to 45%. Our margins can vary in that range, given such things as foreign exchange movements and the impact of acquisitions as we integrate them into our business, like we saw with GroundCloud. We've got lots of exciting things planned for our business. It remains a challenging economic supply chain and compliance environment for our customers, but we believe our proven track record of execution, solid capital structure, and customer focus will help us serve them well. Thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. As always, we're available to talk to you about our business in whatever manner is most convenient for you. And with that, operator, I'll turn it over to you for the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Stephen Long [ph] from Stephens. Please ask your question.\nJustin Long: Hi, good afternoon. This is Justin Long from Stephens. How are you doing?\nEd Ryan: Hey Justin, how are you?\nJustin Long: Good. So, maybe to start, I think you gave the organic growth in services revenue for the quarter, but could you also talk about all-in organic growth. And then looking forward, if we do see signs of a better freight cycle this year, is it reasonable to expect that organic growth to accelerate? Or is there anything that you see on the horizon that could prevent that from happening?\nEd Ryan: Maybe Allan could comment at the end on the overall number. But no, I think your presumption is correct. I mean we're expecting maybe kind of what we've seen so far in the market and if it improved from there, it would certainly help our business and probably our growth rates as well. Allan, I don't know the overall number off the top of my head.\nAllan Brett: Yes, Justin, we're just around 10% on services. And as you know, that's the bulk of our revenue. The professional services outside of acquisitions were relatively flat. Licenses were down ever so slightly. So, somewhere -- water is down to 10% a little bit, maybe by 0.5 point to 1 point. But that's the number we focus on as that 10% growth on services.\nJustin Long: Got it. Understood. And I guess, secondly, I wanted to ask about acquisitions. Ed, could you just comment on the pipeline that you're seeing today versus a quarter ago? And it's been a few quarters since we saw an acquisition materialize, I guess, since GroundCloud. So, what's your confidence that we can see that change in the quarters ahead?\nEd Ryan: Yes, there's a lot going on right now. And first and foremost, it's kind of a little bit of a struggle over price with the number of people that are out in the market. We expect just based on what we're seeing ahead of us in a number of companies that are saying they're going to go out that we would see it start to pick up in the near future.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. Congrats on the quarter.\nEd Ryan: Okay. Thank you very much Justin. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Willow Miller from William Blair. Please ask your question.\nWillow Miller: Hi, I'm Willow Miller for Matt Pfau. Thanks for taking our questions. In your prepared remarks, I believe you commented aggregate freight volume is down, but you're seeing strong demand in your subscription products. Are the changes in the operating environment, such as the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, increasing more and enough adoption of subscription products to offset any decline in transaction volume and revenue?\nEd Ryan: Yes, that's certainly part of it. And I mentioned a couple of other things in the beginning of the call that are maybe even more prominent. We're picking up a bunch of business from our competitors as during tough times. I think people tend to flock to a safe and reliable source that's been a big help for us. Certainly, our MacroPoint business and our Global Trade Intelligence business that's been the case, which is great. And yes, as you mentioned, the conflicts around the world put more people on the sanctioned parties list. Tariffs and duties changes, all the things like that. And as we said all along, complexity and change is a big growth driver for us in our business. And I think that's why you've kind of seen us outperform the logistics transportation market over the last year.\nWillow Miller: That’s great. Thank you.\nEd Ryan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Paul Treiber from RBC Capital Markets. Please ask your question.\nPaul Treiber: Thanks very much and good afternoon. Just the commentary in the prepared remarks on the drivers of organic growth are really helpful. When you look back over the years, do you see the changes that you're benefiting from? Do you feel like these drivers are structural and likely to persist for a while? Or does it seem like it's more short-term in nature and may subside at some point in the future?\nEd Ryan: No, that's certainly the latter. I mean we see a bunch of things going on. You probably heard me mention before, the biggest one, which is just that the whole world has realized supply chain and logistics is more important and that the first place they tend to put -- they tend to -- cause them to tend to make extra investments in the first place to put those investments is into technology because it gives them the fastest return on investment and it's the most visible for their customers. I think that's been helping us since the pandemic started and I see no end in sight to that. There's other areas where there's drivers in our business, people are putting more money in the technology. And as a result, they're going with the kind of the IBM of the industry and someone who's seen as a trusted and reliable provider, so we tend to move from small guys to larger guys during times like this. And then just some of the products that we have are fast-growing and like e-commerce and Global Trade Intelligence that are fast-growing things that we kind of see that going on for a long time to come. I don't know when it ends, but I don't see any end in sight. So, certainly the latter.\nPaul Treiber: That's good to hear. And then how do you see that stronger -- fundamentally stronger organic growth changing your business model? Or would you consider changing your business model around it? And what I mean by that is would you consider a higher level of sales and marketing investments? Are there different types of acquisition targets that you consider in light of seeing stronger organic growth than historically?\nEd Ryan: Yes, I mean I think you've seen us and we probably described in the past couple of years, putting more money into sales and marketing. We're still pretty prudent investors, and we're cautious guys that we're running this business for the long-term. We try to treat the money like own, and that's certainly one of the things that we do is continue to make investments as we've done better in our business. And I think you're going to see us continue to do that, but it's probably not going to be fundamentally changing the business, maybe just incremental changes to try to make improvements as things get better. You mentioned acquisitions, probably over the last 10 years, we've gravitated towards faster growth businesses that are profitable and mostly recurring revenue. I think we've gotten quite comfortable doing that and certainly look for those types of businesses in the acquisition environment. We'll consider anything, but certainly, we gravitate towards some of those faster-growing things that we think are going to be the stuff that our customers want next and I think we'll continue to see us do that moving into the future.\nPaul Treiber: And then just lastly for me, on the acquisition side, do you have a -- you mentioned faster-growing businesses. I mean there's been a lot of money that VCs have put into the space over the last couple of years, maybe some of them are struggling now. Do you lean more towards buying healthier businesses, the cash flow positive? Or would you consider some that are fixer-uppers that may have seen stronger growth, but are unprofitable or burning cash?\nEd Ryan: The three things we look for are companies that are growing, companies that are profitable, and companies that all are mostly recurring revenue, and we kind of stick to our guns on that. We'll consider something else, but it's rare that you find us looking at something that doesn't have all three of those things. So, we would like to see a business be profitable before we buy it. As we would say, we don't want to shoot a hole on our own boat, right? So, when we're looking at a business, we'd like to see them demonstrate the ability to make it a profitable business before we get involved. And just so it fits in culturally with us, right? The companies that are losing a lot of money tend to operate in a different way and a different mindset. And when they get to be profitable, they tend to operate a lot more like we do and we don't want to be the ones trying to change the culture of some of these companies.\nPaul Treiber: Thanks for taking the questions.\nEd Ryan: Yes. Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Daniel Chan from TD Cowen. Please ask your question.\nDaniel Chan: Hi, good evening. I know I asked this question last quarter, but your cash balance is now over $320 million. So, any update on your thoughts on the use of cash? You've got more cash on the balance sheet than you've ever spent in any year for acquisitions. And looks like you're likely to generate more than $200 million of free cash flow next year. So, will you be able to use all of that for M&A or are you considering returning some of it to shareholders?\nEd Ryan: No, we see a strong environment for M&A in the next couple of years. It's been a couple of years now where not much is sold and there's been a little bit of a fight about what the price should be. Companies that are not going out because I don't think it's a good environment to sell a company in. And I think that's starting to change. We're seeing that change going on in the market right now. And we're holding on to that cash. So, if there's a need to deploy a larger amount, we're ready to do that. We think our company has the wherewithal to do a lot of acquisitions in a year. We're still very prudent about how we do it and very careful about the investments we make. But if more of them came at us in a given year and we suspect that could happen one of these days, we want to be prepared with cash on hand to pull it off.\nDaniel Chan: Okay. That makes sense. And then earlier, you commented that it's a pretty competitive market out there. Any changes to acquisition thresholds or KPIs that you use when you're considering these targets, especially with like higher rates and like you said, more competition space?\nEd Ryan: We try to stick to our guns. We look at each acquisition individually, right? I mean some have -- they're all different and they all have reasons that we might pay more or less for them. But back at home, we're sitting there thinking about this is the way we buy companies and this is how we evaluate what's a good price for them. And we do our damnedest to stick to those priorities.\nDaniel Chan: And then maybe on the EBITDA margin, I mean it continues to take higher. Nice to see that the acquisition is being layered in nicely. Can you -- if we were to just kind of ignore acquisitions for a second, organically, do you think -- what do you think the upper level is? Do you think it can get above that 45% range?\nEd Ryan: We think that there is a natural push in our business, a natural tailwind for it to keep going higher. We have a bunch of businesses, as you probably heard me describe in the past, Global Trade Intelligence, our network, our customer selling businesses that have a very high incremental margin. So, when we sign a new customer, most of that money flows right to the bottom-line. In total and across some of our fastest-growing businesses, that creates a natural tailwind where that number keeps getting pushed up over time. Those businesses all operate above the line that we're at right now, 44%. And all things being equal, I think it would get pushed over time as those businesses grow. Now, that having been said, we go out and buy five companies, they all make less than us, that's going to drag it down at the same time. I don't view that as a bad news. I think that's an opportunity for us to get those businesses to perform like the rest of our business and make our whole company more profitable and stronger over time. But all things being equal and if there were no acquisitions, you have to see some of the strongest areas in our business with some of the strongest growth and some of the highest incremental margins, we continue to push that number up.\nDaniel Chan: Thanks Ed.\nEd Ryan: Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Andy Nguyen from Raymond James. Please ask your question.\nAndy Nguyen: Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe a question for Allan. Could you give us some more color on the FX impact on the upside revenue as well as the EBITDA?\nAllan Brett: Yes. So, we're fairly naturally hedged from a profitability perspective from FX. We -- a little bit more expenses in Canada, a little bit more revenue than -- and profitability -- profits coming out of the U.K. or Continental Europe. So, we're very naturally hedged there. So, very, very minor impact, this quarter, as well as most quarters on the EBITDA side. From a revenue perspective, we do have some level of exposure, with 30% or so of our revenue coming from those currencies. And so in a strong U.S. dollar environment, we see a bit of weakness in our revenues. It was actually a very, very minor quarter. It was very small, less than $0.5 million impact on revenues in Q4 and really a small impact for most of FY 2024 on revenues. That hasn't always been the case, but it was also a low impact on EBITDA and that is pretty much always the case. Does that help?\nAndy Nguyen: Yes. No, got you. That's very helpful. And maybe a question on the macro pictures. There has been a report of softening retail spending in the U.S., maybe across Europe as well. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing on the ground in terms of the volume with the retailer?\nEd Ryan: Yes, I mean I think the retailers from what we see are all focused on improving their supply chain operations, so they can operate more efficiently and we're benefiting from that right now. The minor ups and downs in that industry show up in some of our transportation statistics that we've been seeing for a while. But the bigger growth driver from retailers and manufacturers that we're doing business with directly is them implementing more transportation management solutions, supply chain visibility solutions and these -- some of these short-term things that you just mentioned, while they may provide minor ups and downs in our global logistics network. Moreover, from these types of companies, we're getting increased investment because they see a need to improve their supply chains. It's something that customers are focused on right now and making sure they know where everything is. it is not only important -- it's important to our customers, and that's been a big benefit for us, and I suspect it will for a long time to come.\nAndy Nguyen: Thank you. I'll pass the line.\nEd Ryan: Thanks Andy.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Robert Young from Canaccord. Please ask your question.\nRobert Young: Hi good evening. I think this is a little bit of a continuation of Paul's earlier question. It seems Trade Intelligence has been very successful, it's high margin. And maybe the world is always going to be this volatile, but it feels as though you're benefiting from a lot of volatility and changes. And if we're looking at a couple of years and things calm down, does the interest in your customers to maintain subscription there or maintain activities? Like how does the business -- how does the revenue changed if things get calmer?\nEd Ryan: Yes, that's a good question, Rob. So, what we've seen is that once you start using these things, you don't stop, right? And there's always changes. I mean, even in times of slower change and we were in the middle of a time of high change right now, but even when that slows down and you see -- even within a year, we see a pickup and a slowdown. The customers that are already doing it, almost always stay on the service, right? They need to know what's happening. They need to know what the sanction parties are. If you're shipping stuff and you've been fined once or twice already and then you sign up for our solutions and there's constantly people getting added to the sanctioned party list. Even in a slow time, there's lots of people getting added every day and a lot of countries and products, et cetera. You need to keep having that solution. So, let's just switch to it, it's hard to get off. It's almost impossible stop actually. You need to have it. The only thing that would make you stop is a country -- if your company got smaller, or you stop shipping as many products to as many different countries, you will not buy as much stuff from us. But as long as your company continues to do well, you're probably going to be buying those sources from us.\nRobert Young: And then my second question would be around, in the past, you've highlighted some of the labor negotiations in U.S. ports as maybe a headwind. And I think that this year, there's some expected negotiation in Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports. And just curious, does that impact you? Or does the ship just move? Does it have any impact on you if that -- if there's an extended--\nEd Ryan: Yes, when I talked about the headwind, it's really a headwind for our customers. Great challenges for them. It actually tends to help us because they have to move stuff around and change things very rapidly to do that, and that tends to drive more transaction volume for us. I don't know whether there's going to actually be a strike there. Most of the time if things are threatened, they don't actually go through. Gulf Atlantic ports is not as big as like, say, the West Coast ports, which just got resolved a year ago -- six to eight months ago. But nonetheless, if you're doing business out of those areas, it would impact you. And if it did, our customers have to make arrangements to get around it, and that usually benefits us.\nRobert Young: Thanks Ed. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nEd Ryan: Thanks Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please ask your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. afternoon. So, I just want to go back to the organic growth for a second. The a bit of a pickup from last quarter. I wasn't clear. Is that more -- are you seeing the transactional start getting a little bit better? Or is it the other parts of the business that got better? And then maybe just, Ed, you talked about Panama Canal and Red Sea, your data clearly showing a big shift to the West Coast ports. Just wondering, do you think that continues or maybe starts to fade?\nEd Ryan: So, on the latter, I mean it's going to continue for a while. I mean you can watch this -- the more -- what's going on in Israel, it's is probably causing that. I don't know what's going to happen there, but it will go on until that it stops, and our customers would be thrilled at a good stuff, but not much we can do about it. Panama Canal is more a function of water levels in the Panama Canal. I heard -- I'm not a meteorologist. I've heard that this is in part due to El Niño, which I guess ends at some point later this year. So, we'll see if that actually helps things. But my understanding is that it should, maybe the Panama would be a little better next year without knowing what the weather is going to be next year, obviously. And sorry, what was the first part of that question?\nScott Group: Just like what -- the organic growth picked up a little bit. Is that more transactional getting better? Or is it the other parts getting better?\nEd Ryan: It's our services overall getting better and a little of it was from transaction volume and probably a little more of it was from subscription volume. I mean the subscriptions -- the transactions are going up and down through the pandemic. They went way up and then way down and back up to normal, and they're probably muddling around over the past year, maybe ticking up a little bit towards the end that you see in our move from 9% to 10%. The subscriptions have been steady -- steadily moving up over the past four or five years. It's been a great source of strength for our business and something that's helped us keep the growth rates up even with the network a year or two ago that was having lackluster performance and kind of more than making up for the subscription part of our business. We'll see what happens in the future. I mean I don't know what's going to happen in the economy that will probably have some impact on the transactional business. The subscription business over the last several years has seen to be somewhat not really impacted by that. There's -- the overriding issue there is that more companies are saying, hey, we got to do something about this supply chain to manage it better. Our customers are expecting us to do that and we're going to pump more money into that investment, and that money is predominantly going to go into the purchase technology because that's where we get the biggest bang for the buck and the highest visibility by the customers. And I see no end in sight to that. We'll see what happens, but I continue to see manufacturers and retailers make investments in those areas. And when they do, they oftentimes are choosing Descartes, which is great.\nScott Group: So, maybe just a follow-up there, like I feel like you talked more today about share gains for your services. Am I right that you're talking more about that? Is this a new trend or has this been going on for a while?\nEd Ryan: It's been going on for a while. I probably explained it better or more thoroughly today than I have in the past. People would ask over the last year, hey, lackluster transportation environment, how do you continue to put up good numbers? And I think that's your answer. Even in a flat environment, we've been taking gains from our competitors and taking gains from ourselves in a sense in that we get -- a customer hands us a whole bunch of shipments and says, please track them. Well, two years ago, we were able to track 70 -- let's just say, 70% of them. Today, I'm able to track 87% of them. I get paid by the shipment to track them. And as we got better at tracking, not only did that help us beat out our competitors because if you're a customer, you want to go with a company that can track the most shipments. But it also helped us increase our transaction on it because I was -- to stay with the math I was using before, we were leaving 30% of them on the ground a couple of years ago, and now we're leaving 13% of them on the ground and continue to try and bump that number up. So, that's been a big help for us and we continue to focus aggressively on that area. I think we spend a lot more time than our competitors doing stuff like that and it's paying off.\nScott Group: And then just last one, if I can. So, you guys continue to come in at the high end of that 10% to 15% annual EBITDA target. I know it's early -- how are you feeling about fiscal 2025?\nEd Ryan: I mean we're always trying to beat that 15% number, Scott. We say 10% to 15%. We all get our bonuses based on beating the 15%. So, yes, we're confident we will as we always are and we're going to do our damnedest to make sure we get there.\nScott Group: Makes sense. Thank you guys. Appreciate it.\nEd Ryan: All right. Thank you, Scott. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Kevin Krishnaratne from Scotiabank. Please ask your question.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Hey there. Good evening. I've just got one. How do we think about the opportunity for cross-selling upside? I know it might be tough to say, but you've got so many products and services. Like how early are you? And how do you measure where you are versus where you can go? Many SaaS firms do give metrics like net retention ratio to measure how much more revenue they're generating from a given client over time. I know you're not going to give that, but just how do we think about that? Any thoughts there on how you're looking at the revenue generation on a given client over time from the cross-sell?\nEd Ryan: Yes, sure, sure. We do business with just about every transportation company of any size in the world and just about every intermediary in the world of any size. So, we have a lot of cross-sell opportunities. If you look at any -- I get these reports every Thursday night what we sold at weekends, it's usually in the two-thirds of the sales are new sales to existing customers, which is a cross-sell. And I would expect it to continue that way for a while. No end in sight to cross-sell being a very large part of what we do. Remember, we continue to buy new companies, too. So, as soon as we buy a company and so -- to give you an example, we buy a company with, say, 500 freight forwarders and the customers love that product. And we buy the company and I say, hey, we've got 5,000. So, the first thing we're going to do is go to the other 4,500 and say, hey, this is the product. And because we're already in there, the company we bought might have had to fight their way into each account, and we're walking right in because we've been -- I might sell 20, 30 products. And so my ability to walk in the door and show the product is immediate. And I'm not saying they're all going to buy it right away, but if we can bring it out to a much wider customer base, I like our chances of selling a lot more, but then the company we just bought us. And I think that's why you see our cross-sell continue to be a big part of our business and will be for a long time to come.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nEd Ryan: Thank you, Kevin.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Please ask your question.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey. Thank you. Yes. Quick question on -- if you think about ESG, carbon footprint, et cetera, like how is that starting to come through for your clients? Because that's -- in our checks, we're hearing quite a good bit of extra interest to optimize things there? And what are you doing on the product side there? Thank you.\nEd Ryan: Hey. Thanks Raimo. So, ESG, for a long time, for 20 years, even before it was a household name, we had a lot of retail customers starting in the grocery industry that had customers -- their consumer customers that were environmentally-conscious and started positioning our product as a way to help the environment. They would have green deliveries, they would say they were offering these deliveries up to the consumer. Here we are 20 years later, and this is a household name. And while it's getting beat up a little bit in the last six months to a year, I think the environmental part of it is less beat up in terms of that. I think there was a lot more companies going, hey, we need to do our part to help the environment. We need to answer these questions for regulators who are asking a lot of questions and specifically about the environment, and our products and there are several products that help them solve that problem. Make no mistake, our customers are buying our products because just they save money, but it's really nice for them when not only doesn't save you money, but it also helps reduce your carbon footprint. And we have several products out there that do provide a significant impact on reducing your carbon footprint. So, not only with the amount of money we save for a big retailer or manufacturer that say, routing trucks with us, we get into the C-suite because of that. But once we do get into the C-suite, they're also going, hey, I'm being asked about all these other things. How does this going to impact the environment? And our answers in that are very good. We have a number of products that reduce the miles driven versus the amount of trucks driven and the amount of gasoline used to deliver goods and it's significant reductions, tens of millions of miles a year that we're taking off the road across our customer base. And as regulatory bodies start to put more and more pressure, shareholders start to put more and more pressure on our customers to answer things about that, that drives demand for our products, which has been great.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nEd Ryan: Hey thank you, Raimo.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand the call back to Ed Ryan for the closing remarks.\nEd Ryan: Great. Thanks everyone. I appreciate your time this afternoon and we look forward to reporting back to you on next quarter in early June. Thanks for your time tonight and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now ended. Thank you all for joining."

And with that, let me turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Ryan: Hey. Thanks, Scott, and welcome everyone to the call. We’re coming off a great third quarter with record financial results, good organic growth and strong operating margins. We’re excited to go over those with you and give you some perspective about the business environment we see right now. But first, let me give you a roadmap for the call. I’ll start by hitting some highlights of the last quarter and some aspects of how our business performed. I’ll hand it over to Allan, who will go over our Q3 financial results in more detail. I’ll then come back to provide an update on how we see the current business environment and how our business is calibrated as we enter Q4. And finally, we’ll open it up to the Operator to coordinate the Q&A portion of the call. So let’s start with the quarter that ended on October 31st. Key metrics we monitor include revenue, profits, cash flow from operations, operating margins and returns on our investments. For this past quarter, we again have outstanding performance in each of those areas. Total revenues were up 19% from a year ago, with service revenues up 18%. Adjusted EBITDA was up 17% from a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA margin was at 44%. Back up to the levels before we bought GroundCloud and we generated $56 million in cash from operations, representing 86% of adjusted EBITDA. At the end of the quarter, we had almost $280 million in cash and we were debt free with an under on $350 million line of credit. We remain well capitalized, cash generating, we have strong organic growth and remain ready to continue to invest in our business. We had a good quarter of organic growth in our core services revenues. Many of the drivers are similar to past periods. The biggest growth areas were in real-time visibility, global trade intelligence and routing and scheduling solutions. So let me touch on each of those here for a minute. First is real-time visibility, when you’re moving goods on other people’s assets, they’re ships, planes and trucks. It’s a challenge to know where your goods are. This is even more difficult if you’re not the one who’s arranged the shipment. If instead you booked through an intermediary like a broker, freight forwarder or third-party logistics provider. To get this visibility, you need to network the sources and information from all these assets and parties and present it in a way that makes business sense. Knowing the location of a shipment and when it’s going to arrive is critical to serving your customers and running your business. Our visibility and transportation management solutions, which include MacroPoint, provide critical help to customers. We’re winning more time visibility deals and seeing strong demand from our customers, and I think, there’s three key reasons for this. The first reason is our solutions are better at tracking loads. Simply put, we track a greater percentage of loads than our competitors can. Customers pay us based on the number of loads that we track, so we’re motivated to have as many carriers and intermediaries as possible to source location information from. If they’re not already connected, we’ve got self-connected tools that help our customers get even more location coverage across their network of carriers. We also have customer success personnel who help expand the network in more complex cases. The outcome has been a greater percentage of loads tracked, better data, happier customers and strong growth in our business. Visibility is embedded, the second reason is visibility is embedded in many Descartes solutions. Some customers come to us just for visibility, but visibility is also embedded into many of our Descartes solutions. Our customers can make transportation management decisions, including planning, who they tend to, consolidations and otherwise, and ensure they have visibility while those shipments are executed. We believe we offer a more comprehensive solution than our competitors in this regard. The third reason is we’re a reliable, stable and growing partner. Our customers take a lot of comfort from working with Descartes as a larger public company with a long track record of financial stability. Also, our customers value our lengthy experience operating secure cloud services across the globe. This makes us a service provider of choice in the real-time visibility market. The second area where we’re seeing strong growth is in global trade intelligence solutions. There’s a lot of geopolitical conflict in the world right now. When that happens, it has an impact on supply chain and logistics. Goods move on new routes away from conflict areas. Sanctions are put in place restricting who you do business with and what types of goods can be shipped. The duties and tariffs are adjusted to incentivize certain trading relationships. We’ve continued to see strong demand from our customers for help with these challenges. Our solutions help them in three principal areas. The first is competitive intelligence. Our data mine solutions provide information on trade flows, historical classifications of goods and other logistics and supply chain intelligence. This information can be used to help make decisions about your own supply chain, but also to see how competitive you are with other companies’ supply chains. The second area is tariff and duty data to make intelligence shipping decisions. We provide up-to-date data about tariff and duty rates and rules around the world, which can be used by leading global trade management systems to help run international supply chains. The third area is compliance. These solutions help our customers make sure they’re not shipping things to people they should not be shipping them to. This may be to specific people, to specific companies, to specific geographies, or in some cases, specific goods being shipped. The final area we’re seeing high growth at the moment that I outlined at the beginning is in our routing and scheduling solutions. These solutions help you manage your own fleet of vehicles rather than hiring space on other people’s vehicles. We believe we have the premier routing and scheduling solutions in the market. Our customers have faced pressure to use their vehicles efficiently, whether it’s due to cost pressures, limited labor or environmental concerns, so we’ve seen continued good demand. Also, our customers recognize that the delivery experience is a key part of the consumer’s purchase experience. So they’re very interested in being able to provide delivery recipients with time-definite delivery windows and an Uber-like delivery visibility experience in the final miles. Our innovations in this area continue to drive customers with complex delivery challenges to us for our solutions. We were able to show good organic growth in the quarter, even with some broader macro-economic challenges in the supply chain and logistics market. As we went into the quarter, the market was bracing for reduced transportation volumes. In the quarter, we did see lower volumes, but not as bad as may have been initially expected. Our supply chain messaging and customers filing businesses saw something impact with lower transaction volumes, but not inconsistent with our plans. Overall, our business is designed to grow through fluctuations in transportation volumes and the superior performance of the parts of our business that are less volume sensitive, combined with the addition of new customers, continued to drive our organic growth. Our organic growth was complimented by the contribution of recently completed acquisitions. Several of the acquisitions are performing better than we originally planned for, resulting in more earn-out being accrued in the quarter. Allan will get into that and more to talent his section, but let me touch on the two most recent acquisitions. The first is GroundCloud. We’ve got about eight months experience with GroundCloud’s safety and compliance solutions. GroundCloud helps us identify safety incidents faced by drivers and provides responsive and targeted video training on the challenges that drivers face. They also help companies manage delivery obligations as they have as subcontractors to other delivery brands such as FedEx. When we first combined with GroundCloud, we indicated we anticipated some impact on our overall adjusted EBITDA margin, which we did in fact see in Q1 and Q2. We’ve made good progress on integration and our aggregate adjusted EBITDA margin is back up to 44% for Q3. We’re also seeing good opportunity for cross-sell of the safety solutions into our existing routing customer base and we’re monitoring the impact of FedEx and increasing the number of shipments it moves through the independent contractor network as that may increase demand from customers looking to help FedEx. The second acquisition was Localz. I spoke to this a bit earlier as Localz helps with the Uber-like delivery experience for the final mile. If you’re receiving a delivery, you can track the vehicle in real time on a map as the goods arrive. The Localz has been immediately incorporated into our routing solutions and we saw good demand for combined Localz Descartes solutions. We’re very happy with the technical capabilities and initial performance and hope to be able to share more on progress in the upcoming quarters. With that, let me just summarize as I handed over to Allan to give the full financial in the quarter -- details in the quarter. We had record financial results, the business performed well and we believe that’s a good reflection of the value that our customers continue to get from our solutions and the hard work that our team continues to put in for our customers. We ended the quarter with almost $280 million in cash, $350 million in available credit and a market opportunity where we can continue to grow the business for our customers, both organically and through acquisition. We remain focused on profitable growth so that we continue to ensure that our customers have a secure, stable and growing technology partner that can help them with their challenges well into the future. Many thanks to all The Descartes team members for everything they’ve done to contribute to a great quarter and continue to have our business in an enviable position for future success. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Allan to go through our Q3 financial results in more detail. Allan?\nAllan Brett: Hey. Thanks, Ed. As indicated, I’m going to take you through our financial highlights for our third quarter, which ended on October 31st. We are pleased to report record quarterly revenue of $144.7 million this quarter, an increase of 19% from revenue of $121.5 million in Q3 last year. While revenue from acquisitions completed in the past 12 months contributed nicely to this growth, similar to the past several quarters, our growth in revenue from new and existing customers from our existing solutions was the main driver in growth again this quarter when compared to last year. Looking at our revenue details further, our revenue mix in the quarter continued to be very strong, with services revenue increasing 18% to $130.4 million, compared to $110.1 million in the same quarter last year, representing approximately 90% of total revenues in the third quarter. Removing the impact of both the recent acquisitions, as well as the impacts from foreign exchange on a like-for-like basis, we would estimate that our growth in services revenue from new and existing customers would have been just over 9% this quarter when compared to the same quarter last year and fairly consistent with the first half this year. License revenue came in at $1.5 million or 1% of revenue in the quarter, up slightly from last year, while professional services and other revenue came in at $12.8 million, up 24% to 9% of total revenue, compared to $10.3 million or 8% of total revenue in the third quarter last year as both professional service hours and hardware revenues were higher this quarter. For the nine months this year revenue came in at $425 million, an increase of 18% from revenue of $361 million in the first nine months last year. Gross margin came in at 76% of revenue for the third quarter, down slightly from gross margin of 77% in the third quarter last year, but very consistent with the gross margins we’ve experienced since the completion of the GroundCloud acquisition earlier this year. Operating expenses increased by approximately 19.5% in the third quarter over the same period last year and this was heavily related to the cost impact from recent acquisitions, primarily the GroundCloud business, but also operating costs increased from some additional investments we made in labor and non-labor costs as we managed the organic growth that we continue to see in our business. So as a result of both revenue growth and solid cost control, balance with targeted investments in our business to manage growth. We continued to see strong adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.5% to a record $63.5 million or 43.9% of revenue up from $54.5 million or 44.9% of revenue in the third quarter last year. We should mention as a reminder that while adjusted EBITDA margins are down slightly from Q3 last year to the diluted impact of recent acquisitions, we did see a sharp increase in our adjusted EBITDA ratio in Q3 over Q2 of this year, increasing from 42.3% of revenue in Q2 to 43.9% of revenue in Q3. This increases the direct result of the continued operating leverage from organic growth, as well as a steady improvement in the margins from our recent acquisitions. For the first three quarters of the year, adjusted EBITDA has increased 14% to $182 million from $160 million in the same nine-month period last year. Looking at the other GAAP line items on our income statement this quarter, other charges increased to $9.7 million up from only $200,000 in Q3 last year and this increases the result of two unique items. First, we accrued an additional $7.8 million in anticipated earn-out payments related to recent acquisitions as these businesses have performed better than our original expectations and therefore better than the estimates that were made at the time of the acquisitions. In addition, as part of our ongoing efforts to maintain an effective cost structure, we initiated a restructuring plan early in Q3 at a point of heightened macro uncertainty. The restructuring involved a reduction of just under 2% of our labor force and the closing in whole or in part of four of our offices as we continue to adopt a flexible work model for our employees and realize that we had certain facilities that were not going to be actively reused by our employees going forward. We would estimate that the cost savings from these completed restructuring efforts would be in the area of $4 million annually and the resulting charge to P&L in the third quarter was approximately $1 million. As a result of the increased profits from the growth in the business, offset by this increase in other charges, from a GAAP earnings perspective, net income came in at $26.6 million or $0.31 per diluted common share in the third quarter, very consistent with net income of $30 -- $26.5 million or $0.31 per diluted common share in the third quarter last year. We should also note that the income tax expense for the third quarter came in at $8.2 million or 23.5% of free tax income, which is slightly lower than our blended statutory tax rate of 26.5%, mainly as a result of recognizing certain unrecorded tax benefits from past periods. Net income for the nine-month period year-to-date was $84.1 million or $0.97 per diluted common share, compared to $72.5 million or $0.82 per diluted common share in the first nine months last year. Again, with the higher offering profits from our growing business being partially offset with the higher amount of other charges from the earn out adjustments and the FY 2024 restructuring plan. With these solid operating results, strong AR collections as an offset partially by the higher cash tax payments we incurred, cash flow generated from operations came in at $56.1 million or 88% of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, an increase of 10%, compared to $50.9 million of cash flow from operations in the third quarter last year. For the nine-month year-to-date, operating cash flow has been $157 million or 86% of adjusted EBITDA up 11% from $142 million in the same nine-month period last year. And we should mention that subject to unusual events and quarterly fluctuations, we expect to continue to see strong cash flow conversion and generally expect cash flow from operations to be between 80% and 90% of our adjusted EBITDA in the quarters ahead. As a reminder, the additional earn out payments that we’ve expensed in other charges in the income statement of these past few quarters will be one of those types of unusual events as these amounts will show as a reduction to cash flow from operations in future quarters when these higher earn out payments are made. Overall, as Ed said, we are once again very pleased with our quarterly operating results in the quarter as strong organic growth and solid performance from our recent acquisitions resulted in strong growth in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. If we turn our attention to the balance sheet, our cash balance is totaled $280 million at the end of October up from approximately $227 million at the end of the second quarter in July. This increase in cash is primarily related to the $56 million in cash flow from operations that we generated in the quarter. As a result, as Ed mentioned, we have $280 million in cash available to us as October 31st, as well as our unused $350 million credit facility available to deploy towards future acquisitions consistent with our business plan. As we look to the final quarter of fiscal 2024, we should note the following. After incurring approximately $4.8 million in capital additions for the first nine months of the year, we expect to incur approximately $1 million to $2 million in additional capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of this year. At this point, we currently expect that in the fourth quarter, we will use approximately $23.3 million of our cash to pay additional contingent consideration on two past acquisitions. While this entire $23.3 million estimated contingent consideration to be paid as a accrued for on our balance sheet, approximately $12.7 million of this balance relates to the portion of the earn-out arrangements accrued for at the time of the acquisition and will be reflected in cash flow from financing activities, while the remaining $10.6 million expected to be paid will be reflected in cash flow from operating activities, as the financial results from these acquisitions have both been better than our initial expectations, and therefore, the earn-out payments are higher than our original estimates made at the time of the acquisitions. After incurring amortization costs of $45.4 million in the first nine months of the year, we expect amortization expense will be approximately $14.7 million in the fourth quarter with this figure being subject to adjustment for foreign exchange and future acquisitions. Our income tax rate for the first nine months of the year came in at approximately 24.5% of pre-tax income. Looking ahead into the fourth quarter, we currently expect our overall tax rate will again come in below our blended statutory tax rate of 26.5%, and as a result, we’ll experience a tax rate in the range of 23% to 25% of pre-tax income for the year. After incurring stock-based compensation of expense of $12.4 million in the first nine months of the year, we currently expect stock compensation to be approximately $4.4 million in the fourth quarter, subject to any forfeiture of stock options or shared units. And with that, I’ll turn it back over to Ed, with -- who will give you some closing comments, as well as our baseline calibration for Q4.\nEd Ryan: Great. Thanks, Allan. So we are a month into Q4 and the end of our fiscal year. General areas of our business that benefit from end of year holiday sales such as e-commerce and truck deliveries will see an uptick in volumes. Another area such as ocean transportation are at seasonal low point as inventories are already in store. Our forecasting and plans remain relatively cautious given the general malaise and different volumes in the previous quarters this year. However, we are also mindful of the press reports with initial positive statistics on Black Friday sales volumes. We keep these things in mind as we set our calibration for the quarter. Our business is designed to be predictable and consistent. We believe that stability and reliability are valuable to our customers, employees and our broader stakeholders. To deliver this consistency, we continue to operate from the following principles. Our long-term plan is for our business to grow adjusted even to 10% to 15% annually. We grow through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. We take a neutral party approach to building and operating solutions on our global logistics network. We don’t favor any particular party. We run our business for all supply chain participants, connecting shippers, carriers, logistics service providers and customs authorities. When we over perform, we try to reinvest that over performance back into our business, we focus on recurring revenues and establish relationships with customers for life, and we thrive on operating a predictable business that allows us to forward visibility to our revenues and investment payback. In our Q3 report, we provided a comprehensive description of baseline revenues, baseline calibration and their limitations. As of November 1, 2023, using foreign exchange rates of $0.72 to the Canadian dollar, $1.06 to the euro and $1.21 to the pound, we estimate that our baseline revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 are approximately $127 million and our baseline operating expenses are approximately $79 million. We consider this to be our baseline adjusted even to calibration of approximately $48 million for the fourth quarter of 2024 or approximately 38% of our baseline revenues as at November 1, 2023. We continue to expect that we’ll operate it in adjusted EBITDA operating margin range of 40% to 45%. Our margin can vary in that range given such things as foreign exchange movements and the impact of acquisitions as we integrate them into our business. We’ve got lots of extending things planned for our business. It remains an uncertain, broader economic and supply chain environment, but we believe our proven track record of execution, solid capital structure and customer focus will serve us well. Thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. As always, we’re available to talk to you about our business in whatever manner is most convenient for you. And with that, Operator, I’ll now turn it over to you to manage the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nMatt Pfau: Hey. Great. I wanted to ask a question on competition and on the macro. So, one of your public competitors had some notable struggles this past quarter and there’s another private competitor that went out of business. Just wondering if you’re seeing some of the same headwinds that they’re seeing and some of their struggles is having any impact on you competitively? Thanks.\nEd Ryan: Thanks, Matt. I mean, I think, we saw some of the things that impacted them. We obviously fought our way through it and ended up with pretty good results. The two companies you’re talking about may have been in a different position in that things went bad, maybe with transportation -- transaction volumes and then the customer suffered as a result, and they didn’t have any other products or services to make up for it. We obviously were in a different situation and we’re able to take advantage of that. And sometimes competitors struggle and end up being good news for you, because customers turn elsewhere and that also makes them potentially concerned about, who they’re going business with and when you’re a strong company like Descartes that ends up playing in our favor.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. And then just on the services revenue that did tick downs sequentially, was that driven by some of the headwinds on the transaction side that you cited?\nEd Ryan: I think so, yeah. I mean, we had a very strong quarter, but it probably would have been better if some of our customers’ volumes were doing even better. The -- whether it was a horrible quarter, I think people were predicting it was going to be a lot worse than it was in terms of our customers’ transportation volumes and we have the benefit of continuing to sign up new customers in the space of that. So we did all right in that period, probably would have been even better if that part had gone well and we had a bunch of other parts of our business that I mentioned on the call that were really doing well, so that kind of more than made up for it. So we’re happy with the results under the circumstances, for sure.\nMatt Pfau: Okay. Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nEd Ryan: Hey. Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is now open.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good afternoon. Ed, maybe building on that last question, could you share what’s your -- how your transportation volumes performed on a year-over-year basis in the quarter? And Allan, I heard your commentary around organic growth for the services revenue line, but do you have the estimate for all-in organic growth as well?\nEd Ryan: I don’t know that I have the exact numbers, Allan, year-over-year, but if you get something.\nAllan Brett: Yeah. So if we want to talk about organic growth numbers, we’re just over 9% on the services side and just very, very similar to that overall in the business. There is -- there was certainly some slight negative impacts on FX that would have affected, the question Matt just had with respect to our services revenue being down slightly quarter-on-quarter. That was -- they were up actually neutral with FX, but roughly 9% in both services revenue and total revenue for the quarter.\nJustin Long: Okay. And any sense on transactional volumes on a year-over-year basis, even if it’s just kind of directionally, it sounds like maybe there was pressure year-over-year or any additional color you can share there?\nAllan Brett: Yeah. There was definitely some pressure year-on-year. We certainly did better with our subscription services for software and databases. But as Ed said a couple times in the prepared comments, we kind of expected that, our businesses built to deal with those types of fluctuations. Those are not new for us. We will see those types of things happen from time-to-time. Quite honestly, we’ve probably seen weaker transactions in the last 12 months. But overall, what matters for us is the overall blended growth rate and then businesses built to grow and the 9% overall is more of our focus.\nJustin Long: Got it. And I guess, lastly, Ed, could you just talk about the acquisition pipeline? I am curious what you’re seeing today versus a quarter ago and your level of confidence that we can see capital deployment pick up the next couple of quarters or so?\nEd Ryan: Yeah. Without getting into too much detail on it, we like the environment we’re in right now. A couple years ago there were not many companies for sale and the ones that were, in our estimation, were oftentimes trying to charge too much. We made a difficult acquisition environment for us, but things are certainly softening from that perspective and creating opportunities for us to get more deals done at in-price ranges that we think are a good value. More companies are coming up for sale and as a result and maybe in addition to companies are coming up for sale and with a more reasonable expectation of valuation and that’s creating an environment where we think we’re in a very good position to get more deals done in the future.\nJustin Long: Okay. I’ll leave it there. Thanks for the time.\nEd Ryan: Hey. Thank you, Justin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Chan from TD Cowen. Your line is not open.\nDaniel Chan: Yeah. Hi. Good evening. Maybe to follow on that last question, the cash balance continues to grow. You’re now at about $280 million and you do about $200 million of free cash flow here, which is more than you’ve typically spent on acquisitions in prior years. So any other considerations for that capital just given the strong cash balance and the strong cash flows or do you think you’ll be able to deploy that towards acquisitions over the next few years?\nEd Ryan: Listen, I mean, we’re making more and more money every year. That’s great. We only buy companies when we think it’s a good deal and that means we have extra cash and that means we have extra cash. We’re not going to apologize for that. We absolutely think that the winner in our space is going to continue to be acquisitive and we absolutely believe that there are many more companies that are acquisition candidates for us. So while we talk about it at our Board level, we’ll discuss every quarter, should we have a dividend, should we some way give this money back to shareholders to our buyback, whatever. But at the moment and I think for the foreseeable future, well, we believe that that money should go towards acquisitions. And it’s not really going to harm us at the moment to have more cash sitting in the bank. It’s actually a good thing. Our company continues to make more money. And as we look forward and say, hey, we think we’re going to like this future acquisition environment, and go, hey, I think, we’d be smart to hang onto it and be ready to act if a bunch of stuff comes up for sale at the same time. Certainly think we have the team to negotiate, purchase and integrate those types of companies when they come in and we want to be ready when that happens. So that’s why you see us holding on to our cash.\nDaniel Chan: Yeah. Makes a lot of sense. Thanks for that. Maybe another question on the macro environment. You talked about weaker volumes last quarter. Just wondering whether you saw that extend into the peak holiday shopping season over the last month. We’ve seen headlines that Black Friday, Cyber Monday volumes.\nEd Ryan: Well, listen, we’re not reporting on this month, but I have seen some of the transportation statistics unrelated to our transaction volumes and I’d say they look good. And you can probably see some of that as you read the paper right now. Black Friday was a pretty good Black Friday. The report’s something we’re reading right now. And when I look at -- and again, independent of our transaction volumes, when I look at the transportation statistics that we would normally look at over the last month, they look good. Starting to -- things are certainly will starting to pick up in anticipation of Black Friday. So that’s good news.\nDaniel Chan: That’s helpful. Thanks, Ed.\nEd Ryan: Thank you, Dan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Afternoon. So, Ed, I just want to follow up on that last point, because I think, we’re seeing a little bit of better import activity, better air freight rates. You’re saying you’re not reporting on that. But is that sort of reflected to the extent that you are seeing that? Is that -- would that be reflected in your calibration?\nEd Ryan: The calibration was done at that as -- at the first day of the quarter. So technically no. In my comment…\nScott Group: Okay.\nEd Ryan: … about not reporting on it, is just saying, hey, I’m reporting on through the end of the quarter, not the first month of the first quarter. And specifically to your question, our calibration this quarter was done as of the first day of the quarter.\nScott Group: Okay. That makes sense. Okay. I wanted to get your perspective, a year ago, we were talking about just in time is becoming just in case. I’m wondering is, with much higher rates, are we just -- is that sort of done, are we back to just in time and how does that -- is that a good thing or a bad thing?\nEd Ryan: Well, probably, I’m just a bit of a guess on my part. We’re just getting some comments from customers about this. But I don’t know this perfectly. But we always believe that just in time, now just in case, we always believe it would end up gravitating towards back just in time. People forget about how bad it was three years ago when the ports were all backed up and then they start going, boy, I’m losing a lot of money and inventory carry costs, I’ve had all this extra stuff and now interest rates just went up significantly and so now that’s a lot of money and I should be more careful. And we always believed it was going to drip towards back that. And I’d say, if I’d eventually guess that it would probably somewhere approaching back to just in time in a lot of cases, because high interest rates and the warehouse is only so big and you can only hold so much inventory and you’ve got to make good approximations about what customers are going to buy in stores and companies are always going to try and do that and I think we’re drifting back towards just in time, for sure, in most cases.\nScott Group: Makes sense. And then just lastly, a nice step up in the EBITDA margin. Did we see the full impact of some of the cost actions this quarter or do we see more of that show up in Q4 and so maybe we see another further step up in the margin?\nEd Ryan: Yeah. I will let Allan -- Let me -- let Allan answer that more specifically.\nAllan Brett: Yeah. Sure. So we did initiate our restructuring plan earlier in the quarter. So for the most part, we’ve completed it and the results are in the quarter. There will be a little bit of an impact coming through Q4, given that there’ll be a full quarter impact for all the changes. But for the most part, Q3 had most of it baked in, if that helped.\nScott Group: Yeah. All right. Thank you guys. Appreciate the time.\nEd Ryan: Hey. Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Robert Young from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.\nRobert Young: Hi. Good evening. The first question was asking about the shutdown of a private competitor. Maybe just another question there. Maybe a lot of reports in the news suggested that they really struggled to find a strategic buyer that there was not a lot of activity out there. And so like, is there a big sea change or is there a bigger change in the number of buyers or the interest in the space that puts you in a better leader.\nEd Ryan: I -- while I knew who they were talking about when we asked the question a couple of questions ago, I didn’t bother disagreeing with the question. I don’t know that we’re the technically really competitor of the guy that he was talking about going out of business. They’re more of a freight broker. They had a business that was an electronic freight brokerage and that’s not something we would buy. That’s a customer of ours. They were a small customer of ours. And furthermore, when I -- this has happened, like, I’ve watched this movie like 30 times in my life where a company comes in that does the same thing as everybody else in the industry and says, I’m going to be the automated guy that does that. And every time I hear that I go, that’s a misnomer. You’re trying to pretend like you’re a technology company when in this case you’re a freight broker and you’re saying that the reason that we should invest in your freight brokerage is because you’re going to be more automated than everyone else. And I always think to myself, even if that creates an advantage for you for some period of time, it’s not going to last long, because your competitors are going to buy automation from people like us that provide awesome automation in this industry and that advantage will evaporate in short order and you’ll be back to being a freight broker with no significant advantage over anyone else. I think that’s what happened here and I think in addition to that, because they raised a lot of money, they dumped a lot of money into becoming an automated freight broker, and as a result, they had a big burn that was hard to overcome when things went back to normal, and as a result, they went out of business. And we didn’t even look, that’s not something we would buy and that’s something maybe one of our competitors, sorry, one of our customers would buy and they didn’t. I think the competitors probably thought, I’ll just steal those customers from them and that’ll be the end of it. I’ll do my guess as to what happened there. But that -- for us that business we were just looking at from afar, they were minor customers of ours. We were aware of what was going on, but not particularly interested in any of the assets.\nRobert Young: Okay. Second question for me would be about, I think on that call, you’ve been talking about maybe offsetting weaker transaction volumes than you expected with maybe better subscription side and so I was curious, is that consolidation, is there any other -- what are -- is there any other factor there maybe to call out or customers…\nEd Ryan: No. We -- I mean -- no. Listen, we have a bunch of areas in our business that are booming. We have transaction volumes that are stuffed in like 30 -- a little over 30% of our business that have always and will always fluctuate up and down a little bit. Every once in a while, you seem to fluctuate down a lot like an ‘08 [ph]. But even that a lot is 8%. That was -- they were down all the way to 8% and I think, geez, why is that, because most of the stuff that we use still has to ship. And maybe in good times we’re all buying lobster and in bad times we’re all buying chicken. But it’s the same shifting volume. One costs a lot more than the other. Maybe we don’t buy boats and jet skis for a couple years, but most of the stuff that we need to live and run our households still gets shipped and we get that shipping volume. So even in the worst of times, maybe 8% down for the work that’s ever going to get is not that much. And these variations in our business happen from time to time. Guys like us need to be prepared for it. And fortunately for us, we have a broad enough business where we have a bunch of other things that are really going great. So that when the transportation volumes are a little weak, like they were in the last six months, eight months, while they were recovering, but not as strong as we’d like to see them. Our business continues to perform well through that and I think that’s a great sign of a resilient business that something like volumes go down and our answer to that is nothing to see here. We continue to do well.\nRobert Young: All right. Thanks for taking the question.\nEd Ryan: Yeah. Thank you, Rob.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.\nEd Ryan: All right. Great. Thanks everyone for your time. We look forward to seeing you in the coming weeks and months and reporting back to you next quarter with the Q4 results. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This call is being recorded on Wednesday, September 6, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Pagan. Please go ahead.\nScott Pagan: Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Ed Ryan, CEO; and Allan Brett, CFO.

And with that, let me turn the call over to Ed.\nEd Ryan: Thanks, Scott, and welcome everyone to the call. We had an excellent first half of the year with record financial results this past quarter. We're excited to go over those with you and give you some perspective about the business environment we see right now. But first, let me give you a roadmap for this call. I'll start by hitting some highlights of last quarter and some aspects of how our business performed. I'll then hand it over to Allan who will go over the Q2 financial results in more detail. I'll then come back and provide an update on how we see the current business environment and how our business is calibrated as we enter Q3. And then we'll open it up to the operator to coordinate the Q&A portion of the call. So let's get started by looking at the quarter that just ended July 31.  Key metrics we monitor include revenues, profits, cash flow from operations and returns on our investments. For this past quarter, we again had record performance in each of those areas. Total revenues were up 17% from a year ago with service revenues up almost 20%. Net income and EPS were up 23% and 19%, respectively. Income from operations was up 17% while adjusted EBITDA was up 12%. And we generated $52 million in cash from operations representing 86% of adjusted EBITDA.  At the end of the quarter, we had $227 million in cash and we were debt free with an undrawn $350 million line of credit. We remain well capitalized, cash generating, debt free and ready to continue to invest in our business. We believe a company like ours is well positioned to continue to thrive in market conditions like these, because we've got good organic growth plus the experience and capital capacity to execute on acquisitions. We had a good quarter of organic growth in our core services revenues, so I want to highlight some of the drivers of that.  The first is just real-time visibility. Just a refresher on this, a large part of shipping is people moving goods on other people's assets, whether they be planes, trucks, rail or boats. There may also be intermediaries involved in arranging the shipments or making required filings, including freight brokers, third party logistics providers and customs brokers. With all those assets, modes of transportation, data sources, locations and parties involved, it can be challenging to know where a shipment is and knowing the location of a shipment and when that's going to arrive is critical to serving your customer and running your business.  Our visibility in transportation management solutions, which include MacroPoint, are increasingly important for our customers in this area. These solutions contributed to solid growth in the quarter for reasons including first, our solutions are better at tracking loads, customers pay based on the number of loads that are tracked by our solutions. So we're aligned with our customers on doing what we can to connect as many carriers and intermediaries as possible to get location information on loads. We've launched new carrier self-connect tools that have helped our customers get even more location coverage across their network of carriers. We've also made investments in customer success personnel to help maximize the number of loads with full visibility. The outcome has been a greater percentage of loads tracked, better data, happier customers and strong growth.  Second issue is we're winning more deals and seeing strong demand for visibility. The real-time visibility market is not without competitors. However, we're having good success at securing new customers and welcoming back some old ones, because our commitment to tracking the success. We have a broader network that's across more modes of transportation than our competitors and that's being recognized by customers as they choose the visibility solution for the future. Our customers often take comfort in our reliability, and that we're operating a business they know will be around to serve them for the long term.  The third issue is visibility is embedded in more Descartes solutions. Some customers come to us just for visibility, but others are using Descartes solutions and are looking to have visibility as an add-on to what they're already doing. Each time we expand our solution set including by way of acquisition, we look for how we can embed visibility into the new solutions to provide an easier mechanism for our customers to track their loads. We believe that our best source of business is often our existing expansive and supportive customer base. So we're making dedicated efforts to make visibility easier for those customers.  Second big issue is routing, scheduling and mobile solutions and this contributed to our revenue success this quarter. These solutions are principally for when you're managing your own fleet of vehicles rather than hiring space on other people's vehicles. We believe we're the most experienced company in this market and have the premier routing and scheduling solutions to offer. Our customers in this area have faced recent challenges including rising labor costs, challenges in security data, rising fuel prices, and customer demands for accurate delivery windows. This is contributing to strong demand with new customer projects and existing customers retuning their solutions.  We've also been innovative in this market, which has contributed to our market leadership. We've recently launched a new generation route planning solution that has been rolled out with customers. And we've made investments in our solutions through acquisitions with safety solutions from GroundCloud and final mile delivery tracking from Localz, all factors that contributed to good growth in this area.  The third area is global trade intelligence. Once again, we saw good growth in the global trade intelligence solutions in our business. Those solutions generally fall into three buckets. The first bucket is competitive intelligence. Our data mine solutions provide information on trade flows, historical classification of goods, and other logistics and supply chain intelligence. This information can be used to help make decisions about your own supply chain, but also to see how competitive you are with other companies supply chains.  Recent attention on efficiency of supply chains has helped drive demand in this area. In addition, our data is front and center in many leading business publications as a source for data about logistics and supply chains, which has also been a good demand driver for us. The second bucket is tariff and duty data to make intelligent shipping decisions. We provide up-to-date data about tariff and duty rates and rules around the world, which can be used by leading global trade management systems to help run international supply chains. We've seen an increased level of changes in tariffs and duties principally as a consequence of geopolitical tensions and trade disputes. This has changed the design of many supply chains and has increased the importance of having accurate and timely information like ours.  The third bucket is compliance. These solutions help our customers make sure they're not shipping things to people they shouldn't be. This may be to specific people, to specific countries, to specific geographies, or in some cases specific goods being shipped. These restrictions have expanded and increased in complexity, as the geopolitical tensions have increased, and trade disputes have emerged. In addition, governments in the larger economies, like the United States, have increased the resources dedicated to ensuring compliance and have levied substantial financial penalties on firms not taking compliance seriously. We've continued to see good demand for these compliance solutions as a result.  The next area is e-commerce. This continues to be a growing market and part of our business. We've made investments into these solutions with additional leadership and also by way of acquisition with our purchase of XPS within the past year. The parcel market has seen some recent challenges with labor challenges at UPS, changing service preferences at the U.S. Postal Service and FedEx restructuring. However, our share in the market continues to increase as we work with partners to find the most efficient way for our customers to get their deliveries made. So good acquisition and organic contribution in the quarter.  We're very happy with how the business performed in the quarter and in particular with the organic growth the business was able to produce, a few comments on our two most recent acquisition additions. The first is on GroundCloud. We combined with GroundCloud in February. GroundCloud is particularly strong in safety and compliance solutions that help identify safety incidents faced by drivers and provide responsive and targeted video training on challenges drivers face. They also help companies manage delivery obligations as they have subcontractors to other delivery brands, such as FedEx.  This was one of our larger acquisitions. And when we first combined, we indicated we anticipated some impact overall on our adjusted EBITDA margin, which we saw in Q1. We've made good progress on integration and actually saw a slight uptick in aggregate adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter, so we're hoping that bodes well for the future. Finally, FedEx has recently announced that it may increase the number of shipments that will move to the independent contractor network. So we saw some good initial improved demand for that.  Second acquisition is Localz. This business provides final mile visibility on deliveries. So if you're used to watching your Uber driver or food delivery vehicle come down the street to your house, Localz technology replicates that experience for delivery of other goods. This was a key investment in our routing, scheduling and mobile space, something our own customers need and they seek to provide a better delivery experience for their own customers. This investment was critical to some of our new customers trusting their fleet management to Descartes. Let me just summarize as I hand it over to Allan to give full financial details on the quarter. We had record financial results. The business performed well. And we believe that's a good reflection of the value that our customers continue to get from our solutions and the hard work that our team continues to put in for our customers. We ended the quarter with $227 million in cash, $350 million in available credit, and a market opportunity where we continue to grow the business for our customers both organically and through acquisitions.  We remain focused on profitable growth so that we can continue to ensure our customers have a secure, stable and growing technology partner that can help them with their challenges well into the future. Many thanks to all the Descartes team members for everything they've done to contribute to a great quarter and continue to have our business in an enviable position for future success.  I'll turn the call over to Allan to go through our Q2 financial results in more detail.\nAllan Brett: Thanks, Ed. As indicated, I'm going to walk you through our financial highlights for our second quarter, which ended on July 31. We are pleased to report record quarterly revenue of 143.4 million this quarter, an increase of 17% from revenue of 123.0 million in Q2 last year. While revenue from new acquisitions, including the GroundCloud acquisition completed earlier in the year, as Ed just mentioned, contributed nicely to this growth, similarly to the first quarter and really the last several years, growth in revenue from new and existing customers from our existing solutions was the main driver in growth this quarter when compared to last year.  Looking further at our numbers, our revenue mix in the quarter continued to be very strong with services revenue increasing 19% to 130.7 million or 91% of total revenue compared to 109.4 million or 89% of total revenue in the same quarter last year. Services revenue was also up nicely sequentially increasing just over 5% from the first quarter of this year, as we continue to help our customers expand with new services and additional volumes. Removing the impact of recent acquisitions, on a like-for-like basis, we would estimate that our growth in services revenue from new and existing customers would have been just over 9% for the quarter when compared to the same quarter last year, similarly to the results we saw in Q1 this year.  License revenue came in at 1.4 million or just 1% of revenue in the quarter, down from license revenue of 3.3 million in the second quarter last year, as we had a couple of larger than normal license deals closed in the second quarter last year while professional services and other revenue came in at 11.3 million or 8% of revenue, up approximately 10% from revenue of 10.3 million in Q2 last year. This was mainly as a result of recent acquisitions, including GroundCloud.  Gross margin for the second quarter was 76% of revenue for the quarter, pretty consistent with gross margins we realized both in the first quarter of this year and the second quarter last year. Operating expenses increased by approximately 19% in the second quarter over the same period last year, and this was primarily related to the impact of recent acquisitions, including GroundCloud but also from additional labor-related costs as we continue to invest in various areas of our business to prepare for future growth.  So as a result of both revenue growth offset slightly by our planned cost increases in the business, we continue to see strong adjusted EBITDA growth of 12% to a record 60.6 million, up from 54.0 million in Q2 last year. As a percentage of revenue, adjusted EBITDA came in at 42.3% of revenue, down from 43.9% of revenue in Q2 last year. And as mentioned in Q1, this is once again primarily related to the acquisition of GroundCloud earlier in the year as it came into Descartes with much lower EBITDA ratios than the rest of our business.  We should note that our adjusted EBITDA ratio as a percentage of revenue did increase slightly in Q2 when compared to Q1 of this year, as we've already started to work at improving the profitability on the GroundCloud business consistent with our plans as Ed mentioned earlier. As a result of the above, net income under GAAP came in at 28.1 million or $0.32 per diluted common share in the second quarter, an increase of 23% from net income of 22.9 million or $0.27 per diluted common share in the second quarter last year.  If we look at our operating results for the first half of the year, the trends stay the same. Revenue came in at 280.0 million, an increase of 17% from revenue of 239.4 million in the first six months last year. For the six months year-to-date, adjusted EBITDA came in at 118.3 million or 42.3% of revenue, up just over 12% from 105.2 million or 43.9% of revenue last year. Net income for the six-month year-to-date period increased 25% coming in at 57.5 million or $0.66 per diluted common share compared to 46.0 million or $0.53 per diluted common share in the first half of last year, again, with higher operating profits being partially offset by higher tax expense.  With these strong operating results and continued strong accounts receivable collections, cash flow generated from operations came in at 52.0 million or 86% of adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, an increase of 12% from operating cash flow of 46.4 million or also 86% of adjusted EBITDA in the same quarter last year. For the six months year-to-date, operating cash flow has been 100.9 million or 85% of our adjusted EBITDA, up 11% from 90.8 million in the first half of last year.  And we should mention as always going forward, we expect to continue to see strong cash flow conversion and generally expect cash from operations to be between 80% to 90% of our adjusted EBITDA in the periods ahead, subject any unusual fluctuations or future changes and contingent consideration payments that we'll discuss later as I comment on our outlook for the second half of the year. So overall, we're once again pleased with our operating results in the quarter as strong organic growth and solid performance from our recent acquisitions resulted in 17% growth in revenue and a 12% increase in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter.  If we turn our attention to the balance sheet, our cash balances totaled 227 million at the end of July, an increase of approximately 45 million from the end of the first quarter in April. While we generated 52 million in cash flow from operations, we also used 6 million of our existing cash balances to complete an earn-out or contingent consideration payment on a past acquisition, while also adding 2 million in capital additions during the quarter. As a result, we currently have our 227 million of cash as well as a $350 million line of credit available under our credit facility available to deploy towards future acquisitions. So we continue to be well capitalized to allow us to consider all opportunities in our market consistent with our business plan. As we turn our attention to the second half of fiscal 2024, we should note the following. After incurring approximately 3.4 million in capital additions in the first half of the year, we expect to incur approximately 2 million to 3 million in additional capital additions for the balance of the year. At this point, we currently expect the second half of the year we'll use approximately 22.8 million of our cash to pay additional contingent consideration payments on two acquisitions.  While the entire 22.8 million estimated contingent consideration to be paid is now accrued for on our balance sheet, 12.7 million of this balance relates to the portion of the earn-out arrangements that were accrued for at the time of the acquisition and will be reflected in cash flow from financing activities while the remaining balance of approximately 10 million will be reflected in cash flow from operating activities when paid as a result of these acquisitions have been better than our initial expectations.  After incurring amortization costs of 30.2 million in the first half of the year, we expect the amortization expense will be approximately 29.8 million for the second half of the year, with this figure being subject to adjustment for foreign exchange changes and future acquisitions. Our income tax rate for the second quarter came in at approximately 27% of pre-tax income, which is right around our blended statutory tax rate. Looking into the second half of the year, we currently expect our tax rate will continue to be in the range of 25% to 30% of our pre-tax income, or somewhere either side of our statutory blended rate.  However, as always, we should state that our tax rate may fluctuate quarter-to-quarter from one-time items that may arise as we operate internationally across multiple countries. And finally, after incurring stock-based compensation expense of 7.4 million in the first half of this year, we currently expect stock compensation will be approximately 9.3 million for the balance of the year, subject to any forfeitures of stock options or shared units.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to Ed to wrap up with some closing comments as well as our baseline calibration for Q3.\nEd Ryan: Great. Thanks, Allan. With Q3 a month in, we remain confident in our business but cautious about the broader economic circumstances and various statistics and commentary relating to the supply chain logistics markets. On the broader economic front, this continued high interest rates, pervasive conflict in Ukraine, labor availability challenges and various recessionary pressures and economic discussions. In the supply chain and logistics market, here's a few things we're noting.  First is shipping volumes. Shipping volumes across various modes of transportation are below their pandemic highs and more closely tracking pre-pandemic trends. In addition, there are some current challenges such as the reduced flow through the Panama Canal caused by low water levels that could impact shipping alternatives. The second is retailer inventories. This higher level of retailer inventories potentially impacting fall replenishment cycles, inventories aren't decreasing, implying retailers are matching demand with replenishment and potentially carrying more safety stock.  The third is consumer demand. There's uncertain consumer demand coming into this peak buying season, in particular it's uncertain how spending habits will split between durable goods and services and experiences. Overall, U.S. consumer spending is still high, but there's caution as we approach the holiday season. The fourth is some capacity left the market. The U.S. truck market has seen some capacity come out of the market with the recent bankruptcy of Yellow. The market continues to adjust the post pandemic volumes and it's possible more capacity will leave.  In air, we're seeing capacity adjustments with less reliance on pure air freighters. With additional trade restrictions, there continues to be new restrictions announced principally relating to the war in Ukraine and in connection with burgeoning trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Some new restrictions have been announced with respect to investment in and trade in chip manufacturing, AI and quantum technologies. These restrictions can be positive for our global trade intelligence business, but can also impact freight volumes. There’s also labor challenges. Labor negotiations have created challenges for UPS, West Coast ports and Yellow and may impact other unionized supply chain players.  Next are some logistics participants planning for a muted peak season. General commentary from logistics participants is bracing for lower volumes in the second half of the year with some companies taking proactive cost reduction activities. This is illustrative of the pervasive sentiment of caution. And then finally, distribution of parcel volumes among larger players is uncertain. As I mentioned earlier, UPS has some labor challenges which may have resulted in some parcel buying cautiously being redirected to other players.  FedEx has publicly indicated it will be moving more parcel volume to its ground division with independent contractors and away from its Express division using employees. The U.S. Postal Service has implemented various new service adjustments as it seeks to compete and Amazon has announced its reentering the parcel delivery business. All of this combines to provide a very competitive environment with uncertainty as to how the volumes will shake out among the various providers. So those are some of the things we're hearing from our customers and seeing in our business, things that also inform our calibration for the quarter.  Our business is designed to be predictable and consistent. We believe that stability and reliability are valuable to our customers, employees and our broader stakeholders. To deliver this consistency, we continue to operate from the following principles. Our long-term plan is for our business to grow adjusted EBITDA 10% to 15% annually. We grow through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. We take a neutral party approach to building and operated solutions on our global logistics network.  We don't favor any particular party. We run our business for all supply chain participants, connecting shippers, carriers, logistics, service providers and customs authorities. When we over perform, we try to invest that over performance back into our business. We focus on recurring revenues and establishing relationships with customers for life. And we thrive on operating a predictable business that allows us forward visibility to our revenues and investment paybacks.  In our Q2 report, we provided a comprehensive description of baseline revenues, baseline calibration, and there are limitations. As of August 1, 2023, using a foreign exchange rate of $0.75 to the Canadian dollar, $1.10 to the euro and $1.28 to the Great Britain pound, we estimate that our baseline revenues for the third quarter of 2024 are approximately $124 million and our baseline operating expenses are approximately $78 million. We consider this to be our baseline adjusted EBITDA calibration of approximately $46 million for the third quarter of 2024 or approximately 37% of our baseline revenues as at August 1, 2023.  We continue to expect the adjusted EBITDA operating margin range of 40% to 45%, our margins vary in that range given such things as foreign exchange movements and the impact of acquisitions as we integrate them into our business. Last quarter, GroundCloud impacted our margin while we started the integration work to bring it up to our desired Descartes contribution levels. The integration activities have gone well, we've already seen some margin improvement in Q2, and we're planning for some additional margin improvement going forward, absent any other acquisition activity.  We've got lots of exciting things planned in our business. It remains an uncertain broader economic and supply chain environment. But we believe our proven track record of execution, solid capital structure and customer focus will serve us well. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. As always, we're available to talk to you about our business in whatever manner is most convenient for you.  And with that, operator, I'll turn it over to you for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your line is now open.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks, guys. I wanted to follow up on some of the comments you made about potential headwinds in the back half of the year here. How should we think about those in terms of the potential impact on your business? Part of your business is transaction based but it's not as simple as just being tied to shipping volume. So how do we think through the potential puts and takes there in terms of the impact on your revenue?\nEd Ryan: Well, as we've been talking about for a year or two now, we have a lot of things going very well in our business. And maybe it will be going better if at some point in the future, transportation transactions went down. We don't know what the future is going to bring. We're just running the business, looking at what's going on in the market and going hey, there's some uncertainty out there. So we'll see what happens. As you've seen in the past, transportation transactions have gone down and still performed very well. We do that because we sell a lot of software outside of that 60% of our recurring revenues outside of transaction-based volume. And even in the transaction space, we tend to be picking up more volume over the course of a quarter or a year because our customers are doing more business with us and as a result we end up doing pretty well even in the face of the industry having a lackluster time. So we'll see what happens. I don't know what's going to happen in the rest of the year. We've heard different things, the same stuff you probably read in the paper. We'll see what happens, but we like our chances either way.\nMatt Pfau: Great. And just wanted to follow up on MacroPoint. You called out that that's been an area of strength and performing well in a trucking environment that was oversupplied. How does trucking capacity coming out of the system potentially impact that? Is that anything material to think about?\nEd Ryan: That's interesting. That's actually one of the areas I think about when I made the comment a minute ago. MacroPoint continues to grow in a relatively flat truck environment, because it continues to pick up more and more customers and more volume from our competitors. I went over that in some of the prepared comments on the call today. But MacroPoint's a big beneficiary of that as people realize the importance of having a network and they value that over a flashy application, because we can track more loads, more and more customers are settling with Descartes because they're saying, hey, that's what's most important. My ability to put in 100 loads and be able to track high 80s, low 90s percentage of those loads is much more important than the visibility application I'm using myself. Most of the time, they're not even using an application to look at these things.\nMatt Pfau: Great. Thanks guys for taking my questions. I appreciate it.\nEd Ryan: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Treiber from RBC. Your line is now open.\nPaul Treiber: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Just a question on the earn-outs. I don’t recall in the past you having this degree of earn-outs. What's changed now over the last several acquisitions that are leading to these earn-outs versus acquisitions in the past?\nEd Ryan: Yes, it’s an interesting question and you're right that several deals we've done in the past couple of years have done that. I think there was a -- you probably heard me talk about it on past calls, a rebalancing going on where everything was selling for high dollar volumes as everyone was booming coming out of the pandemic. When that started to slow down, companies were finding it hard to get people to pay up for acquisitions. An earn-out is one way to bridge that gap. We've used it effectively a few of the times. It's not really our first choice. We’d probably just pay cash for something and own the asset outright. But when there's a dispute about what the fair price is for something, we've used them to get over that hurdle and quite effectively, most of the time or in fact every time, we have an earn-out in a process. We're very happy for that acquisition to get the earn-out because that usually means we bought a business that’s doing very well and probably going to do very well for us in the future. So we've used this. It’s probably not our first choice, but certainly something we've done when we think it's appropriate.\nPaul Treiber: And then shifting to one of your more recent acquisitions, GroundCloud, you mentioned the integration go well and some margin expansion. How do we think about the long-term margin profile at that business? Do you think you can get it up to the company average margin profile?\nEd Ryan: We'll see. Our hope is to -- we bought it much, much lower than that. And our hope is to get it up as close as we can to that. I don't know if we have our sights set on the company average margin profile right now. But certainly, we'd like to get it up 10, 12 points, which will get it close.\nPaul Treiber: That will be great to see. Just a last question just on the M&A environment in general. Your comments about the macro environment expressed a lot of caution. Are you seeing that caution still in the M&A environment in regards to the valuation?\nEd Ryan: I think we're starting to see it in pricing [ph] in some of the deals we've been doing now. We're getting more deals done now than we were six, eight months ago. So I think it's starting to settle itself out right now. And we will see what happens in the economy. If the economy gets worse, it's probably going to get easier for us to get stuff done. If it gets better, people might start saying I want more money for the companies I’m selling. So we'll have to see what happens. But we like what we see right now and have been able to get what we think are very high quality acquisitions done at a price we think we can make money for our shareholders.\nPaul Treiber: Thanks for taking the questions.\nEd Ryan: Thank you, Paul.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is now open.\nJustin Long: Thanks. And I guess to start building on that last question, it sounds like valuations on acquisitions have started to come down and you've talked about that the last couple of quarters or so. In terms of just deal activity, have you seen things pick up and maybe could you talk about your confidence in deploying capital in the back half of the year? I know there weren't any acquisitions in this most recent quarter.\nEd Ryan: Yes, I think that's right. I think we're starting to see prices come into what we think is a reasonable range. That's why we're able to get acquisitions done. And I think we're starting to see more stuff for sale. Again, if there was kind of a lag there for six months or so when no one knew what to do, I think it’s starting to open up now. We're starting to see the type of quality assets that we wanted at prices that we think are fair prices for them. And let’s see what happens. But hopefully that translates to the ability to get more deals done in the future.\nJustin Long: Got it. And I know organic growth in the services business is what's most important. But Allan, could you share your estimate for all-in organic growth in the quarter? And maybe just going forward, Ed, how do you feel about the sustainability of the organic growth we've seen in that services business? It's held up really well despite a weak freight market. So just wanted to get a sense for your confidence in that continuing?\nAllan Brett: Yes. So I'll take the first part of it. Overall growth was less than the -- just over 9% that we saw in services. We certainly saw a lower license quarter, as I mentioned earlier. We had larger licenses in Q2 last year. We’re back to the more basic sort of 1.4 million this quarter. Professional services and other revenue was also flattish, down slightly. So in around the 6% or so currency neutral for the entire business compared to just over 9% on services. Ed?\nEd Ryan: Yes. Thanks, Allan. With regard to sustainability, we'll see what happens in the long run. But in the quarters coming up here, we think we're in pretty good shape, right? We think we're running a strong business, some of the things I went over in the prepared remarks in the beginning of the call we think that puts us in a position to continue to have good organic growth in the business. I've probably mentioned this on past calls, but over the past seven or eight years, we've tended towards buying higher quality assets as we've been forced to pay a little more than we used to for stuff, we tended to pick higher quality assets with higher rates of growth. And that translated into us moving from the mid single digits before the pandemic to after the pandemic coming out in the high single digits. And we're going to do our best to stick in that range. And obviously, economy has some effect on that. But at the moment, we like what we see.\nJustin Long: Great. Thanks for the time and congrats on the quarter.\nEd Ryan: Thank you very much, Justin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nScott Group: Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Ed, I think last quarter you were talking about ocean volume starting to improve and customers telling you maybe a little bit more normal inventory replenishment trends coming. Are they now saying something different? I just want to understand sort of what you're saying on the macro and more broadly just your views around like peak season, if you have any?\nEd Ryan: Well, I don't know yet. I've heard rumors that it's going to be maybe a muted peak season. I also see stuff going on with the Panama Canal, which probably for us it probably doesn't matter very much. People tend to find other ways to move the cargo which results in other shipments on our network. So it ends up being fine for us. But for our customers, if that's what you're asking, I think disruptions like that tend to cause them some troubles. I don't have a crystal ball on what's going to happen in Christmas season. I’ll probably tell you -- I'll know for sure at the end of next quarter. But the rumors I've heard is it might be a little muted, but I don't think it's something that's significant and certainly not something that's probably going to impact our numbers as much as maybe it might impact some of the ocean carriers numbers a bit. But I don't hear anything horrific going on. I don't hear anything spectacular going on either. So it looks the same.\nScott Group: Okay. And then you spend some time talking about the parcel carriers and volume shifts with UPS and FedEx and the post office. Does that matter to you? Are you agnostic to where the volume goes? I just want to understand the volumes.\nEd Ryan: Yes. We were trying to describe what was going on in the market for us. You're right. We're probably a little more agnostic to it. We do business with all of them. We like all of them, have good relationships with all of them. We're not trying to help pick winners in this. We just help service each of them. And there are times when some do better than others. There are sometimes when some move more freight to us than others. But in general, it works out, tends to balance out across all the larger carriers you mentioned.\nScott Group: Okay. And then just lastly, when I think about the step up in organic growth now versus pre-COVID, how much is price helping now? Even if it's not like real price, just nominal price to just keep pace with more inflation. Is that a meaningful contributor now to organic that maybe you didn't have in the past?\nEd Ryan: I'll let Allan comment a little bit on this, but I wouldn't call it meaningful, but it's there. Certainly we raised prices last year because of the high inflation. But Allan can comment on it.\nAllan Brett: Yes. We're raising prices across the business, across our product lines. Despite that, the overwhelming majority of our growth is still going to be volume related. That's going to be consistent. So we're using price to offset the cost pressures we have. We should be doing that as a business. But for the most part, our growth is going to be heavily focused on volume doing more with new and existing customers.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nEd Ryan: Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Young from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.\nRobert Young: Hi. Just wanted to add to the very first question around transaction revenue not being as simple as just tied to shipping volumes. I think there's some transaction minimums on some of the contracts. Just maybe you can refresh that and how much protection that provides on weaker volumes?\nEd Ryan: Most of our contracts in the transaction space are done at a minimum of 85% to 90% of the normal volume that a customer has. That plays a role from time to time with individual customers. I think more importantly, we watch the transportation volumes. Our business continues to grow. And in tougher economic times we tend to have more companies hit our direction because they tend to shy away from the smaller guys when they get worried about people in this space struggling. So we’ve tended to pick up more volume then. When customers start hurting, they start asking everyone for discounts because we provide 10 or 15 different services to them. We have a lot to negotiate with and the potential to pick up more business from our smaller competitors that are not in a stronger position as us. So as it happened in '08 and in the pandemic and a couple other times when we've had weaker economic times, and again I don't know that that's what we're looking at right now, we're probably looking at more of a muddled economic scenario right now. But in weaker economic times, we've tended to pick up volume in the face of our customers having less volume, and we come out of that stronger than ever and we tend to not have the same lows that maybe some of our competitors would have in transaction volumes, which is why when these things happen, you look at our numbers and say, why didn't they go down? And it's that plus the combination of other strengths in the subscription part of our business that continued to do well to this day.\nRobert Young: All right. And then second one for me, you're talking about the impact of union agreements and a lot of change there. Does that have an impact on your customers’ willingness to invest in technology to improve the visibility or having the price of the delivery itself goes up, then you would assume that technology becomes a better way to seek efficiency? Is that something you’re seeing or does it just pressure volumes?\nEd Ryan: In the short term, it can pressure volumes. It can do things to our customers probably a lot more than it would to us. In the longer term, though, you're absolutely right. You've heard us say a number of times change in our business or in our customers’ business drives more success for Descartes and I think that's absolutely true in situations like this. The more of the supply chain disruptions and strikes, of course, are certainly one of them. The more you have people saying I need more information and I need more technology, so that I can do something about that next time it happens. And that plays right into our hand. We saw it in spades in the pandemic. It's probably 10 other scenarios I could walk you through in the past where that's really helped us, the tariffs, with Trump, and et cetera, things like that. And we're not looking forward to those changes, but when they occur, they tend to be a tailwind for us.\nRobert Young: All right. Thanks for the question.\nEd Ryan: Thank you, Robert.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJeremy Campbell: Great. Thank you. This is Jeremy on for Raimo. I was just wondering if you could give a bit more color on how the trade intelligence segment performed in the quarter, and then just broadly your outlook there in terms of both organic investment and M&A around that business line. Thank you.\nEd Ryan: Thanks, Jeremy. Trade intelligence has been doing very well for several years now. Starting with the tariffs stuff when Trump became President, the nationalistic tendencies you saw around the world that caused maybe people to pay more attention to it. Ukraine-Russian war has also added to it as we see sanctions getting put on a number of parties and a big part of our databases there are sanctioned and right through to today. This business has been doing very well. And I think you asked if we continue to be bullish about it? We absolutely do. It’s one of our best performing businesses. It’s one of our most profitable businesses. It's one of the businesses where we think we help the customers the most in a very simple way. And, of course, if there were acquisition opportunities there, we would be excited about that because we love the business.\nJeremy Campbell: Got it. Thank you.\nEd Ryan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Krishnaratne from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Hi there. Good evening. You talked about some of the strength and the success you're seeing in visibility. You talked about winning new customers, but also bringing guys back in. I'm curious if you can remind us why customers might leave, while they're coming back. You mentioned some new products like self service tools. Just curious to know your thoughts there.\nEd Ryan: Yes. So over the past seven or eight years since we bought MacroPoint, there were a number of other players in that space that were spending a ton of money advertising, getting their name out there and launching themselves towards the moon, losing a ton of money while they're doing it without what seemed to us like without a whole lot of regard to that. I think over time, that helped them pick up some customers, right? You make enough noise and you spend enough money, you probably pick up some customers, but in the long run those customers start looking and saying, hey, who's the best provider here? And maybe it's not the guy with the name in the newspaper, maybe it's the guy that can track the most loads for me. And over time, I think we've been -- as a network operator, you expect us to focus on this. Those guys focused on things like I just mentioned. We focused on getting more connections on the network. And as a result, we track more loads by a lot than our competitors do. And I think over time, the customers realize that's what's most important. And that's helped us get some competitive wins in that space.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Okay, got it. Thanks for that. Second question is e-commerce, a growing market. You made a bunch of acquisitions during the pandemic. Can you remind us how you guys think about that business in terms of the size, percentage of revenue, and maybe if you can give us some thoughts on the growth profile there? E-commerce industry wide seems to be trending back up after normalizing a year ago. Can you just comment on the e-commerce business?\nEd Ryan: Yes. We're big fans of the e-commerce business. We got in it seven, eight years ago, nine years ago now and continue to buy any asset in that space that we think would be a good fit for what we already do and with an ability to help us grow our network. It's about 10% of our business today. It's one of our faster growing businesses. And yes, we absolutely continue to like that business and think that as more and more people order stuff online, that business is going to continue to do well for us for the foreseeable future.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Got it. Just last one for me, Localz sounds it's doing well. I know that was more of an APAC focused business. Are you starting to sell that product into other dealers and customers?\nEd Ryan: We've always provided that service through third parties. And when we had a chance to buy Localz, we thought that was a great opportunity for us to be able to do that ourselves without paying a third party to do it. So that's what we did. And we're bringing it to all the jurisdictions that we operate in right now. It's a simple service, right? You order something and you want to see the truck driving to your house and you can go on an app and you can see where the driver is. That having been said, to someone who's trying to deliver furniture or something of that nature, it's very important that you're there when they come to make the delivery. And a mobile functionality like that really helps make sure that customers know when the truck’s coming so that they're there to get the furniture or whatever it is that they ordered from you. So we want to make sure we're able to bring that experience to all of our customers. And now we're doing it in a way where we own the entire solution. So we're happy about that.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Got it. I appreciate the color. Thanks.\nEd Ryan: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.\nEd Ryan: Great. Thanks, everyone. I appreciate your time today and we look forward to reporting back to you next quarter. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

We had a very strong first quarter to start the year with record financial results. We're excited to go over those with you and give you some perspective about the business environment we see right now. But first, let me give you a road map for the call. I'll start with highlighting some aspects of how our business performed in the last quarter. I'll then hand it over to Allan who will go over the Q1 financial results in more detail. I'll then come back and provide an update on how we see the current business environment and how our business is calibrated. And we'll then open it up to the operator to coordinate the Q&A portion of the call. So let's get started by looking at the quarter. Key metrics we monitor include revenues, profits, cash flow from operations and return on our investments. For this past quarter, we had record performance in each of those areas. Total revenues were up 17% from a year ago with services revenues up 21%. Net income and earnings per share were up 27% and 26%, respectively. Income from operations was up 19%, while adjusted EBITDA was up 13% with a slight FX headwind. And we generated almost $49 million in cash from operations, representing 85% of adjusted EBITDA. At the end of the quarter, we had $182 million in cash and were debt-free with an undrawn $350 million line of credit. We remain well capitalized, cash generating, debt free and ready to continue to invest in our business. We believe a company like ours is well positioned to continue to thrive in market conditions like these. As I've said in the past, our investment strategy is heavily influenced by what our customers are looking for from us. An excellent example of that is our recently announced acquisition of Localz where we continue to deploy capital for leading technology and services for our customers. Localz is headquartered in Australia and specializes in helping customers with final mile deliveries. Specifically, they provide an Uber-like tracking experience to the end recipient of a delivery, allowing them to be able to see the real-time progress of the delivery over the final miles. Localz also provides customer self-scheduling deliveries and a click-and-collect solution to help with fulfillment of online purchases. Localz' customer base is mostly in Asia Pacific and Europe. Our focus is to integrate Localz' leading technology stack into our routing and scheduling solutions and make it available through our distribution channels on a worldwide basis. We've already been active in welcoming the Localz team in and had them interacting with our Australian partners and customers. So we're off to a great start. Welcome to the entire Localz team. Localz complements our continued investment in final mile deliveries this calendar year. Our February investment in GroundCloud had a partial quarter of contribution to our results and added a robust solution to help independent final mile delivery companies manage their operations with particular specialization for service providers who are performing the bulk of their deliveries for large transportation brands such as FedEx and Amazon. What really distinguishes GroundCloud is its specialization and attention to driver safety by delivering easily digestible driver training video content to drivers' mobile devices. Our customers' focus on ESG issues and risk minimization which include workplace and driver safety, are a good demand driver here. Our focus is on integration of the safety technology with our broader routing and scheduling solutions and anticipate that the go-forward revenue mix will -- with growth will trend more towards Descartes' revenue mix over time where nearly 90% of our business comes from higher-margin recurring revenues. While our acquisition engine continues to deliver, our organic operations were the principal contributor to a very successful quarter of growth. I just wanted to highlight a few areas that performed well. The first is real-time visibility. This is an area that we've talked about in the past quarters and continues to be strong. A large part of the logistics market is people moving shipments on other people's assets, whether they be planes, trucks, rails or ships. There also may be many intermediaries involved, including freight brokers, third-party logistics providers and customs brokers. With all those assets, modes of transportation and parties involved, answering the question of where is my shipment is not an easy one. It's also an important question as people have realized over the past few years how vulnerable their businesses are to a dysfunctional supply chain. Our MacroPoint solutions have continued to be market leaders in this space and see strong growth, especially with our integration to our Global Logistics Network which enables us to easily cross sell MacroPoint embedded directly into a number of Descartes solutions. The second is final mile delivery solutions. The same factors that have driven our recent acquisition investments in final mile delivery and the desire for shipment visibility have also driven growth in our organic route optimization operations. Regardless of whether you have your own fleet of delivery vehicles or are contracting out, the recipients' delivery experience is now part and parcel of the product sale. We continue to see strong demand from our customers for technology that enhances the customers' experience, whether it be in the scheduling or delivery process. Third area is e-commerce. We've certainly seen headlines about how e-commerce is not growing as fast as it did during the pandemic. However, those headlines often miss the key: it's still growing. E-commerce continues to be an increasingly more prevalent way of purchasing and e-commerce deliveries flow as a consequence. We've made historic investments to help our customers with this trend and we continue to see strong volumes in the quarter that contributed to our organic growth. And finally, we have Global Trade Intelligence. This was another strong quarter for our Global Trade Intelligence pillar with some key drivers. You may have seen an increased presence of our data being used by leading publications like The Wall Street Journal to do market analysis, showing the value that customers get from our data mine solutions. We're also continuing to see strong demand for sanctioned party screening as a consequence of continued geopolitical tensions, including from the war in Ukraine and U.S.-China tensions, so a good contributor to growth in the quarter as well. So let me just summarize as I hand it over to Allan to give you the full financial details in the quarter. We had record financial results. The business performed well and we believe that's a good reflection of the value that our customers continue to get from our solutions and the hard work that our team continues to put in for our customers. We ended the quarter with $182 million in cash, $350 million in available credit and a market opportunity where we can continue to grow the business for our customers, both organically and through acquisition. We remain focused on profitable growth so that we can continue to ensure that our customers have a secure, stable and growing technology partner that can help them with their challenges well into the future. My thanks to all Descartes team members for everything they've done to contribute to a great quarter and continuing to have our business in an enviable position for future success. I'll now turn the call over to Allan to go through our Q1 financial results in more detail. Allan?\nAllan Brett: Thanks, Ed. As indicated, I'm going to walk you through our financial highlights for our first quarter which ended on April 30. We are pleased to report record quarterly revenues of $136.6 million this quarter, an increase of just over 17% from revenues of $116.4 million in Q1 last year. While revenue from our acquisitions in the past 12 months, in particular, GroundCloud and XPS, contributed to this growth, growth in revenue from new and existing customers was again the main driver in growth this quarter when compared to last year. Consistent with past quarters, our revenue mix in the quarter continued to be very strong, with services revenue increasing 21% to $124.1 million or 91% of total revenue compared to $102.8 million or 88% of revenue in the same quarter last year. Services revenue was also up nicely sequentially, increasing over 9% from $113.4 million that we recorded in Q4 last year. License revenues came in lower at only $1.0 million or 1% of revenue in the first quarter, down from license revenues of $2.3 million in the first quarter last year. While professional services and other revenue came in at $11.5 million or 8% of revenue, up 2% from $11.3 million in the same period last year. In addition, we should mention that there was also a decrease in revenue from FX this quarter. As consistent with the past few quarters, the U.S. dollar continued to be stronger compared to the euro, the Canadian dollar and the British pound compared to the same period last year. This resulted in an over $2 million negative impact on revenue in Q1 when compared to Q1 last year but only had a very small impact on our profitability as we continue to be fairly naturally hedged to the various currency movements. Removing the impact of the recent acquisition as well as the negative impacts from FX that we just mentioned, on a like-for-like basis, we would estimate that our growth in services revenue from new and existing customers would have been just over 9% in the quarter when compared to the same quarter last year, pretty similar to the results we experienced in Q4. Gross margin in the first quarter came in at 76% of revenue in the first quarter this year, consistent with gross margin realized in the first quarter last year, as the operating improvements that we continue to see in the business were offset by lower gross margins realized in the recently acquired GroundCloud business. Our operating expenses increased in the first quarter. This was primarily related to the impact of the acquisition of GroundCloud but also from additional labor-related costs, primarily in sales, marketing and the R&D areas as we experienced the higher run rate costs from the staffing investments we made throughout the past 12 months. As a result of the higher revenues, offset by the increase in sales, marketing and R&D costs, we continue to see our adjusted EBITDA growth of 13% to a record $57.7 million or 42.2% of revenue in the quarter, up from $51.2 million or 44.0% of revenue in the first quarter last year. As we had indicated at the end of Q4, the addition of the GroundCloud business, while profitable, came to us with much lower adjusted EBITDA margins out of the gate than the rest of our business. The lower margins in that acquired business, as well, to a lesser extent, lower license revenue recognized in the quarter, had a negative impact on our adjusted EBITDA ratio in the first quarter, very much as we expected. From a GAAP earnings perspective, net income came in at $29.4 million, up 27% from net income of $23.1 million in the first quarter last year. With these strong operating results, cash flow generated from operations came in at $48.9 million or approximately 85% of adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter, up 10% from operating cash flow $44.4 million or 87% of adjusted EBITDA in Q1 last year. Note that Q1 is typically a seasonally lower cash flow quarter mainly due to the timing of several tax and bonus payments that typically occur in the first quarter each year. Once again, we are pleased with the strong cash collections we realized during the quarter. So as Ed mentioned earlier, we are very pleased with these operating results in the first quarter as continued organic growth and a solid contribution from our recent acquisitions 17% growth in revenue and, more importantly, 13% growth in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. If we turn our attention to the balance sheet, our cash balances totaled $182 million at the end of April, down from cash balances of $276 million at the end of January as we used our positive cash flow from operations to complete both the GroundCloud and Localz acquisition. As a result, we still have over $180 million of cash as well as a $350 million undrawn credit facility available for future acquisitions. So we continue to be well capitalized to allow us to consider all acquisition opportunities in our market, consistent with our business plan. As we look towards the balance of fiscal 2024, we should note the following. After spending approximately $1.2 million on capital additions in the first quarter, we expect to incur approximately $4 million to $5 million in additional capital expenditures for the balance of this year. After incurring amortization costs of $14.7 million in Q1, we expect amortization expense will be approximately $45 million for the rest or the balance of this year, with this figure being subject to adjustment for foreign exchange changes and future acquisitions. Our income tax rate in Q1 came in at 22.3% of pretax income, slightly lower than our blended statutory tax rate and this was mainly a result of a few smaller tax benefits and recoveries realized in the first quarter. Looking into the balance of the year, we currently expect that our tax rate will trend much closer to our expected range of 25% to 30% of pretax income in the next few quarters, meaning that our tax rate for the year is likely to end up in the range of between 23% and 27% of pretax income. However, as always, we should add that our tax rate may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter from onetime items that may arise as we operate internationally across multiple countries. Also, after incurring stock-based compensation expense of $2.9 million in the first quarter, we currently expect stock compensation to be approximately $13.6 million for the remainder of fiscal 2024, subject to any forfeitures of stock options or share units. And finally, going forward, subject to unusual events and quarterly fluctuations, we expect to continue to see continued strong cash flow conversion and generally expect cash flow from operations to be between 85% and 90% of our adjusted EBITDA in the quarters ahead. I will now turn it back over to Ed.\nEd Ryan: Thanks, Allan. With Q2 a month in, we remain confident in our business but cautious about the broader economic circumstances that are out there, this continued high interest rates, pervasive conflict in the Ukraine, various recessionary pressures and economic discussion that could impact the freight market. We've seen some companies taking action from impacts they've seen in their business. So for us, we continue to be cautious in the face of uncertainty. Supply chain and logistics continues to be a critical business function for our customers regardless of the economic circumstances. I wanted to share some areas that our customers are monitoring and that shape the market that we're currently operating in. First is U.S. ocean container imports are growing but at pre-pandemic levels. Based on public data available through our data mine service, ocean imports have grown month by month since February but are tracking more in line with pre-pandemic levels than the elevated 2021 and 2022 levels. We'll be monitoring growth over the coming months, with May numbers expected in the coming days. The second is that retailers have made good progress in shedding excess inventories. Over the past months, the market saw some decreased ordering from retailers as they dealt with excess inventories. Essentially, some retailers skipped a replenishment cycle which had an impact on freight demand. We've heard from customers they've had good success in recent months of moving that excess inventory with a potential return to more normalized replenishment cycles on the horizon. The third is freight prices have come down. The recent abnormal replenishment cycles had an impact on demand for freight which has impacted the spot markets for freight across the different modes of transportation. That's good news for shippers but less good for logistics carriers and intermediaries. Just because prices come down, it doesn't necessarily mean there's a corresponding impact on the number of shipments, just that there's tighter margins on many of these shipments. In terms of how that impacts Descartes' business, the number of shipments is a more important metric. We saw strong volumes through Q1 and we'll be continuing to monitor the shipment volumes over our Global Logistics Network. Fourth is port delays have decreased. During the pandemic, there were tremendous backlogs in ports, with ocean vessels moored waiting since ports couldn't handle the volume. However, ports have caught up and processed these volumes and are back moving goods at pre-pandemic levels. This is a key factor as parties consider lead times for orders. Fifth is China origin shipments have increased. China was still dealing with COVID shutdowns and resource availability challenges later than many parts of the world. This resulted in companies sourcing goods from other countries. However, in April, we saw sourcing from China pick up and we'll be monitoring whether this is a continued growth trend. The sixth is fuel costs are lower than a year ago. Diesel and other fuel costs are at lower levels than a year ago, so while Descartes -- so sorry, while carriers and intermediaries maybe seeing some challenges with revenues with freight prices decreasing, they're seeing some relief on the cost side as well. Seventh is some funding challenges for earlier-stage logistics companies. The technology community saw some recent shocks in the availability of capital to earlier-stage technology companies, including those in the logistics and supply chain space. Many of these companies may not have access to further rounds of funding and may be required to consider other strategic alternatives. We'll be monitoring this as we look at our own acquisition strategy. And finally, ESG focus impacts supply chain and logistics. ESG discussions in boardrooms are having a meaningful impact on supply chain and logistics decisions. Our customers are looking for detailed information from their trading partners so they can meet and report on their own ESG goals. We're seeing legislation and regulation in different countries, forcing companies to adopt solutions that will enable them to better monitor and report on their compliance with prohibitions on use of forced labor, environmental impact of their operations and trading with restricted parties. So those are some of the things we're hearing from our customers and seeing in our business, things that also inform our calibration for the quarter. Our business is designed to be predictable and consistent and believe the stability and reliability are valuable to our customers, employees and our broader stakeholders. To deliver this consistency, we continue to operate from the following principles. Our long-term plan is for our business to grow adjusted EBITDA 10% to 15% annually. We grow through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. We take a neutral party approach to building and operating solutions on our Global Logistics Network. We don't favor any particular party. We run our business for all supply chain participants, connecting shippers, carriers, logistics service providers and customs authorities. When we over perform, we try to reinvest that over performance back into our business. We focus on recurring revenues and establishing relationships with customers for life and we thrive on operating a predictable business that allows us forward visibility to our revenues and investment paybacks. In our Q1 report, we've provided a comprehensive description of baseline revenues, baseline calibration and their limitations. As of May 1, 2023, using foreign exchange rates of $0.74 to the Canadian dollar, USD 1.10 to the euro and USD 1.26 to the Great Britain pound, we estimate that our baseline revenues for the second quarter of 2024 are approximately $120.5 million and our baseline operating expenses are approximately $76 million. We consider this to be our baseline adjusted EBITDA calibration of approximately $44.5 million for the second quarter of 2024 or approximately 37% of our baseline revenues as at May 1, 2023. We continue to expect that we'll operate in an adjusted EBITDA operating margin range of 40% to 45%. Our margin can vary in that range given such things as foreign exchange movements and the impact of acquisitions as we integrate them into our business. Last quarter, we flagged that GroundCloud would impact our margin while we completed the integration activities and brought it up to our desired Descartes contribution level. We believe we've made good progress on the integration activities and are not planning for a further impact to our operating margin from where we were at in Q1. We got lots of exciting things planned for our business. It remains an uncertain broader economic environment but we believe our proven track record of execution, solid capital structure and customer focus will serve us well. I want to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. As always, we're available to talk to you about our business in whatever manner is most convenient for you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow from Barclays.\nRaimo Lenschow: Congrats on another solid quarter. Ed, just if you think about the cycle that we're kind of living in at the moment, how do you see this continue to play out in terms of like how transportation volumes are continuing to go through -- come through? Like, are we kind of through the worst? That's kind of what it feels like but I kind of wanted to see your view on that one. And I had one quick follow-up.\nEd Ryan: It's tough to tell. Depends on the mode of transportation you're talking about. I mean ocean probably had a weaker point a few months ago. We see it strengthening in the last couple of months. I think truck also had some weaker points over the last couple of months. We didn't see that in our network as much because it was growing considerably, specifically with MacroPoint kind of growing its way out of any volume issues our customers were having. And on the air side, it's continued to perform pretty strong and it looks pretty good to us today. I don't know what the future brings exactly. I mean it's a mixed news economy at the moment, as I read the paper. But most of our customers seem to be in pretty good shape. I don't hear any of them sounding fire bells or anything like that. And certainly, the volumes on our network continue to be strong, so we're happy about that.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yes. Okay, perfect. And then what are you seeing in the field in terms of -- you always were very good in finding good assets and finding them at good prices. Like, where do you see the private market in terms of their understanding of new asset values and valuation levels? Where are we on that journey?\nEd Ryan: Yes. Thank you. It's certainly coming around right now. We're starting to see, I think, the early signs of change in that market. There's still a decent amount of stuff for sale. You can see we got the Localz deal done. That was probably something that we might have struggled to do a year ago because we wouldn't have been able to agree on price and we were able to do it in the last few months based on the conditions that the company -- smaller technology companies are facing. I think on the smaller end, where we tend to play, we're seeing more stuff that's impacted more quickly by economic uncertainty out there and an unwillingness for people to put money into the market. So if they're losing money or not making much money and the people that historically have invested and maybe perhaps over invested in those areas in the last 4 or 5 years have kind of stopped doing that, all of a sudden were a very attractive choice to people. Our company continues to perform well and we have a good track record of integrating acquisitions in and making their businesses grow when they get here. So I think that's played well for us and you can see it in some of the acquisitions that we've done so far. And I think there may be more to come just based on what I'm seeing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair.\nMatt Pfau: First, I wanted to follow up on one of the comments you made and I don't know what the exact wording was but it was something along the lines of some of your customers have taken actions based on macro impacts they've seen in their business. Has that had any impact to Descartes?\nEd Ryan: No, I think we have been in a very fortunate situation where I think while customers, particularly big retailers and manufacturers are probably the first place we saw this in the last 6 months where they were worried about what the economy looked like and they were probably telling us they were kind of putting their foot on the brake and maybe holding back on some investments, they continue to green light their logistics and supply chain investments. So we would hear about them at some of our larger customers but they were continuing on with their projects because they felt the supply chain and logistics area was an area of focus for them and something they should continue to invest money, even though they were proceeding cautiously in other areas of their business.\nMatt Pfau: Got it. And just to follow up with your comments in terms of the acquisition environment and funding pressures that some private companies are seeing. Have you seen that have an impact in terms of some of your customers perhaps becoming less willing to do business with VC-backed companies over fear of what the longevity is there?\nEd Ryan: Yes, I think there's some of that going on right now. There's a lot of talk of that in the logistics trade publications and the risk that you might be in doing that. It's not just a risk of whether it will be there or not. It's a risk of is it going to get sold to somebody else who was going to change the direction soon and do I want to sign up for -- to make a decent-sized investment with someone who might have that happen to them. And the management team that I'm talking to today can't make promises that they can keep for a long time. And I think that's benefited us. We certainly see some of it going on. I think we'll continue to see that happen. And honestly, I think our customers are smart to think that way. I think that is an actual concern. And if you do business with someone that's probably a lot more likely to be around for the long run, you're probably making a smarter decision.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Paul Treiber from RBC Capital Markets.\nPaul Treiber: I was just hoping, could you elaborate on one of your earlier points about MacroPoint and that has been growing even though that the truck market in general has been weak. Does that reflect MacroPoint growing share of wallet or penetration within customers? Or are you seeing continued new customer wins?\nEd Ryan: Both. I mean MacroPoint has done an excellent job of growing and I think it's come with new customer wins they were taking away from their competitors. It's also come, over the last several years, with companies saying, \"I used to track some of the shipments. I now need to track them all.\" And that takes a while for companies to roll out. But I think a lot of companies are starting to say, \"I'm not going to be selective about what shipments I'm going to track anymore. I'm going to track all of them.\" And it's just going to be table stakes in their business. And that certainly benefited MacroPoint as they have a large chunk of the industry that's made that decision.\nPaul Treiber: That's insightful. The other question, just more broadly speaking, despite the freight market perhaps going through a slower period here, your organic growth has been very resilient, much higher than you've averaged in the past. Do you think you're seeing structurally and sustainably higher organic growth than in the past? And then if so, why not take up your long-term 10% to 15% growth outlook which does include organic growth plus acquisitions?\nEd Ryan: We're a \"slow and steady wins the race\" kind of company. I think we proceed cautiously all the time. If we over perform, that's great news. But I don't know that we see what's going to happen out 5, 10 years. And so we think, hey, this is the rate that we think this market may grow at. Maybe we're doing a little better than that right now. But we're going to continue to run our company like that. So if something bad happened in the future, we're not dramatically impacted by it. We've seen a lot of people roll by us over the years, screaming from behind them, \"We're going to the moon and we'll see you later.\" And then in the next couple of years, they implode and we quietly come behind them and pick up all the pieces. And the reason those things happen is because they overinvest in sales and marketing as they start making promises they're going to grow faster than they can in the long run. And when something goes bad, they implode. Everyone gets fired. The customers get forgotten. And they probably get sold to somebody else. And that's a disaster that we don't want to be a part of.\nPaul Treiber: And just one last question. There's been a lot of enthusiasm in the market recently around AI. How do you see AI impacting the logistics market in your business? And to what degree have you been making investments in AI?\nEd Ryan: Yes. Thanks for asking that. A lot of -- it's impacted us for years. First of all, our routing business has a lot of AI in it before the words AI really became a common discussion point. If you take away our routing solutions work for the last 10 or 15 years, we've been making AI-like decisions for our customers and our guys have been thinking like that. So we continue to do more and more of that. And with all these IoT devices coming out, we get more and more information that we can help our customers make better and better decisions about how to move their freight around every day. And that's exciting times for us because we're now at the point where you're looking at our routing systems and going, \"How does it know that? Like, I don't understand.\" And it's all because we're collecting a lot of data points over a long period of time and are able to help our customers figure out things like, \"What's that intersection going to look like at 5:00,\" and \"Should I make a left turn or a right turn or completely avoid that intersection and tell them to do it at 3?\" And when you can combine millions of those things a day -- those decisions a day for a customer and make pretty damn accurate decisions every day, you help them route their trucks a lot more efficiently and save them a lot of money which is awesome. In our content and classification space, we are starting to look, over the last 6 to 8 months, at using AI to help our customers more quickly and accurately classify goods so that they can make better decisions about how to make their customs filings which potentially saves them a lot of money. More internally and you probably heard this at a lot of software companies, standard routines and standard pieces of code that you can use AI to pull up a chunk of code that you might have taken 3 days to write and now, all of a sudden, you're pulling up a chunk of code in 20 minutes, configuring it to your use case and saving yourself a whole lot of time in the development and engineering process. So we're seeing some of that right now. I think I'm going to see a lot more of that in the future. And then another obvious one that I think a lot of software companies are doing is better and better customer support and more cost-effective customer support, better interpreting the answers at the questions that customers are going to ask and being able to disperse those answers out to them quickly and often in a self-service model. This all started like 10 years ago. You saw all these customer experience applications that come out. Well, now it's table stakes and really starting to become the norm and we're using it in our tools. And I think you're going to see us use a lot more of it over the coming years to more quickly answer customers' questions and get them back to solve on the problems that they're actually trying to solve. So there's more but those are the big ones and I'm happy you asked because I think it's an important topic for the future.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens.\nJustin Long: I wanted to start with a question on organic growth. Allan, I think you mentioned in the services business, organic growth was a little bit over 9%. But could you share what all-in organic growth was in the quarter? And then maybe comment on what you're seeing from a transactional volume perspective on a year-over-year basis.\nAllan Brett: Yes, I'll start with the organic growth one and Ed may look at -- or talk to you about the volumes. So just over 9% in the services piece of our business which is the most important piece, the recurring part of our business. Licenses, I mentioned earlier, were down. We had a weaker license number. It's only $1 million, down from $2.3 million and a little bit of drop in some nonrecurring areas, including hardware. So 6.5%, 7% growth organically in total revenues because of those drops. So 9.5% from services leading to a 6.5%, 7% overall organic growth in the business. And from a volumes perspective, Ed?\nEd Ryan: I mean I commented on the volumes earlier but let me just comment on some stuff that Allan said. I mean we are a recurring revenue business. We are trying to get all our customers up and running as fast as possible on recurring revenue-type products. I am aware of the license component -- the small license component of our business, the small hardware component of our business and the small professional services and training component of our business. They are not our focus. If we could eliminate all 3 of those and get everyone over to fast installed recurring revenue products, that would be our ideal goal. So we spend most of our time looking at that services line. I'm aware that there's a little bit more to the business than that but certainly, we're really happy that our highest growth is coming from the area that we think is the most valuable.\nJustin Long: Understood. And I guess building on one of the earlier questions, when I think about the services business growing over 9% organically, in this economic backdrop in a freight market that's challenged and we're hearing about a lot of weakness in volumes from the transportation companies, if this type of growth is sustainable and the framework for organic growth is more in that high single-digit range, can you talk about the head count requirements to support that and maybe where sales and marketing head count is today versus pre-pandemic? I'm just curious if you've already ramped enough to support that growth or if we're going to need to see further investment there.\nEd Ryan: No, I don't think you're going to see us -- let's just say, I think you're going to see us continue to behave the way we have in the past. And for the past 6 or 8 months, I think I've described it to people as we took our foot off the gas and just kind of covered the brake with it in an attempt to be cautious and are still very happy with the growth rates that we're getting given that's the case. We're not the type of company that's going to go invest ahead, too far over our skis, in terms of sales and marketing. We want to have people in place to answer our customers' questions and help them make buying decisions when they're there but I don't think you're going to see us start to make material additions to sales and marketing beyond what we've done in the past which I think is, by all accounts, cautious. And I think you're going to see us continue to behave that way.\nJustin Long: Understood. Congrats on the quarter.\nEd Ryan: Thank you very much, Justin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Chan from TD Cowen.\nDaniel Chan: Ed, you were talking about an expectation for the replenishment cycle to normalize. Just wondering if that is translating into the investments that your customers are making. In other words, are they investing ahead of what may be higher anticipated volumes?\nEd Ryan: Maybe but my first guess is they're probably thinking a little more long term than that. They went through the pandemic. They had their customers realize that supply chain and logistics is a lot more important than they thought it was. They saw that translate into their business and a need to be able to tell their customers what's going on in the supply chain and logistics world a lot better than they did 5 years ago and they're making investments to do that right now. I don't think they're -- at least as we talk to them, I don't think they're sitting there thinking about, \"How do I make this investment to be better off in the next 6 months.\" I think they're probably more like, \"How do I make this investment to be better off in the next 5 to 10 years.\" And I'd say that's probably more the way we hear them talking about it. Now will it benefit them in the next 6 months? Probably. Guy who made the investment last year is probably going to get some benefit out of it this year. Guy who's making it right now is probably going to get some benefit out of it coming into Christmas season this fall. But if I listen to what their thinking was or logic was coming into it, it was probably a longer-term one than just this resupply period.\nDaniel Chan: That's helpful. And then maybe a follow-on question on these VC-backed competitors of yours. Shopify made a big splash by divesting its logistics business to Flexport. And Flexport seems to have some similar solutions to you. Are they a competitor that you see often? And does them taking on the Shopify assets change the competitive landscape at all?\nEd Ryan: No, no. Flexport is a big customer of ours and a good customer of ours and we don't compete with them in any way. And nothing about what Shopify did does anything but help us. I mean we were partner with Shopify before this. We're a bigger partner of Flexport now. And we don't compete with them nor do we have any intention of competing with them at any point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Robert Young from Canaccord Genuity.\nRobert Young: Maybe a quick clarification on a previous question around the replenishment cycle. You said that retailers skipped a replenishment cycle. It didn't seem to impact your numbers at all and so I'm just curious why that would be. Is there something to understand there?\nEd Ryan: I think my first kind of look at that would be we continued to grow through a cycle that wasn't that bad across all the modes of transport that we operate in. Things were down, for sure. Transportation volumes were down and prices were down significantly for our customers from '21 and '22 to today or, let's say, the last 6 months. But the volumes weren't down that much and we were growing through that. So we've kind of -- we're growing while volumes are tempering a little bit and that probably kind of masks it from our perspective. Maybe not from our customers' perspective, they probably suffered a little more because they have prices coming down somewhat dramatically and then volume's coming down a little bit from pre-pandemic or from pandemic times. I think that's fine because, during those times, our customers were making tons and tons of money and we certainly did well in the pandemic. But once they're shipped for full, we could process no more transactions for them. Their prices shot up at that point. Our revenue kind of just stayed along with the high transaction volumes that they were living with. So on the way out of that, I think we probably benefited from that, right? As their backlogs got less and less, their prices went down. We weren't really impacted by that. When they went down below full, they didn't go down below full that much. And as a result, our growth in our business probably made up for it and put us in a position where our numbers look good all the way through.\nRobert Young: Okay. And then maybe just a question around the comment you made about pushing as much as possible into a recurring revenue and towards subscription. I think you start off the answer to that talking about volumes but I think maybe you're talking about license and hardware. But was there an element to that answer you were talking about moving volumes, volume-related revenue, more into a subscription product? And then, I'll pass the line.\nEd Ryan: No. No, I mean we love our subscription business and we love our transaction business. We actually think our -- in a very odd way for a software company, we're one of the few that you might hear say this, we think our transaction business might even be stronger than our subscription business in a lot of ways. They're all recurring revenue to us. What I was referring to earlier in the call was license fees, pro services, hardware sales that -- we recognize that's a small part of our business. We think our subscription and transactional recurring revenue businesses are the heart of our business and the core to our business and the thing that makes us a great business and differentiates us from a lot of other companies out there. And so when I -- I think my comment was when I hear that the growth is highest in that services business or the recurring revenue business, that's exactly what we're looking for. That's great news for our business and great news for our shareholders.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Li from Raymond James.\nSteven Li: Ed, on GroundCloud and the margin impact, it sounds like Q1 would mark the low point. So based on what you've seen so far from GroundCloud, do the margins stay there for a couple more quarters as you digest? Or can we quickly get back to that 43%, 44% range?\nEd Ryan: Yes. No, we think we're going to -- first of all, we're thrilled with the GroundCloud investment. We think, in the long run, there's a lot of tailwinds behind it. And we also think it's a business that historically operated at a much lower margin than Descartes did and there's a lot of opportunity for us there. We're going to push that and continue to try and get it much closer to our margin levels but I'm not trying to do that so fast that we cause any problems. A couple of quarters is fine and you'll start to see us continue to move those numbers up over that time. I don't know, Allan, if you have anything else to say about it but...\nAllan Brett: No, just it's similar to other acquisitions where we've done, Steven. Where the margins start out low, we will work hard to improve those margins. We'll improve them to whatever level we can get them to. And that depends on product line, what the ultimate high point is but that's what we'll do over time. And I would expect it to go steady, slow and steady with that. We'll improve it much like we did with MacroPoint.\nEd Ryan: I mean, listen, Steven, we're in this for the long run. And I'd much rather do it right than do it fast. We're trying to make sure we make this a great business for the long run. Like a lot of the other businesses we operate in, we're proceeding cautiously to make sure that we get the margins up. But we're not going to rush through it in any way that harms the business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Krishnaratne from Scotiabank.\nKevin Krishnaratne: Just on the shipping strength that you saw in Q1, I think you're now above 2019 levels. Can you talk about -- did you see those same drivers continue on into May? And then what are your thoughts on volumes? I know it's a tough one to answer here but thoughts maybe on how you're thinking about your guidance for the year in terms of are you anticipating potential for volumes to be above levels that you saw in 2019 in the industry?\nEd Ryan: Yes. Thanks for the question. We have -- you'll hear about the May numbers when we release next quarter, so I can't speak to that specifically. I can tell you what customers are telling us and I can tell you some of the trade statistics we're hearing; and certainly, maybe April will give you some indication. We saw February was kind of a low point and it's trending up in March and April. And we'll see what happens in May. You can probably take a look at some of the trade statistics that we put out in a week or two. It will give you some indication of that. But if I could use May as an example -- or sorry, April as an example, I'm optimistic about what we see in May. And we'll see what happens to the rest of the year. I mean I read the newspapers like you do. It's hard for me to figure out exactly what's going to happen with the economy right now. It doesn't seem like it's terrible but it doesn't seem like it's great. I'm glad that U.S. got a debt deal done or almost done and we'll see what happens here. But either way, just the way we run our business, I like our chances. We think we're in a very good position and certainly better than a lot of the other companies in our space that we compete against.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand over to Ed Ryan. Please continue.\nEd Ryan: Hey, thanks, everyone. I appreciate your time on the call today and we look forward to reporting back on next quarter in a few months. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
