        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the AstroNova Fiscal Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to David Calusdian of the company's Investor Relations firm, Sharon Merrill Advisors. Please go ahead, sir.\nDavid Calusdian: Thank you, Carla, and good morning, everyone. By now you should have received a copy of the earnings release issued this morning. If you've not received a copy, please go to the Investors page of the AstroNova website, www.astronovainc.com. Please note that beginning this quarter we will be using an earnings slide deck that follows along with our prepared remarks. You may access the deck on the Investors section of our website at astronovainc.com. under events and presentations. Turning to slide two in that deck. Statements made on today's call, that are not statements of historical fact are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions that could involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially, except as required by law. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of today, March 22, 2024. AstroNova undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. For other information regarding the forward-looking statements and the factors that may cause differences, please see the risk factors in AstroNova’s annual report on Form 10-K and other filings that the company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On today's call, management will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. AstroNova believes that the inclusion of these financial measures helps investors gain a meaningful understanding of the changes in the company's core operating results and also helps investors, who wish to make comparisons between AstroNova and other companies on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in today's earnings release. Turning to slide three, joining me on this call this morning are Greg Woods, AstroNova’s President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Smith, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Greg will discuss segment operating highlights and share the company's fiscal 2025 financial targets and outlook. David will take you through the financials at a high level. Greg will make some concluding comments and then management will be happy to take your questions. If you've not received a copy of this morning's earnings release, please go to the investors page of the AstroNova website at astronovainc.com. Now please turn to slide four as I turn the call over to Greg.\nGreg Woods: Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to begin by recognizing the excellent work of the AstroNova team. Every one of our more than 360 team members contributed to our solid performance in fiscal 2024. Their skills, dedication, and hard work are the driving force behind what we accomplished this year, moving AstroNova to a stronger and more profitable financial trajectory. As I reflect on fiscal 2024, three key achievements actually stand out. First, the strategic realignment of our product identification segment, which we completed last summer. By consolidating PI, we have created a far leaner and more efficient business. Our strategic focus is on delivering the best engineered solutions for our customers and the highest return opportunities for the company. The simplification of our PI segment enables us to do just that. Second, the resurgence of our test and measurement segment, which in fiscal 2024, posted its highest revenue in four years. Our portfolio of aerospace products and MRO services is the primary driver powering the T&M segment. Fueled largely by the rebounding commercial air travel and aircraft build rates, T&M is well on its way to returning to its pre-COVID highs. And third, the launching of new PI products in fiscal 2024 in each of our QuickLabel, TrojanLabel, and Astro Machine brands. These include the QuickLabel 900, the TrojanLabel T2 Pro and T3 Pro, as well as Astro Machine's two new flat pack printing solutions. All of these new products feature improved performance and expanded printing width capability. The initial deliveries of these products have been well received by our customers, and we expect them to gain full production momentum in the second-half of this fiscal year. Turning to our full-year results on slide five, we reported fiscal 2024 revenue of more than $148 million, the most in our history. Our 4% top line growth was primarily driven by the T&M segment, which posted a revenue increase of nearly 12%. PI segment revenue was up slightly year-over-year as we worked through the previously discussed retrofit of certain printers affected by the inequality and reliability issues related to a large supplier. Our full-year consolidated margin results reflected an easing of supply chain pressures, the benefit of the PI realignment, improving pricing in T&M and discipline cost management. Compared with fiscal 2023, gross margin improved by 110 basis points on a GAAP basis and 290 points on a non-GAAP basis. We posted record operating profit for the full-year. Operating margin increased 210 points and 380 points on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis respectively. For the full-year adjusted EBITDA, excluding restructuring and retrofit items, increased 60% to $17.6 million. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.9% in fiscal 2024, 420 basis points ahead of fiscal 2023. On the bottom line, Astro Machine earned $0.63 per diluted share on a GAAP basis in fiscal 2023 -- ’24 sorry, up 75% from the year earlier, while non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.97, more than double the $0.43 earned in fiscal 2023. During the year, we generated $12.4 million in cash from operating activities, the majority of which was used to pay down debt. David will discuss our balance sheet and cash flow highlights in more detail in his financial review. Looking at our full-year segment performance on slide six, Product ID segment, revenue was $104 million, just under a million ahead of fiscal 2023. Increases in revenue from hardware and the service and other category offset lower revenue in PI supplies that was attributed primarily to the retrofit program. PI segment operating profit was $2.2 million in fiscal 2024 on a GAAP basis and $5.3 million on a non-GAAP basis. T&M revenue increased to $44 million, compared to $39.4 million in fiscal 2023, primarily on strong hardware revenue growth. The supplies and service categories also posted gains year-over-year. T&M segment operating profit increased $1.2 million from 2023. The rebound in airline passenger traffic toward pre-pandemic levels, the increasing number of daily flights, and favorable commercial aircraft order and delivery trends provide a favorable growth runway for our aerospace product line. The data acquisition product line within our T&M segment gained traction as we went through the year and performed well in the second-half of fiscal 2024, highlighted by strong order volume in end markets such as energy and defense. I'd like to conclude by taking you through our fiscal 2025 targets, turning now to slide seven. Our global teams are committed to continuous improvement and applying the tools of the AstroNova operating system to drive sustained product innovation, operating efficiencies, and margin enhancement. For fiscal 2025, AstroNova expects to achieve full-year organic revenue percentage growth in the mid-single-digits. Additionally, as we continue to drive operational improvements throughout the business, we expect our full-year adjusted EBITDA margin to be 13% to 14% this year and to further improve by 100 basis points per year over the following two fiscal years. Now I'll turn the call over to David for his financial review. David?\nDavid Smith: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. Greg acknowledged the tremendous AstroNova team effort and I'll say that I'm happy and proud that we’re proud of it. We've made great strides in focusing our investments and streamlining our cost structure and we all share our great enthusiasm about the future. The initiatives he outlined do put us in what I believe is a clear path to execute on our longer-term financial objectives. A key metric, we generated strong cash flow for the year with cash from operating activities at $12.4 million, from which we paid down $7 million of debt on our revolving credit facility. Debt reduction is our current primary use of cash after the working capital and modest capital expenditures inherent in supporting the business. We have ample unused capacity, committed in the credit facility with the bank. Turning to slide eight and our fourth quarter results. The $39.6 million of Q4 revenue was in line with the comparable period in fiscal ‘23, with a 10% increase in T&M, largely offsetting a 5% decline in PI. GAAP gross margin of 37.2% in the fourth quarter increased by 320 basis points from the same period in fiscal ‘23, reflecting a more favorable mix in PI in the 2024 period. Operating expenses for the quarter were down $634,000 or approximately 6% year-over-year to $10.8 million. The key driver was a 10% decline in selling and marketing expense, which reflected the benefit of our strategic realignment of the PI segment. It is also overall a function of a broad-based commitment to efficient use of our resources throughout the organization in keeping with the AstroNova operating system. When we announced the restructuring last August, we projected an annualized cost savings of more than $2.4 million. All of the elements of that restructuring are in place and we now see that the run rate is in line and can be seen in our results. The strength of the higher gross margin and lower operating expenses led to operating margin increasing 460 basis points in the fourth quarter to 9.9%, compared to 5.3% in the fourth quarter of last year. As disclosed in the tables, in Q4, we took back $210,000 of the $852,000 provision reserve for the product retrofit program as the costs were not as high as projected as some planned retrofits were not needed or wanted by some customers and the program is complete. Again, if you look at the reconciliation of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable GAAP results, that's available in the release. Adjusted EBITDA improved 4% in the fourth quarter to $5.5 million or nearly 14% of revenue from $3.9 million or 10% of revenue a year earlier. Order volume remains strong. Q4 bookings were a record $39.8 million, 9.7% above the same period in fiscal 2023. Turning to slide nine. In the Q4 of segment performance, PI revenue declined 5% year-over-year to $26.6 million, a large measure due to the market impact of the suppliers’ quality and reliability issues. PI segment operating margin increased by 560 basis points to 12.2%, driven by the strategically-driven activities Greg's already explained. And frankly, the effect of a whole host of improvements by the AstroNova team that are starting to show real results in aggregate. T&M segment revenue increased 10% to $13 million with contributions from both the Aerospace and data acquisition product lines and segment operating profit was, up 14% to $3.7 million and there was a 90 basis point improvement in the segment operating margin. Moving to slide 10. Hardware accounted for about 34% of revenue in the fourth quarter, 3 points higher than the year earlier period, driven by the T&M segment. Although supplies revenue declined year-over-year, again largely to the same ink issues, our businesses continue to generate a high returning revenue stream that averages about 50% and sometimes higher. Service and other revenue accounted for about 14% in the quarter versus 13% in the same period last year. The repair and paper supplies part of the aerospace product lines is a major focus of the team and it's helping both revenue and margins. Geographically, we saw a pickup of nearly $1 million in revenue in the U.S., as well as higher revenue in Asia and though those gains were offset elsewhere mostly in Europe. I'll finish up by summarizing the balance sheet and cash flow highlights and you'll find those on slide 11. Cash and equivalents at the end of the fiscal year were $4.5 million, up slightly from the end of the year last year. And that range is where we're currently comfortable in operating our global operations safely, consistently and efficiently. We generated strong cash from operations, the $12.4 million I mentioned before and we used $7 million of that to pay down our revolving credit debt. Total debt was $21.8 million at beginning of the year and our total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA on a bank basis was 1.3 times. Our financial condition is strong and can certainly support our operations and strategy. I believe the responsible and effective way that the AstroNova team managed through the now historical races of the max crash and COVID impacts on our business, plus the results delivered by our debt-funded acquisitions have enhanced our credibility and access to the capital market as we seek to grow organically and through further acquisition. So now let me turn the call back to Greg for closing comments.\nGreg Woods: Thanks, David. Summary is now on slide 12. AstroNova is well positioned as we move forward in fiscal 2025. We have well-respected brands across our businesses, we continue to launch innovative products that satisfy our customers' most challenging needs and strength in our leading market positions. This sets up a nice position for us to capitalize on strong secular trends in both our Product Identification and Test & Measurement segments, including the increasing demand for a wide range of printing solutions to satisfy mass customization and packaging for consumer goods, as well as the resurgent airline industry. We also continue to benefit from the high recurring revenue contribution from our supplies business and expect that to increase as we continue to place more hardware in the hands of our customers. And finally, we have a strong track record of value-generating M&A and we continue actively seeking complementary strategic acquisitions that broaden our presence and capabilities in our growth markets. We start the new year in a strong financial position and are committed to achieving our 2025 and long-term financial objectives. With that, Dave and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you, Greg. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from [Samuel Koenig] (ph) from Delta Analytics.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning, Greg. Good morning, guys. Congratulations on the…\nGreg Woods: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Congratulations on the wonderful accomplishments this year. I think it's magnimonious and really is impressive. I just wanted to ask you one question regarding Boeing and Airbus. I understand if I'm correct that in the past year, you also began to put in your printers in Airbus. Is that correct?\nGreg Woods: Well, we've always said our -- I don't say always, we've had printers on the Airbus aircraft for quite a while. So that's, you know, true. As we have different brands on the different aircraft that we have.\nUnidentified Analyst: What I wanted to ask you also was with all the detrimental news on Boeing and a lot of companies delaying their acquisitions of the different planes from Boeing and Boeing was also saying there was traps [Indiscernible] and other related items to this incident. How do you think that, that will affect you? Or will that be taken up by the increase in the Airbus orders?\nGreg Woods: Yes. As I mentioned earlier, the overall industry is growing. So we're on a wide range of aircraft. Obviously, in commercial, Boeing and Airbus are the biggest, but pretty much any aircraft that you might be flying on probably has our products on it. So in general, we're pretty well diversified there. As far as Boeing, I'm sure that they'll have -- they have these items to deal with. But looking at it from our standpoint, from a forecast and talking to their supply management people, our forecast and projections from them have not changed. So we're still shipping on schedule and expect that to increase. The increased rate might be a little bit less than what we anticipated last year going into this year. But hopefully, we'll see that pick up as we go later into the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: And are you -- and my final question and wishing you all a great weekend and happy Easter is, are there upgrades coming in these printers? Do you have any upgrades at all? Or are these same like newer products and upgrades in the printers?\nGreg Woods: Well, as we mentioned in our press deck, last investor deck that we posted, we have a big encouragement program going on with airlines and aircraft manufacturers to transition to our ToughWriter brand, which is a more modern printer. So we have a number of airlines as well as OEMs taking us up on that. And we expect to have within the three-year period, the majority of our shipments transition to the ToughWriter brand, which is a newer, more up-to-date printer.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you, guys, and keep up for good work.\nGreg Woods: Great. Thanks for your call.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question today comes from Samir Patel from Askeladden Capital Management. Please go ahead.\nSamir Patel: Hey, guys. Congrats again on the great quarter, and thanks for initiating guidance. I know we've been talking about that for a while. On that topic, I wanted to kind of dive into that guidance. So it's like there's some level of conservatism embedded in that, obviously, year-on-year growth, but it kind of seems more flattish to the last couple of quarters of the year. Is that attributable to seasonality, conservatism on the macro kind of given like the previous caller referenced some of the issues at Boeing. Maybe you could just kind of expound on that a little bit.\nGreg Woods: Yes. Hi, Samir, yes, it's -- we will like to kind of be in the lane there and not everything is predictable. So we don't see any huge headwinds with respect to that. And there are some things, obviously, that could move it higher as well. But that's what -- when we take a look at it right now, we're comfortable with what we said and if we need to revise that later in the year, if things -- if we get ahead of ourselves, we'll adjust it at that way.\nSamir Patel: Okay. So it's kind of that's what you're starting with. And then it's more -- I guess, the bias would be more towards upward revisions if things go well, that you're comfortable that kind of in the face of whatever things you anticipate might happen that you're not going to kind of come in below that. Is that a fair way of interpreting it?\nGreg Woods: Yes, that's a good way to think about it, yes.\nSamir Patel: Okay, okay. The second question was -- I know we've had this ongoing conversation on product ID emergence. They were obviously quite strong in Q3. Q4 kind of gets back to that Q2 level despite similar revenues. I know you mentioned in your script about the retrofit program. Can you kind of explain what was going on there and what we should think about for margins in that segment as we head into next year?\nGreg Woods: Yes. Well, you know -- don't really have -- did never release exactly on that, but there was an adjustment that David could maybe talk about there in Q4. But setting that aside, what we're looking at as we go into this year, is that should -- those margins should be increasing because we're looking at more of those T2C and the other [children-related] (ph) products coming back online as you move through this year. And that helps drive the supplies revenue, which obviously helps growth, but also helps us on the margin side of things. David, do you want to add anything to that?\nDavid Smith: Yes. We did have some inventory adjustments in Astro Machine in the fourth quarter that sat on the margins there a little bit. Obviously, it was -- that's not something that's going to recur. So we think that the margins, the mix moving forward certainly well should improve from what happened in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from George Melas from MKH Management. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Melas: Thank you, operator. Hi, Greg and David, the previous caller asked exactly my question. So I don't have any other, I'm sorry.\nGreg Woods: Okay. All right, good catching up with you.\nGeorge Melas: Okay.\nOperator: The next question is from Dennis Scannell from Rutabaga Capital. Please go ahead.\nDennis Scannell: Yes, good morning, Greg and David, and just echoing what everybody else has said a really nice quarter and nice end of the year. Nice to see this rebound. So my question is also similar to the previous two questioners. So -- but maybe to get a little granular or frame it a little differently. So QuickLabel in the third quarter, by my numbers did -- I'm sorry, Product Identification did 18.1% operating margins, I think the highest I've ever seen and then we're 12% in the fourth quarter. And David, you said that maybe there were some inventory adjustments at Astro Machining. I know historically, the group has been as high as, I think, 14%. So kind of on a go-forward basis, can we look more at the high-teens for this business, like what we showed in the third quarter? Or were there some unusual things going on in the third quarter that make that kind of an unrealistic expectation?\nGreg Woods: So I'll answer it in general and maybe David can be more specific about it. But yes, the inventory adjustment that you mentioned had a big impact on it. And if -- when you average that out, you get more into the longer-term trend that we're talking about getting back into the -- I think we're kind of in the 14% range before. So driving more towards, kind of, that mid-teens, I think is a more realistic thing to think about as we go forward. [Multiple Speakers]\nDennis Scannell: Yes. Go ahead, please David.\nDavid Smith: I agree with that. That's the way I would frame it. I would have said that you kind of take a look at the average there.\nDennis Scannell: Absolutely. No, that sounds great. Thank you for the further clarity. That’s great. Thank you.\nGreg Woods: Alright, thanks, Dennis.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Samir Patel for Askeladden Capital Management. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSamir Patel: Yes. Hey, I think we got cut off. We're sorry about that. I just wanted to follow-up and see if you had any comments on the M&A pipeline.\nGreg Woods: Yes. Well, it's similar as we've talked about before. We've got some interesting opportunities in both T&M and the PI segment and we'll see if we can finish any of those up. Typically, it's about 1% or 2% of the things that we look at that we end up closing. But we're actively looking at it. As David mentioned, we're in great shape from a financial position to be able to pursue acquisitions in the size of the last one we did or even larger. So we're out there. And hopefully, we do something this year. And if not, it means we didn't find a good one here. So we're kind of prudent about that as well to make sure it's a good strategic fit and also that we don't overpay, of course.\nSamir Patel: Makes sense. And again, sorry, if you guys -- I'm not sure if you referenced this in the script, but David, we've talked about your inventory levels and kind of cash flow. You gave your guidance on EBITDA, but maybe we could talk a little bit about sort of cash flow dynamics that you expect this year? I mean, you expect inventories kind of to stay flattish at these levels to continue coming down. Any other kind of working capital or other items you call out?\nDavid Smith: Inventory continues to be a focus and it needs to be. We do see what I like to call areas of opportunity for improvement. We have had to make still some commitments to bring in inventory to support the supplies business, NPI on primarily ink, which has drawn off a lot of cash would have otherwise been able to pay down more debt more recently. And we continue to have some commitments that we need to make on the T&M side of the business. I think as we move through the year, the combination of improvement on the inventory side and obviously, the benefit of the higher margins are going to give us the ability to really go after the remaining portion of the revolving credit debt barring acquisitions, of course, which will cause us to take on more debt. And I think by the end of the year, we'll take a very large bite of what remains there and have the dry powder to do some things on the acquisition side and that will probably be the pattern. It's been the pattern for a while and we work that continuous, pay down the debt and redeploy it first to support operations and then to do acquisitions.\nSamir Patel: Makes sense. Thanks.\nOperator: We currently have no further questions. So I will hand back over to Greg Woods to conclude.\nGreg Woods: Great. Thank you, operator. So thanks, everyone, for joining us here this morning. In June, we'll be presenting at the East Coast Ideas Conference in New York City. We hope to see many of you there in person as well, and have a great weekend, everyone. Bye now.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.\nGreg Woods: Thank you, Scott, and good morning, everyone. We began the second half of fiscal 2024 with a significantly more profitable third quarter. Where operating income increased more than threefold to $4.6 million. Operating margin improved 890 basis points to 12.3% and adjusted EBITDA hit an all-time record up 81% to $5.7 million or 15% of revenue. This profit improvement is a testament to the great agility, hard work and execution by our teams around the world. The increased profit generation was achieved despite an 11% year-over-year revenue decline in our Product Identification segment. This was primarily from the supply side of the business, or the lingering negative impact of an ink quality issue from one of our suppliers has decreased in utilization on some of our printers. To a lesser extent, the temporary effect of higher customer ink inventories ahead of a price increase from that same supplier, and to a degree, the impact of exiting certain product lines as part of the restructuring we announced last quarter. We believe the ink related slowdown issues will abate as we move through the next few quarters. Additionally, we expect to realize strong margins from several new product releases as they gain traction in the market. Meanwhile, the commercial aviation industry continues to experience robust demand closing in on and in some cases exceeding the 2019 highs. Both aircraft operating hours and new aircraft orders are up markedly. These trends are expected to continue and bode well for the aerospace product line within our Test and Measurement segment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and beyond. Now let's review our segment results in a bit more detail, starting with the PI segment. Operating profit increased 62% to $4.8 million, with margin up to 820 basis points to 18.1%. The vastly improved performance primarily reflected favorable product mix as some of the margin improvement actions we implemented earlier took hold. Additionally, we reduced expenses, and lower warranty costs and improved operating efficiencies from the restructuring. We have simplified the PI segment by transitioning more printer manufacturing from Asia and West Warwick to our AstroNova -- Astro Machine plant rather in Illinois, exiting low-margin or low-volume label printers, consolidating international sales and distribution facilities, and streamlined our global channel partner network. As an ongoing fundamental of our strategy, we continue to invest in new products that meet our customers' needs for printing solutions that are compact, efficient and flexible. In the third quarter, we unveiled three new printers. The QuickLabel QL-900, the TrojanLabel T2-Pro and the TrojanLabel T3-Pro. The rugged QL-900 is a desktop inkjet label printer designed for full color labeling applications, manufactured at our Astro Machine plant in Illinois. The product features a touchscreen interface and internal job library, enabling users to easily manage printer setup and operation.  The new T2-Pro is the latest addition to our TrojanLabel brand of compact digital label presses targeted towards industrial and professional printing segments. With a print width of 12.75 inches, and a print resolution of 1,600 by 1,600 dots per inch. The T2-Pro offers superior cost of ownership across all available aqueous inkjet technologies on the market. The T3-Pro as a compact CMYK digital print module ideal for OEMs that want to easily integrate a print station into conveyors or other specialty equipment to offer full color digital printing solutions for envelopes, corrugated and a wide variety of flat surface products. In addition to those three printers, we recently unveiled the VF-280, a high-speed commercial vacuum feeder. This product is designed to handle a variety of materials like bags, envelopes, heavy card stocks, corrugated cardboard, jewel cases, calendars and sheet stocks. When integrated with the TrojanLabel T3-OPX the VF-280 offers a modular direct-to-package post printing system that enables high-quality, full-color automated printing. Customers benefit from faster time to market and reduced waste.  In recent months, we've had the pleasure of integrating and interacting with the thousands of current and prospective customers who demoed our digital label printers, envelope printers and direct-to-package printing solutions at major trade shows such as PACK EXPO in Las Vegas, LabelExpo Europe in Brussels and the Printing United Expo in Atlanta. What we heard from customers is clear. Within the digital printing market, what differentiates AstroNova is our ability to provide customers with a unique total printing solution. We consistently earn high ratings, not only for the breadth of products we offer, but also for the consultative services and support that we provide that tailors a solution to each customer's application and business needs. For instance, within our Astro Machine subsidiary, we are continuing our product innovation initiatives with the upcoming launch of two new digital printing and addressing systems, purpose-built for a large OEM customer. These products embody the voice of the customer methodology that is a central tenet of our AstroNova operating system. Engaging with customers on the design engineering of new products has enabled us to apply that valuable learning to gain traction in both existing and new market verticals. Switching to the Test and Measurement segment. Third quarter revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $11 million, with growth in both our Aerospace and Test and Measurement product groups. Segment operating profit was $2.6 million or 23.2% of revenue compared with $1.7 million or 18% of revenue a year earlier, driven primarily by favorable product mix and the impact of operating leverage on the higher revenue in that unit.  As we've discussed on prior calls, we are gradually upgrading OEM and direct airline customers to our more advanced ToughWriter branded printers from the other three brands in our portfolio. Pairing the number of brands that we offer will allow us to reduce our overall manufacturing costs, thereby driving higher margins.  By the end of fiscal 2027, we estimate that 9 out of every 10 printers we ship will be a ToughWriter compared with a little less than 4 in every 10 today. As we execute that transition, we want to also point out to investors that an additional benefit of this transition will be that the royalty we pay to Honeywell International under our asset purchase and licensing agreement will decline, and it will disappear completely at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2028. We'll not be forecasting that decline for you, but we will report on that as it happens beginning next year. Finally, I'd like to mention another platform design win for our ToughWriter printer. The ToughWriter will be standard equipment on Boeing's new 777X, a wide-body twin-engine jet line are expected to enter service in 2025. Last month, our Aerospace group exhibited at the Dubai Air Show, where I had the privilege of touring the 777X flight test aircraft and hearing from a number of commercial aircraft airline pilots about the favorable experiences with our printers. And [Ember] the captain captured it best when he referred to our printer as ‘a lifesaver’. We agree.  With that, let me turn the call over to David for some further financial comments.\nDavid Smith : Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. I'll reinforce and add some comments about the third quarter financial performance. As Greg said, total regular for the quarter was $37.5 million, down about 5% year-over-year with the lower revenue in the PI segment, partly offset by growth on the test and measurement side.  Hardware revenue of $12.9 million was about 8% higher than last year's third quarter, and supplies revenue was about 13% to $20 million. While the service and other revenue grew about 4% to $4.7 million. Domestic revenue was $21.8 million for the third quarter, a 55.8% of the total compared to 57% in the year earlier period. International revenue was $16.6 million or 44% of revenue compared to 43% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.  Gross profit increased 770 basis points to 39.4% in the third quarter, driven by better product mix lower manufacturing expenses and better absorption and reduced period costs. Of the improvement, the directly trackable impacts on the PI segment restructuring benefits were approximately $450,000 in the fourth quarter -- third quarter rather, and that impacted both gross margin and operating expense. Operating expense declined about 9% in the third quarter to $10.2 million on a non-GAAP basis. This and the factors Greg outlined for why the operating income increased more than twofold to $3.6 million, while non-GAAP operating margin improved over 710 basis points to 12.3%. On the bottom line, we reported net income of $2.8 million or $0.37 per diluted share for this -- just the next quarter versus $289,000 or $0.04 per diluted share in the year earlier period. But keep in mind that the GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal '23 included transaction costs of $540,000 or $0.07 per diluted share associated with the August 22 acquisition of Astro machine.  On a non-GAAP basis, net income for the third quarter of fiscal '23 was $0.11 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter of this year was 5.7% or 15% compared to $2.4 million or 6% of revenue in the same period last year. Excluding transaction costs last year's adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $3.1 million or 8%. Bookings for the third quarter of fiscal '24 increased 1% to $35.5 million from $35 million in the third quarter last year. Backlog as of October 28, 2023 decreased 20% to $31.2 million from $39.3 million a year ago. But this decline is largely due to the timing in the T&M segment and is not indicative of what we expect in the fourth quarter this year when we expect the income statement overall to be consistent with the third quarter. As previously discussed, we had identified about 150 printers sold to customers that were affected by the faulty ink. and we're working with those customers to either repair or replace the effective printers on a gradual basis. We anticipate this will be largely done by the end of this fiscal year at the end of January 2024, with maybe some of it trailing into the first quarter.  In Q3, we incurred costs of about $240,000 for that program, which had been reserved for in connection with the restructuring. Inventory reduction was modest. And while the supply chain challenges are abating. We're still recovering in the inventory level reduction tests that we have. Inventory was $46.3 million at the end of the quarter, down 9% from the end of fiscal '23. Term loan debt at the end of the third quarter was $9.5 million compared with $12 million at the end of last fiscal year. the revolving credit is down $1 million to $14.9 million. Our expectation is to generate cash from earnings and working capital reduction in Q4. and to continue the current focus on using available cash to reduce debt.  So I'll turn the call back to Greg for closing comments. Thanks, David.\nGreg Woods: Our operational and financial momentum entering the final quarter of fiscal 2024 is strong. The recently completed strategic restructuring has significantly improved the cost structure and margin profile of the business and we expect both segments to perform in line with these results again in the fourth quarter. The restructuring of our PI segment allows us to focus on those products with the strongest volume and margin potential while continuing to drive demand through innovative new solutions, such as the QL-900, the T2 Pro and the T3 Pro, and we're very excited about the new OEM products in our Astro Machine pipeline. In the Test & Measurement segment, the key demand drivers are commercial air traffic, new aircraft orders and OEM market forecasts, all of which are pointing up and to the right. Based on strong demand, high barriers to entry and the extended nature of the contracts, we feel very good about the prospects for our Aerospace Products group over the long term.  Now with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for questions.\nOperator:\nGreg Woods: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us here this morning. As always, we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress and hope you have a wonderful holiday. Bye now.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Scott Solomon of the company's Investor Relations firm, Sharon Merrill Associates. Please go ahead, sir.\nScott Solomon: Thank you, Carla. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us on our fiscal second quarter 2024 earnings call. Hosting this morning's call are Greg Woods, AstroNova's President and Chief Executive Officer; and David Smith, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Greg will discuss the company's operating highlights. David will take you through the financials at a high level. Greg will make some concluding comments, and then management will be happy to take your questions. By now, you should have received a copy of the earnings release that was issued this morning. If you don't have a copy, please go to the Investors page of the AstroNova website, www.astronovainc.com. Please note that statements made on today's call that are not statements of historical fact are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions that could involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially, except as required by law. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of today, September 06, 2023. AstroNova undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. For further information regarding the forward-looking statements and the factors that may cause differences, please see the risk factors in AstroNova's annual report on Form 10-K and other filings the company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On today's call, management will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures. AstroNova believes that the inclusion of these financial measures helps investors gain a meaningful understanding of the changes in the company's core operating results. It also helps investors who wish to make comparisons between AstroNova and other companies on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in today's earnings release. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.\nGregory Woods: Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. At the beginning of August, we announced the strategic realignment of our Product Identification segment and an initiative designed to further capitalize on the synergies of last year's acquisition of Astro Machine. That restructuring is reflected in the second quarter financial results that we reported this morning. As a reminder, the specific actions we have taken to realign the segment include; first, transitioning more of our PI printer manufacturing from Asia and our headquarters in West Warwick, Rhode Island, for our Astro Machine plant in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. Second, rationalizing our combined AstroNova and Astro Machine PI Product Portfolio by exiting certain lower margin or low volume label printers to concentrate on higher margin product lines with advanced functionality and greater demand. And third, consolidating our international PI sales and distribution facilities and streamlining our global channel partner network. These actions enable us to concentrate the segment's manufacturing, marketing and sales resources on the highest return opportunities. This in turn will provide the best products and services to our customers. Although the realignment had a negative effect on our GAAP performance in the second quarter, it puts us in a position to achieve an anticipated annualized cost savings of $2.4 million and create a stronger, more resilient business in the quarters to come. Beyond the restructuring, in fact, during the second quarter, we continue to make operating efficiency improvements and we posted double-digit year-over-year top line growth. The key growth drivers for Astro Machine, which we acquired in the fiscal Q3 of last year and the continued momentum of the commercial aviation industry, which is served by our aerospace product line within our testing measurement segment. Looking at our performance by segment, Product Identification revenue was up 10% in the quarter, and excluding the restructuring charges, segment operating profit improved by 80%. Over the past several quarters, the performance of the PI segment has been tamped down as we work through our program to retrofit a large number of high volume printers, guidelines due to a supplier's ink quality issue. As an integral part of our restructuring effort to improve the PI segment, we've established a reserve to account for the cost of an accelerated effort to rapidly repair or replace effective printers in the field, so they can more quickly be returned to full service. We expect to complete this retrofit program by the end of the current fiscal year. Product development continues to be and represents an important part for the growth engine for the PI business, enabling us to increase the breadth of our solutions for brand owners, OEMs and commercial printers. This quarter, we plan to introduce four innovative new products to the market for applications, including labeling, direct-to-package over-printing and high-speed mailing and addressing. Earlier this year, we introduced the QL-900, a high-speed high-performance label printer, printing at speeds of up to 12 inches per second, the QL-900 print vibrant wide format color labels at a resolution of 1,600 dots per inch, making it a robust solution for the most demanding applications. Our customers will have the opportunity to see these and other products in action at several major industry events taking place in the coming weeks. These events include PACK EXPO in Las Vegas, Labelexpo Europe and Brussels, and the PRINTING United Expo in Atlanta. Turning to our Test & Measurement segment, revenue also increased 10% year-over-year in the second quarter, reflecting the continued strong performance of the aerospace market. Robust airline passenger traffic and increased aircraft deliveries, are driving stronger demand trends for our aerospace printers, supplies and services. Segment operating profit was down year-over-year, however, due primarily to a higher-than-normal adverse mix of older-generation product shipments in the quarter. We continue to focus on upgrading and transitioning aerospace customers from these older-generation products to our newer, more advanced, ToughWriter family of printers. As we gradually consolidate our product offerings into fewer, high-volume skews, we expect the resulting manufacturing efficiencies will positively impact segment margins. With that, I'll hand over to David for the financial review.\nDavid Smith: Thank you, Greg, and good morning, everybody. I'll start with an overview of the impact of the restructuring charges on our GAAP and non-GAAP results in the quarter. Restructuring expenses totalled $2.7 million in this quarter. It consisted of about $2 million for the write-off of certain PI inventory, $611,000 in severance cost spread across our geographic footprint, but concentrated primarily in the U.S. and EMEA and $48,000 in lease abandonment expenses. The inventory written off was for low-volume, lower-margin products. This action allows us to concentrate more efficiently on a small set of higher-margin products that cover all of the expected applications that our customers have. We closed a product showroom that was not being used. In a closely related action, we recognized the liability for $852,000 in expenses in connection with the printer retrofit program that Greg described. The program is supported by a very detailed schedule of buy customer action steps and we're on track to complete it during this fiscal year. We've backed out both of these charges from our GAAP financials to give you a clear picture of the business on a non-GAAP basis as is presented in detail in the tables included in the press release. All of these details will be further discussed in our 10-Q when it is filed tomorrow. In sum, we delivered net income after tax of $1.1 million or $0.15 per diluted share in the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis. As Greg said, revenue in the quarter was up 10% to $35.5 million, driven by gains in both segments and the PI gains were attributable to the Astro Machine acquisition. Compared to last year, operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis, excluding the restructuring charges on the retrofit program costs, were up only about $200,000 or 2% in the quarter from last year and that was prior to the addition of Astro Machine just a year ago, Astro Machine operating expenses exceeded that amount. Also, when excluding the non-GAAP charges in the quarter, adjusted EBITDA increased to $3.7 million or 10.3% of revenue, up from $2.2 million, or 6.7% of revenue in the same period last year. Looking at revenue by type, hardware revenue grew by 31% to $11.3 million. Supplies revenue increased 3% to $19.7 million, while the service and other category increased 2% to $4.6 million. In total, hardware revenue accounted for 32% of total revenue in the second quarter, up from 26% last year, supplies made up 55% of total revenue compared with 59% last year and service and other comprise the remaining 13% versus 15% in Q2 of fiscal '23. From a geographic perspective, domestic revenue accounted for nearly 63% of total revenue, up from 59% in the second quarter last year and international revenue, the other 37% compared with 41% last year. In dollars, we saw double-digit revenue growth in the US, while Europe and Asia were down low single digits. At the end of the quarter, cash was $4.5 million, up $600,000 from the end of the fiscal year that ended on January 31. Total debt at the end of Q2 was $27.3 million, down $2.7 million from the end of the year. We're in compliance with all their debt cabinets and we have sufficient capacity to support all the operating needs of our business. We still plan to invest about $1.7 million in new capital equipment that will upgrade our hardware and supplies manufacturing equipment to improve efficiency and keep up with demand and we'll finance that through our bank outside of the capacity of our existing credit facilities. Inventory investment declined modestly in the quarter before the effect of the inventory write-off for the products we're getting out of. We're still expecting some -- we're still experiencing some supply change troubles, primarily electronic components used in T&M products and in a few instances, we are still needing to maintain extra buffer stocks. However, there are clear signs that those supply chain issues in aggregate are abating and we still believe that our inventory levels will decline as we move through the year. Our current plan is to use any free cash flow to reduce debt. So now I'll turn the call back to Greg for closing comments.\nGregory Woods: Thanks David. With the strategic realignment of the PI business behind us, we entered the second half of 2024, well positioned for accelerated revenue growth and margin improvement. We are very excited about the four new PI products to be unveiled at the coming weeks and expect our T&M segment to continue benefiting from the strong demand environment we are seeing in the commercial aviation market. With that, David and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] We'll now take our first question, which comes from Pete Sidoti from Sidoti & Co. Pete, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nPeter Sidoti: Good morning, gentlemen. Just a quick question. Can you talk about your capital spending for this year and next? And with these adjustments, can you talk about the free cash flow you'll be freeing up?\nDavid Smith: Peter, we're going to spend probably right around $2 million this year, which traditionally would have been pretty consistent. We had a period where we were spending a little bit more on business systems and that's behind us now. Traditionally, we've said that we've spent about $2 million a year and maybe it's CapEx. I don't think it's probably quite that high. I think it's probably more like $1 million to $1.5 million and maintenance CapEx, but about $2 million this year as we make those investments. I think the critical issue on the free cash flow side is working capital management and I mentioned that a little bit during my remarks where the focus is on reducing inventory and improving terms, converting more of our earnings to free cash and utilizing the balance sheet more efficiently and clearly streamlining the product line, which should help us in that direction, but we don't have any specific guidance.\nPeter Sidoti: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.\nOperator: Thanks Peter. Our next question comes from Samir Patel - Askeladden Capital. Samir, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSamir Patel: Hey Greg. Hey David. First question is on the restructuring benefits, you quoted $2.4 million cost savings. I wanted to understand, are those just direct cost such as leases, manufacturing costs, labor or does that include any of the benefit from getting these printers retrofit more quickly and kind of getting those units returning to be rectified or is that -- or would that be incremental to those restructuring benefits?\nGregory Woods: That would be incremental.\nSamir Patel: Okay. That makes sense and then the second question is I notice that the bookings were down kind of a fairly significant way that you talked about strong demand. Is that just related to some of that product realignment or some of the printer issues or maybe you could help me understand what's going on there?\nDavid Smith: Maybe I can address that. So, it's a combination of two different factors really. So when we get blanket orders, that tends to boost if up and then we kind of work those down. That happens more from the test and measurement side of the business, where we have kind of large blankets that come out from a bulk way quarter to quarter disturbances. On the PI business, tends to be fairly steady. Although, as I kind of mentioned in my notes there with some of these printers offline, the ink demand for the printers that are offline, those decreased and effective printers unfortunately tend to be our highest volume machine, but it's nothing out of the ordinary. Pardon.\nSamir Patel: I said it's mostly on a Trojan-label side for the machines.\nGregory Woods: Yes, the effective machines or Trojan machines.\nSamir Patel: Got you. So your summary say that it's not any sort of a -- there is not really structural issue. It's more addressed kind of the timing of some of the lumpier orders.\nGregory Woods: Correct.\nDavid Smith: Yes, keep in mind that the backlog in the aerospace business is very lumpy and it's not necessarily a great indicator of revenues in the short term. The PI business is a little bit more short cycle, although as Greg discussed, we could get quite a few blanket orders for labels on that side of the business as well. So it's an interesting metric, but it can't be used effectively I don’t think to predict short term revenues. It's important obviously to have a lot of bookings, but it will fluctuate.\nSamir Patel: All right. Understood. I'll turn it back over, thanks.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question is from Tom Spiro from Spiro Capital. Tom, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nThomas Spiro: Good morning, Greg. Good morning, Dave. Hey, first on the restructuring and retrofit initiatives, with respect to retrofit, the charge I see is $852,000. My recollection is that a month or so ago, you folks estimated that it's $600,000. If I'm recalling correctly, can you explain the difference?\nDavid Smith: Yeah, I can give it kind of a high level on that. As I mentioned in my comments, we wanted to get this done and make sure we get it done as fast as possible. So, that involves more direct travel to customer sites as opposed to, sending the unit in, checking it and validating and then updating it and sending it back out. So, for certain customers, more of the high volume ones, we're actually going to go on site and do it that way. So, that's more expensive, but it gets it done quicker.\nThomas Spiro: And this process will be complete by the end of the fiscal year.\nDavid Smith: Yeah, we've got a very systematic process on that. There could be a few stragglers, but, by and large, well over 90% and we expect if it follows our plan, it will be over 100% -- at 100%.\nThomas Spiro: Okay. That's very much. There is some low volume and low margin products that we were withdrawing from. We're streamlining channel partners etcetera, etcetera. Roughly speaking, how much by way of sales we'll be walking away from those these initiatives?\nDavid Smith: It's very little on the sales front and part of the -- it's still some overlap in products between the AstroNova products, pre Astro Machine acquisition and post. We've done a little line up and in some cases, the AstroNova product is going to win out or has won out and in other cases, it's the Astro Machine product. So we're kind of just the bulk of what we're doing is kind of consolidating and rationalizing those product lines between the two. There is no point having two kind of products that are very similar, just with different branding to the box and there are some other products that they were decreasing in currently low revenue anyway and just to streamline operations, we've end of life those products that we can limit their manufacturing processes associated with those units.\nThomas Spiro: Thanks and on the streamlining of channel partners or reducing channel partners, are we doing that domestically primarily? Is that where that's occurring? Is that overseas? Is it both?\nGregory Woods: No, no. It's globally. So it's in all regions and it's really to get focus. There is some, whatever, -- we're keeping the best of the breed out there and making sure that we have channel partners that are totally aligned with our strategy and also where we have overlap again between Astro Machine distributors and AstroNova distributors, we're sorting that out as well. So it's really to make sure that within each given geographic region, we have a strong partner who is dedicated to AstroNova.\nThomas Spiro: I see. And on Astro Machine, as I recall, when we acquired it, its sales were running something like $21 million, $22 million, $23 million a year. And then I believe last quarter, it seemed kind of a little weak on a quarterly basis. Is it still running at that annual rate of $21 million, $22 million, $23 million ? Has it changed much?\nGregory Woods: It's off a bit from where it was running. But I don't know if we disclosed that. Is that in the Q, David?\nDavid Smith: The amount of the current quarter was will be in the Q. And it's still running in the same range, slightly lower. But I think by the end of the year, we'll be in the range that you talked about.\nThomas Spiro: I see. So product -- I'm sorry, did I cut you off?\nGregory Woods: Just Greg, I was just going to highlight something I said last quarter as well is that the -- from what we've seen in the historical information from Astro Machine, their second half of the year tends to be stronger than the first half.\nThomas Spiro: I see. So if I were to look at the PI sales for the quarter of just under 26% and back out 5%-ish, PI is running well under where it was last year.\nDavid Smith: It is running last year.\nGregory Woods: It's behind where it was, yes.\nThomas Spiro: Yes. Okay. All right. This is most helpful. Thanks very much and good luck.\nOperator: Thanks Tom. Our next question comes from John Dasha [ph] from Pinnacle. John, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Just a quick question on the retrofit expense, $852,000. That seems to be a supplier-related issue and I'm just curious, are they sharing in any of the cost of retrofitting the machines? And do we have any recourse against them?\nGregory Woods: Yes and yes, and it's something that we actually announced that earlier. So there was a financial restructuring and there's also some pricing concessions as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sorry, I must have missed that. Where was that disclosed?\nGregory Woods: It was a year and a half David, two years ago? I forgot exactly what quarter that came out in.\nDavid Smith: I can't really...\nGregory Woods: Recognize what that was and there's a limitation of liability per event in that particular supplier's contract.\nUnidentified Analyst: Limitation of liability. Okay.\nGregory Woods: Yes, to maximize the payouts on that. Go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. I just got to say, so there's really no recourse at this point against the supplier?\nGregory Woods: No, not for the amount that we reserved, no. Yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay.\nGregory Woods: Separate from that, longer term...\nDavid Smith: The amount that we...\nUnidentified Analyst: Go ahead.\nDavid Smith: The amount that we have on the income statement is that we reported. This is the amount that will hit us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay.\nDavid Smith: If that's helpful. If that's helpful.\nUnidentified Analyst: Well, I guess what I'm trying to understand, is the supplier matching that obligation? Or who's on the hook primarily here, you or the supplier?\nGregory Woods: Well, it's a shared amount, but we're not -- because of the negotiations, we don't release the exact dollar amounts between the two of them.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay.\nGregory Woods: But we're going to probably disclose what we're reserving for.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thanks John. Our next question comes from Dennis Scannell from Rutabaga Capital Management. Dennis, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDennis Scannell: Yes. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. Just real quick, though. Maybe could you talk a little bit about the timing of the $2.4 million in savings, kind of how that will leg in over the next few quarters and kind of when you expect to be realizing the full benefit of the realignment actions?\nGregory Woods: Yes. So as far as the $2.4 million, that's what we expect to get on an annualized basis, but it will take a little bit of time to ramp up. So it will ramp, but it's not really back-end loaded. It's just that there's kind of a startup going in Q3 and Q4 to get to the full amount. But we fully expect to hit it within the 12-month period in the fourth quarter. And then it's an ongoing benefit, of course.\nDennis Scannell: Right. Yes. So annualized full benefit in fiscal '25, then? Is that your January '25 fiscal year?\nDavid Smith: Certainly. Yes.\nGregory Woods: Probably also in the next four quarters.\nOperator: Thanks, Dennis. We now have a follow-up question from Samir Patel from Askeladden Capital. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nSamir Patel: A couple of follow-ups. One is you didn't talk, unless I missed it, about the e-commerce site, just kind of any early briefings there?\nGregory Woods: Sure. Yes. So we continue to add customers there. So that's -- I don't if you've been on it and off, but there's more and more things getting added to it and linked into it. So that's growing. We'd like to see it grow a bit faster, but it's more an uptake, and we've got our customer service people, whenever they're talking to our customers, we encourage them to use it. But we also picked up a fair number of third party -- call them third-party customers, where they bought a printer from somebody else, but they're buying label material from us via the e-commerce site. The other benefit, Samir, from that is we're seeing a nice uptick in our Internet marketing results, getting higher up in search and a higher number of inquiries.\nSamir Patel: Got it. And then I know we've talked about this before, is there -- with where you are right now with the retrofits, do you have any sort of sizing around how much of an impact those issues are to your revenue in the PI segment? Put differently, like, you did $26 million this quarter, give or take. Where would you see that figure once you get those retrofits done, kind of based on the supply of the printers that are offline and the supplies that you're not selling?\nGregory Woods: Yes. We haven't given guidance on that. What I can tell you is the two-two Cs that are primarily the ones that have the highest volume that are impacted by that. They typically generate in the neighborhood of $20,000 a year in revenue. And there's roughly -- I think we're about halfway through that upgrade program. So as far as units that are touched. So one thing to keep in mind, too, is once we upgrade it, then they need to use the ink supplies and/or label supplies that they have in-house before they buy more. So there's a bit of a ramp-up in that process.\nDavid Smith: Yes. And Samir, it's David. I'll just comment that, obviously, to take a step like this, where we are moving rapidly to spend all this money, we are expecting a return on that. It's a good economic decision to do it. The faster we do it, we're faster, we'll get the money back and I think it's pretty high -- we think it's a pretty high-return endeavor from a cash flow perspective.\nSamir Patel: Okay. That makes sense. That's helpful.\nOperator: Thanks, Samir. At this time, we have no further questions registered. So with that, I will hand back to Greg Woods for final remarks.\nGregory Woods: Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us here this morning, and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress. Have a good rest of the day. Bye now.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.\nGregory Woods: Thank you, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Despite a macroeconomic climate that remains volatile, we delivered a solid first quarter performance. Our results highlighted our progress in 3 key areas: first, integrating the acquisition of Astro Machine; second, maintaining disciplined expense management; and third, capitalizing on the continuing rebound of the commercial aviation market. Through the exceptional work of our team members around the globe, we generated double-digit revenue growth in both our Product Identification and Test & Measurement segments. Our aggressive focus on implementing and maintaining cost-disciplined measures helped drive a 91% increase in operating income. This increase translated to a 150 basis point improvement in operating margin. On the bottom line, net income grew to $800,000 or $0.11 per diluted share compared with $400,000 or $0.06 per diluted share in the same period of fiscal 2023. Now let's look at each of the segments, beginning with Product Identification, which reported first quarter revenue of $25.1 million, nearly 16% higher than the year earlier period. The increase was driven by the addition of Astro Machine, which we acquired in August of last year. The integration of Astro Machine is proceeding on plan with a rapid level of cross-pollination in terms of engineering, manufacturing and product development between our operations in West Warwick and Elk Grove Village. For example, our first jointly developed printer has already been completed and will be released later this month, and at least one more additional jointly developed printer should be released before the end of the year. First quarter segment operating profit margin improved 350 basis points to 10%, reflecting the higher Product ID revenue from a more favorable mix in the 2024 period. Going forward, we expect revenue mix to also benefit from the retrofitting of printers in the field that were sidelined since last year by a supplier-related ink quality issue as those units are restored and returned to full production. We expect this issue to be fully resolved before the end of the fiscal year. We kicked off our Product ID trade show season last month with great responses at 2 large European trade shows in Germany. interpack 2023 in Düsseldorf and a couple of weeks later, FESPA Global Print Expo in Munich. The shows featured a number of our latest products and accessories, and we were delighted by the number of high-quality leads we generated and the traction our new products are gaining with customers across an array of applications. Also last month, we had another important milestone with the launch of our e-commerce site, giving customers the ability to research and purchase AstroNova printers and supplies directly over the Internet. It's ideal for new customers searching for a solution as well as existing customers that want to reorder or check their account order status. The site provides a convenient, user-friendly experience. Initial customer response has been very positive, and we will continue to add products and functionality to the site throughout the year. Turning to the Test & Measurement segment. Revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $10.3 million driven by continuing improvement of the commercial aerospace market. Segment operating profit was up modestly, but margin was down 50 basis points to 20.1% of revenue. With the projected global demand for air travel in the coming decades, the outlook for our aerospace printers, supplies and services is strong. Airbus anticipates 46,930 aircraft in service by 2041, up from 22,800 in 2020. A total of 39,490 of those are expected to be new deliveries with 60% to support growth and 40% to replace aircraft that will be retired from service. Boeing likewise projects a massive jump in airline fleets over the next 18 years. Turning to the data acquisition portion of Test & Measurement segment. In addition to our core aerospace and defense programs, we have landed several new power generation monitoring projects due to the exceptional accuracy and performance of our data acquisition products. We look forward to growing this new segment in the coming quarters. Finally, we were pleased to see the company-wide bookings in the first quarter were up over 18%, $38.4 million. With further strengthening of our backlog, that totaled $38.7 million at quarter end. Backlog is up more than 32% year-over-year and more than 8% sequentially from the fiscal year-end. Now let me turn the call over to David for additional financial review.\nDavid Smith: Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everybody. At the top line, we posted revenue 13% increased to $35.4 million and solid contributions from both segments. We always highlight the revenue -- recurring revenue nature of our overall business model. And looking at revenue by type, hardware revenue grew by more than 25% to $11.7 million. Driven primarily by the addition of Astro Machine in the Product ID segment, segment revenue increased more than 6% to supplies revenue increased by more than 6% to $19.1 million, reflecting demand growth in both segments. The service and other category was up by more than 24% to $4.7 million. So in total, hardware revenue accounted for 33% of the total revenue in the first quarter; supplies, 54%; and service and other, the remaining 13%. As a percentage of revenue, both hardware and service were up year-over-year, while supplies revenue was down about 4%. Greg noted the cost control in the quarter. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to 30.8% in the first quarter from 32.1% in the same quarter last year, which along with a 40% -- excuse me, 40 basis point increase in gross margins led to a 160 basis point increase in operating profit margin. I'll notice -- I'll note that the operating expense this quarter was lower than the prior 2 quarters. That remains a very strict focus for us. From a geographic perspective, domestic revenue accounted for 64.5% of total revenue, up from 63.4% in the first quarter of the same quarter last year. International revenue accounted for 35.5% of total revenue compared with 36.6% a year earlier. In dollars, we saw double-digit growth in Asia and Central and South America in the quarter and a high percentage -- high single percentage growth in Europe. Adjusted EBITDA, which we define as normal EBITDA plus the share-based compensation, increased to $3.1 million or 8.6% of revenue compared to 6.2% of revenue last year. Cash was $1.5 million higher at the end of the year. Total debt at quarter end was $29.7 million, slightly lower than year-end. Total debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA is calculated in our bank agreement includes a full year of Astro Machine, and that checks in at 2.2x. On the historical GAAP financials, the debt to adjusted EBITDA would be 2.6x. We're comfortable with this level. We do expect leverage, though, to decline through the year absent any acquisitions. We've got sufficient capacity to support our business, the operating needs primarily. And we will use about $1.7 million of secured financing for some new capital equipment that will upgrade our hardware and supplies manufacturing equipment to improve efficiency and keep up with demand growth. Inventory investment increased in the quarter a little bit primarily to support our T&M segment. We're still experiencing some supply chain struggles in the T&M electronic components area and in a few instance, in the PI segment as well, where we need to purchase extra buffer stocks. However, there are clear signs that those supply chain issues in aggregate are , and we're confident that our inventory will shrink as we move through the year. We'll use the free cash to reduce debt. With that, I'll turn the call back to Greg.\nGregory Woods: Thanks, David. In closing, we began fiscal 2024 with improved results that mark an important step towards our larger goal of driving sustained top line growth and margin enhancement. Barring any downturn in the global economy, fiscal 2024 should see continued momentum in the commercial aerospace business, which we expect to contribute favorably to the performance of our T&M segment. In Product ID, our focus is on innovation with multiple new products slated for launch this year and other technology initiatives underway across our lines of business. Now David and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Samir Patel.\nSamir Patel: One question on the Product ID side. So I know this is the first Q1 that you have the Astro Machine business in there, and I noticed that there was a sequential step-down in revenue from kind of the Q3, Q4 levels. Is there some seasonality to that business?\nGregory Woods: There -- we don't have a good enough read exactly on that, but there does seem to be a favorability of the second half of the year from the numbers that we've looked at. And a few of the customers that we've talked to kind of bear that out. Although they don't commit exactly to that kind of cycle, but it seems to be that type of a cycle. It tends to do kind of Q3, Q4 supplies build up is what we've seen.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Peter Sidoti from Sidoti & Company.\nPeter Sidoti: Gentleman, two quick questions. One, can you give me a capital spending budget for this year?\nGregory Woods: We can give you approximate. David, do you want to address that?\nDavid Smith: Yes. We've got about $1.8 million sort of legitimately in the pipeline. So I'm going to estimate that we'll end up at about $2 million.\nPeter Sidoti: Okay. So the excess cash flow from operations will be used to pay down debt? Is that the assumption, unless an acquisition comes along?\nDavid Smith: Yes, that's correct.\nGregory Woods: That makes sense.\nPeter Sidoti: And inventories, do you think they'll stay flat given the growth? Or do you think you'll be able to bring them down?\nDavid Smith: We should be able to bring them down. I'm not going to commit to a number. As I said in my comments, I think the supply chain issues are abating. And we're going to concentrate on getting the inventory levels down over the balance of the year. It's a slow process, but we will get them down.\nGregory Woods: Right.\nPeter Sidoti: Okay. And one simple question, Greg. What's your economic assumptions for 2023 at this point?\nGregory Woods: My economic assumptions?\nPeter Sidoti: Yes. What do you think is going to happen with the economy over the next 12 months? And how do you think it will affect you? There's all different views of what's going on...\nGregory Woods: Yes. I'll have to admit, I'm not an economist. But right now, as I mentioned in my -- big driver I mentioned in the presentation there is we do see a very strong demand in the aerospace. That's probably the strongest indicator that seems to be solidly up. But as long as the economy works well and -- it doesn't seem to be affected at all so far. So we see that as a big driver.\nPeter Sidoti: Okay. So you see no slowing down in any of your sectors at this point?\nGregory Woods: Well, I said in the aerospace, in our Product ID, it is a very global business and a lot of different market segments. So it's hard to predict exactly what the macro economy may or may not affect that. Obviously, the better the economy, the better we will do.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Tom Spiro from Spiro Capital.\nThomas Spiro: Tom Spiro, Spiro Capital. On Product ID, as I recall, Astro Machine's revenues -- annual revenues run in the low to mid-20s, something like $5 million, $6 million a quarter. If I'm right about that and if it did something like that in Q1, it would look to me like what I'll call core Product ID was down. Am I right?\nGregory Woods: We don't break it out exactly. But yes, I would say the growth in Q1 was driven by the Astro Machine business, correct.\nThomas Spiro: No, it's not simply the growth. It looks like product -- core Product ID was down.\nGregory Woods: We don't break out the different segments, Tom.\nThomas Spiro: Okay. The quality issue -- I think the quality issue first emerged in fiscal '22, as I recall from one of your annual reports. And if I understood you your comments earlier, it's going to be resolved by the end of this fiscal year. That seems to take a very long time. Why?\nGregory Woods: We actually are on our third iteration of fix for that, to be honest with you. So what happened is we worked with the supplier, and their first 2 recommendations which we implemented did not prove effective in the long run. So we reverted to a third that we tested very stringently in the last 4, 5 months. And that does seem to be working very well. So now we're rolling that out across the board. Unfortunately, some of the machines we upgraded, we have to upgrade again to this latest fix. But the good news is it does look very sustainable now.\nThomas Spiro: Which product lines are affected by the quality issue?\nGregory Woods: It's most of the Trojan-label products. Some of -- only 1 or 2 of -- actually, it's very little of the QuickLabel. It's mostly in the Trojan-label line.\nThomas Spiro: And does -- if someone has one of these....\nGregory Woods: I was going to say, it works for some applications fine, but in certain applications, it didn't perform as well as it needs to be, and that's why we're redoing those machines.\nThomas Spiro: I see, I see. And if I'm one of the folks who has one of the affected machines, does the problem prevent me from using the machine at all? Or simply do I use it at a lower rate? What do I do?\nGregory Woods: You may be able -- it depends on your application. So some applications -- and there's different types of labels and different applications of our labels in a wide variety of markets. So some see no issue at all, some see an intermittent issue, where we can address that kind of just treating the symptoms but not the root cause. And then others, just -- it doesn't work for their applications because they require very specific application requirements. So it's a mix -- several hundred printers, yes.\nThomas Spiro: As I recall, we did receive some modest compensation from the vendor a couple of years ago for this problem. Are we expecting further compensation for what we've suffered or no?\nGregory Woods: We can't disclose that exactly because it has to do with the agreements that we made. But the -- it's a combination of some concessions, and then future concessions and a variety of elements. But it won't -- there's not a clear payment like we had at the outset there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samir Patel from Askeladden Capital.\nSamir Patel: David, following up on the inventories issue. I know you don't want to pin down to a specific number. But if I just look at data I pulled here, and I don't know if this is accurate, but it looks like from October of 2002 all the way through, call it, maybe late 2018, your inventory turns were kind of at 5 or above, except for a very brief period early in that decade. Today, those inventory turns according to my data source are at 3.3. So is there something structural about your business where as the supply chain headwinds abate -- I mean, do you think getting back to maybe that 4, 4.5, 5x inventory turns is a reasonable target? Or is there something structurally different in the business today?\nDavid Smith: I love the question. I wish I had been around long enough to have that in my bones. But I'll take your math at good faith. No, there's nothing about the business inherently that should keep us from getting back to those levels. I think the aerospace business will always turn slower than the PI business for a variety of reasons, including the fact that you have to support these printers for a very, very long time. And if you have old technology, you have to do last-time buys to make sure that you have the components to build the printers over that entire period. And I think that's sort of the long-term drag on inventory turns. The PI business turns inventories much more quickly. We did have a slowdown across the board during this most recent struggles with the aerospace business and the pandemic and so forth. But no, I think our turn should improve in the PI business. And I think there are secular reasons why the aerospace business should improve. So no, I think our turn should improve over the next couple of years.\nSamir Patel: That makes sense. I mean another way of looking at it is the last time that your revenues were at comparable levels on a trailing basis. Your inventories were, I think, $35 million according to this data as opposed to $50 million now. So I mean I know you're not wanting to put out a number, but it sounds like it could be quite meaningful over -- and I guess what time frame do you expect that to be realized? I mean, is that kind of 24 months, is that 12 months, somewhere in between?\nDavid Smith: Yes. I mean the business is bigger and we bought Astro Machine. So the inventories are going to have a little bit of a step-up. I think it's going to take -- during this year, we expect -- I said in the comments, I think our cash flow generation and as we move through the year, the inventory levels are going to get better. I'm not committing to a specific number. And hopefully, we'll be able to improve that into future years as well. But I -- that's speculative at this point.\nGregory Woods: Samir, so I could add a little bit of color to that, if you like. And I think we've said this in the past as well is that when we had these supply chain issues going back over a year now, where we found issues, especially on our supply part of our PI business, we definitely stocked up above our normal run rates. So that will start to bleed off, actually. It's just orders for those suppliers are typically 6 to 8 months in the future. So some of that is actually going to bleed off this year and it will continue into next year.\nSamir Patel: Okay. Perfect. And then one topic you haven't talked about for a little while is I know you implemented the new ERP system. You were excited about some of the visibility that gave you, I think, when you were integrating Astro Machine. Maybe just talk about some of the benefits there and how you see that helping you run the business going forward.\nGregory Woods: Yes. And one of the biggest benefits is having it integrated amongst our different operations. So here in West Warwick, we're very far through the process. It's now a matter of kind of optimizing processes. We kicked it off very rapidly at Astro Machine because it's here, domestic, it's a smaller operation. So we expect to have that one done probably by the October kind of time frame. So that's moving very quickly. And then we'll move directly to the branch locations, Canada, U.K., France and Germany.  Have different instances of NetSuite that they've had over time. So we just need to consolidate all of those, which that will be the focus after Astro Machine. So getting everyone on the same system clears up a fair amount of inefficiencies that we have to deal with mainly in the financial reporting side of the business. But the CRM systems, having those integrated, because that's also part of NetSuite, that just helps the whole sales and marketing team know globally what's going on instantaneously.\nSamir Patel: Got you. And I guess I'm excited to hear about e-commerce next time but probably wait for more data. As far as...\nGregory Woods: If you want to check it out, you were -- was just going to say, just go to our AstroNova Product ID site and click on the Shop button, and you can explore it on your own.\nSamir Patel: I will do that. As far as M&A, I mean, I know timing is kind of not within your control, but do you want to talk about the pipeline? Or are you seeing more opportunities on the Test & Measurement side, the Product ID side, both of them?\nGregory Woods: Yes. So it's pretty good in terms of a number of elements. We typically have a handful -- I'd say, have about 4 to 6 things that we're looking at seriously both in Test & Measurement segment and in the Product ID segment. And there's a few that look interesting. So it's -- you never know that, right? So it looks interesting. You start talking. And if we don't like what we see, we'll walk away. And you can see we're kind of conservative in the type of deals we do. So obviously, if we find -- if we can get one of those closely to the parameters we have for Astro Machine, we'll be jumping on it. And we'll have -- you've heard about what's going on with the balance sheet. So we should be in a good position to do a nice deal later in the year if we can get the right one vetted out from our diligence efforts.\nSamir Patel: Okay. And Greg, I actually did what you said. I am on the e-commerce website. I'm only seeing the ability to buy printers and presses. Am I missing sort of the supplies component of that? Or is that a part of the website?\nGregory Woods: No, you can go in there. You can buy a label -- all different labels. You actually can buy them if you were...\nSamir Patel: Okay. I see it now.\nGregory Woods: Unfortunately, you bought a competitor printer. You can actually buy the label for that printer too to get better results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from George Melas from MKH Management.\nGeorge Melas: A follow-up on Thomas Spiro's questions about the quality issue. It clearly affected machines that are in the field. So it impacts supply sales. Did it also impact hardware sales? Was it just hard to sell the Trojan machines given the issues that you were having?\nGregory Woods: Yes, in certain models, mainly through our channel segment. So we know which indications we can sell the machines into. So on a go-forward basis, we're able to do that incrementally. And now we have, of course, the fix in place so we can go a little more aggressively on it. But the channel -- you can imagine, if you're a channel partner and you had a number of issues, you're reluctant to do it until you see the new solution prove out and regain those sales. So we're -- a lot of what we're doing is working with the channel partners to get them back online, explain exactly what we did to make sure that we have a solid solution here. And yes, that's working, but now they need to go back out and generate their customer sales. So there was a hardware impact for those reasons.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. And maybe help us understand, like Trojan, what percentage of revenue is direct or how much is through the channel? How important is the channel for Trojan sales?\nGregory Woods: It's an important piece of it. There's a good amount of direct sales as well. But a lot of the OEMs, some of the larger accounts, happen to be either OEM accounts or channel accounts for Trojan equipment, less so with the QuickLabel.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. Okay. Great. Maybe a question on the bookings. They seem to be really strong. Was there any particular area of strength? Or was it sort of across the board? Was it like a few large deals? Maybe give us just a little bit of color on the bookings.\nGregory Woods: Yes. There wasn't an outsized deal that was involved there. It's pretty much spread across different products in both the Test & Measurement segment and in the Product ID segment.\nDavid Smith: Yes. The trend is -- the trend in the aerospace products is generally favorable.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. How do the aerospace guys order? I mean, is it very lumpy? Or is it sort of just a continuous kind of order patterns?\nGregory Woods: We wish it was the latter, but it's more the former, right? So it depends on -- in the Test & Measurement segment, I'll put this into one because that's how we report it. So with the kind of data acquisition -- those tend to be a lot of aerospace and defense government contracts, so that's very lumpy. And then the aerospace product lines, it depends on which -- you get a new airline who buys, whether it's -- say, it's 50 Airbus 320s or 50 Boeing 737 airplanes. That then -- they then come to us or go to Boeing or Airbus and -- it depends on which product category you're talking about. And they put their orders in. So that could be a big order, it might be spread over 12 months or even longer. And sometimes it's a forecast. We can't even book it as an order. But that's where that lumpiness comes in there. Sometimes we get some surge orders. But the short term, hey, we need something in 3 months that wasn't forecast, that's pretty rare. We don't see a lot of that in the aerospace. It's pretty predictable. There's typically -- we're shipping product 6 months or more in advance of when it goes into the final assembly of the airplane. But there's spare parts part of it. There's other parts of the business that can jump around as well.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just a final quick question for David. David, the G&A line, do you expect some leverage on that G&A line in the future as the business grows? I mean, as -- basically as a percentage of revenues, you see G&A as a percentage of revenue coming down?\nDavid Smith: Yes. That's the goal. It makes sense that, that will happen. We haven't talked about specific percentages from a guidance standpoint. But certainly, it would make sense that, that would happen, and that's our goal. I think we're -- I think that's what will happen.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. And is there a particular number you can give about the ERP implementation costs in the quarter?\nDavid Smith: Most of the implementation costs are in the rearview mirror. We are spending some capital on implementation at Astro Machine. We'll spend some more work on capital in the European convergence with the global system. But those numbers are in my overall guidance for capital spending this year. So it's -- they're not huge.\nOperator: There are no more questions on the line. So I'll now hand back to Mr. Woods for any closing remarks.\nGregory Woods: Great. Thanks a lot. So thanks, everyone, for joining us here this morning. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in the future. Have a good day.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everyone, for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a lovely rest of your day."
