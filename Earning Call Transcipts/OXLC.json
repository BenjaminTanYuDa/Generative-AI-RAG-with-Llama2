My name is Adam and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand the floor to CEO Jonathan Cohen to begin. So, Jonathan, please go ahead when you are ready.\nJonathan Cohen: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Oxford Lane Capital Corp Third Fiscal Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by Saul Rosenthal, our president; Bruce Rubin, our chief financial officer; and Joe Kupka, our Managing Director. Bruce, could you open the call with the disclosure regarding forward-looking statements?\nBruce Rubin: Sure, Jonathan. Today's conference call is being recorded.

Today's conference call includes forward-looking statements and projections that reflect the company's current views with respect to, among other things, future events and financial performance. We ask that you refer to our most recent filings with the SEC for important factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these projections.

With that, I'll turn the presentation back to Jonathan.\nJonathan Cohen: Thank you, Bruce. On December 31st, 2023, our net asset value per share stood at $4.82 compared to a net asset value of $4.81 per share as of September 30th. For the quarter ended December, we recorded GAAP total investment income of approximately $79.2 million, representing an increase of approximately $4.8 million from the prior quarter. The quarter's GAAP total investment income consisted of approximately $73.6 million from our CLO equity and CLO warehouse investments and approximately $5.7 million from our CLO debt investments and from other income. Oxford Lane reported GAAP net investment income of approximately $48.7 million or $0.23 per share for the quarter ended December, compared to approximately $44.8 million or $0.23 per share for the quarter ended September 30th. Our core net investment income was approximately $82.7 million or $0.39 per share for the quarter ended December compared with approximately $79.7 million or $0.41 per share for the quarter ended September. For the quarter ended December, we recorded net unrealized appreciation on investments of approximately $6.7 million and net realized losses of approximately $3.1 million or $0.02 net per share. We had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $52.4 million or $0.25 per share for the third fiscal quarter. As of December 31st, the following metrics applied. We note that none of these metrics represented a total return to shareholders. The weighted average yield of our CLO debt investments at current cost was 16.6%, down from 18.5% as of September 30th. The weighted average effective yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 16.5%, up from 16.3% as of September 30th. The weighted average cash distribution yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 24%, down from 25% as of September 30th. We note that the cash distribution yields calculated on our CLO equity investments are based on the cash distributions we received or which we were entitled to receive at each respective period end. During the quarter ended December, we issued a total of approximately 10.8 million shares of our common stock, pursuant to an at-the-market offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $52.2 million. During the quarter-ended December, we made additional CLO investments of approximately $113.9 million and we received approximately $30.2 million from sales and repayments. On January 25th, our Board of Directors declared monthly stock distributions of $0.08 per share for each of the months ending April, May, and June of 2024. With that, I'll turn the call over to our Managing Director, Joe Kupka. Joe?\nJoe Kupka: Thanks, Jonathan. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, U.S. loan market performance improved versus the prior quarter. U.S. loan prices, as defined by the Morningstar LSTA U.S. Leverage Loan Index, increased from 95.56% as of September 30th to 96.23% as of December 31st. The increase in U.S. loan prices led to an approximate six-point increase in median U.S. CLO equity net asset values. Additionally, we observed loan pools within CLO portfolios marginally increase their weighted average spreads to 372 basis points compared to 370 basis points last quarter. Despite the increase in loan prices, the 12-month trailing default rate for the loan index increased to 1.5% by principal amount at the end of the quarter from 1.3% at the end of September. Additionally, the distress ratio, defined as the percentage of loans with a price below 80% of par, ended the quarter at 4.5% compared to approximately 4.4% at the end of September. CLO new issuance during the quarter totaled approximately $32 billion, an increase of $4 billion from the prior quarter. The $116 billion of issuance in 2023 trailed the $129 billion of issuance in 2022. However, CLO liabilities have continued to tighten through the new year, which should improve new issue arbitrage and issuance going forward. Oxford Lane continued to be active during the quarter. While most of our activity took place in the secondary market this quarter, we added one new issued CLO equity investment, one new issued CLO debt investment, and one new warehouse during the quarter. Our investment strategy during the quarter was to engage in relative value trading and to lengthen the weighted average reinvestment period of Oxford Lane's CLO equity portfolio. In the current market environment, we intend to continue to utilize an opportunistic and unconstrained investment strategy across U.S. CLO equity debt and warehouses as we look to maximize our long-term total return. And as a permanent capital vehicle, we have historically been able to take a longer-term view towards our investment strategy. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Cohen: Thanks Joe. Additional information about Oxford Lane's third quarter performance has been uploaded to our website www.oxfordlanecapital.com. And with that, operator, we're happy to open the call up for any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Now our first question today comes from Mickey Schleien from Ladenburg. Mickey, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMickey Schleien: Yes, good morning, everyone. Jonathan, in the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that CLO debt liability spreads are compressing. What are your expectations for that trend to continue in order to offset the decline in leverage loan spreads, which are also compressing and thereby protecting the arbitrage this year?\nJonathan Cohen: We don't really have a view, Mickey. I mean, that's more of a macro factor. And in terms of the forward pricing outlook for CLO debt tranches, which in turn, as you rightly note, feeds into the quality of a new issue arbitrage and therefore the robustness of the forward calendar. We'd obviously like to see those things happen, but we have no particular insight as to whether they will.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. If I can follow up then, what are your expectations for the portfolios CLO investments that are beyond their reinvestment period in terms of the ability to have those called now that spreads are tightening, and what proportion of those investments are you in a control position?\nJonathan Cohen: Sure. We've already begun that process, just taking advantage of rising NAVs and the tightening liabilities. So, we're starting to have those discussions kind of a case-by-case basis depending on the current status of the CLO. We're going to look to call some deals, reset when we can, and kind of take it case-by-case. Obviously, regarding your first question, there's going to be this push and pull on the market as a lot of the post-reinvestment CLOs try to get something done. So I think we'll be range-bound, but we kind of take what the market gives us in terms of when we want to reset first call.\nMickey Schleien: I understand and my last question, what sort of average recovery rate assumption are you using in the portfolio to calculate your estimated yields? And how has the decline in the rate of those recoveries impacted that assumption?\nJonathan Cohen: Sure, Mickey. I don't think we have historically disclosed those figures publicly, but in any case, it's a range. I mean, as we're calculating those likelihoods, we're looking at a range of possibilities and probabilities that are in turn dependent on, in some cases, the individual portfolio compositions of the underlying collateral pools and the structure of the indentures themselves. So it isn't as if we have sort of a single calculation that fits every profile. We've got a range of calculations that we hope allow us to make good decisions around a very wide array of different CLO profiles.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. That's it for me this morning. Thank you.\nJonathan Cohen: Thank you, Mickey, very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Howlett from B. Riley Securities. Matt, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Howlett: Good morning, everyone. This is Michael Schafer on for Matt. Notice cash flow diversion down a little bit over half. I'm curious if you could detail the trend there? What that looks like quarter to date. Thank you.\nBruce Rubin: Yeah, sure. So we had a large payer in particular that kind of -- just through the self-curing mechanisms of the CLO in combination with improving market conditions turned off its diversion, so started to pay. It's hard to project out diversions for next quarter, a lot of it [Multiple Speakers]\nJonathan Cohen: Right, we generally don't do that, but as you say, we were down about half in terms of the quantum of diversion quarter-over-quarter.\nMichael Schafer: Thank you.\nJonathan Cohen: Thank you very much. Thank you for your question.\nOperator: I show no further questions. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jonathan Cohen, CEO.\nJonathan Cohen: Wonderful. Well, thank you very much. I'd like to thank everyone who participated in this call and everyone who's listening on the replay of the call for their interest and their participation. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thanks very much."

For the quarter ended September, we recorded GAAP total investment income of approximately $74.4 million, representing an increase of approximately $3.9 million from the prior quarter. The quarter's GAAP total investment income from our portfolio consisted of approximately $69.3 million from our CLO equity and CLO warehouse investments and approximately $5.1 million from our CLO debt investments and from other income. Oxford Lane recorded GAAP net investment income of approximately $44.8 million or $0.23 per share for the quarter ended September, compared to approximately $42 million or $0.24 per share for the quarter ended June 30. Our core net investment income was approximately $79.7 million or $0.41 per share for the quarter ended September, compared with approximately $75 million or $0.43 per share for the quarter ended June 30. Quarter ended September, we recorded net realized losses of approximately $10.5 million and net unrealized appreciation on investment of approximately $95.8 million or $0.44 per share in total. We had a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $130.1 million or $0.67 per share for the second fiscal quarter. As of September 30, the following metrics applied. We note that none of these metrics represented a total return to shareholders. The weighted average yield of our CLO debt investments at current cost was 18.5% up from 18.1% as of June 30. The weighted average effective yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 16.3%, up from 16% as of June 30.

We note that the cash distribution yields calculated on our CLO equity investments are based on the cash distributions we've received or which we were entitled to receive at each respective period end. During the quarter ended September, we issued a total of approximately 20.8 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an at-the-market offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $104.8 million, which resulted in net accretion to shareholders of approximately $0.07 per share of NAV for the quarter. During the quarter ended September, we made additional CLO investments of approximately $171.7 million and we received approximately $11.8 million from sales and from repayments. On October 26, our Board of Directors declared monthly common stock distributions of $0.08 per share for each of the months ending January, February and March of 2024. With that, I'll turn the call over to our Managing Director, Joe Kupka.\nJoe Kupka: Thanks, Jonathan. During the quarter ended September 30, 2023, U.S. loan market performance improved versus the prior quarter. U.S. loan prices, as defined by the Morningstar LSTA U.S. Leverage Loan Index, increased from 94.24% as of June 30 to 95.55% as of September 30. The increase in U.S. loan prices led to an approximate 11 point increase in median U.S. CLO equity net asset values. Median junior overcollateralization positions declined 0.1% to approximately 4.1%. Additionally, we observed loan pools within CLO portfolios increased their weighted average spreads to 370 basis points compared to 359 basis points last quarter. The 12-month trailing default rate for the loan index decreased to 1.27% by principal amount at the end of the quarter from 1.71% at the end of June. Additionally, the distress ratio, defined as the percentage of loans with a price below 80% of par, ended the quarter at 4.36% compared to approximately 6% at the end of June. CLO new issuance during the quarter totalled approximately $28 billion, an increase of $6 billion from the prior quarter. However, the $84 billion of year-to-date issuance as of quarter end trialed $106 billion of issuance for the same period in 2022. Oxford Lane continued to be active during the quarter, transacting in both the primary and secondary markets. Overall, we executed over 40 transactions in the quarter, adding 16 new CLO equity investments and two new CLO debt investments. Our investment strategy during the quarter was to engage in relative value trading and to lengthen the weighted average reinvestment period of Oxford Lane's CLO equity portfolio.

With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Cohen: Thanks, Joe. Additional information about our second quarter performance has been uploaded to our website at www.oxfordlanecapital.com. And with that, Operator, we're happy to open the call for any questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Mickey Schleien from Ladenburg. Please go ahead.\nMickey Schleien: Yes, good morning, everyone. Jonathan, I want to start by asking you how you would describe how the managers in your CLO portfolios responded to take advantage of the strength in the low-end CLO markets during the third quarter in terms of the opportunity to refinance or reset liabilities.\nJoe Kupka: Hey, Mickey, this is Joe. Yeah, we saw some limited activity in terms of refis and some resets around the margin. The liability market was quick moving during the quarter, so just given the amount of supply out there, we tend to see like a push and pull pretty quickly. We also see some call deals, but there wasn't that wave of refis and resets that are waiting in the wings, but we did see some around the margins.\nMickey Schleien: And I imagine that given the war in the Middle East and the weakness in the markets in October, if anything, that opportunity is lower now than it was in the third quarter. Would you agree with that?\nJoe Kupka: Yeah, I think that's fair to say.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. My next question, with inflation still above target, the consensus seems to be building around higher interest rates for longer, so curious to understand how managers are dealing with that risk in terms of the stress to their issuers' interest coverage ratios and the potential for more downgrades to CCC.\nJoe Kupka: Yes, I think that's definitely been at the top of managers' minds for several quarters now. So I think they've had time to prepare and manage their portfolios appropriately. We've seen some managers take proactive measures in terms of limiting their CCCs, limiting their single B exposure -- just for the potential of further downgrades to manage those tests. Also have seen managers limiting certain sectors where they see…\nJonathan Cohen: Less of an ability to pass through price increases, Mickey. Where demand elasticity is lower, we've seen a push for managers to make those smaller positions inside of their collateral portfolios.\nMickey Schleien: Yeah, I understand. You've reported net realized losses pretty consistently every quarter. I want to understand, to what extent is your goal of defending the portfolio's average reinvestment period driving exits from post-reinvestment periods, CLOs? Those prices have been relatively weak and are those what's leading to the realized losses?\nJonathan Cohen: I don't think in a meaningful way, Mickey. I mean, we are trading the portfolio on a relative value basis. So in instances, where we see the ability to sell something and buy something at a better price with a better reinvestment period or a cleaner portfolio or more stronger cash flows or a diminished probability of a future diversion, we will likely engage in those trades. But there's no wholesale effort to sell positions, either at losses or gains, simply with the sole objective of extending the reinvestment period. That is one objective, but it is not the driving objective beyond all of our trading activity.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. So these consistent realized losses have been proactive decisions on relative trades in the portfolio. Am I understanding you correctly?\nJonathan Cohen: Yes, that is a truthful and fair statement, Mickey, yes.\nMickey Schleien: Okay, that's it for me this morning. I appreciate your time, as always.\nJonathan Cohen: Thank you, Mickey.\nOperator: The next question on the line is from Matthew Howlett from B. Riley Financial. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Cohen: Good morning, Matt. You may be on mute.\nMatthew Howlett: Sorry about that. Good morning, Jonathan. Hi, Joe. Hey, thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Just your thoughts on relative value. When you look at primary versus secondary, you look at the credit curve, you look at tiering among managers, are things becoming more pronounced now where you could really look at value between those sort of metrics? Or just I'd love to hear your thoughts on relative value within the CLO market today.\nJonathan Cohen: Joe?\nJoe Kupka: Yes, I think it's very quick moving. As you said, manager tiering is especially top of mind for us. We've seen that basis grow and shrink throughout the year. It's pretty wide at the moment, so that's a potential avenue for some relative value. In terms of primary and secondary, that's moved around a bit, probably not to the extent of the manager tiering, but selectively, we've participated in the primary in a few instances this year, but the bulk of it has been in the secondary, just given that's where we see the relative value. But, yes, I think, like you said, there's a lot of opportunities just given the large bases between managers, between lengths and between primary and secondary.\nMatthew Howlett: Yes, you seem like you guys are finding a lot of value. The yields all went up on the GAAP yield and the core yield on the equity and the debt. Is that from the new purchases that you're finding deeper value, or is that just from improvement in existing holdings? Just curious on that upward movement in yields we'd like to see that.\nJoe Kupka: Yes, it's a combination of both.\nJonathan Cohen: It's a bit of both, Matt. So obviously, when we're turning the portfolio, by definition, we're seeking better total returns, better risk-adjusted returns than the positions we held historically. But this was a strong quarter. We saw a meaningful improvement in NAV, certainly, driven by strength in the underlying collateral pool. So very much so.\nMatthew Howlett: Great. Look, it shows the benefits of active management, and congratulations to everyone on the team on that. And then I guess the final question is, like, the balance sheet is just in terrific shape. You haven't really issued any new preferred or unsecured notes in some time. I know there's one small maturity in mid-next year, but with the growth in the equity base, the improvement in the NAV, can you just give us an update on those markets and when potentially you'd look to tap them? I mean, we've seen that market open up to some other people. Just curious, is your equity base, your common equity base, grows? How willing would you be to be able to tap those markets? It seems to be very critical to shareholders.\nJonathan Cohen: Sure, Matt, absolutely. We're always open to that possibility, but at a price. So we need to be very mindful of the differentials between our uses of proceeds and our costs of capital. And the five-year, for example, $25 par market that you just referenced is certainly a wider market than it was a year or two ago. And so we're watching those markets. We're sort of always in internal discussion about the viability and desirability of issuing more debt, but as you say, we haven't chosen to in a while.\nMatthew Howlett: Absolutely. And it's nice that you guys are paying attention to price. It's just that the balance sheet continues to improve and improve. It just seems like even with these putting on some higher yields, it could be enormously accretive if you put on something in the 8% range, call it, and go into market and buy a sale equity yielding high T's or whatever. It just seems so that the math would make a lot of sense at some point when you're ready to explore.\nJonathan Cohen: Absolutely, Matt. It's a dynamic we're very much focused on, certainly.\nMatthew Howlett: Great. Well, congrats on a great quarter. That's all I have.\nJonathan Cohen: Thank you, Matt, very much.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from Mickey Schleien from Luddenburg. Please go ahead.\nMickey Schleien: Jonathan, I just wanted to follow-up on the relative value trades and the realized losses. Do you, as a practice, triangulate the prices that you're getting on these exits when you consider your estimated yields? In other words, on these exits, could you argue that the estimated yields were too high and not enough return of capital was booked and that led to the realized loss? Or am I misinterpreting that trend?\nJonathan Cohen: I'm not sure, Micky. It's a somewhat technical accounting question. We can go through it with our internal accounting group and get back to you. I'm not sure.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: I show no further questions on the question key.\nJonathan Cohen: All right. I'd like to thank everybody for their interest and for their participation in our second fiscal quarter earnings call. We look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thanks very much."

On June 30, 2023, our net asset value per share stood at $4.34, compared to a net asset value per share of $4.61 as of March 31, 2023. For the quarter ended June, we recorded GAAP total investment income of approximately $70.5 million, representing an increase of approximately $4 million from the prior quarter. The quarter's GAAP total investment income from our portfolio consisted of approximately $66.2 million from our CLO equity and CLO warehouse investments and approximately $4.3 million from our CLO debt investments and from other income. Oxford Lane recorded GAAP net investment income of approximately $42 million or $0.24 per share for the quarter ended June, compared to approximately $37.4 million or $0.22 per share for the quarter ended March. Our core net investment income was approximately $75 million or $0.43 per share for the quarter ended June, compared with approximately $37.5 million or $0.22 per share for the quarter ended March 31. For the quarter ended June 30, we recorded net realized losses of approximately $1.3 million and net unrealized depreciation on investments of approximately $55.5 million or $0.32 per share. We had a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of approximately $14.8 million or $0.08 per share for the first fiscal quarter. As of June 30, the following metrics applied. We note that none of these metrics represented a total return to shareholders. The weighted average yield of our CLO debt investments at current cost was 18.1% up from 18% as of March 31. The weighted average effective yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 16%, up from 15.8% as of March 31. The weighted average cash distribution yield of our CLO equity investments at current cost was 24.6%, up from 16.5% as of March. We note that the cash distribution yields calculated on our CLO equity investments are based on the cash distributions we received or which we were entitled to receive at each respective period-end. During the quarter ended June 30, we issued a total of approximately 12.1 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an aftermarket offering, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $60.2 million. During the quarter ended June 30, we made additional CLO investments of approximately $111.9 million and we received approximately $69.7 million from sales and from repayments. On July 27, our Board of Directors declared monthly common stock distributions of $0.08 per share for each of the months ending October, November and December of 2023. And with that, I will turn the call over to our Managing Director, Joe Kupka. Joe?\nJoe Kupka: Thank you, Jonathan. During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, U.S. loan market performance improved versus the prior quarter. U.S. loan prices, as defined by the Morningstar LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan Index, increased from 93.38% of par as of March 31 to 94.24% of par as of June 30. According to LCD, during the quarter, there was some pricing dispersion with BB-rated loan prices increasing 69 basis points, B-rated loan prices increasing 134 basis points, and CCC-rated loan prices increasing 212 basis points on average. The 12-month trailing default rate for the loan index increased to 1.71% by principal amount at the end of the quarter from 1.35% at the end of March. We note that the percentage of defaults within U.S. CLOs, which are actively managed, remains lower than the index. The increase in U.S. loan prices led to an approximate 9 point increase in median U.S. CLO net equity values. Median junior over-collateralization cushion declined 0.3% to approximately 4.2%. Additionally, we observed loan pools within CLO portfolios modestly increased their weighted average spreads to 359 basis points compared to 357 basis points last quarter. With the primary market arbitrage remaining challenging, Oxford Lane continued to be active in the secondary market during the quarter. We added 12 new CLO equity investments and two new CLO debt investments during the quarter.

You hear me okay? Jonathan?\nJonathan Cohen: We do. Yes, we can hear you fine.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. I think, Jonathan, Joe just mentioned that the primary markets in CLO equity are still challenging. I'm just curious whether you've seen at the margin any improvements in the trends in CLO equity trading either primary or secondary with this sense that maybe an economic soft landing is actually more probable than we might have thought.\nJonathan Cohen: We have, Mickey, yes. I would say since quarter's end, we've seen upturn both in the tone of the secondary market and, also prospectively, the arbitrage in the primary market. So, yes, I would say, thing have just in the past month or so strengthened across our asset class.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. Last quarter, Joe mentioned that managers have some ability to reinvest even past the end of a CLO's official reinvestment period. And just counting this morning, the positions you're showing in the presentation, it looks like about a third of the portfolio has passed its reinvestment period. So, could you maybe help us understand or describe the parameters that managers have to follow in that situation to continue to invest after the end of the reinvestment period?\nJonathan Cohen: Sure, Mickey. It's essentially a function of the four corners of the indenture itself. But Joe will speak more specifically to that.\nJoe Kupka: Sure. Like Jonathan mentioned, a lot of it depends on the exact tests in the indenture and these vary by manager to manager and even deal by deal, and that's a big part of where we believe we deliver value decomposing those indentures and finding the managers who are able and willing to continue reinvesting. So, it has various tests like weighted average life, work, diversity score, the various OC tests, and they can vary from satisfy at the end of the reinvestment period or maintain or improve. So, there's a wide range, I would say, no deals exactly alike, and that's part of just annualizing the individual deals.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. My last question, there has been some spread tightening, I believe, in CLO liabilities. But looking at the portfolio's average AAA spread at 128, it looks like there's still long ways to go before it's economical to reset most of the portfolio's positions. So, if we don't see more significant spread tightening, then there could be more pressure on Oxford's cash flows as more reinvestment periods end. So, how are you managing that risk without having to take losses in the secondary market to trade out of those positions that are in that predicament?\nJonathan Cohen: Sure. As you say, Mickey, we are an active trader across this asset class. And the issue for us isn't whether we happen to take a loss on a particular position or not, the issue for us is optimizing the portfolio as aggressively as we can for the best possible risk-adjusted return. So, we are, I don't believe, heavily reliant on the assumption of refis or resets across the portfolio. We're looking at cash flows, we're looking at interest income, and we're looking at the prospect and the quantity of likely return of principal. All of those things are set against the arbitrage that exists between the use of proceeds and the cost of capital on a deal by deal basis and our ability and desire to trade out of things and into new things in the secondary market, just as you say.\nMickey Schleien: Okay. Those are all my questions this morning. I appreciate your time. Thank you.\nJonathan Cohen: Thank you, Mickey, very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Bavaria with Inside the Income Factory. Steven, please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nSteven Bavaria: Thanks. Hi, guys. Hey, you're doing a great job, and we're just trying to understand it and explain what's still a pretty complex asset class to a lot of the retail investors. And there's a lot of concern expressed about how your NAV, which, I understand, sometimes can move opposite to your business prospects. I mean, it seems to me like as loans drop on the secondary market to the point where you can then collect at par and reinvest it 92% of par or whatever and then collect again at par when those loans mature, your business prospects probably improve when the loan market drops. At the same time, that your own -- that CLO equity in theory probably drops because their loans are worthless, but their debt is still worth the same. How do you -- am I interpreting that appropriately? And then, when people see that they are earning 17% yields on your very secured distribution at the moment, how much realistically should they regard that as perhaps a certain erosion of NAV that's inevitable over time and how much of that 17% is real sort of total return they get to keep?\nJonathan Cohen: Sure, Steve. Thank you for those questions. As you say very correctly, it's a complex asset class. In terms of our assumption or our presumption about the total return we are looking to receive over an extended period of time, we're not managing across all periods to any specific rate of return. We are looking for the best possible risk-adjusted return, risk-adjusted total return over each period that we're managing to. So, at this moment, we are enjoying the benefit of relatively high cash flows in the secondary market. We are not participating especially actively in the primary market by virtue of the very challenged arbitrage that Mickey referenced in his earlier question, and we're not projecting out any number of years into the future in terms of a targeted total return. Instead, we would focus on how we have done historically. Oxford Lane has been in existence since 2011 and our track record is certainly in the public record, where, I would say, generally enthusiastic about the current state of this market, but this is also a fairly volatile market as you correctly note.\nSteven Bavaria: Got it. Thank you.\nJonathan Cohen: Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Howlett with B. Riley. Matthew, please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Howlett: Hi, good morning, everybody. Hey, Jonathan...\nJonathan Cohen: Good morning, Matt.\nMatthew Howlett: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The core NII, the pickup, if you could just go over what explains the really dramatic pickup in the core net investment income quarter-over-quarter?\nJoe Kupka: Sure, Matt, sure. There were two main components. So just again, when we're looking at this quarter-over-quarter increase, we're mainly comparing the payments in April to the payments in January last quarter. The payments in January were historically depressed, mainly driven by the one-month, three-month LIBOR mismatch basis that we've spoken about a few times. In addition, where our portfolio, in particular, we've also had some first time large payers kick on this quarter, which drove that number up further.\nMatthew Howlett: Got you. When you say [indiscernible] CLO equity is starting to cash flow immediately, when you say first time payers that...\nJoe Kupka: Yeah, either a large position we had purchased in the secondary or a large primary position we had purchased several quarters ago, who have just now finished ramping up and made their first payment.\nMatthew Howlett: Got you. I know you disclosed sort of what's in the ramp process on your presentation. I appreciate that. [And that doesn't] (ph) really move the needle, clearly. My second question is on the credit curve. I mean, you're obviously showing higher debt yields versus equity yields. I mean, I know there's some accounting phenomenon in that. But I mean, what -- is the curve flat here where you could actually go up in credit and pickup yield or up the capital stack and pick up? What are you seeing with the BBs versus equity yields? And how are you playing it?\nJoe Kupka: Yes. So, I think there are two components to that. First, what you see there is the current -- like you said, the GAAP accounting yield, so that's just some function of the accounting standards we apply and it's not necessarily what we project going forward what we could buy out in the market. That said, I believe that credit curve has flattened a bit and we have seen some other equity players move to BBs, for instance, because they can't quite pick up the yield they can in equity, but pick up a definitely elevated yield and BB, for instance. So, I wouldn't say flip, but definitely has compressed if you look at certain tranches.\nJonathan Cohen: Yes, the vast majority of our books, Matt, is still CLO equity. But as you say, we've been looking a bit more carefully at B and BB opportunities.\nMatthew Howlett: Right, exactly. I know it creeped up a little bit the percentage to CLO debt, but it would be interesting to see how that moves going forward. And then, could you just comment, I know you don't give July NAV, you're at last day of the month, but I mean, we've seen a strong rally in the markets here. Is there a sense -- I mean, you gave some numbers in the beginning. I don't know if that was for July, but if any sense of what went on July? I'm assuming the trajectory which your NAV was positive, given the market. Just any sort of handle what you saw in July?\nJonathan Cohen: Sure, Matt. Without commenting on our portfolio or our balance sheet and just speaking to the market, broadly, I would say, in the month of July, the market for CLO equity broadly is probably sort of mid high-single digits.\nMatthew Howlett: For CLO equity that is?\nJonathan Cohen: Yes.\nMatthew Howlett: Great. Thanks -- well, that's interesting. And when will you put up that July NAVs, a week or so from now?\nJonathan Cohen: Hopefully, a bit sooner than that. We'd like to say probably later this week.\nMatthew Howlett: Great. We look forward to that. Thanks, Jon. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJonathan Cohen: All right. Thanks very much, Matt\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. So, I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jonathan Cohen, CEO.\nJonathan Cohen: Operator, thanks very much. We'd like to thank everyone who participated in this call and who listens to the call on replay. We look forward to speaking to you soon. And thank you again for your interest in Oxford Lane. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you everyone for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines."
