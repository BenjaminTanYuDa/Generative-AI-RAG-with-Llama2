I'd like now to turn the call over to Ruy Cunha, CEO.\nRuy Cunha: Thank you, Tigran. Good afternoon, and thanks, everyone for joining. I'll begin by touching upon the overall business landscape and the broader economic context, after which Julian will delve into our financial highlights, and I'll return for some concluding remarks. First, fiscal second quarter 2024 ended in December, Lavoro delivered revenues of US$618 million, marking a 1% increase compared to prior year periods, as volume growth led by market share gains helped to offset continued significant input price deflationary pressures in crop protection and fertilizers across our retail footprint. In our Brazil Ag Retail segment, second quarter volumes for crop protection, fertilizers and specialty products respectively grew 46%, 63%, and 29% year-over-year. The benefits of scale of our platform and strong execution from our commercial team led to another quarter of strong market share gains. Our strategic priorities of attracting seasonal technical sales representatives continue in its momentum. We concluded the second quarter with just over 1,040 RTVs in Brazil, an increase of 25% versus our first quarter. We anticipated positive contribution of these new hires to primarily materialize in our next fiscal year. Crop Care delivered a standout performance in the quarter as revenues and gross profits saw both year-over-year growth of more than 20% in spite of the challenging overall market environment and the adverse impact of El Nino to demand for biologicals in the quarter. Crop Care's share of portfolio consolidated gross profit continue to expand, reaching nearly 24% up from 16% in the prior year is further validates the importance of our vertical integrated business model. Second quarter consolidated gross profit of $103 million and adjusted EBITDA of $40 million decreased 17% and 48%, respectively over the prior year period as the headwinds from the industry-wide input price deflation in crop protection and fertilizers continue to adversely impact our margins. With that said, it's noteworthy to highlight the meaningful sequential improvement in the year-over-year changes to our margins from our first quarter to the second quarter. I'd like to spend a few moments here to explain certain key fundamental drivers to ag input distribution margins, as we had a lot of discussions on these important topic following our last earnings call where we briefly touched on them. Simply put, we generated gross margins by selling our inventory at a certain target markup over cost. The size of the markup depends on the nature of the product category with more technical or specialized products such as biologicals, foliar fertilizers, adjuvants or seeds, commanding premium margins relative to crop protection or fertilizers for instance. There are three critical factors that impact our gross margins. Number one is the price we pay to suppliers to purchase our inputs, which is effectively the COGS embedded in our inventory. Second is the price that we set for farmers, which is a function of localized supply and demand, and which is impacted by things such as weather, farmer profitability and sentiment, relative price competition, et cetera. And third, the overall pricing trend lines, whether inflationary or deflationary environment. This factor plays a role due to the time delay between when we purchase products to build inventory and when we sell our inventory. Our inventory days range between 90 to 130 depending on the seasonality, and there's some variability depending on the product category. In essence, our COGS tend to lag our average sales by three to five months. A deflationary environment acts as a headwind to gross margins so long as the trend line remains intact. For illustrative purpose, one would purchase an inventory at $100 with the goal of selling at $120 around the time of planting. Yet four months later, the prevailing retail price has decreased to $110 or $105. Once pricing flattens out both from suppliers through retailers and retailers through farmers, COGS gradually catch ups to retail prices as the higher cost inventory cycle is over. In a normal market environment, by which I mean an environment where input prices are not declining by 30%, 40% or even 60% year-over-year, such as what we experienced this year, the third factor of pricing tends to play a relatively minor role, which is manageable as farmers start placing purchase orders with retailers mostly in advance and this booking curves built as the crop season unfolds. In contrast, when the deflationary environment is as intense as we have witnessed in the past few quarters, this adverse pressure is difficult to mitigate. Moreover, Brazilian farmers have been uncharacteristically praising orders much close to the point of use, which has diminished the role that bookings and purchase orders played in providing retailers visibility. With all that said, the mechanics I just described will help to explain what is happening with our Brazil Ag Retail business. Our second quarter gross margins in Brazil saw a meaningful sequential improvement in the last year-over-year trends with margins contracting 510 basis points to 13.9% compared to a year-over-year decline of minus 1,070 basis points to 8.7% in our first quarter results. This improvement is largely explained by the mechanics I just described with local input prices from retailers to farmers having broadly stabilized in recent months and as we gradually cycle through our higher cost inventory driving an improvement in our COGS margins are consequently recovering. Sequentially, improvement was most pronounced in the product categories most affected by deflationary trends such as crop protection where second quarter gross margins year-over-year contraction went from minus 1,300 basis points in the first quarter to minus 206 basis points in the second quarter. To conclude, our financial outlook remains unchanged. Our market outlook remains consistent with our assessments in our last earnings call in late January. We continue to foresee a 25% decrease in Brazil's retail input market for 2023, 2024 crop year ending in June 2024. As previously mentioned, local input prices, strong retailers through farmers in Brazil have broadly stabilized through disparities remaining across various regions, influenced by the ongoing destocking of excess agrochemicals inventories. Encouragingly, the accelerated pace of progress of the first soybean harvest combined with recent favorable weather conditions have led to a strong start to safrinha corn planting season, which currently stands at 71% above the five-year average of 52%. Now, with that, I'll pass to Julian for further details on our financial results.\nJulian Garrido: Thanks, Ruy. Good morning, afternoon, good evening, wherever you are. So let's cover our consolidated financial results for this fiscal second quarter 2024 ended on December 31, 2023. So let me start with the revenues. The consolidated revenue for the second quarter rose by 1% to $618.7 million as Ruy have mentioned before. In constant currency terms, the revenue decreased by 5%. The price splitting between inputs revenue and grains revenue, inputs revenue increased 1%, driven by volume growth expansion resulting from market share gain offsetting price declines. The grain revenue resulted an increase of 57%, driven by greater desire of our customers for entering into barter transactions. If I look at the rev by segment, the first segment, Brazil Ag Retail, revenue increased by 1% reflecting the unit volume growth in crop protection, fertilizer, specialty products, seeds, which increased by 46%, 63%, and 29%, respectively. These increases were offset by price deflation and negative product mix across all categories. Notably, due to the impact of El Nino, which decreased the mix of higher technology corn seed varieties and changes in farmers purchasing time, seed product revenue declined by 11% year-on-year. Once again, Lavoro gained share in the quarter, driven by good execution from our local commercial teams. Contribution from recently acquired companies Referencia and Coram together contributed to 6% to the overall revenue growth for the segment. Now taking a look at Latam Ag Retail, the revenue totaled $55.8 million, which is a 2% decrease from previous year of 17% decline in Colombian peso terms. This drop mainly due to challenges in fertilizer and crop protections distribution revenue, along with the lingering effects of discounting Paraquat the herbicide from a supplier product lineup. However, growth in specialty products, seeds and service sales as well as the Colombian peso's appreciation against the U.S. dollar and Brazil real partially offset its revenue declines. Last but not least, Crop Care recorded revenue of $72.8 million in the second quarter 2024, demonstrating a notable 26% increase compared to the prior year. This growth was driven by robust performance with this specialty fertilizer product Integra showing a remarkable 55% increase. Additionally, the recent acquisition of adjuvants and enhancer manufacturer Cromo Química contributed 5% to Crop Care segment revenue for the second quarter 2024. Now let's go and talk about consolidated gross profit. The consolidated gross profit for the quarter decreased by 17% to $103 million, gross margin contracted by 360 basis points to 16.7%, and the main driver was the steep price decline in crop protection and fertilizers in our Brazil Agriculture Retail segment dictated by Ruy before. Latam agriculture retail on the gross margin perspective declined by 230 basis points to 17.8%, driven by compression in crop protection and fertilizer distribution margins. And the gross margins of Crop Care retreated by 160 basis points to 35.3%, primarily due to unfavorable mix effects resulting from the performance of high margin biological products during the quarter. However, the financial contribution from the recently acquired Cromo Química, which has gross margin higher than the Crop Care average helped to offset some of these effects. The adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter 2024 was $40.1 million, down $37.4 million from the prior year quarter, while adjusted EBITDA margin contracted by 48.8% to 6.5%, again primarily influenced by the gross margin compression discussed earlier. The SG&A excluding the depreciation, amortization to sales ratio increased by 300 basis points to 11.3%, mainly due to higher investments as the hiring of new 291 RTVs have yet to contribute to our sales, and we also had the increase in the allowance for expected credit losses resulting from the impact of the El Nino and our expected payment schedule from farmer clients. All three operating segments saw negative year-over-year change in adjusted EBITDA as well as EBITDA. Adjustment items excluded from adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.5 million to $2.4 million for the second quarter 2024, due primarily to higher stock-based compensation expense of $0.5 million and an increase in related party consultancy services expenses in Q2 $0.9 million. Last but not least, the adjusted net profit was $2.6 million, a decline of $34.8 million over the prior year quarter, driven by the lower adjusted EBITDA, higher financial cost of $5.4 million, reflecting higher interest rates on trade payables, and it was partially offset by an increased positive contribution for our income tax. Now I revert back to Ruy.\nRuy Cunha: Thank you, Julian, and thank you all for participating in today's conference call and for your ongoing interest in our company progress. Allow me to highlight some key points from our discussion today. So our second quarter results underscore Lavoro's resilience in the face of challenging market conditions. Our retail operation in Brazil has demonstrated robust year-over-year volume growth even one of the most competitive market environments we have witnessed in over a decade. Similarly, our Colombian operation has also shown a comparable trend with notable gains in market share. Furthermore, our industrial division crop care achieved double-digit growth in both revenues and gross profit compared to previous year. And this growth was primarily driven by strong performances in specialty fertilizers and adjuvants, which offset any temporary setbacks experienced in the biological solution segment. Lavoro's significant volume gains validate the continued interest of farmers in investing in agricultural inputs for the solidifying Lavoro's position as their preferred partner. The confidence expressed by farmers is reinforced by the substantial investments the company is currently making to enhance its sales teams, placing Lavoro in advantageous position to capitalize on the anticipated market recovery. I firmly believe that the current market landscape has the potential to accelerate the ongoing transformation within the agricultural and retail sector in Brazil and South America. In this regard, I'm confident that Lavoro will maintain its prominent role in the market and continue to lead the way in driving positive changes. And with that, I'll come back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bobby Burleson of Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nBobby Burleson: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess the first one is can you just remind us, maybe some of the factors in addition to kind of the planning activity on the safrinha corn that you guys were watching throughout so far in calendar 2024 to decide whether or not you were able to kind of maintain the guidance that you laid out back in January. What were those main kind of things that you were – you guys were looking at?\nRuy Cunha: Hi, Bobby. Thanks for the question. So yes, a few components on that. So first, one of the key elements in driving our vision was the expectation regarding the overall market for this fiscal year. So we continue to see an overall decline in markets above 25%. And this has not changed too much, which was mainly driven by price. We also mentioned that the area of corn in the second crop will see a reduction as well as some expected reduction in productivity that would in consequence also affect farmers' decisions whether to invest in medium technology seed as opposed to higher technology seed. And this is also being confirmed. And also, some tendency to use lower, let's say, level of biological solutions. So I would say largely those were the main facts in addition to the normalization of the retail inventory. So all of that to say that those indicators, they seem to be progressing as we expected. I think on the positive note, we see that, as we mentioned, the planting of safrinha is advancing fast. That means that the time window for farmers through operating safrinha is going to be improving compared to what we expected originally. Okay? So this might encourage some last minute sales, but yet it is difficult to predict if this is going to have a meaningful impact on the sales volumes or not.\nBobby Burleson: Okay, great. And then just as a quick follow-up with the farmer balance sheets in Brazil, and we know that they tend to have healthier balance sheets, but there's definitely some concern on the part of grain traders that bankruptcy filings have increased in the region. And I'm just wondering your customer cohort in the small and medium farmer, how are they kind of positioned relative to where those filings are happening? Is there anything that's changing rapidly in terms of balance sheet health in the area? Thanks.\nJulian Garrido: Yes. So what we saw, Bobby, is that some areas have been more affected by the drought, and I think this obviously had a more negative impact on farmers in Mato Grosso and in Goiás. I think those are the main affected areas. And in some cases with lower productivities, we have some farmers that – particularly those who rent the land, they are close to a breakeven point at this moment. Okay. So I think the most critical areas as Mato Grosso and part of [indiscernible]. With that being said, it's not generalized, is not a generalized problem. And the current expectations for the soy crop is something around 150 million tons, which is – it's still a pretty good number. So I would say in general, farmers should be able to meet their commitments. But yes, we'll see some areas of potential risks. I think another important factor Ruy just mentioned the chapter eleven, some farmers filing for bankruptcy. Indeed the number has increased. It has increased from, I would say, a relatively small number. We will have to look into the next month to see the extent of the problem. But right now, I think, it has not changed our perspective. If anything maybe a little bit better than we expected considering the current soy production. It can be Lavoro, I think all the, let's say, the negative effects related to bad debt provisions is already contemplated in our results. So it does not change the perspectives we have for the year.\nBobby Burleson: Okay. Thank you for that color.\nOperator: Thank you very much. The next question is from Benjamin Theurer of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Theurer: Hi. Good afternoon and evening. Thanks for taking my question. Ruy, wanted to follow-up on the Crop Care business. And just to understand a little bit what you kind of looking into the second fiscal half. We obviously had a very soft first quarter, a nice sequential improvement in 2Q, but still down on a year-over-year basis. Now, normal seasonality, second half tends to be lower in Crop Care than first half. I wanted to understand, like within your guidance parameters, how do you think about Crop Care into the second half, just as you're coming out of this whole destocking environment over the last couple of quarters and what's kind of baked in for the guidance of specific Crop Care? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nRuy Cunha: Okay. Hi, Ben, and thanks for the question. So I think there's two relevant impacts here. The first is a phasing effect, as you mentioned. So we had a very, let's say, slow start in the first quarter, accelerating the second quarter, and we expect further acceleration in the third and fourth quarter. But with that being said, the mix of Crop Care will probably change with lower participation of biologicals than what we had in last year. So the acceleration we'll see in the last quarters of the year is being mostly driven by specialty fertilizers and adjuvant business. Even though, as I mentioned, depending on the scenario of safrinha in the past that eventually occur, we might get some surprises or some positive surprises when it comes to biologics. But I would say overall the expectation for the biologics business this year is to be lower volumes than last year. So it's not only a fading effect. We're going to grow in those other categories, but the growth will partially offset the negative margin headwinds. Okay? So that is our current considerations.\nBenjamin Theurer: Okay. Perfect. And then just quickly as well on the Latin American business, if we could dig in a little deeper into your expectations for the back half and how maybe some of the phenomena you've talked about with El Nino obviously impacting Brazil to a sizeable way, but it also does have an impact on Latam. I just wanted to understand what are the puts and takes here from a – just a Weber pattern and how this could potentially impact the Latam business into the second fiscal half because that was kind of a little bit of an underperformer, I guess, during the quarter as well.\nRuy Cunha: Yes. So Ben, on the Latam business, I think that the dynamic, even though they're subject to the same global trends, I think there's some different aspects to consider. The first one is our Latam business is being able to hold gross margins better than the Brazil retail business. And then the competitive environment is I would say less intense. So we are holding margins a little better. The challenge remains in sales partially driven by price, but is also partially being driven by unfavorable climate conditions that we're having in that region. So right now, we will depend – we expect the second half of the year to be considerably stronger than the first half. But that will also depend on, let's say, some of the climate conditions that are postponing farmers' decisions to buy to be normalized. But we do expect, I would say a stronger second half of the year.\nBenjamin Theurer: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you very much. The next question is from Vincent Anderson of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nVincent Anderson: Yes. Thanks. Good evening, gentlemen. I was just hoping to kind of get an update on how you feel about your sales staff. You hired a lot, but I'm curious how you're tracking against your three-year ramp up algorithm. And then just remind me how the performance compensation metrics work for them between revenues, volumes and gross profit dollars?\nJulian Garrido: Hi, Vincent. We're executing our hiring. According to plan actually, I think we're even with better performance than we expected in the last month. So we saw a significant growth in the last quarter. But I'll say largely in line with what we expected to bring in new sales teams. Most of them – I mean, the compensation structure in the market is fairly standard. So we have I would say relatively low fixed salary, but then you have a relatively larger variable compensation, which is a proxy, something around 1% of their sales. Okay? What we expect is, I mean, some of those guys are already having a positive impact in sales, I would say mostly in safrinha. But the full benefit will only be achieved next year, right, with the full-year of working with us. I think the interesting thing is also that we're trying to hire experienced sales consultants, and we're being able to bring consultants with a very large potential order book with them. And those experienced sales consultants, they tend to be much more productive than the new ones, right? So usually takes between three to four years to have a sales consultant fully operational or to the maximum capacity. And many of those guys that are bringing right now, they're already experienced and they're already operating the region that they've been working on. So I think that we may experience, I would say, accelerated growth coming from those new sales guys in the next year.\nVincent Anderson: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then my other question was just, I'm trying to get a feel for your pricing model in these kinds of market conditions in terms of how you are able to monitor prices across all the growing regions you sell to and coordinate price and margin targets kind of from a centralized position down to your individual locations? Or is it still mostly a bottoms up effort and these individual locations are loosely held to a goal of some kind?\nJulian Garrido: Yes. So we have – so in the way that we are organized, I'll say in Brazil, but it's also valid for Colombia. So we have a decentralized pricing decisions because we need to be mindful of the right pricing being performed at the market. So we have Brazil divided in clusters, and we have three major clusters in Brazil, North, South and East. And each one of those clusters, they have specialized marketing and pricing teams that are fully dedicated to looking to the overall farm gate price being performance by product. And then with that – and based on that, taking our price and markup decisions. So I'd say it's decentralized to the points that we need to have adequate pricing levels to where we compete. And then on the COGS side, I would say, it's probably more centralized because then we also need to leverage our scale and ability to discuss margin recomposition with suppliers at a central level, right? So we try to maximize that by combining our negotiations with suppliers on a central level and then taking tactical pricing decisions at the regional level.\nVincent Anderson: Okay. All right. No, that's helpful. I was trying to get a feel for when you have these kinds of price movements, if there's a mechanism to communicate that individual location should not sell below a certain price or anything like that. But what you described sounds pretty robust and I appreciate that detail.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to management for some closing remarks.\nRuy Cunha: Okay. Again, thank you all for your participation in the meeting. Again, I think once again, the company has shown the resilience of this platform. We're very excited about the second half of the year. We continue to be strong believers in the fundamentals of the Brazilian and the South American markets. And we'll keep you posted in new development. But right now, I think we're tracking in line with what we have already projected that's planned for this year. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that then concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect your line."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Tigran Karapetian, Investor Relations for Lavaro. Thank you. You may begin.\nTigran Karapetian: Thank you for joining us today on Lavaro's fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings conference call or results ended September 2023.

Please refer to today's release for a reconciliation of non-IFRS financial measures to the most comparable measures prepared in accordance with the IFRS. I'd like to now turn the call over to Ruy Cunha, CEO.\nRuy Cunha: Thank you, Tigran. I'll begin by touching upon the overall business landscape and the broader economic context, after which Julian will delve into our financial highlights. And then I will return for some concluding remarks. So, on our last quarter for our first quarter 2024 ended in September, Lavoro delivered revenues of $483 million, up 11% year-over-year, and up 3% in current local terms. Adjusted EBITDA was $11 million, declining 75% over the previous year quarter. Our revenue grew in the quarter in spite of the intense industry-wide deflationary pressures felt across major product categories, a strong volume growth led to market share gains, as well as currency tailwinds and growth in grains revenues more than offset the 40% to 50% average price declines in crop protection and fertilizer in Brazil. These deflationary pressures were a headwind to our profitability, in particular to ag retail in Brazil segments, where gross margins contracted by 10.7% compared to previous year to reach 8.7%. It translated to Lavoro’s adjusted EBITDA margins compressed to 2.3%. Now let me take a moment to update you on the market environment. Since our last update, we saw an emergence of a disruptive El Nino phenomenon in Brazil. Severe drought conditions in many producing states, including Mato Grosso have caused delays in planting of the soybean crops and created challenges for the next crop as well. We now expect these to adversely impact the second corn crop with reduced planted acers, as well as seeing a portion of farmers opt for medium-tech corn seeds over high-tech alternatives, as well as curtail investment in specialty inputs such as biological solutions. We anticipate this impact to our second and third quarter results, both in Brazil ag retail segment, as well as crop care segments. Next, let me provide you with some brief updates on our distribution margins recovery. In our last earnings call we briefly explained on the effect that ag input prices variations have on our distribution margins. As a reminder, we explained that as a markup business, we are relatively agnostic to absolute price levels of inputs over time, so long as they remain relatively stable. When prices are in an uptrend or downward trend, our distribution margins are temporarily impacted, given the three to four months inventory days causing the delay between COGS and average sales price adjusting. I refer to this as temporary given the fact that this trend eventually dissipates. Naturally, inventory turnover causes the inventory COGS to catch up to sales price and distribution margins reverts to normalize -- to their normal average. So this in a sense what occurs is a normal environment when our margins are relatively stable. What is unusual about the last 12 months in Brazil is that, the sheer steepness of the deflationary trend with crop protection and fertilizer prices declining 40% to 60% year-over-year over multiple quarters is a pressure that ag retail industry has not experienced since 2014. While our distribution margins for fertilizer and crop protection have indeed been gradually recovering, the pace of the improvement thus far has been below what we have expected. The destocking of excess agrochemical inventories is taking longer than expected. With all that said, we're updating our financial guidance to reflect the unanticipated impact of El Nino, as well as the slower recovery in distribution margins. We are now forecasting adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $80 million to $110 million, while our guidance for revenue remains unchanged. With that, let me turn to Julian for some details on our financials.\nJulian Garrido: Thanks, Ruy. I'll begin by covering our consolidated financial results for the fiscal first quarter 2024, which ended on September 30, 2023, and providing additional details regarding our revised full year fiscal 2024 guidance. Let me start with the first quarter. Consolidated revenue grows by 11% to $483 million, as Ruy have mentioned. In constant currency terms, the revenue increase was 3%. The inputs revenue increased 5%, with volume growth more than offsetting price declines. Grains revenue increased 109%, driven by a greater desire by our customers for entering barter transactions. Looking at revenue by segment, Brazil retail saw revenue increasing by 15%, reflecting the improved sales volumes of crop protection, fertilizers, and specialty product categories, which increased 54%, 53%, and 33%, respectively. This more than offset the decline in average sales price that we elaborated on before. Lavoro gained share in the quarter, driven by good execution from our local commercial teams. The contribution from recently acquired Referencia in the south of Brazil contributed roughly 2% of the overall revenue growth for the segment. Now talking about the Latam retail revenue, it decreased by 1%, 9% in Colombian Peso terms relative to the prior quarter, landing at $66.3 million. The decline was probably driven by the pricing headwinds to fertilizers, as well as supply shortages of corn seeds from our key supplier, which resulted in loss revenue opportunity amounting to just under $2 million for the quarter. Actions have already been put in place to add new suppliers to mitigate impact for the rest of the year. In addition, our Latam business continue to suffer from the impact of the [rupture] (ph) of supply of Paraquat, the top leading herbicide in Colombia, from our key supplier. The year-over-year headwind from Paraquat amounted to just over $2 million in the quarter and is expected to continue impacting the results for the next two quarters. Crop care revenue decreased by 1% to $35.7 million, tuned by a sharp decline in revenue for Perterra due to price declines in agrochemicals. As a reminder, Perterra is the crop care subsidiary that imports off-patent agrochemicals from Asia with Lavoro’s Brasil retail as the customer. An additional detractor in the quarter was Agrobiologica, which faced headwinds from delays in farmers' purchases or decisions making, which pushed revenue out to future quarters. Of setting the year over the impact of this was the new M&A contribution from Cromo Quimica, a manufacturer an adjuvant acquired in Q4, as well as double-digit growth for Union Agro, our specialty fertilizer manufacturing subsidiary. Consolidated gross profit for the quarter decreased by 34% to $59.5 million, gross margin contracted by a 850 basis points to 12.3%. The main driver was the steep price decline in crop protection and fertilizers in our Brazil agriculture retail segment, dictated by Ruy. Latam agriculture retail saw its gross margin decline by 50 basis points to 13.8%, as we had mentioned, driven by the compression in crop protection distribution margin, as well as a negative product category mixed shift, this high margin seed distribution was tempered by previously mentioned product shortage. Crop care gross margin [indiscernible] by 3.3% to 43.3%, driven by a lower margin at Perterra, as we mentioned, due to agrochemical price declines, and negative product mix shift at Union Agro, while higher margin soil fertilizer product face time shift from delayed farm decision making. These effects were partially offset by the financial contribution from the newly acquired Cromo Quimica, which boosts gross margins more than Crop Care average as we expected. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 was $11.1 million down, $32.9 million from the prior quarter. While Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 7.9% to 2.3%, chiefly driven by the impact of gross margin compression [indiscernible]. Now SG&A to sales ratio remain constant at 11.9% of sales, less higher consulting and legal expense related to Lavoro's public company expenses, as well as increasing allowance for expected credit losses due to the impact of El Nino on our expected [FIAGROquota] (ph) payment schedules, were offset by the new initiatives charging low overhead expenses. All three operation segments saw negative year-over-year change in adjusted EBITDA, as well as adjusted EBITDA margin. No recurring expenses excluded from adjusted EBITDA increased by $5.4 million to $8.5 million in Q1 2024. Due to, number one, M&A accounting and tax due diligence expenses $0.9 million, which includes a one-time [deal break] (ph) fee related to NS Agro, resulting from suspending our plans to acquire them. Second, the provision of the second half of the DeSPAC bonus to employees that will be paid in Q3 2024, $1.3 million. And last, related party consultancy services expenses, recognized as non-recurring $2.3 million and the increase of $1.3 million amortization of the fair value of inventories sold from acquired companies, which relates to purchase accounts. Having said that, I'll pass the ball back to Ruy.\nRuy Cunha: Thank you, Julien. And now I'll move to my concluding remarks. Guys, we’re living in a very unusual situation in the global ag markets, but particularly in Brazil. Even though grain prices and ag input price adjustments are normal and expected the intensity of some of those movements was not seen in the last decade, given the high inventory levels carried by retailers. On top of that, we had the severe impact from El Nino that created additional challenges to farmers. In this context, Lavoro is acting to mitigate short-term impacts in our results, and at the same time, we are positioning the company to capitalize on the expected market recovery. Lavoro has gained market share in the first quarter and hired new experienced RTVs that can bring potential new sales of more than $100 million for the next fiscal year. The market scenario is temporary and will improve as the secular trends and strong fundamentals of Latam agriculture have not changed. When this occurs, Lavoro will be in an even better position to deliver strong results and further consolidate our leadership position. And with that, I’ll turn to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bobby Burleson with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question.\nBobby Burleson: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So I guess maybe just starting with the share gain efforts that you highlighted. This is a tough market obviously in Brazil, but you guys are working to kind of accelerate those share gains. I'm curious, your position in the market versus other players and how that might advantage you in some ways? And maybe just expand on the efforts underway to drive share gain.\nRuy Cunha: Hi, Bob. Thanks for the question. Yes, absolutely. We're actually accelerating our share gain through some actions that include, as I mentioned, the hiring of experienced sales consultants that -- in this more challenging scenario, they see the opportunity of joining a company that is more solid and with higher growth perspectives. So we have been very successful in attracting new RTVs, as well as we have been achieving a very low level of attrition between our current RTVs. So I think this is a first key component of that. In addition to this, we have been very successful in also preparing our logistics to deliver products to clients and to take orders in the last minute as farmers were not taking the same approach as previous years of placing orders in advance. So we've managed to present the very strong volume growth that Julian has mentioned by being better prepared to supply these last-minute orders and we plan to continue doing so. So I think there's a combination of factors, but in the end, it's related to our strong position to serve this market.\nBobby Burleson: Okay. Great. And then just quickly on the comparison to 2014. I guess this is the worst environment you've seen since. And I'm wondering maybe just contrast the way things unfolded in terms of recovery from 2014 versus the way things are positioned to recover, in your opinion, from this current situation?\nRuy Cunha: Yes, I think, Bobby, the difference between the current scenario in 2014 is that: first, the magnitude of the change in prices were not even that close. So we have a, let’s say, higher intensity of price changes in this time, particularly in the fertilizers and herbicides. And I think another point that is important is that, the inventory on the retail channel is at a much higher level this time, because retailers were preparing for shortage of products. So what may be different this time is the pace of which the retail comes back to normal inventory levels and the situation of the overall market normalize. So it will be a, I’d say, slower recovery this time and it’s definitely slower than what we have anticipated. We see early signs of improvement, so we see improvements in the level of inventories, we see farmers already planning for the next crops, but I think the timing will be longer this time.\nBobby Burleson: Okay. Super helpful.\nTigran Karapetian: And Bobby, if I may just add a couple of points. I think just contrasting 2014 and this cycle. This cycle, you had effectively a number of unrelated, whether geopolitical or pandemic-related events occur, and El Nino being the latest one. That were not really related to the market, to the supply and demand for these products, just hit all at the same time. 2014, the decline then was driven by kind of the hangover from the ethanol mandate in the US. So it was more of a supply and demand question. Here, as far as inputs are concerned, it's sort of reverting to the mean after the post-pandemic shock to the system. Now, a couple of things that are different is that, as far as Brazilian farmers are concerned, they're in excellent shape. In fact, even despite these headwinds, their margins are still double digits. And they will see a recovery next year once a lot of these trends dissipate and normalize. So that's a couple of things just for you to think about as you compare those two cycles.\nBobby Burleson: Okay. Thanks Tigran. Thanks, Ruy. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ben, your line is live. You have your line on mute. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Anderson with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Anderson: Yes, thanks. Good evening, guys. So I just wanted to dig into the biologicals component of the guidance. I know you're starting up new capacity, so maybe there's some fixed cost absorption there that you're not getting in this revised guidance. But maybe beyond that, can you talk about the revised expectations between repeat customers that are not buying versus just pace of adoption being slower in this market environment?\nRuy Cunha: Hi, Vincent, I think I can start and then [indiscernible] can compliment you. So, first thing, the short-term impact on the biological solution is related to the fact that farmers are more skeptical to invest now in the corn crop. So we have lower expected margins for the second crop and we have also a shorter time window for this crop as the soy crop got delayed, so we get higher risks for them to invest. So I think the level of adoption of biological solutions in the corn crop this time will be lower than in the previous year. So this is what is reflected in our guidance. I don't think this is -- again, it's not a structural change, but it's something that will affect the next corn crop. Regarding our new facility, we have the facility ready. We will not initiate production on the new facility until August. So we will most likely postpone some of the additional costs related to initiating this operation. And we expect the market to normalize and then we will eventually accelerate again. So I think it's a temporary thing that we'll face over the next months.\nVincent Anderson: That's helpful, thanks. And then just maybe going back to guidance as a whole, just to help frame your decision making process. The drought obviously has been developing for a couple of months now. Internationally fertilizer prices have been falling for a while now. So I'm trying to just understand where the tipping point was in terms of your expectations on the year. And is it just as simple as you had to make volume commitments before you were certain corn would be delayed? Or is there something else that I'm missing?\nRuy Cunha: So I think compared to our last discussion, some of the things that have changed, first is the fact that we expect some of the margins on the inputs to be improving and prices, not prices from suppliers to retailers, but end prices to farmers to be recovering faster. So one thing that we observed is that, given the competitive scenario in the market, we continue to see prices at very low and unusual levels from retailers to farmers. Another thing that has caused this concern is what Tigran has just mentioned on the climate events, particularly the El Nino implications. And we saw the situation getting worse as both the soy crop was affected in terms of replanting. So farmers were planting and then they have eventually to replant some of the soy and also the shrinkage of time -- window time for the safrinha. So I think those were the main changes. So basically the markets -- we continue to believe that the markets will recover and the challenges are temporary, but the pace is just different based on what I just described.\nVincent Anderson: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just one last one on kind of just Brazil in general, because the US doesn't have two growing seasons. So I don't have a good comparison. But is the Brazilian farmer -- is there an opportunity right now for a Brazilian farmer who's looking at a very difficult safrinha corn environment to then sell them more product to maximize soybean yields or have most of the opportunities to do kind of in season adjustments to things like nutrient levels or biologicals, has that window largely passed?\nTigran Karapetian: Vincent, the way to think about it is the reason why the delayed planting and harvesting of soybean is impacting the safrinha, which may not be super obvious at first. But effectively, there's a window when you start planting the safrinha, typically early to mid-Feb all the way to early March. And the reason why you want to plant then is because the more drought-like or potential for drought-like conditions in Brazil in general kick in in April, May, and you don't want your seedlings to be in the growth phases when those things happen. And so, what happens when you have a delayed planting for the safrinha is you increase the risk. The farmer has a higher risk of facing yield challenges. And therefore, what they're doing is either they're doing what they did last year, so they keep planting exactly like they did last year, or they're downgrading technology in terms of medium technology for the seed, or they are shifting their crop type to other types, whether it's beans or sorghum or other types. And those obviously also have potential for demand for agrochemicals. But from our standpoint, what's impacting us more so is the corn seed business for us, which is a higher margin in agrochemicals and fertilizers.\nVincent Anderson: Right. Yes, what I was getting at is, a farmer facing that likelihood. Does it change their purchasing behaviors on the soy that's already in the ground? But it sounds like the impact of corn just outweighs any opportunity for incremental sales into the current soybean crop that is causing the delay.\nTigran Karapetian: Yes, that's probably a good assumption.\nVincent Anderson: Okay. All right. Well, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Wright with ROTH. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Wright: Thanks. Good afternoon. [indiscernible] a little bit of how to think about the issue between a medium tech seed environment per safrinha versus your kind of view per planted hectare. So how to think about the relevant impact or the magnitude of the impact on each of those on your outlook?\nTigran Karapetian: I would say it's a couple of things. A part of it is the downgrading. A part of it is just less acres. We went from, I think, early November [indiscernible] and some of the consultancies were forecasting acres to be anywhere between minus 2 to plus 5. I think now the consensus is more like anywhere between minus 10 and minus 3. So it's sort of shifted. And it's also impacting our crop care business in the sense that our biologicals -- Agrobiologica does sell bioinsecticides for the corn for certain insects and we expect that to be a headwind as a result of -- what's going on in safrinha. Now the reality is, there's still a couple weeks left and so we took, I would say, an approach of not guessing and sort of taking what we thought was a scenario that's likely and rather than wait, there's chances that the acres actually end up being better than we expect, but we didn't want to take a chance.\nBrian Wright: Okay. So it sounds like you're kind of thinking more along, like, did this outlook is kind of more predicated on a minus 10 on acres than the minus 3, or is that the range you're kind of thinking as far as what you're predicating things on?\nTigran Karapetian: Brian, yes. I think more important than the reduction in acres here is the assumption behind the level of technification that farmers will want to apply in the corn crop. This is actually more impactful to the overall retail results, right? So we basically believe that they may be trading down some seeds in the sense that using lower technology seeds and also lower application of biological solutions. It's not as much as the reduction in area that, as Tigran mentioned, there's still not a consensus in this market, but I think there's an overall consensus that farmers will be more cautious this year with those types of technology investments.\nBrian Wright: Okay, No, thank you. If I could ask you one more just on -- the press release has talked about ways to go on the de-stocking and just like -- and how to weigh it and you also mentioned the fertilizer, but just maybe how to think about relative impact. Is it more fertilizer, more crop protection on the destocking or like you just help us figure out the relative importance of those?\nRuy Cunha: The crop protection is the most important category in the destocking process now. So I think fertilizers, they had an impact, but looking forward, the most important category to be looking at is the level of destocking of herbicides, fungicides and insecticides. So this is what we expect to see normalization over the next months.\nBrian Wright: Okay, and I just want to make sure, I've read -- so I'm recalling the press release correctly that the thought process is, by the end of March kind of time frame? Is the kind of view on the substantially complete on the destocking or is that a fair characterization?\nTigran Karapetian: Brian, I think it's hard to say. I mean, certainly, some of the data that we've been hearing from consultancies that run surveys suggest that, as of December, we're probably two thirds along the way. But to be quite honest, the data is really hard to get. And we'll really see it when we see prices at the farm gate, as Ruy mentioned, start to recover. And then that will be really the real leading indicator. And we've yet to see a meaningful reversal or uptrend. It's sort of been bouncing around in a range bound way. Skew by skew is different, but generally speaking, it's sort of stabilizing. It's been bouncing around for the last couple of months.\nBrian Wright: Okay, thank you so much.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Ben Theurer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. Ben, your line is live.\nBen Theurer: Okay. Does this work? Can you hear me? Hello?\nRuy Cunha: Now we can hear you.\nBen Theurer: Oh, finally, we got this done, technology. First of all, thank you very much for squeezing me in at the end. I had a few technical issues. So two things I wanted to ask. First of all, as you look into it, I mean, obviously the data we just got is ending September and late January. But as we think about the whole ag chem destocking that's been an issue in Brazil and all this high inventory we've talked about. So what's like your kind of like your best guess with that softened outlook that we're going to get through this. Is that still going to last one, two, or even more quarters than that? So, anything that you have from off the ground information, that would be my very first question. I'm not sure if you've answered this already, but I got lost, so hopefully you can help me out on that. And thank you very much for that.\nRuy Cunha: Ben, I think we mentioned that right now it's hard to predict. What I can say is that, we have some lead indicators that show that the level of inventory is improving. So when you compare the levels of inventory of retailers in January last year to December last year, we saw a decline back towards, I would say, more normal levels. The thing is that, it's hard to predict if the normalization is going to occur between three months or six months. I think right now we're going to have to see the development of safrinha, as well as farmers' intentions on starting the new season, whether it's going to be delayed or if they're going to advance some of their purchases. So I would say we should see at least three months of this process of destocking by what the local consultants say with the possibility of extending a couple of months more.\nBen Theurer: Okay, perfect. And then just for understanding reasons, because it's been a while that we had El Nino. You've mentioned it as having had an impact. Does that work to last a little longer in a similar situation as we had in El Nino for a couple of years prevailing? If we were to assume a similar scenario, can you frame or help us understand what the market dynamics would be and how that would impact your business just from I guess historic context that used to be in the past and how we should think about the impact going forward under the assumption that El Nino is going to last?\nTigran Karapetian: Yes, I mean, Ben, always difficult to predict headache events. But I would say relative to the historical data, this has been a particularly severe El Nino. Just to give you one indicator, the percentage of soybeans that had to be replanted in Brazil, so basically that to scrap and replant it all together was between 5% and 6%, which is 4 times to 5 times higher than normal. That's a fairly large area. Obviously that's another atypical thing, after the series of atypical things happening this year. But we can't, obviously, predict what's going to happen next year with the El Nino, but I would say relative to historical El Nino, this one has definitely been on the severe side.\nBen Theurer: Perfect. Well, thank you very much and good luck with what is left over here.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks. Ruy Cunha So I think we covered most of the topics already. Maybe the last comment from my side is, I mean, it became very clear all the challenges, but we're also, I think it's important to say that this crisis is also an opportunity for Lavoro to further consolidate its leadership position. The company's solid fundamentals will actually act in our favor. So this moment is a good moment for us to continue expanding market share. We will continue to invest in the acquisition of new clients. And we expect to bring some news for the next quarter based on our continued investments in the market. Thank you all for participating and I will be all available for further questions if you need. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."
