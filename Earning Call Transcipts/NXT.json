And now, I will turn the call over to our CEO and Founder. Dan?\nDaniel Shugar: Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to our third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We start this call by noting how thrilled we are to be a fully independent public company after successful separation from Flex in early January. We are appreciative of our time with Flex, in eight year combination that exceeded its goals related to our growth and global expansion. And we sincerely thank the six outgoing board members, all Flex executives for their service. We're also excited to welcome Julie Blunden and Howard Wanger to our Board, further strengthening our directors deep domain expertise in solar, storage and public companies. Let's focus on Q3 results. This was another strong quarter and our fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth, resulting in record revenue, profit and backlog. Q3 demonstrated ongoing momentum for Nextracker in the solar industry. Our revenue grew 38% year-over-year to exceed $700 million. And our adjusted EBITDA accelerated to a $168 million. It's noteworthy that we've doubled our adjusted EBITDA in the last 12 months. The significant top line and profit expansion was the result of our solid execution, further optimization of our re-architected supply chain and continued rigor and pricing discipline. Our reported $168 million of adjusted EBITDA does not include the anticipated 45X tax benefits which are expected to further increase earnings. Q3's performance was driven by exceptionally high deliveries in our U.S. business growing 70% year-over-year. We also highlight our international expansion progress by celebrating the 10 gigawatt milestone we reached in the Middle East, India and Africa. We have long-term and proven track record in these regions. Where in some cases, we have the advantage of first market mover. Our differentiated product reliability and extreme weather and ability to deliver large volumes scale are well understood by customers. Recently, we have booked significant orders and have tracker fleets operating in India, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Africa. To serve our growing demand, we keep expanding our global supplier footprint. In total, we now have over 70 major supply chain partners across five continents. Our new contract bookings continue at a healthy pace, both domestically and overseas. This resulted in a new record backlog significantly exceeding $3 billion. With strong demand and record backlog year-to-date, we are increasing guidance. We are raising the midpoint of our previous annual revenue and profit guidance by approximately $100 million and $73 million respectively. For the full fiscal year, our new revenue target is $2.45 billion and our new EBITDA target is $488 million at the mid points. This is the third consecutive quarter we've raised our revenue and profit guidance. We achieved this growth by focusing on innovation, customers, execution and our team, delivering over 90 gigawatts since inception. Based on our strong growth profile supported by healthy profitability and ample liquidity, we've continued to increase our investments in R&D with emphasis on technology that lowers the levelized cost of solar energy for our customers. The additional R&D investments we've made have accelerated the time-to-market for new products and allows us to maintain market leadership. In Q3, we bolstered our overall patent portfolio, both organically and through strategic investments. We now have over 500 patents issued and pending at the end of the quarter. Last September, we launched our next generation technology suite with three innovations, extreme terrain tracker XTR 1.5 Hail Pro and NX Horizon and Zonal diffused for to capture. All of these innovations are either operating in the field today are under contract to be delivered to customer projects later this year. We will now speak to the short and long-term dynamics in the market. Starting with the United States. As covered on our previous calls, there are multiple headwinds and tailwinds impacting solar development velocity. Headwinds including interconnection backlog permitting delays in equipment shortages are real and can impact any specific project EPC or developer. But in totality, the combination of new entrants in both developers and EPCs and the increasing number of projects in their portfolios has allowed the market to continue expanding. Solar panel availability in the United States has improved significantly over recent quarters. And as things stand today, we are not seeing panel availability as a first order problem in the market. There are however multiple trade proceedings pending which could impact panel imports from certain geographies into the U.S. We will need to see how this evolves over time to determine any potential impact. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association, at the one year anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA, 85 gigawatts of new U.S. solar module manufacturing capacity had been announced, which inspires confidence, the power availability will be systemically addressed in the coming years. Overseas, some of the headwinds noted above also exist that are typically less severe than the U.S. And globally, falling solar panel pricing has enabled the economics of projects to continue improving and markets in general to continue expanding. Longer-term, we believe it's insightful to consider both the accelerating need for new power in combination with retiring legacy power generation assets. Focusing on the U.S., power generation requirements grew modestly from 2007 through 2022 at about 1% annual increase. Over the last few years however, energy usage has increased dramatically driven by growth and data centers, electrification of appliances and transportation and reindustrialization across the United States. At the same time there has been a significant retirement of legacy power plants. The combination of these factors has caused the U.S. Energy Information Administration to forecast a 5% annual increase need for new power generation capacity in the grid over the next five years. The result is that almost 300 gigawatts of new power plants are needed over the next five years and about 500 gigawatts of new power is needed over the next decade. Where is this massive amount of new power going will come from? The U.S. CIA historically very conservative on renewables is forecasting that solar and wind power will comprise the vast majority of new power generation. Solar is expected to have a 26% compound annual growth over the next five years and within 10 years be the number one source of electric generation in the United States comprising almost a quarter of all electric energy. Naysayers point to the intermittency of renewable power as an impediment to its large scale adoption in the grid. We believe this issue will improve. Sharp decreases in battery costs have enable steep ramping of battery storage, power plants in the grid both co-located with renewable power and standalone project. Battery power increased five-fold in the last two years to 15 gigawatts, operating in the USA today. And batteries are expected to triple again to about 50 gigawatts by 2026. Many battery systems have four hours of storage today which pairs well with the solar tracker plant which together provide from power through the evening peaks. Nextracker is very well-positioned to continue driving utility scale on distributed generation as the world transitions to renewable energy with solar leading the charge. We are the skeletal system for the solar power ecosystem. With over two million tracker systems shipped to more than 30 countries, we're the global market leader in trackers and a preferred partner for Tier 1 owners, developers in EPCs. And equally important, we appreciate our customers and their guidance on our products. We listen and respond to customer requirements with operational excellence and uncompromising quality. Now I'll turn the call over to Howard Wenger, our President to expand on our commercial progress and product innovation.\nHoward Wenger: Thank you, Dan. Q3 was another successful quarter delivering multiple proof points that our products are differentiated and our team continues to execute on fulfilling customer requirements. It's been an amazing journey as we have scaled Nextracker's revenue to over $700 million this quarter. In just a short two year span, we've more than doubled our quarterly revenue while increasing profitability. Our proactive investments are paying off. We have invested in innovation, increasing our technology lead. We've implemented a regional strategy to further enable international expansion. And we have successfully deployed a strategic pivot to localize our U.S. supply chain which is in full flight. The U.S. remains our largest served market representing 78% of total Q3 revenue. This is a higher percentage than in previous reported quarters. However, we expect our revenue mix to continue to be approximately two-thirds U.S. and one-third international for the full fiscal year '24. We did have some delays of projects in the quarter but this was more than offset by other projects pulling in ahead. As our team continued to focus on customer needs and delivery requests. The international business performed as expected with our EMEA region leading the way with project deliveries in Middle East, India and Africa. We are very pleased with our global supply chain and project management teams as they continue to collaborate with customers worldwide. Establishing local supply has further optimized our offering and provides even more reliability, improving execution on multiple continents to achieve on-time delivery for our customers. Let me now provide some details on our new Q3 bookings. Overall, we are seeing continued strong demand. We had another excellent quarter for new business with a book-to-bill ratio greater than one. Our backlog increased quarter-over-quarter to a new record and remained significantly over $3 billion. In the U.S., Q3 bookings were diversely represented across the country where we continue to win under a wide range of conditions and terrains. We executed a healthy mix of new EPC contracts and volume commitment agreements or BCA's in the quarter. We believe our continued sales strength reflects Nextracker's superiority across multiple dimensions that matter most to discerning customers. This includes product performance and capability, quality and reliability, service offering, track record, our team and execution and customer focus. This catalog of positive attributes earned over many years translates into what we believe is the most bankable product with the lowest levelized cost of energy for large scale solar power. We also now have a robust U.S. manufacturing capability that is enabling us to deliver domestic content our customers want. As well as providing scalable capacity to allow for future growth. As for the IRA and the impact of waiting for treasury clarifications, the upshot is that we are not seeing a significant impact on U.S. project deliveries or on new bookings. Customers and projects are transacting. And as we have outlined in previous earnings calls, we continue to see positive demand activities as our backlog continues to grow. Let's now turn to our international bookings. In Q3, we signed customer contracts across several international regions, notably in India, Australia, Saudi Arabia and Spain. We've also added new countries to our list, such as South Africa, New Zealand and even Sweden, which is not considered a traditional solar market but reflects improving economics driven by recent solar technology developments such as Bifacial Solar Panels and Nextracker TrueCapture Technology. As you heard from Dan, we achieved the milestone of 10 gigawatts of operating in contracted systems in our EMEA region comprise of Middle East, India and Africa. Our deep relationships and already established track-record of superior solar performance matter greatly to customers in these regions. As we deploy our regional strategy, we have more boots on the ground to scale. But more importantly, we lead with product quality and reliability, our world class wind engineering and performance coupled with our high quality and durable components such as batteries, motors and fasteners. While we believe it's early days in our global expansion, we've been fast movers and are the leading solar tracker platform in many countries. And we have increasing opportunities to further invest and mobilize to address and grow in these significant markets. As Dan noted, we are constantly monitoring headwinds and tailwinds for our business as we navigate the company forward. We continue to see on balance and net positive trend and we are in a strong position going forward. We do want to acknowledge that some of our shipments are being rerouted due to the Red Sea and Suez Canal conflict which does have an impact on some deliveries and costs and potentially revenue recognition. We have factored this into our guidance. While we don't see a material impact today, we are closely monitoring the situation and we continue to make the adjustments needed to minimize the impact to our customers. I'd like to briefly discuss pricing. Solar trackers are not commodity products, but are highly engineered for site specific conditions such as soils and foundation requirements, topography, wind speeds, panel type and local permit needs, codes and standards. As such, costs and pricing are specific to each and every project and very from site to site, region to region and customer to customer. Also I want to point out, there is a significant lag time of multiple quarters between ASP or average sales price at the time of booking versus the revenue per watt that is often used as a proxy for ASP. That said, on an aggregate basis worldwide for Q3 and for the majority of last year, our ASP has been relatively stable. Our margin strength is in part a result of our continued rigor in pricing discipline. But even more so it's driven by a differentiated superior product and service offering in our ability to deliver what we believe offers the lowest LCOE and highest financial returns for our customers. We do not chase business. And finally, let me wrap up with a quick update on our continued hardware and software innovation. We are having tremendous success with our NX Horizon tracker products as well as increasing traction for both of our XTR and Hail Pro product lines. As we increase project installations of these products in a wider variety of terrains and weather conditions, we are expanding use cases for Nextracker. Q3 sales and installation of TrueCapture increase both sequentially and year-over-year. TrueCapture is our intelligence self-adjusting tracker software that integrates with our patent and electronic controller to help maximize solar power production. It operates automatically with no user intervention. TrueCapture is a differentiated software platform and enhances our overall offering. We are seeing increasing adoption as our customers see the value add by boosting energy gains and enhancing their financial returns. We will continue our R&D investments to accelerate innovation and time to market for new products. We recently-announced new product innovations that leverage inherent features of our flagship NX Horizon smart solar tracking system. We are making good progress in Hail Pro and Hail Pro 75, XTR 1.5 and enhancements to TrueCapture including Zonal diffuse. All of these innovations are either operating in the field today. We're scheduled to be delivered to customer projects later this year. We will be reporting on our progress in the quarters ahead. In summary, we are very proud of the team's execution and accomplishments in the quarter. We just celebrated our 10 year anniversary and we are energized and ready for more, as the world transitions to renewable energy. Now, let me turn the call over to Dave Bennett, our Chief Financial Officer to review financials. Dave?\nDavid Bennett: Thank you, Howard. Before I start, I'd like to remind everyone that all references to financial metrics except for revenue are non-GAAP adjusted and all growth rates are year-over-year unless otherwise stated. Please note, our Q3 results exclude any benefit from the IRA 45X tax credits related to tracker components. Q3 was another record quarter. Delivering double digit growth for both top and bottom line. And our fourth consecutive quarter of growth since the IPO. Q3 revenue closed at $710 million up 38% driven by a 70% increase in the U.S. market, offset by a decline of 17% in the rest of the world. Q3 revenue mix was 78% and 22% respectively. We saw a material uptick to U.S. revenue, primarily due to strong execution from our teams and progressing projects to schedule. We expect the U.S. to land at the high end of our previously reported full year revenue mix of 60% to 70% of total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was $168 million. An increase of $105 million or 168% growth establishing another new record for the company. Gross margins expanded in Q3 to 30% as a result of our strong execution and favorable mix, both by project and region. As Howard and Dan both mentioned, our teams continued to optimize our supply chain and drive pricing discipline. As I just said, Q3 also had a larger U.S. mix which has somewhat higher pricing and margins versus the rest of the world. Our Q3 EBITDA margin of 23.6% was up over 1100 basis points from the prior year and marks the seven consecutive quarter of sequential margin improvement. Despite Q3's outperformance we continue to expect project gross margins to track in the mid-20s as we manage our business to optimize annual results. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.96 in the quarter. As previously stated, the separation from Flex increased our public float by approximately 74 million shares but does not impact our diluted EPS. Adjusted free cash flow was $62 million for the quarter and $314 million for the first nine months of fiscal year '24. Driven by strong net working capital management, customer deposits and higher EBITDA. Net working capital at the end of Q3 was approximately 13% of trailing 12 month revenue, which was within our expected 10% to 15% levels. To support our planned growth in the next few quarters, we expect to continue to fund our net working capital, which may pressure free cash flow. Our high quality balance sheet, cash flow generation and ample liquidity remain competitive advantages. We call it was the quarter with $368 million in total cash, which is greater than two times our total debt of less than $150 million. Total liquidity at the end of Q3 was nearly $800 million. We continue to operate with a debt to EBITDA ratio of less than one with no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2028. We have a resilient financial model with a growth mindset. We will continue to make investments in our teams, technology and infrastructure to grow, create value and scale our business. At the same time, we have the flexibility to explore M&A opportunities to accelerate our business with the mindset to create differentiated value for customers, in addition to increasing shareholder value. Let me now transition to the IRA 45X benefit considerations for Nextracker. We have developed great relationships and arrangements with top vendors in the industry. We have strong conviction that our torque tubes and the bulk of our fasteners will qualify under 45X which will be meaningful to our financials in fiscal year 2025. The key takeaway to understand is that our objective is to reduce the cost of materials to enable domestically made product to be cost competitive with imports via the 45X tax credit vendor rebates. Consistent with last quarter, we have not factored in any expected IRA 45X profit projections in our updated fiscal 2024, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS guidance. However, based on current arrangements with vendors and the 45X Treasury rules, we expect to realize a reduction in GAAP, cost of sales in the range of $50 million to $80 million in our fourth quarter fiscal '24. This is our current projection and subject to change based on contract terms and tax filing timing by our vendors. As previously messaged, fiscal '24 continues to be a transitional year as we work through respective contract terms and mechanics with our vendors. We plan to include the impacts of the 45X credits in our fiscal 2025 adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS guidance. Now, let me speak briefly about the successful separation from Flex. As stated in the previously issued press release on January 2nd, we announce the completion of Flex's spin off of all of its remaining interest in Nextracker to the Flex shareholders. Flex no longer directly or indirectly holds any shares of Nextracker common stock. We continue to maintain a transition services agreement with Flex to properly transition certain non-customer facing and back office functions which we expect to be completed this year. Turning to guidance. Our revised full year fiscal '24 guidance is as follows. With strong results year-to-date, we have once again raised the midpoint of our full year revenue guidance by $100 million. The new range is now $2.425 billion to $2.475 billion. At the midpoint, we are expecting 29% growth year-over-year. We've also raised our adjusted EBITDA guidance range meaningfully by $73 million. The updated range is now $475 million to $500 million. At the midpoint, we're expecting over 130% growth year-over-year and an implied EBITDA margin of approximately 20%. Our business should be evaluated on an annual basis. Structurally, we expect our gross margin to be sustainable in the mid-20s range. Factoring in quarterly variations in regional, project and customer mix. GAAP EPS is expected to be between $2.53 to $2.90 per share and includes approximately $0.30 related to stock based compensation and intangible amortization. GAAP EPS also includes the benefit of approximately $0.28 to $0.45 per share related to the recognition of the expected IRA tax credit vendor rebates. Adjusted EPS is expected to be between $2.55 to $2.75 per share, based on a $148 million weighted average shares outstanding. Net interest and other income are expected to be under $5 million due to benefits from FX and interest income offsetting interest expense. We still expect the adjusted income tax rate to range between 15% to 20% for the full fiscal year. As we head into fiscal 2025, we do expect the tax rate to trend slightly higher as an independent company domiciled in the U.S. I will now turn the call back to Dan for concluding remarks. Dan?\nDaniel Shugar: Thank you, Dave. I'm so proud of our team and what we've achieved. Our execution is backed by a strong history of innovation, deep domain expertise, global supply chain and trusted relationships. We're thrilled to begin this year as a fully independent company. We will continue to make strategic investments, expand our talented team and look to pursue additional market opportunities ahead. Nextracker's well positioned to grow and scale globally. We're just getting started. We now look forward to your questions. Let me pass the call back to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nBrian Lee: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and kudos on great execution again. First question, I know you probably can't get into all the specifics, but if we sort of backed into what's implied by the guidance for the vendor rebate that you're going to be seeing in fiscal Q4. I guess, I get to something in the ballpark of like a third credit share with other constituents here. I know we might not have all the details to be able to get to that number, but I thought it'd be a bit higher. So is there some additional clarity you can provide as to whether one, is that in the right ballpark or two, is there something unique about your shipments in '23 that you wouldn't get the full share or 50% plus that I think has been implied thus far by you and your peers. Just wondering what we should be thinking about as we head into fiscal '25? And then, I have a follow-up.\nDaniel Shugar: Brian, Daniel Shugar. Thank you for your question. We're not commenting on the share that we have with our manufacturing partners. Dave, do you have more share of elaborate on that?\nDavid Bennett: Yeah. Thanks, Dan. Hi, Brian. Couple of things to remember on our fiscal '24. And one is, we've previously guided without 45X, we're going to finish the year measuring our business to that standard. And trying to give you guys enough transparency to understand that we are partnering with our vendors and have a meaningful share and that's the extent of it. But '24 is a transitional year. Starting in January, we started U.S. manufacturing before 2023 but triple down on it after IRA, think about the ramp going through calendar 2023. So you're not at a full run rate at the beginning of it. So to try to measure the amount based on our cumulative catch up entry is not going to be representative of our going forward plan. And then each vendor, we're going to work contract by contract to understand their tax filing status and work with them. And then lastly Q4 is it contains a cumulative catch up for all of those periods over in the ramp. And so in a nutshell, the way we're addressing in fiscal '25, 45X will be operationalized and used as a measure to our performance for us. So it will be in our guidance for fiscal '25, but looking at it for fiscal '24 is really a transitional year. And that's kind of why we've approached it that way.\nBrian Lee: Yeah. Fair enough. That makes sense. So that figure there are some nuances to the number for this year. Maybe just second question, I'll pass it on. This could be for you Dan. I guess, can you talk a bit about the competitive landscape, the market share outlook, particularly in the U.S., it seems like that has become a bit more noisy of late. I know Nextracker has been winning via innovation and meeting customer requirements. So any reason to believe that won't be the case going forward. Can you maybe speak to examples (ph), where you're getting wins or feedback from customers on this being the reason you continue to win business here in the U.S.\nDaniel Shugar: Thank you, Brian. Yes. Product differentiation is a primary driver for winning in the market. That combined with our experience, financial condition. And at the end of the day, what does that need. Our trackers need more energy than other designs that are at scale in the market. We -- you can visually see it if you go on YouTube and you look at our TrueCapture, there's couple three minute video and there you can actually see how the systems are working empirical side by side cases where TrueCapture of operationalize or not. And we harvest more Bifacial through reported by way. About a third of the United States is it a pretty extreme health risk area. And we have operationalized or help pro technology to help customers enjoy operational performance on their system that's safer and we have many successful customers with their fleets using our technology. So there's a variety of factors there. But we've been in the shoes of the customer, what we're focused on is below LCOE. For our customers by having differentiate -- differentiated technology and really strong operational metrics.\nBrian Lee: All right. Thanks for all the color, guys. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Windham with UBS. Please proceed.\nJon Windham: Perfect. Thanks. Great result. So that's about -- you did mention some project delays that you can just, any color you can add on what drove those up you at some project pull forwards to allow you still beat on revenue pre -- pretty solidly but just any commentary about the nature of delays in geography, what caused them be helpful? Thanks.\nHoward Wenger: Sure. This is Howard Wenger. I'll answer that. So we had some delays for example in the Midwest, there is a lot of -- it's the wintertime and it's raining. Facing it muddy, things can get pushed a week or two weeks. So the shipments can vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of that. Meanwhile, we've had acceleration for customers who want product faster. And so on balance, we'd be on every financial metric, which means we beat on shipments too. So on balance, we're good. But it's not -- we're in the project business where part of that's construction business and things can shift here and there. The other thing I mentioned was the conflict in the Suez Canal region. And that we have factored that into our shipping time frames. So, with our customers, so we able to mitigate and yes, product to our customers on time, so they can finish their projects on time, but things can shift a week or two as a result of different dynamics. Thanks for your question.\nJon Windham: Great. Thank -- yeah, thanks for that. I'll take the full Flex accounting questions offline. I won't bore everyone. Thanks again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Strouse with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nMark Strouse: Good afternoon. And thank you very much for taking the questions. I'll echo my congrats as well. So pretty impressive upside to the guidance with just -- just a quarter to go in the year. I'm curious, if you kind of talking about project movements forward and backwards. If there weren't any sizable project pull forwards into the March quarter that you should call out or is this kind of just broader market acceleration?\nHoward Wenger: It really is this broader market acceleration, Mark. As we noted in our previous call, we have a lot of backlog. Our backlog has grown over call quarter-over-quarter, we're over $3 billion significantly. And so customers in the strength of the market particularly in the U.S., as we noted, 78% of our revenue came from the U.S. in the quarter, which is higher than normal, it can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, and we expect it to normally be two-thirds, one-third, but there are some pull ins in the U.S., but it's not significantly changing our demand picture at all. Our backlog grew in the quarter. So there's really nothing significant. One thing that Dan noted in his remarks is that there are simply more developers and more EPCs. And we believe we're doing a good job with our team, winning share of the business. So the strength is there, the demand strength is there. And things aren't slowing down because of IRA in anyway. So that's where we're at on balance.\nMark Strouse: Okay. I'll take the rest offline. Thank you, Howard.\nHoward Wenger: Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Smith with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nJulien Smith: Hey. Indeed, really very well done. Impressive indeed. Look, thank you guys very much. Appreciate it. So with respect to the 45X, just coming back to what we're seeing executive percentage. If I can ask that question slightly differently rather than what the percentages. How do you think about what a run rate might look like for instance, like how do you think about what that would trend into the '25 period. And is that fully reflective of all the various aspects of 45X as you think about torque tube and beyond?\nDaniel Shugar: Hi, Julien. Thanks for your question. Let me just start with the operational aspect and then Dave will speak to the financial. Nextracker is very, very serious about scaling off domestic manufacturing in the states and our other core markets. And we hit this early. And last summer, we announced 25 gigawatts of contracted capacity across the United States. We've operationalize that, we've had six public factory openings. We have over a dozen factories shipping finished goods, all across the United States. And we're going to be in a position to be any customer requests for domestic manufacturer content. And be able to arbitrage any problem with congestion at a poor for -- there is a problem in logistics route or currency or natural disaster what have you. So we're really focused on being able to operationalize that with both the supply chain. And we're achieving great success with our partners. In a number of cases, we've gone back to some of these factories we've started upwards with our partners to double or greater increased capacity in those factories. Dave?\nDavid Bennett: The only thing to add would be is as I indicated there is a lot of moving parts with what quantifies the fiscal '24 Q4 amount and that isn't necessarily a good indicator for what we will be given the ramp, given the one time nature of the cumulative catch up. As we've been saying, we bring the demand, it's a meaningful partnership with our -- with our vendors and we will include that in our fiscal '25 guidance, so it will be transparent you see the uplift to our profitability for fiscal '25.\nJulien Smith: Both of you guys, thank you very much. I appreciate it. And then just related to on the mix on international, you guys were talking about one-third still. Obviously, some real success abroad, how do you think about what that proportion could trend as you think about year-over-year in terms of recognizing that revenue. And then related, how do you think about the ongoing expansion in gross margin, does that start to top out as you think about that international mix really getting going here, if you will.\nHoward Wenger: Thanks, Julien. This is Howard. So it's a big world, solar works just about everywhere, we had our first project in Sweden. But typically thought it was a great solar market. So, so, but the United States remains the biggest market outside of China in the world. And certainly for Nextracker, it's going to continue to be, the biggest market for some time. But unbalanced there are more locations around the world that we can and we are driving towards increasing that one-third share of our total business because we think that's healthy for the company and provides us more levers for growth. And we're really just getting started in many countries around the world. So as far as margin on that front, we have seen that it can be more price sensitive. But we think that will change over time as customers come to realize the strength of our technology and the importance of the tracker in terms of being designed for a 40 year design life like ours is with the highest quality components, the best reliability, the best performance track record. And the owners of these projects will increasingly drive and the choice of Nextracker being the most reliable and most trusted partner. We've seen that in the United States, we think that's part of our traction. We believe we're going to see that more and more internationally as time goes on. One thing, I want to note. Dan mentioned that we've shipped over 90 gigawatts in the company's history. Two-thirds of those gigawatts is just in the last three years. So when you think about the S curve and the adoption rate and how we're going off that in the experienced space, it will pull increasingly more towards quality, a flight to quality over time. And that's played out in the U.S. already, which is our home market. It will play out internationally as well. Thanks for your question.\nDaniel Shugar: I'd like to pile what Howard said, which is this, it's around our philosophy for how we design, how we build, how we serve customers. I can tell you what Nextracker is not going to do. We're not going to cut any quarters on a product quality, design philosophy. You won't be seeing Nextracker's shipping lead acid batteries in any of our controllers. doing any quarter cutting on our product. We will be maintaining the highest standard. Make sure that trackers perform. And that we really set a standard, not only for Nextracker but that solar power systems are the highest performing reliable systems in power generation.\nHoward Wenger: Thanks, Julian.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Philip Shen with ROTH. Please proceed.\nPhilip Shen: Hey, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Just a quick follow-up on Julien's last question there. Specifically for Q3 was international mix down due to seasonality or is it more just strength in the U.S. market. Or was there some slowdown in international growth. And then what is your expectation for the international versus U.S. mix for FQ4? Thanks.\nHoward Wenger: So let's just start for the full year, Phil. We expect to land at roughly one-third, two-thirds for the full fiscal year '24. Okay. So, on balance, you'll see for Q4, numbers that are closer to that. And so, we -- the U.S. market just is very strong right now. And customer are accelerating certain projects and that's what we saw this quarter. And when we can make a difference, right. If you've got one out of 13 weeks, you have some significant projects getting more products this way versus next, the next week for falling out of -- into the subsequent quarter and it can change that ratio, but we're stable at one-third and two-thirds. Yeah, [Multiple Speakers] and I do want to note that new international business is up. International business is up, year-on year, quarter-on-quarter in terms of bookings and revenue.\nPhilip Shen: Got it. Thanks.\nHoward Wenger: So, no slowdown there.\nPhilip Shen: As it relates to booking – [Multiple Speakers] Right. No slowdown. You guys are doing very well with your bookings and your record backlog, which would assume at least $710 million in bookings, I think for FQ3. I was wondering if you could give us just a little bit of color on do you think the FQ3 bookings were closer to $1 billion or maybe closer to $750 million. And then, to what degree can you share any color on what you see for calendar '24 or better yet fiscal '25. I know you have no official guidance, but the reality is, you guys have very long lead times. And you should have good visibility to the degree you can kind of talk through that would be really helpful. Do you expect the bookings strength to continue? Do you expect to be able to continue to hit these record backlog numbers in the coming quarters? Thanks, guys.\nHoward Wenger: We're going to get more detail on the next call as to where we landed on backlog for the year, we mentioned that. I think last quarter, the quarter before that we would be on an annual basis providing more detail on backlog and then quarter-to-quarter some directional guidance. So, I just want to say on the bookings and the bookings strength very consistent for since we've been public company, each quarter that we've reported, our bookings in totality worldwide EPC and BCA business, very consistent. Each quarter in terms of magnitude and very strong. each quarter. Reflecting strong demand globally. Thanks for your question, Phil.\nDaniel Shugar: And just on the longer-term, Phil. In my prepared remarks, I noted that the EIA is forecasting a 26% annually compounded growth in solar and states. Does that -- that sounds very high rate. Well, Nextracker's demonstrated 30% annually compounded growth for five years and up. So it is definitely in the realm of possibility, but the United States in particular is going to need a ton of power. So there's a huge opportunity here not just for Nextracker but the whole solar power industry, other tracker companies, new tracker entrants, new solar panel companies, new power electronics companies, new EPCs to really engage in the market. And we need -- we need additional companies. And companies that are serious about performing and delivering high quality products across the value chain. So I mean that is tremendous 300 gigawatts of new power needed in five years in the United States. With the EIA predicting most of that's going to come from solar. That's a big deal. Thank you, Phil.\nPhilip Shen: Right. Thanks, Dan, just -- Yeah. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kashy Harrison with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.\nKashy Harrison: Good afternoon. Great quarter and thanks for taking the questions. So my first one is just on the margin. 30%, it's a pretty big number and I was wondering if you could just provide more specifics precisely on how you got to 30% this quarter. And then, Dave, I know you mentioned mid-20s is more of a sustainable level but is there a scenario in which Nextracker is generating 30% gross margins, ex credits, while simultaneously generating a lower LCOE than some of your peers? And I have a follow-up.\nDavid Bennett: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Kashy. Obviously, is there a scenario where we just printed it. So I can say that there isn't a scenario. The higher gross margin for the quarter driven by some level of leverage, we were at a record revenue was at $710. We benefited from a regional mix that we already alluded to, with a high U.S. concentration that generally drives a higher margin profile. And finding better software attach rate. So that's going to move our margin profile up as well. The year-over-year increase we spoke about before but in terms of the sequential increase, it's just execution over and over, the biggest factor in my opinion is pricing discipline and cost discipline. So some of the innovations that we talked to and everyone aligns to the new product introductions that's real, but it's also about innovating our supply chain, our cost downs in enabling us to maintain that higher profitability. But to close, you really should look at it on a greater than one quarter window, if you look at the full year to date. Actually, we are at 27% gross margin and 20% EBITDA which is in that range of what we see as sustainable.\nKashy Harrison: Thank you. [Multiple Speakers]\nDaniel Shugar: My apologies. We need to go to next question.\nDavid Bennett: Thank you, Kashy.\nKashy Harrison: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please proceed.\nChristine Cho: Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. Great quarter. If I could just go back to your comments on the 45X for fiscal '25, you mentioned that you expect it to be meaningful. And the objective is to reduce costs. So can you just talk through how you expect that to impact margins, years back expected in equal offset or do you anticipate it to be more and you would keep it has higher margin or do you adjust for a demand (ph)?\nDaniel Shugar: Hi, Christine. This is Shugar. Thanks for your questions. Look, the 45X was about rapidly spinning off the U.S. supply chain to deal with all the disruptions in the pandemic and create a bunch of jobs here. That was the premise of the 45X, be it in tracker or solar panels. And we have accomplished that. Products are competitive here. With things that are made overseas, with a 45X, and we're delivering on the U.S. product with steel sourced domestically was higher. Quality steel, it's also cleaner. Okay. With respect to our position on the 45X, Nextracker has an extremely diverse domestic supply chain across multiple manufacturing partners with a huge amount of capacity we've announced over 25 gigawatts. With comparison we've operationalize that. Which one would then have to presume or in a very strong position with respect to supporting but also negotiating position with respect to suppliers. So we're going to leave it at that. And we'll be speaking to our FY '25 guidance for the next quarter.\nHoward Wenger: Thank you for your question.\nChristine Cho: Okay. Great.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nPraneeth Satish: Thanks. I guess with the separation from Flex behind you, I'm just interested in your perspective on M&A, whether you'd be more or less inclined to pursue acquisitions now and then I guess just broadly what gaps do you see in your portfolio and what businesses do you think would be complementary and synergistic?\nDavid Bennett: Thanks, Praneeth. We don't see gaps in our offering. We could expand our offering. We will be very discerning as we were when we did an acquisition of a machine learning company, seven or eight years ago that helped us accelerate our TrueCapture technology. So we just completed the Flex spin off and we are open to a variety of options, we're evaluating things but we're going to be -- have a lot of discipline about how we proceed on that. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Street Research. Please proceed.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. Excuse me. Thank you. Two quick questions. First, the strong U.S. growth. Any sense on how much that is market growth versus you taking market share? And then just would like more color on your thoughts on the commentary on the trade issues on panels and a lot of that seems backward looking, but what's the risk might be to forward-looking? Thank you.\nDavid Bennett: We focus on our customers in winning and partnering with them. We're doing that with our EPC customers, we're doing that with owners developers directly and power plant owners. And we have a lot of capacity for growth. And we don't really pay attention to whether we're taking share or we're just -- we're just focused on delivering value for our customers and improving our products, investing in innovation. And doing as much solar as we possibly can. We've dedicated our whole careers to solar mainstream solar power. Dan and I have worked in the solar power industry for more than 35 years each. And that's our focus. What we do find, when we do that, but when we have that focus and when the company focuses on value, we do win and it seems like we've win disproportionately. And which is it's good for the company. But it's mainly around and we've shown that we are both global leaguer -- leader in market share. Okay. But we're just -- we're really conveying that to all of our employees at the company, focused on the comps -- customer, focus on innovation, differentiation, delivering value, lowering the cost of energy. I think that a 40 year design life highest quality, highest rollout reliability DNA and that breeds success. Thanks for your question.\nMary Lai: We have time for one more question. Operator?\nOperator: Our final question comes from Moses Sutton with BNP. Please proceed.\nMoses Sutton: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just a quick one on TrueCapture. So you noted, it's slightly better software attached. Any way to quantify this at all maybe the cumulative installed gigawatt number, how much has changed on a quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. Just anything that could help us on the TrueCapture side to the numbers. Thanks, again.\nDavid Bennett: Moses, thanks for your question. As we have kept introducing new features on TrueCapture like Split Boost [indiscernible], we've seen increasing uptake on our TrueCapture fleet. And as I mentioned you can visually see it. So we reached few people to watch those videos we have on YouTube. Well, we'll go in deeper on your question after next quarter when we do the annual guidance.\nMoses Sutton: Okay. Thanks again. Congratulations.\nDaniel Shugar: Thank you, Moses.\nMary Lai: Great. Thank you everyone joining the call. This concludes our call. Thank you.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your line."

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we’ll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Wednesday, July 26, 2023. I would now like to turn the conference over to Don Quinby, Director, Finance and IR. Please go ahead.\nDon Quinby: Thank you. Good afternoon, and welcome to Nextracker’s earnings conference call for our first quarter fiscal 2024 results.

Dan?\nDaniel Shugar: Thank you for joining us to review our first quarter fiscal 2024 results. With me today are Howard Wenger, President; and Dave Bennett, Chief Financial Officer. Following our remarks, we look forward to your questions. Please turn to Slide 3. I’m very pleased with our execution and results in Q1 across all key metrics. Starting with our financial results. Revenue for the quarter was $480 million, increasing 19% year-on-year. Our EBITDA for the quarter was $84 million, up over 160% year-on-year. Increased profitability is attributable to pricing discipline, monetization of distinct product features and improved operational efficiency. We achieved solid positive cash flow for the quarter, further bolstering Nextracker’s robust and differentiated liquidity position in the industry. Dave will provide more detail on our financials. We have been relentlessly driving solar technology innovation that provides tangible value to customers in hardware, controls and software. Our innovation is focused on reducing LCOE, the levelized cost of energy solar power, which supports our customers to increase their project profitability and Nextracker to exercise pricing discipline. We have exciting product announcements planned for the major RE+ Trade Show in September. We posted another strong quarter of new contract bookings building upon our booking achievements of last fiscal year. We ended the quarter with new record backlog over $3 billion, up from $2.6 billion as of the end of fiscal year 2023. Sales momentum continued with repeat business and new customers across diverse and expanding geographies. This is reflected in our strong international performance in the quarter, where over 40% of our revenue was attributable to overseas projects. We were pleased that Wood Mackenzie recently named Nextracker as the global tracker market share leader for 2022 by a significant margin. This is the eighth consecutive year Nextracker has led the industry. Based on our Q1 results and strong industry position, we are increasing our annual revenue and EBITDA guidance, as Dave will cover. In our prior earnings call, we quantified progress in LCOE and the growth of solar as today’s largest source of new power being added to most grid. And we also reviewed that in the U.S., the IRA provides an attractive 30% investment tax credit level for 10 years with upside for U.S. manufacturing content. Today, I will provide some qualitative comments on market dynamics based on our insights for meeting hundreds of customers at global events last quarter. To give a sense of engagement at Intersolar Europe last month, over 100,000 people attended the conference. We are seeing strong demand factors driven by cost reduction in solar panels and battery storage combined with performance enhancements in panels, power electronics and trackers such as Nextracker’s proven true capture technology. In sum, these factors are yielding lower LCOE and solar is breaking away from fossil and nuclear power as a lower cost, lower risk and faster to deploy resource even when the cost of battery storage is included, which is now typical in major markets like the U.S.A. In parallel, electricity demand is increasing with the electrification of transportation and end-use demand. In the U.S., customer pull for locally-made components has paired with industrial policy resulting in over 60 new or expanded factory announcements in just the past year for solar and storage, hundreds of thousands of people are working directly in solar. New factories and growing jobs are providing broad support for the industry. Given solar today provides under 5% of global electric power generation, we envision significant long-term growth as cost-effective solar increases its share of power for the grid responding to a world where electricity demand keeps increasing and society trends toward decarbonization. Now turning back to Nextracker. Our global supply chain is a key competitive advantage, which we generally map to align to our local markets. This ecosystem comprises about 50 partners across 16 countries and five continents. To serve our ongoing growth, Nextracker is continuing to collaborate with our valued subcontractors to increase our global manufacturing footprint. I will cover our U.S. position shortly. After we reported our Q4 results, the U.S. Department of Treasury issued guidance regarding IRA’s domestic content provisions. Receiving these rules clarifications was incrementally helpful for Nextracker and we continue to work with our customers and trade associations to further clarify the requirements. We continue to exclude potential IRA impacts from our guidance pending definitive clarifications and market response. After quarter-end, we completed a successful secondary offering of Nextracker stock to the market. Allowing our pre-IPO shareholders to reduce their ownership and increase the liquidity of our stock following the transaction, Flex owns less than 52% of Nextracker shares. The headwinds noted previously regarding solar panel availability and permitting delays for electrical interconnection and project construction starts still exist and are likely to continue for the intermediate term, though there is tangible progress on U.S. solar panel availability. Slide 4. Accelerating our U.S. manufacturing suppliers has been a key objective. I’m pleased that ramping the 25 gigawatts of contract capacity is on track. Last quarter, we celebrated a new plant opening in Memphis, Tennessee with our legacy supply partner, MSS. Joined me in the plant dedication was our customer, Silicon Ranch Corporation, who awarded us a second volume commitment agreement of 3 gigawatts during the event; a key raw material supplier, U.S. Steel and the CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a key trade association driving solar policy. At this public opening, Nextracker finished goods were on the floor ready to ship to regional job sites underscore our ability to quickly scale with our partners. Our focus in the U.S. continues to be sourcing from electric arc furnace mills that are significantly lower carbon than most oversees steel production. We are continuing to build our supply chain and next month are planning another strategic supply announcement. We now have over 10 manufacturing facilities with dedicated Nextracker lines in the United States. And now, I’ll turn the call over to Howard to expand upon our commercial progress.\nHoward Wenger: Let me echo Dan by congratulating the Nextracker team. We are very pleased with the company’s execution resulting in another strong quarter of performance. Last earnings call on May 10, we provided some background on the company, given it was our first reporting quarter since going public earlier this year. I specifically covered our technological innovation, which coupled with our best-in-class team, allows us to win business across all regions and terrains. Please turn to Slide 5. We reported last quarter that we had significant sales velocity and wins leading to a company record backlog of $2.6 billion, ending our fiscal year 2023. We plan to report our backlog on an annual basis while providing sales and customer demand insights on a quarterly basis. This is consistent with our annual focus as a company and reflects the nature of our large-scale project business. This quarter, we are pleased to report that our strong sales momentum continued and we significantly added to our backlog. Our backlog is now greater than $3 billion at quarter-end, establishing a new record for the company. We believe we have a distinct competitive advantage, creating demand pull. This is driven by our differentiated product offering, scale of global supply chain and close relationships with our customers and partners where over 80% of our revenue is generated by repeat business. Further, we believe the investment thesis is intact for large-scale solar in the U.S. right now. Independent of the 10% domestic content bonus provided by the Inflation Reduction Act or IRA. There is justifiably a lot of focus on the domestic content provisions and government guidance on how to interpret them. But keep in mind that the IRA created a well-formed and well-known consequential policy in the form of establishing a 30% Investment Tax Credit, or ITC, which has no domestic content requirements. The ITC has been the predominant federal policy instrument for solar for decades. So generally speaking, the 30% ITC is well understood and is now contemplated in the economics of developing solar power plants. Further, recall that the ITC was scheduled to decline pre IRA to 10% next year. So elevating it to 30% and holding it constant for at least 10 years is an incredibly significant change, and we believe it is the biggest pillar and driver of IRA in terms of utility scale solar demand. Of course, the domestic content and manufacturing tax credits are important and government clarifications and market responses are still ongoing, but we believe there is sufficient understanding of the IRA provisions today, to continue to propel the large-scale solar segment forward. We believe these factors are driving continued demand in the U.S., but we are also seeing demand strength internationally. This is illustrated on the map on Slide 5, where you can see we executed agreements totaling over 10 gigawatts of projects during our fiscal Q1. Although this is a subset of our project and customer wins from the quarter, the intent is to highlight the magnitude of Nextracker’s continued sales strength and the breadth of our global reach spanning multiple continents. We had a healthy combination of EPC and BCA business with new and repeat customers from North America to South America, from Europe to Africa, and Asia and Oceania. The sample Q1 company wins also reflect the strength of our global team in sales, marketing, supply chain, training, finance, and support that provide a platform to further scale and grow. In summary, we saw demand strength in all of our core markets around the world. Now let me turn the call over to Dave Bennett, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial details of the quarter and to discuss our guidance for fiscal 2024.\nDavid Bennett: Thank you, Howard. Q1 fiscal 2024 represents the first full financial period for Nextracker as a public company. We are off to a great start. Please turn to Slide 7 for our fiscal 2024 Q1 results. Revenue for the quarter closed at the high end of our guidance at $480 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Rest of the World revenue was $209 million, up 56% year-over-year and 44% of our current quarter mix. As expected, revenue in the U.S. was relatively flat versus the prior year quarter, primarily due to pushouts of certain projects due to permit delays and panel availability. While the Rest of the World was particularly strong this quarter, there is no change to our expectation that the U.S. will represent 60% to 70% of total revenue for the year. Adjusted EBITDA increased $52 million to $84 million from the first quarter of fiscal ‘23, an increase of over 160%. Our strong results were largely driven by improved execution, along with lower logistics costs. We ended the quarter at 17.4% adjusted EBITDA margin up from approximately 8% in the prior year. While we are very pleased with the positive EBITDA results, we don’t expect this level of outperformance to continue throughout the year. And as always, encourage you to evaluate Nextracker on an annual basis. We remained focused on sustainable year-over-year growth and have increased our annual guidance that I’ll speak to in a couple of slides. Adjusted free cash flow was $225 million for the quarter, driven by net working capital management, increased customer deposits resulting from strong bookings and elevated adjusted EBITDA. Net working capital as of June 30 was less than 10% of annualized revenue, which was favorable to our guided 10% to 15% levels. We do expect to fund our net working capital as well as continuing to ramp U.S. manufacturing over the next two quarters to support our planned growth, which may temporarily pressure free cash flow. Turning to Slide 8 for an update on our balance sheet and liquidity. We believe that our capital structure, including a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity, is a key competitive advantage. We closed the quarter with cash of $355 million, which exceeds our total debt by over $200 million. Total liquidity as of June 30 was $855 million, comprised of our undrawn $500 million revolver and our current cash balance. We continue to operate with a debt to adjusted EBITDA and of less than one with no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2028. As Dan outlined, we closed on the secondary offering that resulted in an increase in public float for the Nextracker common stock. Following the transaction, pre-IPO owners now own approximately 66% of Nextracker, comprised of approximately 52% Flex and 14% TPG. It is important to note that all proceeds from the secondary offering that closed in the first week of July to our fiscal Q2 were distributed to the pre-IPO owners. Please turn to the next slide for our updated fiscal 2024 guidance. Driven by our strong Q1 results, in addition to higher expected volume in the second half, we have increased our fiscal 2024 full year guidance. The factors supporting our assumptions in the setting guidance are largely unchanged from last quarter. We will continue to invest in the business, including ramping production, further innovation around product development, and building out the team to take advantage of the opportunity ahead of us. Based on the current ownership structure adjusted for the follow-on transaction, we continue to expect our adjusted tax rate to range between 15% and 20% of adjusted pretax income. We have again not factored in additional profitability resulting from the Inflation Reduction Act. Our full year revised fiscal 2024 guidance is as follows: we are increasing revenue guidance by approximately 5% or $100 million to a range of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. At the midpoint, we are expecting 21% year-over-year growth. We are also increasing our EBITDA guidance by over 10% or $30 million to $315 million at the midpoint, of $290 million to $340 million due to strong execution that includes maintaining pricing discipline and prioritizing higher-margin business. At the midpoint, we expect fiscal ‘24 adjusted EBITDA to grow approximately 50% year-over-year. GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.20 to $1.40 per share and includes approximately $0.25 related to stock-based compensation and intangible amortization. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be between $1.45 to $1.65 per share based upon 147.5 million weighted-average shares outstanding. Our Q2 fiscal 2024 outlook is as follows: Revenue is expected to grow 15% to 20% versus Q2 fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be between 13% and 14%, up approximately 400 basis points to 500 basis points compared to the same period last year. The EBITDA guidance reflects the normal quarterly volatility of the business. So as always, we direct you to evaluate our progress on an annual basis. I will now turn the call back to Dan for some concluding remarks.\nDaniel Shugar: Thank you, Dave. The macro for solar is strong in the U.S. and abroad, and we continue to see accelerated investment into renewables. Solar has achieved its position as the number one source of new power generation through technology and cost reduction. We believe these trends will continue, which will result in significant long-term industry growth and that Nextracker is ideally positioned to leverage this opportunity. Regarding Nextracker’s performance, none of these results would have been possible without the confidence of our customers, which we endeavor to earn every day and the hard work and dedication of the Nextracker team for which we’re extremely appreciative. We now look forward to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Virgo: Hey, guys. It’s actually Alex Virgo on for Julien. Congrats on the strong results yet again. Just wanted to kick off with maybe some of the dynamics on the geographies here. Obviously, U.S. is relatively flat, flagging some headwinds there. I’m just curious on the permitting piece specifically, if you can sort of expand on your exposures how you’re positioning around that. And then relative to sort of not only domestic content but also transferability guidance, how are you seeing that as sort of a headwind or even a catalyst in the back half for developers to sort of move forward and put a date on projects and then sort of confirm the order with you guys. Thanks.\nDaniel Shugar: Alex, Dan Shugar. Thank you for your question. I’ll take the first part, Howard will take the second part. So with respect to a project permitting, first, our increased guidance reflects the environment that we’re operating in, our expectations. Any individual project can be pushed, there is an enormous portfolio of projects that we’re supporting. So we take those factors into account where entitlements are either granted or we consider upcoming projects on a probabilistic basis based on the level of entitlements and where they stand. An advantage for us in managing so many projects in so many geographies is that if one project has slowed down, there’s usually another wanting to take its place. So that would be my answer to that. And Howard, if you could address the second part of the question.\nHoward Wenger: Sure. Alex, so we just want to – you said something about headwinds. I mean we hit the high end of our guide. We believe that we’re still planning for the same mix of U.S. and international on an annual basis. And as Dan mentioned, quarter-to-quarter, things may fluctuate. So – that’s why we keep reorienting everyone to our annual performance. That said, things are going extremely well. We had a really strong bookings quarter including in the U.S. As far as tax equity and transferability, we’re not seeing over constraints there right now in tax equity. We do believe that there is upside with the transferability clarification. And so we appreciate the question.\nDaniel Shugar: Next question, please. Feel free for a follow-on, Alex. Thank you. Did you have a follow-on?\nAlexander Virgo: Yes. Just a brief follow-up just on the pricing piece. You guys mentioned distillate pricing a couple of times. Obviously, some benefits maybe on the supply chain side rolling off to Dave’s comments. Just curious if you could expand on that a little bit, really briefly.\nDaniel Shugar: Well, we don’t share ASP. What I will say is there’s a place of quality. Our customers really want to ensure that their projects are supported, designed on execution, on commissioning with the highest performance trackers with a company that has solid financial stability, Dave covered our liquidity position and ability to service them with a team that really understands the business that’s been in their shoes. And so given the – as Howard mentioned, how the very significant improvement in economics in the projects in the U.S., many of which have been anticipated to have a 10% investment tax credit now have a 30% investment tax credit. Customers are really focused on delivery. And so we don’t chase projects with price. What we really try to do is deliver value, deliver operational excellence and really do everything we need to do to ensure our customers are successful in the projects. So that’s where we’re focused. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Mark Strouse from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nMark Strouse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for taking our question. Good to see the supply chain continue to build out here. I’m just curious, as you’re signing these new contracts – these new partnerships, how you’re baking in kind of flexibility into those contracts with the IRA treasury guidance still kind of unknown. Are those contracts fixed? Or is there some kind of flexibility that you’re baking in there? And then is there any kind of goalpost that you can point us to as far as an upside or a downside and kind of what the percentage split of the kind of the 45x credit that you might be able to keep?\nDaniel Shugar: I’ll address the last question first, Mark. Thank you for that. No, we’re not speaking to that at this time, a potential split of the 45x credit. With respect to the – how we are dealing with flexibility, I want to pull back a little and just speak to the relationships we have with a number of our key subcontractors and suppliers. Last quarter, one of the public factory openings that we had was with MSS. It was in Memphis. We were able to bring life to an old facility that had just been used for warehousing, hadn’t been used for manufacturing in many decades. And this is a supplier that we’ve had a long relationship with on multiple continents, and we have been able to work productively with these suppliers in a variety of markets. They understand the industry and have worked well with us. And so the – and our reliable performers. And we’ve continued to work with some new – help cultivate some new participants in the industry, which is really exciting. So we think we – our supply chain is very robust. It’s a differentiated advantage for the company. As we noted, we have over 10 facilities across U.S. with over 25 gigawatts of contracted capacity. And next month, we’re planning another major factory announcement. So we’re continuing to build. But we’re really a strong relationship company, and that served us well historically, and we think well on the future. Mark, do you have a follow-on question, please.\nMark Strouse: Yes, please. Just I think a real simple follow-up question here. I just want to make sure, I’m thinking about the greater than $3 billion backlog correctly. Does that include or exclude BCA? I just want to make sure I’m comparing it to the appropriate metric from last quarter.\nHoward Wenger: It includes BCAs.\nMark Strouse: Okay. Thank you, Howard. Thank you very much.\nHoward Wenger: One thing I’d like to add on BCA is sensor volume commitment agreement. It’s not an LOI. It’s not a letter of interest. It’s not a term sheet. It’s a binding agreement backed by deposits and collateral with finding liquidated damages on both sides with specific projects and project sizes and pricing. So you can think of it as an EPC agreement, but multiple EPC agreements wrapped into one agreement Appreciate the question, Mark.\nDaniel Shugar: Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Christine Cho from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nChristine Cho: Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. So maybe if I could start on the backlog. Previously, you guys have talked about it being a two-third, one-third split for U.S. and Rest of the World. And I understand you don’t want to give specifics for the backlog on a quarterly basis, but as we think about the bookings that you did in the fiscal first quarter, would it be fair to say that split is still valid for the bookings you did? And if you could provide any qualitative comments on how BCAs are also trending.\nHoward Wenger: Sure. This is Howard. So that’s correct. We’re going to be providing annually more detail on our backlog. But we’re giving a lot of insights quarterly. And for example, we – you know we’re about $3 billion in backlog this quarter. We also note on Slide 5 that we have over 10 gigawatts, more than 10 gigawatts of signed executed contracts in the quarter and the geographies associated with those. So we’re actually giving a fair amount of information that should give you a lot of directional guidance. As far as the mix goes, there are BCA agreements and EPC agreements contained as I answered to a previous question, and it’s consistent with our historical mix that we discussed on the last call and both BCAs and EPCs agreements contributed to the growth of our backlog in the quarter. Appreciate the question. Do you have a follow-on?\nChristine Cho: I do. Okay. Just thinking about the 10 gigawatts of signed executed contracts in the quarter. As we think about bookings for the quarter, would you be able to qualitatively talk about how ASPs for bookings have trended just as steel prices have come down?\nHoward Wenger: Well, pricing actually can vary geography by geography, even project to project because of terrain and size and so forth. But on a macro scale, pricing is stable.\nChristine Cho: Thank you.\nHoward Wenger: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Vikram Bagri from Citi. Please go ahead.\nVikram Bagri: Good afternoon, everyone. It looks like revenues in the remainder of the year are levered to U.S. with more than 80% of the revenues it looks like in rest of the fiscal will be coming from U.S. I was wondering if you can talk about the magnitude of delays you saw in permitting and related to panels and the size of orders delayed. Just wanted to understand the confidence in U.S. orders converting this year.\nDaniel Shugar: Yes. Thank you for the question. Typically, it’s just business as usual, but then there’ll be a few jobs that have an issue, whether it’s a permit issue or a panel issue or something. We’re confident in our forecast and which is why we increased our guidance 10% – I’m sorry, 5% of revenue as covered by day and 10% on earnings, we’re not seeing delays in orders. We’re seeing projects proceeding, but then there’ll be occasional projects that have – they – every project requires a local jurisdiction to issue a building permit. Just like if you’re adding a bathroom at your house or something you need a permit for that. And so some local jurisdictions, there’s delays in what was originally anticipated by the project. But in aggregate, the overall demand, we’re seeing strong demand and strong fulfillment with occasional delays, but in aggregate, we’re able to grow and increase our guidance. Thank you. Did you have a follow-on question?\nVikram Bagri: Yes, I do. I wanted to ask a question on how much of the 45x credit time be retained by you and your peers. I was wondering if you can talk about the pricing competition you’re seeing in the market. You mentioned you’re not chasing pricing. How are you balancing growth versus sort of competing with the peers on pricing from what we understand and what we’ve seen the pricing competition remains pretty stiff. Just wondering like are you seeing that in the market as well? And does that indicate a lot of the 45x credit may get competed away in this competitive environment.\nDaniel Shugar: Thank you for the question. No, we don’t really see that 45x has a factor in how we think about pricing or dollar with customers. It would be a general answer to that. We’re really focused on supporting the really Tier 1 customers, and that doesn’t necessarily mean they have to be the biggest customers, but we’re really focused on supporting customers that have quality projects, that have quality operations, that have reliable performance in terms of developing new projects, they need reliable – and conversely, they want to work with Nextracker because we’re going to be there for them. And so really, what we’re focused on, as Howard mentioned, some of the volume commitment agreements we’ve executed and several – this quarter, for example, in the Memphis facility that Silicon Ranch Corporation executed a second volume commitment agreement, which doubled from the original one we had last year, we had an agreement that was 1.5 gigawatts. They came back with a 3-gigawatt fund commitment agreement with financial securities, as Howard mentioned. What they’re really focused on is, hey, we want reliable supply with high-performing trackers with U.S. content, it’s regionalized, design support and things like that. That’s what our valued customers are really looking for and we’re set up to do that. Thank you for your question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Philip Shen from ROTH MTM. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Shen: Hey, guys, congrats on the strong execution. First question is on margins. You had a really strong quarter here. Can you give us a little bit more color on how you were able to drive those strong margins. I think you talked about it Howard actually, Dan, price discipline, monetization of features and there’s something else. But could you give us a little more detail? And specifically, how much is software contributing to both revenue and that gross profit line. And then to what degree did 45x support this quarter. And looking ahead, I know, Dave, you talked about you can’t look at the whole quarter or just this quarter and extrapolate you have to look at the whole year. But is it fair to say that we’re at a new level of margins for the next quarter and so forth? Or do we go back down to 18%? Thanks.\nDaniel Shugar: Hi, Phil, thanks for the question, and multiple part question. Let me – I took some notes to make sure I capture what you’re looking for. From the last part, I think the answer is yes, our reset guidance does contemplate a higher margin. As I spoke to in the opening remarks, our execution upside, and that is from start to finish quoting to execution of the product, we had upside. That included logistics costs that were lower than expected that did benefit profitability in that we would not expect to continue at the same level. But on top of that, there are other elements that we’re executing that we have baked into our reset on the guidance. Just look at fiscal Q4 fiscal ‘24 – or ‘23, sorry, that was at a 14% EBITDA. We just closed the current quarter at 17.4% EBITDA. And looking at our current backlog, that’s what drove the update of our guidance and the increasing of revenue by 5% and EBITDA by 10%. And to answer specifically, if you look at the high end of the guidance, at the midpoint of the revenue. That’s an EBITDA of approximately 15%. So yes, we have baked an additional profit element into our forward look. You asked about software. One of the elements we messaged last quarter and continue to message now is that panel availability has impacted our software revenue recognition. We are actually below our guided 1% to 2% of revenue for the quarter. We expect that to be back up throughout the year. So we do expect to land at that 1% to 2%.\nDavid Bennett: And Phil, with respect to 45x, none of the 45, either 0, 45x benefit baked in the results we just printed. That’s all upside and we’re confident that will come when treasury issues its definitive guidance. But until they do, we’re not baking it in.\nPhilip Shen: Great. Thanks, guys. Shifting over to, let’s see here, the overall market size. What do you think the U.S. market from a total booking standpoint could be in 2023 and 2024. Just trying to figure out what your market share might be, and Wood Mack came out with some numbers and showed you an array kind of more neck and neck, but wanted to see how fast do you think the market is growing versus how fast you guys might be growing as well? Thanks.\nDaniel Shugar: Yes. Thanks, Phil. Just to clarify, we saw the Wood Mack report and also HI, H-I actually published yesterday. They both had similar numbers with Nextracker for the eighth year in a row as the number one global share by a significant margin and number one in the U.S. by a lesser margin. We believe – but we’re not focused on market share. We’re focused on innovation, adding value to customers, monetizing value where appropriate for the company, so we can keep reinvesting in new tech to advance solar and so forth. Look, I mean, the U.S. market has, as Howard mentioned, unprecedented stimulus with this 30% ITC gain that’s happened. And we are seeing panels debottleneck as – debottleneck. I mean that’s been the governor, the principal governor on the U.S. market. We’re seeing domestic suppliers significantly increase their shipments and their outlook for solar recently as the largest U.S. company for solar, the largest supplier of panels in the U.S. has increased their capacity, increased their production and has new plants coming online in the U.S. in the near-term ad other U.S. suppliers are continuing. We’ve seen several Tier 1 Asian manufacturers that are manufacturing from Southeast Asia, predominantly with their supply chain, having less constraints from the customers and border protection. So in terms of how big the market can be, well, as I’ve said in the past, one of the things I’ve consistently underestimated my whole career in solar is how fast the market could grow. We’re not – and we are now positioned with Nextracker. One of the reasons we went to 25 gigawatts of capacity, over 25 gigawatts of executed contracted capacity in the United States, which is a really big number. One of the reasons we went big is to be able to handle some incremental upside. So I think the answer to the question really comes to how fast can some of these panel manufacturers scale in the U.S., how fast can the supply chains are coming from Southeast Asia and India and other sectors continue scaling. So we’re very optimistic and – which is one of the – but based on concrete bottom-up data, which is one of the reasons we’ve increased our plan for this year. Thanks for your question. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Jordan Levy from Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJordan Levy: Afternoon, all, and a nice quarter. I just wanted to see if we could shift over to the international side of the business briefly. I just wanted to see if you could talk about how the pipeline in some of your key markets outside the U.S. are performing versus expectations. And any particular positive or negative momentum in any of your major international markets versus what you gave us last quarter?\nHoward Wenger: This is Howard. I’ll respond to that. We – as we noted, we had a really strong quarter internationally in terms of our P&L and deliveries. And then on the demand side, overall, it’s a great picture. And one of the benefits of being in multiple continents, with a leading share in four continents, is that if an area or a country as another country can flow. And so we’re seeing a lot of great activity in certain parts of the world like Australia and in Europe. Brazil is a little bit dynamic because of the wholesale price for power, but they’re very committed large customers to that market. So we’re continuing to see developments going through in Brazil, but it’s something to – that we’re watching closely. But overall, the picture is really strong for the company, and we’re growing at a good clip and feel like – we feel very confident with our mix for the year and going forward for the international business. Thank you for the question. Do you have a quick follow-up?\nJordan Levy: A quick follow-up just on steel prices, we’ve seen to move up a little bit over the last few months. It doesn’t seem like it’s impacted your results or ability to grow the backlog. But just wanted to see if we could get a quick refresher on how you all look at that impact of higher steel prices and if that’s changed at all over the last several years?\nDaniel Shugar: Jordan, this is Dan speaking. The answer is not really. We take a bit of a longer-term view and have structured very strong relationships with most of the larger mills in the U.S. and some of the larger mills abroad. And think about the relationship between our – narrowing our demand, our fabrication ability and our supply altogether. That really came to light in our Memphis operation. We have this public opening in May. We had – it was – it’s just a beautiful thing because we had – starting with the customer, which is where we’re really focused with Silicon Ranch, doubled down with Nextracker or tripled down really, they went from a prior 1.5-gigawatt BCA to a 3-gigawatt BCA. And a lot of their demand is regionalized, let’s just say, around the tenancy value for – they’re in many states, but let’s just say that’s an epicenter. But we opened a tracker factory in Memphis, right in the middle of their demand center. One of the other – and then on the steel side bringing home, one of the other speakers was David Burritt, the CEO of U.S. Steel, which has a fantastic mill called the Big River Steel facility. I have the privilege of being there. It’s right across the Mississippi River in Arkansas. It’s one of the highest performing mills from a cleanliness standpoint, it’s about the lowest CO2 producing mill in the world or certainly amongst them. And it’s a very short distance from that mill to this particular tracker facility. And so that particular mill can melt and coat steel coil that then we can process – our partner MSS to process in their facility. Now that particular facility is not limited to that mill nor is that mill limited to delivering to Nextracker’s partner, MSS because as we mentioned, we have over 10 facilities under contract. But we really like this model of pairing demand with fabrication capacity and supply altogether in a system that’s regionally optimized to minimize cost, to minimize CO2 with transport and to shorten the lead time as much as possible for customers, so that we can reduce costs of logistics and be a reliable supplier. Thanks a lot, Jordan. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Donovan Schafer from Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDonovan Schafer: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So the first question I want to ask. So I know at least as far as like as a corporate practice with public-facing sort of disclosures you don’t give revenue mix based on product types. But I would like to – from a qualitative standpoint or maybe you are willing to share some kind of a number. The idea here what I’d like to get it is something like a revenue mix from the different products and value offerings that you bring to the table or even something where it’s like take, for instance, the terrain following tracker. I know in a – like, say, a 1 gigawatt deployment, you may actually only use the terrain following piece designed for some small fraction of that. So if we talked about it as strictly gee, what’s the revenue mix, it could be like a time in fraction. But what I want to – I’d like something to help us kind of understand when are customers pulling the trigger on these things as a way to indicate or validate sort of externally by customer behavior, when and to what extent they value these offerings that could even be something like 10% of your new bookings are enabled by the availability of a terrain-following solution or x number come with the true capture or something to do with the 2P, the Gemini solution, if that ends up getting used on a certain – maybe you win a site because you can use the 2P for certain portions of it. Anything like that? So just if you could provide any updates or clarification and ideally quantification, but anything that shows the degree of customers taking action on that breadth of offering.\nDavid Bennett: Appreciate the question. So – and we appreciate the request more than anything. I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll consider it for next quarter. But we – on the last call, we talked about how TrueCapture has been deployed on over 190 projects and how XTR, our terrain – extreme terrain-following has been deployed over 65 projects last quarter. So we – these are commercial products. We are monetizing them. We’re improving on them. Dan alluded to new product releases in his prepared remarks, upcoming at the largest trade show in the U.S. called RE+ which is in Las Vegas this year, the week of – in the second week of September. And so we’re very cognizant of investors and those who follow us to want to continue to understand our products and how they’re monetized. So we will take your request seriously. Thanks for the question. A quick follow-up.\nDonovan Schafer: Yes. And if I can get into the – yes, sure. Yes. So a quick follow-up is just outside the usual culprits of exciting international geographies, there any that stand out. I think Brazil, Australia, we all kind of know to pay attention to that. I think India has a lot of potential, but that can be a challenging market to operate in domestically for various reasons. So anything like maybe what’s most promising in Africa or somewhere in the Middle East? Or if you’ve seen any traction in India or anything like that? Just what would be atypical markets, but that could be under the radar?\nDavid Bennett: Yes. So we put – just – these are select a subset of wins during the quarter on Slide 5. We have pens placed on a global map that correspond to where these 10 – over 10 gigawatts of wins took place. These are – by wins, we mean contracts. And so in the approximate geography, so you can see, yes, Africa; India, yes; parts of Asia, in the Middle East, yes; not just Spain and Europe; other parts of Europe, yes, Latin America and Brazil, not the only place in Latin America. Just in the quarter, even in North America, there’s a pin that’s up above the United States and Canada. So there are a number of markets where we’re present and that are promising markets, either growing with upside for the company or more mature markets, which have the whole pie growing rapidly like the United States. Thanks very much. We need to move on to our last question. We have one more question or no further questions?\nOperator: Yes. There are no further questions at this time, please proceed.\nDaniel Shugar: Yes. Dan Shugar here. Thank you all very much for the questions and precious comments. In totality, the market is – dynamics are really strong due to fundamentals: cost reduction of solar, better performance out of panels, inverters, trackers, including Nextracker’s patented proven TrueCapture technology. And this is improving by the market because solar, in most grids around the world is the lowest cost way to generate power. Thank you very much, and thank you for dialing in to our investor call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect."
