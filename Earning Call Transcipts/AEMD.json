[Operator Instructions] Please note, today’s event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Miller with Rx Communications. Please go ahead.\nMichael Miller: Thank you, operator and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Aethlon Medical’s third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Michael Miller with Rx Communications. At 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time today, Aethlon Medical released financial results for its third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023. If you have not seen or received Aethlon Medical’s earnings release, please visit the Investors page at www.aethlonmedical.com. Following this introduction and the reading of the company’s forward-looking statement, Aethlon’s Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, James Frakes; and Aethlon’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Steven LaRosa, will provide an overview of Aethlon’s strategy and recent developments. Mr. Frakes will then make some brief remarks on Aethlon’s financials. We’ll then open up the call for the Q&A session. Before I hand the call over to Mr. Frakes, please note that the news release today and this call contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended. The company cautions you that any statement that is not a statement of historical fact is a forward-looking statement. These statements are based on expectations and assumptions as of the date of this conference call. Such forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements can be found under the caption Risk Factors in the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023, and the company’s most recent report on Form 10-Q and in the company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as maybe required by law, the company does not intend nor to undertake any duty to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances. With that, I’ll now turn the call over to Mr. James Frakes, Aethlon’s Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Jim?\nJames Frakes: Thank you, Mike, and I’d like to thank all of you for dialing in. This is Jim Frakes, Interim CEO and long-time CFO of Aethlon Medical. In October 2023, Aethlon received clearance from the Drug Controller General of India, or DCGI, the country’s Central Drug Authority to conduct a Phase I safety, feasibility and dose finding trial of the Hemopurifier in patients with solid tumors who have stable or progressive disease during anti-PD-1 monotherapy treatment, such as KEYTRUDA or Opdivo. The trial is expected to begin following completion of an in vitro binding study of relevant targets and subsequent approval by the respective ethics boards of interested sites in India. In addition to an interested initial site in India, we have three interested sites in Australia that are also awaiting the data from our in vitro binding study. Our in vitro binding study of relevant oncology targets is complex and stands on the cutting edge of extracellular vesicle science. Our goal is to quantify the potential impact of our Hemopurifier on plasma from cancer patients who have been treated with anti-PD-1 monotherapy treatment in order to provide preclinical evidence to support our trial design. While our R&D team has started to quantify our internal data, the results to date are inconclusive. Therefore, while our internal team continues to fine-tune their work, in parallel, we have now engaged several third-party laboratories who independently perform assays on the samples. We are also continuing the study – to study the use of our Hemopurifier as a treatment against life-threatening viral infections through our COVID-19 trial in India. We have two participating sites for this trial, the Medanta Medicity Hospital and Maulana Azad Medical College or MAMC. One patient has been treated to-date. Recently, we have been informed by our contract research organization that a new COVID-19 subvariant has been detected in India. Our COVID-19 trial in India remains open in the event that there are COVID-19 admissions to the intensive care units at our two participating sites. Finally, since being named Interim Chief Executive Officer 3 months ago, I have focused our efforts on our oncology program as well as on reducing our expenses. As previously reported, we disclosed some interesting preclinical proof-of-concept data of the Hemopurifier in organ transplantation. As a result, we do plan to submit one or more articles for publication on our preclinical organ transplantation data. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dr. Steven LaRosa, Aethlon’s Chief Medical Officer.\nSteven LaRosa: Thank you, Jim. The clinical team in Aethlon continues to make strides toward initiating oncology studies in India and Australia. As a reminder, these studies will examine the safety and feasibility of the Hemopurifier in patients who are not responding to anti-PD-1 antibodies following an initial 60-day treatment period. The trial will also examine exosome removal by the Hemopurifier and the downstream effects on reversal of T cell immunosuppression. Three interested sites have been identified in Australia and one in India. Two of the 3 sites in Australia have already completed successful site qualification visits, known as SQV. And we are in the advanced stages of budget and clinical trial agreement or CTA, negotiation. The major milestone to site activation and enrollment is approval by each hospital’s ethics committee. The three main documents that these committees examine are: one, the clinical trial protocol; two, the informed – the patient informed consent known as the IPF; and three, the clinical investigator brochure known as the CIB. The Aethlon team has finalized the protocol and the informed consent documents. The clinical investigator brochure can be finalized once the results of the in vitro binding studies are available. Additionally, we are finalizing other important documents necessary for the conduct of the trial, including the electronic case report form known as the EDC, the safety monitoring plan, the statistical analysis plan and the charter that the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board will use. In short, we are poised for site activation once our in vitro studies are completed. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Jim for the financial discussion, and he will open it up for questions.\nJames Frakes: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon again, everyone. As of December 31, 2023, Aethlon Medical had a cash balance of approximately $8 million. During December and January, we raised approximately $236,000 through common stock sales under our at-the-market program. Now as I’ve been previously encouraged not to cover our expenses on such a granular basis, as I did on prior calls, I will try to keep my remarks a bit more high level this quarter. You will find detailed expense information in the financial statements attached to our earnings release that just hit the wire or in our soon-to-be filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Our consolidated operating expenses for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, were approximately $3.6 million compared to $2.8 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2022. This increase of approximately $717,000 or 25.2% in the 2023 period was due to an increase in payroll and related expenses of approximately $871,000, offset by decreases in general and administrative expenses of approximately $92,000 and in professional fees of approximately $61,000. The $871,000 increase in payroll and related expenses was primarily due to separation expenses for our former CEO of $873,000 and an increase in salary expense of $81,000 associated with an increase in average headcount. This was offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $83,000. Now I’d like to note that without the $873,000 separation expense that was accrued related to our former CEO. Both our payroll expense and our overall operating expenses would have actually decreased from the 2022 period. The $92,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in clinical trial expense of approximately $399,000. That decrease was offset by a $284,000 increase in supplies for manufacturing and R&D and a $31,000 increase in insurance expense. That increase in insurance expense included $16,000 of health insurance expense related to the separation agreement with our former CEO. And the $61,000 decrease in professional fees was due to a $54,000 decrease in scientific consulting, a $22,000 decrease in marketing, a $21,000 decrease in recruiting and a net $33,000 decrease in contract labor related to general R&D. These decreases were offset by an increase of $44,000 in legal expenses, primarily related to the reverse stock split, an $11,000 increase in director fees associated with the addition of a new director, and a $14,000 increase in investor relations and accounting fees. As a result of the changes in expenses that I just noted, the company’s net loss increased to $3.6 million for the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, from $2.8 million in the 3 months ended December 31, 2022. We included these earnings results and related commentary in our press release issued earlier this afternoon. That release included the balance sheet for December 31, 2023, and the statements of operations for the 3 and 9 months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. We will file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q following this call. Our next earnings call for the fiscal fourth quarter ending March 31, 2024, will coincide with the filing of our annual report on Form 10-K in June 2024. And now, Steve and I would be happy to take any questions that you may have. Operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today’s first question comes from Marla Marin with Zacks. Please go ahead.\nMarla Marin: Thank you. Hello. So I have a couple of housekeeping questions and then one sort of broader picture question. So in India, regarding your continued COVID trials if there is an uptick in COVID cases, will that make it easier for patient enrollment in your trial there?\nJames Frakes: Steve, do you want to take that one?\nSteven LaRosa: Yes. Hi, Marla. The trial, as you will recall, is for severely ill patients. So those are patients in the intensive caring. So what we know from our CRO is that cases are occurring with this new variants is JN.1 variant. We don’t know yet if that’s going to translate into the critically ill population or not. But the sites are open and open for enrollment. And so if those patients are in the ICU, yes, we’d be able to enroll them.\nJames Frakes: And we have Hemopurifiers there awaiting to doctors have been trained. In fact, the doctors of Medanta Medicity have very deep experience using the Hemopurifier in prior trials, so…\nSteven LaRosa: So they are at the ready, so to speak. It’s just whether the patient’s critically ill population is there or not.\nMarla Marin: Got it. Okay. That also, Jim, what you just said leads me to another question, which is, are we to understand that you have a sufficient number of Hemopurifiers at the moment to support all of the clinical efforts that you’re looking to conduct at least in the near-term?\nJames Frakes: We do for the planned oncology trials. If all hell broke loose with COVID, that’s an unknown. But we do – we have a cash of Hemopurifiers in India waiting at those two sites. So it would need to be a massive outbreak with a lot of people in the ICUs to cause a problem. So I think we’re in pretty good shape, actually, Marla.\nMarla Marin: Okay. And then you talked about some one-off costs in the third quarter, one-off expenses associated with the separation from the former CEO. Are there any one-off costs that are going to spill over into the fourth quarter?\nJames Frakes: No. The accounting treatment was to analyze all those costs and book the accrual into the December quarter, which was the quarter in which he left the company. So while not all that – that large sum didn’t go out as cash, a small portion did. We’ve accrued it and it will be – just paid out over the year. We’re paying him over a 12-month severance period. We have pretty extensive detail on that in our quarterly report 10-Q that we will go on file shortly. So I’d encourage anybody who’s interested in that to take a look at the footnotes.\nMarla Marin: Got it. Okay. And then last question for me. So, in order to move forward with the oncology trial, you said you need to do some preclinical work in vitro work, correct, in order to see if the plasma from cancer patients that are enrolled and being treated with anti-PD-1 treatment, the response when the Hemopurifier is used. Can you just give us some color on how you get those patients involved? How you are able to obtain access to the plasma from these patients, pre-moving parts?\nSteven LaRosa: Yes. So, Marla, the kind of the work plan, if you will, for the preclinical studies is there are commercially available sources of plasma from cancer patients. The patients have already signed consent. So, they have agreed to allow the use of theirs. So, we have acquired plasma samples from patients with malignancy, particularly those who have been treated with anti-PD-1 therapy. We then run those over a smaller version of our Hemopurifier and then we count things like exosomes and exosomes of PD-L1 and effects on T-cells. So, we are – that’s the process that we are in, and we are still working on getting a definitive answer from those studies.\nMarla Marin: Okay. Got it. Thanks. Thank you very much.\nSteven LaRosa: Thank you, Marla.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Vendetti: Yes. Thanks. So, Jim, on the studies in India, just how many patients are enrolled at this point and just go through again, that should help, right, bringing over those results over to the U.S.\nSteven LaRosa: Anthony, the COVID study, which is the one that’s open right now can enroll up to 15 patients. We have enrolled one to-date, but it’s designed in a manner that, yes, the data, including the biomarker data would be useful for submissions to regulatory agencies. But again, the issue has been with the evolving COVID epidemic, there have been patients who are affected who aren’t critically ill. So and that’s the population that’s eligible for the study.\nJames Frakes: And the FDA prior studies in India did accept and use that data. So, it’s useful information.\nAnthony Vendetti: So, you said that they found a new variant in India, is that different than the JN.1 in the U.S., the most prevalent one now in the U.S.?\nSteven LaRosa: No, I would say, it’s the JN.1 what they are finding is it’s the predominant and they don’t know what the downstream clinical consequences are going to be, meaning, is it going to translate. Is it going to translate to more hospitalized and critically ill patients. So, that’s an unknown right now.\nAnthony Vendetti: Okay. And then in terms of the oncology trial data, is that being done in Australia?\nSteven LaRosa: The planned studies, safety, feasibility and akin to dose finding, how often you have to give the Hemopurifier treatments, those two individual trials are going to be – one trial is going to be conducted in India, one is going to be conducted in Australia. Again, we are awaiting our in vitro data to submit to the ethics boards to get those studies started.\nAnthony Vendetti: Okay. So, neither of them are started at this point, okay.\nSteven LaRosa: That’s correct.\nJames Frakes: That’s correct. We are poised – I have been really pushing hard on this, Anthony, since I was named interim CEO. And we have come a long way on the R&D efforts. They couldn’t even count the extracellular PD-L1 on the extracellular vesicles two months ago, and now they can count the total aggregates, but they have – it’s just inconclusive. That’s why we are engaging outside labs to get to the bottom of exactly where we are.\nSteven LaRosa: Yes. And to reiterate Jim’s point, so there is a whole – and you can imagine, there is a whole book of activity that have to be done to start a trial. And so we have been pushing to get every one of those dots so that once we have this data, we can go if it is fit to go.\nAnthony Vendetti: Understood. Okay. And then lastly, I think you did mention at the end of your prepared remarks, an update on the organ transplant progress. Is that – maybe just give me a little more color on that. Is that I know the oncology is taking priority, but maybe just an update on where that’s at.\nJames Frakes: Well, I did push to make the oncology effort as the highest priority, but there was momentum with the organ transplant work. We have generated additional data. It’s pretty interesting stuff. And we do plan to write one or more articles. We have the data. We are far enough along with the oncology studies that the – some of the more senior people can move their – wrap their head around getting the articles written and try to get this published. So, we haven’t stopped that work. We may very well have things to talk about on future calls on the organ transplantation trend.\nAnthony Vendetti: Are you still working with 34 lives on the transplant side?\nJames Frakes: We are. They have been busy getting their clinical trial going. We have been busy with the oncology stuff. But yes, we are still – we have a collaboration agreement with them. And now that the – I don’t really know where they are with their – they are a private company. We couldn’t talk about it publicly, even if we knew. But we are still working with them and I think the time to move forward may be coming soon. They may have gotten things going, but I don’t know. It’s not our business.\nAnthony Vendetti: Okay. Great. Got it. Thanks for your update. I will hop back in the queue.\nJames Frakes: Thank you, Anthony.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Frakes for closing remarks.\nJames Frakes: Thank you again for joining us today to discuss our quarter end results. We look forward to keeping you up-to-date on future calls. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today’s conference call. We thank you all for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day."

Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Miller with Rx Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\nMichael Miller: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Aethlon Medical's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. My name is Michael Miller with Rx Communications. At 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time today, Aethlon Medical released financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023. If you have not seen or received Aethlon Medical's earnings release, please visit the Investor page at www.aethlonmedical.com. Following this introduction and the reading of the company's forward-looking statement, Aethlon's Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, James Frakes; and Aethlon's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Steven LaRosa, will provide an overview of Aethlon's strategy and recent developments.

Except as may be required by law, the company does not intend nor does it undertake any duty to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances. With that, I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Frakes, Aethlon's Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.\nJim Frakes: Thank you, Mike, and I would like to thank all of you for dialing in. This is Jim Frakes, many of you know me as the long-time CFO of Aethlon Medical. Last Tuesday, November 7, our Board of Directors made the decision to make a change in the company's leadership and they named me as the Interim Chief Executive Officer, replacing Dr. Charles Fisher, Jr. On behalf of everyone at Aethlon Medical, we would like to thank Dr. Fisher for his service to the company as our CEO and as a member of our Board of Directors. I'm grateful for our board's confidence in me. I'm deeply committed to Aethlon's shareholders and employees and plan to work tirelessly to help the company succeed. I look forward to continuing the development of the Hemopurifier and initiating in both India and Australia, a potential Phase I clinical trial in oncology in area where we see great promise and ongoing emphasis. We received clearance in October from the Drug Controller General of India, or DCGI, the Central Drug Authority in India for our planned oncology trial. We expect this trial to begin following completion of an internal in vitro binding study of relevant targets and subsequent approval by the respective ethics boards of interested sites in India. We previously reported a disruption in our Hemopurifier supply for domestic trials in use and that our intended transition to a new supplier for the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin for GNA, a component of our Hemopurifier was delayed because we worked with the FDA for approval of the supplement to our IDE which is required to make this manufacturing change. While we continue to work with the FDA to qualify the second supplier of GNA, I'm pleased to note we're also in the process of completing final testing to begin manufacturing Hemopurifiers at our new manufacturing facility here in San Diego for U.S. clinical trials, using GNA from our original GNA supplier. We do have sufficient supply of Hemopurifier for use in our planned oncology trial in Australia and India. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dr. Steven LaRosa, Aethlon's Chief Medical Officer.\nSteven LaRosa: Thank you, Jim, and I look forward to continuing to work with you closely in your new role as the Interim CEO at Aethlon Medical. We continue to work towards studying the Hemopurifier as an adjuvant treatment to anti-PD-1 antibodies, such as Keytruda and Opdivo in the treatment of solid tumors. Anti-PD-1 antibodies act to neutralize programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, a ligand released by tumors that blocks the ability of one zone immune system specifically T cells to fight tumors. These agents have been revolutionary in the field of clinical oncology in a number of tumor types. But unfortunately, only approximately 30% of patients will have a lasting response. The leading theory of why this resistance occurs to these agents is that tumors release extracellular vesicles containing PD-L1 that service decoy molecules, in essence, distracting the antibodies from reinvigorating the body T cells to fight the tumors. Unchanged or increasing levels of extracellular vesicles containing PD-L1 have been associated with progressive disease during anti-PD-1 antibody treatment. The hypothesis exist that if we can decrease or debulk extracellular vesicles containing PD-L1 with the Hemopurifier and we can resuscitate the ability of the anti-PD-1 antibodies to reinvigorate the T cell response to tumors. In vitro, we have previously shown that the affinity resin within the Aethlon Hemopurifier combined tumor-derived extracellular vesicles from a number of cancer types. In a patient with severe COVID-19 infection, we demonstrated in vivo a decrease in extracellular vesicles during Hemopurifier treatment. We are currently working on in vitro experiments to specifically address the ability of the Hemopurifier to decrease extracellular vesicles containing PD-L1. If this is confirmed, as we expect, we plan to seek approval of a clinical trial of the Hemopurifier by Ethics Board committees at interested sites in Australia and India. The planned clinical trial is designed as a basket trial, meaning encompassing multiple tumor types for which anti-PD-1 antibodies are considered standard of care. In this trial, patients want to go a run-in period where they received two months of initial anti-PD-1 therapy, during which total extracellular vesicle concentrations as well as extracellular vesicles containing PD-L1 concentrations will be measured. We'll also be measuring markers of immune function. Patients who have stable or progressive disease after this 2-month run-in period of anti-PD-1 therapy will go on to the Hemopurifier phase of the study where different intervals of Hemopurifier treatment will be examined. As such, each patient will be serving as their own control. This design is expected to help us answer a number of important questions, including, is the Hemopurifier treatment safe and feasible in patients with solid tumors? Does the Hemopurifier have the same effect on removal of extracellular vesicles in the immune system regardless of tumor type? How often do you need to treat with the Hemopurifier to have sustained decreases in extracellular vesicle levels? And do decreasing extracellular vesicles containing PD-L1 lead to improvement in antitumor T cell functions? The answers to all of these questions will inform the development of future efficacy trials with the Hemopurifier in oncology. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jim for the financial discussion, and then we will open it up for questions.\nJim Frakes: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon again, everyone. As of September 30, 2023, Aethlon Medical had a cash balance of approximately $10.2 million. Now some of you that listened to our previous quarterly calls, gently encourage me not to cover our expenses on such a granular basis. So I'll try to keep my remarks a bit more high level this quarter. You will find detailed expense information in the financial statements attached to our earnings release that just hit the wire or in our soon to be filed report on 10-Q. Our consolidated operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were approximately $3.2 million compared to $3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022. This decrease of approximately $0.5 million or 13.4% in the 2023 period was due to decreases in G&A expenses of approximately $700,000, offset by increases in professional fees of approximately $129,000 and an increase in our payroll and related expenses of $78,000. The $700,000 decrease in general and administrative expenses or G&A expenses was primarily due to the combination of a $377,000 decrease in clinical trial expenses associated with the closed COVID trial. A $261,000 decrease in the purchase of raw materials for research and development testing for use in our Hemopurifier and a $140,000 decrease in subcontract expenses associated with previous government contracts. The $129,000 increase in professional fees was primarily due to an increase of $72,000 in accounting fees associated with audit and compliance services and a $38,000 increase relating to services for our Australian subsidiary. And the $78,000 increase in payroll expense was due to a $135,000 increase in salary expense related to an increase in headcount, which was partially offset by a $56,000 decrease in stock-based compensation related to employee stock option grants. As a result of the changes in expenses that I just noted, the company's net loss decreased from $3.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2022, and to $3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. We included these earnings results and related commentary in a press release issued earlier this afternoon. That release included the balance sheet for September 30, 2023, and the statements of operations for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. We will file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q following this call. Our next earnings call for the fiscal third quarter ending December 31, 2023, will coincide with the filing of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q in February 2024. And now, Steven, I would be happy to take any questions that you may have. Operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Marla Marin with Zacks. Please go ahead.\nMarla Marin: Thank you. So you said something in your prepared remarks that I was hoping we could get a little bit more color on where you spoke about in the expected basket trial, analyzing the Hemopurifier for multiple cancer types and seeing its efficacy in helping to, I guess, fight the PD-L1 challenge. You said that each patient would serve as its own control. Could you give us a little bit more color there on exactly how that will work?\nSteven LaRosa: Yes. Thanks, Marla. So because the patients are going to have a run-in period with their anti-PD-1 therapy alone, we'll be able to see what the anti-PD-1 therapy has done to their exosomes and their immune function, their T cell response to the tumor. So we'll have that as a control. And then when you when they - if they go on to the Hemopurifier phase because they're progressing, their tumor is progressing, then we'll be able to see what the exosome levels and their T cell responses are with the Hemopurifier. So each patient that is their own control, meaning they have with and without the Hemopurifier.\nMarla Marin: Got it. Okay. So then when you're thinking about that, there is that 70% of the population that just unfortunately doesn't respond to Keytruda and other therapies like Keytruda. And you'll be looking at how those patients responding once they are in the Hemopurifier, which day one will be their baseline, and you'll see if there's an improvement from day one once they go on Hemopurifier. Is that the right way to think that?\nSteven LaRosa: That's correct, Marla. We'll be able to see what happens to their exosome levels and their T cell functions after the Hemopurifier compared to when they were not on the Hemopurifier. And you stated it correctly. We acknowledge that, fortunately, our happily 30% of people will do just fine on their anti-PD-1 and they'll just - they won't go on to the Hemopurifier, they'll just continue getting their effective therapy. But those 70% will go on - will be eligible for the Hemopurifier phase in the trial.\nMarla Marin: Okay. Got it. Thanks. So just switching topics a little bit in terms of where you are with obtaining a second supply of, I'm not even going to try to say it so that you have enough Hemopurifiers for your ongoing clinical efforts. So right now, what you have already in hand is sufficient for the back of oncology trials planned in India and Australia. Is that correct?\nJim Frakes: Yes. We think it's a good prudent business to have two sources of supply for critical inventory components. The FDA is really making us - they just really a - through whole gamut of responses adding the second supplier. But we are now in a position with our original supplier to manufacturer. So we're actually very excited about that, Marla, it opens up opportunities in the U.S. and perhaps we can talk to the FDA about moving the same basket trial that Steve just described into the U.S. And that's one of my goals as Interim CEO is to try to bridge that into the U.S. as well. I mean that's our home market. So Yes. It's moving in the right direction on that DNA front.\nMarla Marin: Got it. So then just one follow-up, and I'll step out of queue. So moving into the U.S., I think when you originally talked about doing clinical trials in Australia, I think that part of the strategy was to generate some positive data in Australia where the cost of generating data would be lower. And then using that data in the U.S. to possibly shorten your time line. Is that the right way to think about it if you do move back into the U.S. at some point in the near term?\nSteven LaRosa: Yes. But the - Marla, the FDA has also said we could submit under our breakthrough designation in oncology. We can submit a new oncology trial to them as an IDE.\nJim Frakes: We do plan to - in Australia, they have some great labs. We've made some fantastic principal investigators that are very interested in exosomes. And we may use their labs for trials in other countries like the U.S. and India as well, which would give us potentially that tax benefit you referred to, which is about $0.44 on the dollar? Cash - not a tax credit, it's actually a cash incentive because they're trying to build their life science industry in Australia.\nMarla Marin: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nJim Frakes: Thank you.\nSteven LaRosa: Thank you, Marla.\nOperator: The next question will come from Thomas McGovern with Maxim Group. Please go ahead.\nThomas McGovern: Hi guys. How it’s going. So my first question is on the progress in Australia. I just want to see if any updates in that regard, specifically relating to some site identification or qualification, the Ethics Board submission and then finally, patient enrollment, where you guys - when you guys believe you'll be able to begin enrolling patients?\nSteven LaRosa: So as I mentioned during our talk, we're completing some in vitro experiments, which should allow us to complete the clinical investigator brochure, which is a necessary document for Ethics Board submission. We have already - we're working closely with a CRO, NAMSA in Australia and with Qualtran in India. We've all - I can't tell you the exact name of the site because we don't have contracts in place with them yet, but we have a number of sites in Australia who have already had interest, two of which have already undergone site qualification visits as well as a major center in India. So we have a number of centers that are poised to submit to their Ethics boards the materials once we have them complete.\nThomas McGovern: Great. Great to see some progress there. My next question, similar in kind of construct, I suppose, but is there any progress worth noting on your investigation to the Hemopurifier's utility and organ transplants?\nJim Frakes: We have collaborated with an outside group and have done studies on perfusate, meaning fluid that's gone through retrieved organs. And we are analyzing that data now with the hopes of publishing it down the line. So yes, we've made progress on the in vitro experiments on the transplant side.\nThomas McGovern: Great. And then finally, just real quick, if you guys could give us some type of expected time line for - I mean, I know working with the FDA, it can be very difficult to kind of approximate this, but if you have any type of visibility into how long you expect it to take for that second supplier to be approved? And then kind of a second question, then I'll hop back into the queue, but do you guys have any time line relating to the new manufacturing facility, would you guys expect that to becoming operational? Thanks.\nJim Frakes: Guy Cipriani, our Chief Operating Officer is here and he overseas manufacturing group and regulatory. So I think this falls into his wheelhouse.\nGuy Cipriani: Hi, this is Guy. So first, regarding the manufacturing site and the one that's online, we're currently doing engineering batches and validation batches in that facility. So we hope to be able to submit to the FDA to add that site to our IDE before the end of the year. So then we'll have to wait some period of time after we submit to the FDA to either get it an okay or to be told we have to do some additional work. So I think in the first quarter, we'll have clarity on that. Regarding bringing the second supplier of GNA online, that's an ongoing process. We have some work to do to address some of the concerns still. We think we should be able to accomplish all of that in the first quarter. I think bringing the site online in the early part of the first quarter and getting the GNA clearance somewhat midway through the first quarter, if not soon.\nJim Frakes: Thank you, Guy. And Thomas, of course, we can't predict when the FDA will approve something or come back with more questions. But all we can do is look at when we could submit our packages to them.\nThomas McGovern: Totally understandable. And just for clarity, when you refer to the first quarter, you're referring to the third fiscal quarter for you guys, first quarter being the calendar year quarter in '24?\nJim Frakes: Calendar year. Yes.\nThomas McGovern: Okay, understood. All right, great. Thank you take my questions. I'll jump back in queue. Thanks, guys.\nJim Frakes: Thank you, Thomas.\nOperator: The next question will come from Vernon Bernardino with H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.\nVernon Bernardino: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Jim and Guy, congratulations on the new appointment. Just wanted to ask, I guess, a little bit more about the time line. Just wondering if you could map out a little bit as far as the initial what we may see as far as the in vitro work before we could see perhaps an announcement that you would think about starting the human clinical trial?\nSteven LaRosa: Hi Vernon, this is Steve. So we had envisioned that those in vitro experiments would take place during November and December with the hopes of being able to enroll in early 2024.\nVernon Bernardino: Perfect. Regarding the new supply, do you have to do any GMP work as far as the new suppliers are concerned? And again, could you remind us where or how the current supply is obtained?\nGuy Cipriani: Yes. So we have an existing supplier of our GNA and sector laboratories in the Bay Area in California. All of our manufacturing is done under GMP. So because this is a natural plant product, we want to have more than one supplier providing that key ingredient to us. So really, this is as part of the strategy to derisk our supply chain. At some point in the future, as we get going on our studies, we'll probably look to see if we can do a recombinant version of the protein to even derisk it further. So these are all activities that we're, thinking about it, we're being very cautious in how we kind of roll them out. But we - right now, we need to mitigate any risk of supply by having more than one supplier of this key starting material.\nVernon Bernardino: As part of that work, going to evolve involve supply that is needed to dovetail with the initiation of studies? Or do you have enough supply now such that once you do get FDA approval to the supplement of your IDE that you could start studies right away?\nGuy Cipriani: Yes. We are able to manufacture devices to support a study today. So we don't have - we currently don't have supply constraints on the GNA.\nJim Frakes: Right. Just to expand further on Guy's comments, Vernon. So while we're waiting for our own manufacturing facility here in San Diego to come online with FDA approval, we can easily go back to the contract research facility which is a little north of us here in Southern California. And we could run a few batches, manufacturing campaigns there. And so we don't - things can always change. But at the moment, our feeling is supply is not a problem which is a nice change from points in the past.\nVernon Bernardino: Yes, terrific. I'll look forward to perhaps announcement of those in future results in the start of the studies in human. Thanks again and congrats.\nJim Frakes: Thank you, Vernon.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. James Frakes for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nJim Frakes: I'd like to thank all of you again for joining us today for a discussion of our quarter end results, and we look forward to keeping you up-to-date on future calls. Thanks again for your support. Goodbye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Except as may be required by law, the company does not intend nor does it undertake any duty to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dr. Steven LaRosa, Aethlon's Chief Medical Officer.\nSteven LaRosa: Thank you, Jim, and thank all of you for dialing in. Hi, this is Steven LaRosa. Due to the timing of our March 31st fiscal year, this first quarter report falls only about five weeks after our recent call on June 28. Aethlon Medical is continuing the research and clinical development of its Hemopurifier, a therapeutic blood filtration system that combined and remove harmful exosomes and life-threatening viruses from the blood. These qualities of the Hemopurifier have potential applications in oncology, where cancer associated exosomes may promote immune suppression and metastasis as well as in life-threatening infectious diseases and the organ transplant field. Our ongoing COVID-19 trial in India for patients in the intensive care unit at Medanta Medicity Hospital remains open for enrollment with one patient treated to date. In May 2023, a second clinical site Maulana Azad Medical College, known as MAMC, received Ethics Board approval to participate in the trial and site activation activities are currently underway. Patients with COVID-19 infections that require hospitalization continue to occur in India and the addition of MAMC as a second high-quality clinical site, may improve the enrollment of patients who go on to require ICU care for severe infection. In the oncology indication, Aethlon Medical continues to work with its contract research organization, NAMSA LLC to initiate a clinical study in Australia. Specifically, this is a safety, feasibility and dose-finding trial in solid tumors failing treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies. Aethlon Medical believes that the data generated from this trial will help inform the design of future oncology efficacy trials of the company's Hemopurifier. Ongoing activities include site identification and qualification, finalization of necessary documents for ethics board submission, the case report form development and selection of a data safety monitoring board. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dr. Charles J. Fisher, Aethlon's Chief Executive Officer.\nCharles J. Fisher, Jr.: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Hi, my name is Chuck Fisher. We recently announced that we are investigating the use of the Hemopurifier and the organ transplant setting, initially focusing on the potential removal of harmful viruses and exosomes from recovered kidneys. Our initial objective is to confirm that the Hemopurifier in translational studies when incorporated into a machine perfusion organ preservation circuit can remove harmful viruses and exosomes from recovered donor kidneys. Last month, we signed a research collaboration agreement with 34 Lives, PBC to investigate the use of our proprietary Hemopurifier and 34 Lives organ evaluation and preservation system with the goal of increasing the supply of usable donated kidneys for human transplant. We have previously demonstrated the removal of multiple viruses and exosomes from buffer solutions, in vitro, utilizing a scaled-down version of our Hemopurifier. This process may potentially reduce complications following transplantation of the recovered organ, which can include viral infection, delayed graft function and rejection. We believe that this new approach could be additive to existing technologies that are currently in place to meaningfully increase the number of viable kidneys for transplant. On a personal note, as a physician and former chief – division chief at three major research hospitals, I’ve seen many potentially usable organs discarded in that has always troubled me greatly. There are up to eight potential organs that can be transplanted and typically only 2 to 2.5 organs are actually transplanted per donor. TMS is currently applying pressure on the organ procurement organizations to increase this average. TMS is the payment source for the majority of kidney transplants because it reduces the burden on the U.S. government to cover ongoing dialysis treatments for citizens that have failed kidneys. Dialysis costs the U.S. taxpayer $120 billion in 2019, which equals 34% of Medicare’s total $350 billion of outpatient services budget. Kidney transplants are cost effective to Medicare saving up to $250,000 per year from each recipient. With an average kidney transplant lifespan of 10 years, this becomes $2.5 million in lifetime savings per transplant. There are currently 750,000 Americans receiving dialysis of 20 or more hours per week in the U.S. 105,000 of those patients need a transplant, but the average waiting time for a kidney is six years. In 2020, only 17,581 patients or 17% received a transplanted kidney while 12,293 died while waiting or became too sick to receive a transplant. In 2021, approximately 7,800 kidneys that were recovered from transplant were left unused that perhaps could have been used. Our objective is to increase the number of usable organs that can be introduced into the transplant community. In conclusion, on this topic, we are excited about this addition to our focus at Aethlon and believe this could be a significant business opportunity. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to Jim for the financial discussions and then open up the call for questions. Thank you.\nJim Frakes: Thanks, Chuck, and good afternoon again everyone. As of June 30, 2023, Aethlon Medical had a cash balance of approximately $12.9 million. During the first quarter ended June 30, 2023, we raised net proceeds of approximately $1.1 million under the At The Market agreement with H.C. Wainwright. Now, some of you that listen to our previous quarterly calls have gently encouraged me not to cover our expenses in such a granular basis, so I’ll try to keep my remarks a bit more high level this quarter. You can find detailed expense information and financial statements attached to our earnings release that just hit the wire or in our soon to be filed report on 10-Q. Our consolidated operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2023 were approximately $3.4 million compared to $2.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. This increase of approximately $0.5 million or 17.3%, in the 2023 period was due to increases in general and administrative expenses of approximately $276,000, professional fees of $133,000 and in payroll and related expenses of approximately $91,000. The $276,000 increase in G&A expenses was primarily due to a combination of factors. Those factors included a $344,000 increase in the purchase of raw materials for the production of the company’s Hemopurifier, a $133,000 increase related to the Australian subsidiary’s activities, and a $105,000 increase in depreciation and equipment maintenance associated with leasehold improvements and new equipment for manufacturing and lab facilities. Those increases were partially offset by a $160,000 decrease in clinical trial expenses, and a $140,000 decrease in subcontract expense associated with our former government contracts. The $133,000 increase in professional fees was due to an increase of $123,000 in investor relations expenses associated with facilitating investor awareness and assistance with more widespread dissemination of company news, an increase of $37,000 increase associated with accounting and legal services for our new Australian subsidiary and $86,000 of legal expenses associated with year-end filings and general corporate matters. Those increases were offset by decreases in regulatory services of $85,000 and recruiting expense of $28,000. And the $91,000 increase in payroll expense was due to a $56,000 increase in salary expense related to an increase in headcount and a 33 – excuse me, a $35,000 increase in stock-based compensation related to employee stock option grants. As a result of the factors that I just noted, the company's net loss increased to approximately $3.3 million in the three months ended June 30, 2023, from approximately $2.9 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022. We included these earnings results and related commentary in a press release issued earlier this afternoon. That release included the balance sheet for June 30, 2023 and the statements of operations for the three months ended June 30, 2023, and 2022. We will follow our quarterly report on Form 10-Q following this call. Our next earnings call for the fiscal second quarter ending September 30, 2023 will coincide with the filing of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q in November 2023. And now, Chuck, Steve, and I would be happy to take any questions that you may have. Operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Marla Marin with Zacks. Please go ahead.\nMarla Marin: Thank you. So I'm just wondering, do you have any sense, you talked a little bit about what you're doing right now to prepare for the oncology trials in Australia. Do you have any sense of what the potential timeline is or it's too early for that?\nSteve LaRosa: Hi, Marla. It's Steve LaRosa. Thanks for the question. So currently, we're working with NAMSA and we have interviewed a number of sites. We have four that are now interested and we have to engage in the ethics board mission and we're filing those documents. And then we'll have to go through their questions there, we're planning to do this and all by the end of this year.\nMarla Marin: Okay, thank you. And is the possibility you had talked about at certain points in the past of expanding trials in India, expanding into the oncology space. Is that something that is still potentially on the horizon?\nSteve LaRosa: Yes. So we're working with Qualtran LLC, our CRO in India, and they have identified Medanta Medicity as a hospital that's interested. And again, we'd have to go through the same process I articulated for Australia.\nMarla Marin: Got it. Okay. And then last question is on the organ transplant side. So you are going to be starting looking at translational transplants, I guess, of kidneys. And I think I read that kidneys are the most frequently transplanted organs. Will the results that you get from these first studies, will they be telling of what the potential would be for the Hemopurifier in other in the transplantation of other organs?\nCharles J. Fisher, Jr.: This is Chuck Fisher. Good question. So the first part about the translational research is to establish that we can remove from organs both and organs, which we've already been working on, as well as currently working on human organs that have been rejected, but sent to our partner to be profused. From that, we get the profuse it, and then we test out with our devices here at Aethlon Medical to see are we removing things and the process has just been initiated recently, and we'll expect to get some results in the relatively near-term. So that would help us understand how best to characterize it. As it relates to organs from different parts of the body at a later stage in this process. Some may be more inclined to have inflammatory mediators and some may not. But that’s really an unknown scientific area that we would like to explore ideally, we would like to have an effect on as many recovered organs from the donors as possible. These are not donors that are living related. These are brain dead donors with beating hearts, and in that we would expect that might see a number of these same inflammatory mediators.\nMarla Marin: Okay. Thanks very much for the answers.\nCharles J. Fisher, Jr.: Thanks for the question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vernon Bernardino with H.C. Wainwright. Please go ahead.\nVernon Bernardino: Hi, Chuck and Jim. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow up on that last question regarding the potential use of Hemopurifier and organ transplant in the organ transplant setting. And that’s in particular. So I get as far as increasing the number of viable kidneys for transplant. But as you stated in your press release and previously reducing the complications following transplantation of the recovered organ. That seems like it’s possibly two – even though it’s the same organ transplant that is the same procedure, same person, that sounds like it could be potential two uses of the Hemopurifier. Please correct me if I’m wrong. And what would be the thinking there as far as clinical trials? Would that be two clinical trials or that would all be in the same clinical trial, same patient, et cetera?\nCharles J. Fisher, Jr.: Vernon, thanks for your question. This is Chuck.\nVernon Bernardino: Hey, Chuck.\nCharles J. Fisher, Jr.: I think it’s a well posed question. The issue at the beginning will be, for instance delayed graft function typically is a marker within the first seven days if the kidney is not functioning and making urine that you may be having a problem. And that would be the first thing that we would look at in the kidneys. And then over time, at the six months and one year mark, we would be looking at the same thing as the kidney continued to functioning well. So in that sense if they’re functioning well, we would probably have our – some of our answers. Alternatively, we would potentially expect to have some level of delayed graft function or a further delayed graft or some dysfunction in the kidney at some point over time, in which case we could go back. But for the time being, it will be primarily initial study until we have more information to determine would we need to do a follow-on study in addition.\nVernon Bernardino: Terrific. And onto a different part of your announcements today. Regarding the trial in India, one patient treated to date. What would be the potential for any acceleration in patient enrollment in treatment this year?\nSteven LaRosa: Vernon, this is Steven LaRosa. So we know…\nVernon Bernardino: Hey, Steve.\nSteven LaRosa: Hey. Hi. So we know from communication with Medanta that there are in fact COVID getting hospitalized to date, but they are – the patients who need to be enrolled in the study have to be in the ICU. So there’s that potential. And then with the second site, that’s a large site that’s also seeing COVID admissions as well. So we think the second site may help with enrollment. We’re still at the mercy of the virus, if you will of whether it’s going to its changes over time are going to result in [Technical Difficulty] remains to be seen, if that’s going to translate into severe cases that would be eligible for study.\nVernon Bernardino: Do you have any indication there that they’re seeing some of the same dynamics we’re seeing here, which is increased hospitalization, increased infections, increased hospitalizations due to the variant of interest EG.5?\nCharles J. Fisher, Jr.: Yes. We’re hearing the same thing, that the case numbers are still up and there are still hospitalizations, but they haven’t seen as many ICU patients.\nVernon Bernardino: Okay. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions and my follow-ups. Appreciate it.\nCharles J. Fisher, Jr.: Welcome. Thank you.\nSteven LaRosa: Thanks, Vernon.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chuck Fisher for any closing remarks.\nCharles J. Fisher, Jr.: Thank you operator, and thanks everybody for listening and asking very good questions. We’d like to thank all of you for joining us today and be here to discuss our quarter end results. I look forward to keeping you up to date on the future calls. And I wish everybody a good day, and thanks again for joining.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today’s presentation. You may now disconnect."
