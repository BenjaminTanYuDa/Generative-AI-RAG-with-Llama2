After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I will now hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Ryan Kubota, Director of Investment Relations. Please go ahead.\nRyan Kubota: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining the InnovAge fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. With me today is Patrick Blair, President and CEO, and Ben Adams, CFO. Dr. Rich Pfeiffer, Chief Medical Officer, will also be joining the Q&A portion of the call. Today, after the market closed, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our quarterly results for our fiscal second quarter 2024. You may access the release on our Investor Relations sections of our company website, innovate.com. For those listening to the rebroadcast of this call, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today, Tuesday, February 06, 2024, and have not been updated subsequent to this call. During our call, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings press release posted on our website. We will also be making forward-looking statements, including statements related to our full fiscal year projections, future growth prospects, Florida de novo centers, our acquisition of ConcertoCare, our payer capabilities and clinical value initiatives, the status of current and future regulatory actions, and other expectations. Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements involve certain assumptions and are inherently subject to risk and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for fiscal year 2023 and our subsequent reports filed with the SEC, including our most recent quarterly report on Form 10-Q. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Patrick Blair. Patrick?\nPatrick Blair: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to begin by expressing my continued appreciation to our colleagues, participants, government partners and the investor community who support InnovAge. The company's second quarter results were consistent with our expectations and highlight the ongoing performance improvement across the business. It further demonstrates incremental progress in our broader transformation plan to accelerate responsible growth while restoring operating margin lost during the regulatory sanction period. We reported revenue of $189 million for the quarter, an increase of approximately 3.5% compared to the first quarter, and center-level contribution margin of $34 million, which represents a 17.8% margin. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.8 million for the quarter, which represents a significant improvement compared to the first quarter, which was approximately $2.2 million. Census increased to 6,780, which represents a quarter-over-quarter improvement of 3%. Now a few highlights. Participant net enrolment growth for the quarter was solid at 195, which continues to strengthen our confidence in the value proposition we are delivering. Our clinical value initiatives, CVIs, as we refer to them, which focus on unnecessary utilization and lowering medical cost trends are maturing in line with our expectations and beginning to translate into enhanced quality and greater operational efficiency, as evidenced by a quarter-over-quarter decrease in our participant expense, PMPM, of 0.7% and we're still in the early innings of this work, but we're pleased with the progress we're making. We are managing our non-center costs effectively in our enterprise service functions, resulting in a sequential decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from 15.9% to 13.4% and we completed the implementation of the new Epic EMR in all locations. On December 01, we acquired ConcertoCare Pace, which added two new centers in the highly strategic Southern California market. On January 01, we officially opened our new center in Tampa and are now operational in six states; Colorado, California, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Virginia and Florida. With half our fiscal year behind us, we're pleased with our progress and remain laser-focused on exiting fiscal '24 with solid earnings momentum. While we have demonstrated strong sequential quarter-over-quarter progress, significant work remains to achieve our financial goals for the second half of fiscal '24 and to create a glide path for a successful fiscal '25. As I mentioned last quarter, we have a great team, confidence in our plan and it continues to come down to consistent execution. We remain focused on the levers that drive near-term performance while continuing to build a long-term foundation of compliance and operational excellence. Simply put, we believe we're on track to unlocking the full potential of the organization at an intentional pace, which will take perseverance and time. Before turning to our quarterly performance, I want to take a moment to address the California regulatory update included in our 10-Q. As you'll recall, we were released from enrolment sanctions in our Sacramento Center by CMS in November of 2022 and by the California Department of Healthcare Services in May of 2023. Underpinning that release was validation from both agencies that corrective actions had been resolved to their satisfaction and that there were no remaining systemic concerns. In October of 2023, CMS and DHCS conducted the final annual routine audit of our Sacramento Center, as required for all new PACE centers during their first three years of operations. Following that audit, CMS approved our corrective actions in accordance with their findings. DHCS notified us two weeks ago that it had identified deficiencies. Last week, they shared the specific findings with us. After careful review of the findings, which are similar to the CMS findings, which we were in the process of remediating, we are confident that we have in place the policies, processes and systems to correct the identified issues. DHCS also communicated that it will be conducting a targeted medical review of our San Bernardino Center. DHCS has suspended its state attestations in support of our planned de novo centers in Downey and Bakersfield, which were scheduled to open this summer, but as indicated, it will evaluate lifting the suspension upon resolution of the matter. We remain confident that we will successfully address any issues to the full satisfaction of DHCS, and upon satisfactory remediation, that DHCS will reinstate the attestations. We also remain confident with regard to our expansion plans. This is a highly regulated area. Rightfully so, audits and corrective actions are normal course for all PACE organizations, given the populations we serve. We have seen the benefits of the foundational changes we've made in every center over the last two years to provide high quality care. We work closely with our regulators on their audits and conduct our own audits in each center every month, and we've consistently seen a clear positive trend line. When opportunities for improvement at one center are identified, we make them quickly and then cascade learnings across the organization. I want to be clear, compliance has been my North Star since I joined the company two years ago, and that will always be the case. Our leaders share my commitment to transparency and embrace the opportunity to collaborate with state and federal regulators to continuously improve our business. I felt it was important to share this context and draw the critical distinction of where we are today relative to 2.5 years ago. Now I'll turn to details about our recent performance, starting with existing center growth. New participant monthly enrolment continues above pre-sanction levels for the second consecutive quarter, consistent with our expectations. As I mentioned at the outset, we enrolled 195 participants in the quarter and have enrolled more than 375 participants in the first half of the fiscal year. As we approach the third fiscal quarter, we anticipate some modest seasonality related to the Medicare annual enrolment period. This organic growth contributes to two key objectives. Efficiently utilizing excess capacity in our centers and new growth, especially in Colorado, helps rebalance the overall mix of our participant risk pool. We're pleased to see that our new participants reflect an appropriate balance of individuals living independently in the community and those that may require some level of supportive housing. We continue to see strong demand for our integrated solution that allows seniors to stay in their homes and communities and out of nursing homes. This demand is most evident in the sequential increase in total sales qualified leads, which is up approximately 11% from the prior quarter. Last quarter, we touched on enrolment as a joint effort between InnovAge and our state partners. While we are seeing aggregate enrolment consistent with our expectations, we continue to observe challenges in select markets which have resulted in enrolment processing delays, in part due to Medicaid redetermination. The barriers we're experiencing include state enrolment resource constraints, post-public health emergency policy changes that now require in-person level of care assessments versus telephonic, and new state vendors who are still ramping up to targeted service levels. Recall that this does not affect the eligibility of potential participants, but rather the speed through which we can get them enrolled into PACE. However, lengthy delays can result in prospects evaluating other options and can translate into missed enrolment opportunities. Our state partners remain active and committed to resolving these issues with us as rapidly as possible. To state the positive, we're finding more eligible participants interested in joining InnovAge than were currently enrolling today. On the de novo front, we're pleased to announce that we're operational at our new Tampa Center. Recall, this state-of-the-art center is approximately 42,000 square feet and is expected to serve approximately 1,300 participants at maturity. Enrolment efforts are underway, and job number one is to begin expanding access to the many deserving eligible participants in the community. We believe Florida is an attractive sixth state given the number of eligible individuals and the lack of integrated solutions for the frail dual eligible population. We're also in the final push of pre-launch activities for our Orlando Center. Like Tampa, it's comparably sized and represents our latest best practices in terms of building design, technology enablement, and operating model. We anticipate Orlando Center will be ready to accept new participants in the fourth quarter, barring any unforeseen delays. On December 01, we completed the acquisition of two PACE Centers in Southern California from ConcertoCare. We consider this transaction more of a hybrid between an acquisition and a de novo, as it included a recently opened center in the Crenshaw neighborhood of Los Angeles with minimal census and a center in the final stages of the application for licensure in Bakersfield. We've been evaluating several alternatives to continue responsible growth in this market and these centers facilitate a faster and more cost-effective expansion compared to building the centers from scratch while enabling us to implement our operating model from day one. Of note, we anticipate these centers will add modest operating losses to our fully consolidated EBITDA near term as we work through the maturity curve. Taken together, we believe these new centers, along with our pending de novo center in Downing, demonstrate our ability to augment existing center growth with cost-effective expansions. We are excited for the opportunity to serve more seniors in more geographies over the next several months while also increasing our overall portfolio capacity by approximately 30% once all of these centers are open, which we believe will be a meaningful driver of growth in the near term and represent significant uplift in embedded earnings long-term. You'll recall that we measure and drive accountability for results through our five-pillar performance framework, which includes people, service, quality, growth and financial KPIs. We measure these in every center every month. We continue to see strong results across our people, service, and quality pillars, and we'll continue to invest in the people and resources necessary to further strengthen quality and compliance in each of our centers. Separately, we continue to see improvements in reducing external provider costs as our portfolio of clinical value initiatives mature. In the aggregate, we're trending ahead of internal targets on most initiatives fiscal year to date with strong progress in areas such as inpatient admissions and skilled short-stay utilization. We've also observed meaningful improvement this quarter in areas such as reduced end-of-life costs and contract transportation costs. One new area of focus in the last quarter is ensuring we have the highest performing supportive housing network from a quality, compliance and cost perspective. We're continually learning and improving as we go through compliance and quality audits. One of our key learnings is how dependent our quality, compliance, and financial performance is on the quality of nursing facilities and assisted living facilities in our network, given we have ultimate accountability for the care that is provided and administered in these settings. With this in mind, we have increased our focus on the quality and value of our supportive housing network. By ranking our providers on the dimensions of quality of care, compliance, cost and cooperation, and by narrowing our network around higher performing facilities, we're able to ensure our participants have access to the highest performing providers in their community. We're seeing similar progress in the management of our general administrative expenses. This quarter, we saw a sequential decrease in G&A of approximately $3.6 million. Importantly, ongoing growth will help to right-size our overall cost structure as we continue to expand revenue through existing center enrolment and new center development. Lastly, we're pleased to report that we're now operational across our entire portfolio with the first ever PACE-specific instance of EPIC. As we've discussed previously, this was a significant investment in dollars and time for the organization, and we view our new EMR as a chief enabler of increased operational productivity, efficiency, compliance and clinical staff satisfaction going forward. While it will take some time to achieve full adoption in the expected benefits in our newer markets, we're already seeing early wins in terms of operational and clinical efficiencies. In summary, we believe we are improving the business every quarter, and I again want to thank my 2,100 InnovAge colleagues nationally who are working tirelessly to make this wonderful program a reality for participants every single day. We remain focused on the actions that are unlocking both near-term and long-term value, and believe it will translate into both enhanced competitive differentiation in the marketplace, as well as improved financial performance. Finally, I want to remind the audience that we're excited to be hosting our first Investor Day on February 27 in New York, where we will provide more details on the journey we are on. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben to walk through our quarterly financial performance.\nBenjamin Adams: Thank you, Patrick. Today, I'll provide some highlights from our second quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance, a reaffirmation of our fiscal 2024 guidance, and some insight into some of the trends we are seeing heading into the spring. While it is still early in our margin improvement initiatives, we continue to track to our internal targets and are pleased with the progress we have made so far this fiscal year. Starting with census, we ended the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 with 18 centers and approximately 6,780 participants as of December 31, 2023. We also reported 20,130 member months in the second quarter, a 3% increase to both ending census and member months compared to the first quarter. Total revenue increased by 3.5% to $188.9 million in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, due primarily to an increase in member months coupled with an increase in capitation rate, primarily due to a one-time Medicare true up outside the regular payment cycle recorded in the second quarter. We incurred $101 million of external provider costs during the second quarter of fiscal 2024, a 1.6% increase compared to the first quarter. The sequential increase was driven by an increase in member months, partially offset by a decrease in cost per participant. The cost per participant decrease was driven by lower permanent nursing facility utilization, partially offset by an increase in inpatient utilization, which is not uncommon in the winter months. Cost of care, excluding depreciation and amortization of $54.3 million decreased 1.7% compared to the first quarter. The decrease was due to lower cost per participant, partially offset by the increase in member months. The cost per participant decrease was driven by a reduction in fleet expense, including contract transportation, fuel costs and vehicle repairs and maintenance, as well as a reduction in supplies expense. This was partially offset by an increase in FTEs and annual wage rate increases. Center level contribution margin, which we define as total revenue, less external provider costs and cost of care, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $33.6 million for the quarter, compared to $27.9 million in the first quarter. As a percentage of revenue, center level contribution margin increased to 17.8% compared to 15.3% in the first quarter, reflecting an improvement in the quality of our earnings in our centers. Sales and marketing expense was $5.9 million, an increase of approximately $500,000 compared to the prior quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased marketing spend as we launched our new marketing campaign in November and increased headcount. Corporate, general and administrative expense declined to $25.2 million, a $3.7 million decrease compared to the first quarter. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in third-party costs related to legal, consulting, and financial reporting, and decreased implementation costs associated with Epic. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in IT license fees, inclusive of Epic, and bad debt. Net loss was $3.8 million, compared to net loss of $11 million in the first quarter. We recorded a net loss per share of $0.03 on both a basic and diluted basis, and our weighted average share count was approximately 135.9 million shares for the quarter on both a basic and fully diluted basis. Adjusted EBITDA, which we calculate by adding interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization, M&A and de novo center development expenses, and other non-recurring or exceptional costs to net loss, was $7.8 million for the quarter, compared to $2.2 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.1% for the second quarter, compared to 1.2% in the first quarter. De novo losses for the second quarter were $2.2 million, and related to our acquisition of Concerto PACE, which occurred on December 01, in our centers in Florida. This compares to $1.6 million of de novo losses in the first quarter. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $54.1 million in cash and cash equivalents, plus $44.7 million in short-term investment. We had $83.7 million in total debt on the balance sheet, representing debt under our senior secured term loan, plus finance lease obligations and other commitments. For the second quarter, we recorded negative cash flow from operations of $9.3 million, and we had $1.6 million in capital expenditures, excluding the purchase price of Concerto PACE. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance, which now includes the Concerto PACE acquisition. Based on the information as of today, we expect our ending census for fiscal year 2024 to be between 6,800 and 7,400 participants, and member month to be in the range of 79,000 to 83,000. We are projecting total revenue in the range of $725 million to $775 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $12 million to $18 million. Finally, we anticipate that de nova losses for fiscal 2024 will be in the $10 million to $12 million range, which again is inclusive of our recent acquisition of Concerto PACE. In closing, I want to reiterate Patrick's comments, as we believe we are continuing to make improvements to the business every quarter. We remain focused on all aspects of the business to drive near-term and longer-term value, and we look forward to providing more details at our upcoming Investor Day on the 27th of February. We will provide details on the event later this week. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, and at this time, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Jason Cassorla from Citi. Your line is open.\nJason Cassorla: Great, thanks for taking my questions. Ben, you noted a Medicare true up in the quarter. Apologies if I missed this, but can you help size that true up? And I guess in that context, you've previously discussed or suggested a strong kind of back half EBITDA ramp, as the fruits of your clinical value initiatives come to fruition, but in your prepared remarks, you talked about seasonality related to MA open enrolment period and other nuances. Maybe in all that, can you just walk through how you're thinking about EBITDA progression for the rest of 2024 as well?\nBenjamin Adams: Sure, sure and nice to hear your voice. So a couple of things are embedded in that question. The first is, sorry, the first is that we are on track for our guidance that we issued earlier in the year, so we're reaffirming our guidance. I'd say over the course of the year, not unexpectedly, there are some puts and takes that get us there. So we had a final, final adjustment, which was a rate true up related to 2022, and it had to do with the fact that CMS gave us a little extra time in terms of submitting that, and it was a COVID-related factor. That came through in the second quarter, and that was a sort of meaningful increase to what we received in terms of Medicare rates in that quarter. We haven't disclosed or broken out the numbers specifically in part because there are a number of factors that go into the course of the year. We just chose not to break out individual ones, but that gave us a good boost going into the back half of the year. Another factor that came into play here was a reduction in rates in California, which we're going to see in the back half of the year. That was an unexpected reduction versus a modest increase that we had in the forecast or in the budget going forward. And those two items, to a large extent, sort of offset each other, and so that puts us on path towards getting to guidance for the back of the year. A couple other things I would say about enrolment. There is a seasonal component to enrolment, and Patrick, I know, will want to comment on that a little bit further, but that affects us as we go into the first quarter of the year, but by and large, all of these things together, as we look at the components together, end up with us reaffirming guidance and ending up with us being where we think we're going to come at, but as we indicated earlier in the year, we're quite confident on the destination towards which we're heading, but in any one particular quarter, or we'll have slightly different factors that get us to that destination.\nPatrick Blair: Hey, Jason, good to hear from you. Just two things maybe I may add to what Ben said is, those relates to risk adjustment accuracy. You probably recall us highlighting that as one of the core sort of pillars of building out our payer capabilities, and CMS had extended a deadline for submission of 2022, calendar year 2022 risk scores. And so it gave us some extra time, and we were probably a little conservative on, given it was the first time we'd gone through it, really as a team, an initiative like that, a bit conservative on our accrual. I think we're dialing that in and getting a better sense of that. We've got some third parties helping us to produce better estimates of risk or accuracy changes. I think in the future, I'm hoping that it's going to optimize our forecasting as well, and we'll just do a better job of understanding what period things are going to hit, and how does it compare to our accrual and then on Ben's point related to seasonality, this was a fairly sort of loud and frenetic Medicare Advantage year. There was more direct-to-consumer marketing than I think we've ever seen in our markets and I think what Ben's hitting on is, we'd really like to get a full fiscal year under our belt to see all the cycles, to see all the seasonality that's relevant to our business and I think for those reasons, some of what's coming from that kind of annual election period doesn't hit us until Q3, and we're starting to try to understand what that means and does it have any impact on our growth, etcetera and then the CDI delays, I won't call out a specific, but for example, we had a nice opportunity that we saw where we were paying significantly above market rates for some ancillary services and we were very successful in negotiating the contract. We probably under clubbed the implementation complexity to get that rolled out on the timeline that we thought, it as a result that CDI impact is delayed later in the year and I think that's the kind of thing that Ben's hitting on by suggesting we're going to sort of stick with our guidance because there's a lot of puts and takes.\nBenjamin Adams: Yeah, and I think of that one CDI point, it's important to recognize that we're going to get the targeted amount of dollar savings that we always intended to get, but the contract really just started a couple of months later because it took a little longer to implement and negotiate.\nJason Cassorla: Got it, okay, all very helpful, appreciate it. Maybe to the point around California, right? I wanted to ask just broadly around the PMPM rate development backdrop, how should we think about the moving pieces on the Medicaid side, right? Perhaps if you expect any other material changes to kind of mid calendar year rate development, how rate discussions with state partners developing, now that the enhanced FMAP is winding down. And then I'll just tell me, I may come in on the other component, right? The proposed 2025 rate would suggest another sort of kind of tough year on that front. I guess I'm curious on how you're thinking about the MA side of the rate equation for the second half of this fiscal year and moving into 2025, will be helpful, thanks.\nPatrick Blair: I'll start, Ben, you may clean me up. I think we're probably more focused on Medicaid rates, it is still probably a bit too early to know what that's going to look like in the next fiscal year. I think what Ben pointed out is in California, we came in below what we had targeted. I would qualify that by saying that, think of that as an industry impact in terms of pace and not an InnovAge specific impact. Lots of moving parts, but one notable part is -- notable driver would be the periods of time that states use in the rate build-up and with the passage of time, the further we get from COVID, the more reflective, actual experiences, predicting future experience, reclaims perspective. There's still a lot of noise, if you will, in the rate setting process that I think is a little bit of the lingering impacts of the data set related to COVID. So California's, I think, are only staying on a fiscal year. So, it's having an unexpected impact in the back half of this fiscal year. Ben, can you add?\nBenjamin Adams: No, I think it's absolutely right.\nJason Cassorla: Okay, understood, thanks. If I could squeeze in one last one, I just wanted to quickly follow up on cash flow. It looks like there's a $25 million headwind on deferred revenue year to date. Can you just help reconcile what that was related to? If there's any color there?\nBenjamin Adams: Yeah, the deferred revenue really relates to Medicare and it relates to how the first day of a month falls relative to a weekend. So what happens is if the first of the month falls on like a Sunday, if you will, well, Medicare payments or reimbursements are due in the first of the month. What happens is we receive it on the Friday beforehand. So essentially in the prior month, if you will, by a couple of days. So when that occurs, we set up a deferred revenue account to adjust for that. When all of a sudden the first of a month falls on a weekday, that gets cleaned up in the following quarter. So when you think about that deferred revenue payment, think about it as does the first of the month fall on a weekend or not and how does that impact the timing of the Medicare payment?\nOperator: And our next question will come from Jared Haase from William Blair. Your line is open.\nJared Haase: Yeah, hey guys. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the questions. The first one from us, we're just hoping to dig into the de nova ramp a little bit. Congrats on getting the Tampa facility open. Could you maybe just walk through or remind us a little bit on what the expectations are in terms of how both census and profitability ramp for a de nova facility? And I think a related question here, obviously with the concerns of acquisition in mind, maybe you could talk a little bit about how that profitability ramp kind of informs the equation in terms of your perception of sort of a build versus buy opportunity in terms of future growth. Thanks.\nBenjamin Adams: Yeah, sure. Why don't I start it off here and then Patrick will jump in with some comments here. First of all, thanks for the congrats. It was a great transaction for us. We're really excited about it. If you were to think about the Concerto acquisition, I guess really think of it as two facilities. There's one which is in Crenshaw, which is up and running, but it's a very small census. So think of that as almost like a de-risk de novo because our census is in the, call it 20 folks. And then think about the Bakersfield one, which is a center that's essentially fully constructed, basically awaiting approval to open, right? So when we look at that acquisition, we think of it as a basically de-risk de novo. But generally the way we think about de novo's is that it will take us on the order of six quarters, probably to fill them up to the point where we get to a positive center level contribution margin. And then it'll take us some time beyond that before they hit maturity. But really it's in that first six quarters that we really watch the cash flow impact, especially carefully, because we obviously want to get them up to be contributors as quickly as possible. And so when we do our forecasting and we go through our strategic analysis about do we want to do de novo's or do we want to do acquisitions, or in this case kind of a hybrid de novo, that's the way we model out the business.\nPatrick Blair: Yeah, I'll just add, I mentioned the Investor Day on February 27. One of our goals at Investor Day is to bring more clarity to the de novo ramp up and sort of the unit economics of the business. So we'll do that. In terms of what to expect with the de novo, each market is different. There's different density, there's different managed care landscape, different alternatives, but I would say that Sacramento's probably not a bad proxy for what we think we can accomplish in say a Tampa or an Orlando. It's a big market. There's a lot of opportunity and we feel pretty good about our offering and we've got a great team on the ground and we've got a grand opening scheduled I think on March 03rd, 04th, excuse me and so we've got a great opportunity just to introduce that product to the community and we're feeling really good about it. And we're also feeling good about Sacramento growth. Just as, while it's not a new market, in terms of a timeline, it was sanctioned not long after it was operational. So in many ways, Sacramento is a new market as we think about the ramp and we're really pleased with how the team is doing there.\nJared Haase: Okay, that's super helpful. Thank you for that. And then I wanted to follow up and I think the theme of some administrative delays kind of at the state level, that's maybe creating a little bit of a headwind for enrolment trends. I think that's come up in recent quarters. I was curious, is there anything that you guys are able to do internally in terms of once you've identified an eligible potential participant, sort of working with them, working with their families, maybe helping them get through that process and maybe speed up some of that time? Is that something that you have any control over or is it largely out of your hands?\nPatrick Blair: Well, it is a great question. I tend to ask the team the same question as well. When there are delays that are sort of outside of our locus of control, are there things we can do to still help the family see the end of the process and feel confident that this is going to be the right solution and it's kind of worth the wait? So we certainly do engage with individuals and their family and make them aware of administrative processing delays and set their expectations of when we think enrolment will occur. And more times than not, we're certainly able to achieve that and keep that individual in the funnel and get them access to the services that they need. At the same time, we're dealing with a very vulnerable population and most of the individuals that are looking to access PACE are in need of rather immediate services and so delays with the processing of applications at the state can and do result in people making alternative choices. Sometimes it's going back into the state fee-for-service program. Sometimes it could be, if it's in California, it could be with a PACE competitor in the same territory or they could pursue maybe Medicare Advantage in the belief that there's an option there, but it is definitely something we do our best to manage. We're working very closely with our states audit. The states have been great partners. It's just the reality that they often use subcontractors for this work and that adds a layer of complexity for us to manage.\nJared Haase: Okay, that makes sense and I appreciate that context there. And maybe I'll just sneak in one more question. It sounded like you launched a new marketing campaign during the quarter. Would love to just hear any specifics in terms of anything that's maybe unique or has changed from prior years in terms of just how you're sort of communicating the message about InnovAge services.\nPatrick Blair: Yeah, another great question. We'll be sharing some of our latest creative, if you will, at our Investor Day. And so people get a better sense for it if they haven't seen at least our broadcast TV work. I think one of the things that we're trying to do is to dispel that PACE is only for the absolute most vulnerable. There are a lot of individuals that qualify for PACE that see PACE as a place to enjoy socialization, meet new friends, address nutritional deficits and that's a large senior population. And so I think we've tried to use our creative to drive a message home that PACE is a real resource to a broad segment of the frail senior community. I think maybe a second thing that's new is we're trying to appeal more directly to family members. I think in many cases, family members find PACE as much a solution for them as they do for their loved one. And I think our messaging is starting to appeal to the eldest daughter. Our data will tell us that that's a big decision maker as an example and so I think we're just trying to appeal to a broader market segment and I think we've been successful with that. We've got a lot of great feedback on the creative.\nJared Haase: Perfect, makes a lot of sense. I'll go ahead and leave it there and hop back in the queue. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Jamie Perse from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJamie Perse: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just starting with the Colorado enrolment trends, can you provide a little more detail on just the census rebuild there and patient mix that you're getting? I think you mentioned some balance between community versus facility patients broadly, but any surprises there just in terms of the patient mix and the broader trends on Colorado census rebuild?\nPatrick Blair: Jamie, I think I would say that everything's going as we expected and hoped in Colorado. I think we're on the other side of what might've been some pent-up demand and I would say that that pent-up demand was maybe less reflective of a traditional participant mix. I think we're on the other side of that. At the same time, I think that, at least our gross enrolments are back to sort of the best period in the company's history. So, coming out of sanctions, we set a goal for ourselves, at least near term, to let's get the company back on kind of the track it was in sort of doing all the right things. And I think we're seeing that. At the same time, it's an example of a market where, the demand is probably a bit larger than what's getting processed through the funnel and we are working closely on that issue, but still it's leading to responsible growth in Colorado and we're feeling really good about it.\nJamie Perse: Okay, thanks for that. And then just on the seasonality comments, you talked about in-patient in the quarter. Any way to put numbers to that just in terms of how that impacted external provider costs in the quarter? And then as we think about your third fiscal quarter, how should we be modelling that rolling off? What's typical from a seasonality perspective as some of those inpatient costs come down?\nPatrick Blair: First I would say the seasonality, the relevance of a seasonality consideration is probably more appropriate through the lens of the third quarter versus the second quarter, because people are going through the annual election period and it's really going to hit us if people decided to leave PACE for Medicare Advantage. We're just now kind of seeing that in the numbers. I don't think we actually have a good read yet on, what's the right seasonality, sort of cycle for the business. One day we will see information that I think gives us confidence that the seasonality could be muted, and the next day we see something to the contrary. And so I think we're still trying to figure out exactly what's the right guidance around seasonality and it's just going to take -- it's going to take some experience, real time to offer that. Ben, anything you would add in terms of?\nBenjamin Adams: No, I think the second part of your question, I think was really geared towards how do I think about census and member months for the back half of the year? And I guess I would tell you that, we're not really providing any guidance on a quarter-by-quarter basis. You've got the data now on enrolment and member months for Q1 and Q2. If there's any seasonality in enrolment, it's really probably related to the third quarter, which tends to be a little bit lower for the reasons that Patrick just articulated. But then if you think about where we are in terms of our guidance targets being unchanged from where we were originally, I think you can take those three pieces of information, put them together and come up with a reasonable expectation for how we might perform over the back half of the year.\nJamie Perse: Okay, and then last quick one for me, just on maybe longer term gross margin progression, you've talked in the past about rebuilding that, maybe with different building blocks between the COGS lines. How are you feeling broadly about that margin recovery? Any areas you'd flag as being ahead or behind of your expectations and level of confidence in rebuilding that over the next 12 months to 18 months?\nPatrick Blair: Yeah, great question. I'll start and let Ben weigh in. I would, when I think about margin, I think we're beginning to think about it across two dimensions in the business. I think the first priority is to get our overall center level contribution margin above 20%. And we want to do that across the portfolio and that's inclusive of the investments we've made to fortify quality and compliance technology over the last year. And then I think, sort of the next consideration is more around this adjusted EBITDA target and we believe we can substantially achieve a high single digit, low double digit adjusted EBITDA. But as we've talked about before, it could have a little different composition on how it's achieved, because we're running a little heavier on the salaries, wages and benefits in the market, not only because of we've hired more staff and fortified our operating model, but there's national, excuse me, natural inflationary factors that are a part of that as well that we and other healthcare organizations are dealing with. And the long-term margin targets, I think we think of those inclusive of additional scale over time, because as we grow, we're going to continue to leverage our corporate G&A, our Epic investment, etcetera. So at this stage, I think we're feeling confident, but we're very focused on the CLCM as sort of that leading indicator of what's achievable further down on the P&L. Ben, anything to add?\nBenjamin Adams: No, I think you've captured it perfectly.\nJamie Perse: Appreciate it, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn it back to Patrick Blair for any closing remarks.\nPatrick Blair: Well, appreciate those of you who took the time to dial in and hear more about our progress. I think I'll close with how I opened. We're improving the business every quarter. Delivering on that commitment is extremely important to myself and to the team. And, you know, I think the second is just transparency. We're trying to provide as much information as possible to help you really understand how the business is operating and you can count on us to be as transparent as possible with everything that we face as we transform the company. And then I just would like to encourage everyone to join us, whether that's in person or through a recorded call, Investor Day on February 27 and the goal there is to sort of reintroduce you to the company with a bit more detail than we're able to provide here on these calls and answer your questions and give you just a deeper look at the business and introduce you to what I think is a fantastic leadership team that can run a much larger company and we're excited to share the story with you.\nOperator: Thank you for participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ryan Kubota, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nRyan Kubota: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining the InnovAge fiscal 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. With me today is Patrick Blair, President and CEO; Benjamin Adams, CFO; Dr. Rich Feifer, our Chief Medical Officer, will also be joining the Q&A portion of the call. Today, after the market closed, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our quarterly results. You may access the release on our company website, innovate.com. For those listening to the rebroadcast of this call, we remind you that the remarks made herein are as of today, Tuesday, November 7, 2023, and have not been updated subsequent to this call.  During our call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fiscal first quarter 2024 earnings release, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. We will also be making forward-looking statements, including statements related to our future growth prospects, Florida de novo centers, potential acquisitions, our payer capabilities and clinical value initiatives, the status of current and future regulatory actions and other expectations.  Listeners are cautioned that all of our forward-looking statements involve certain assumptions and are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause our actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. We advise listeners to review the risk factors discussed in our Form 10-K annual report for fiscal year 2023 and our subsequent reports filed with the SEC, including our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for our fiscal first quarter 2024. After the completion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions.  I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Patrick Blair.\nPatrick Blair: Thank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to begin by expressing my ongoing gratitude to our InnovAge colleagues, participants, government partners and the investor communities for the organization. As it's only been 2 months since we reported fiscal year '23 results on September 12. My remarks will be brief and hit on our results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and progress in our key focus areas.  The company's first quarter results were in line with our expectations and reflect continued momentum in our people, service, quality, growth and financial performance measures. Our progress in these areas gives us confidence that we're growing our business in a financially responsible way, delivering high-quality service to our participants, all while ensuring their employees are engaged and committed to our mission. I'll spend more time on these areas in a moment.  We reported revenue of $182.5 million, an increase of approximately 3.2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year '23 and center level contribution margin of $27.9 million, which represents a 15.3% margin. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 million for the quarter, which represents a significant improvement compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, which was approximately $700,000. Census increased to 6,580 which represents a quarter-over-quarter improvement of 2.8%. The results represent continued sequential improvement, and we remain convinced that we have the capacity to deliver even more value to our federal, state and shareholder partners over time.  We have the right team in place, and we continue to build and enhance our processes and technology. It now boils down to driving consistent execution. That said, we're still in the early innings, post-sanctions, and on the path back to unlocking the full potential of the organization. We remain focused on growing into the stock capacity at our existing centers, which is creating operating leverage in enabling contribution margin improvement through incremental enrollments until we reach targeted staffing ratios, particularly in the Colorado market, enrollment growth is driving better center labor utilization, and this is also helping rebalance our mix of new and tenured participants, which should improve participant PMPM expense over time.  While we remain steadfast and are sissy, it will take us time to achieve the full impact forwarders. For example, while overall external provider costs were modestly higher than fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023, we observed positive trends within the quarter, which indicates the clinical value initiatives we launched in early late last year are starting to impact our medical costs. As we noted in our last call, we expect improvement in our medical costs throughout the fiscal year as our initiatives mature and growth positively impacts our participant mix.  Turning back to our performance across people, service, quality, growth and financial measures. We've just concluded our quarterly reporting for employee engagement, our people measure, participant in Net Promoter Score or NPS or service measure and clinical quality. Our employee engagement score increased by 5% to 77%, reflecting increases in 12 of our centers. Our participant NPS increased by 13 points to 47%, reflecting improvement in 15 of our centers. And based on the NPS methodology, we believe our score positions us comparatively among the top tier of health care organizations.  From a quality perspective, we're seeing solid results in inpatient utilization, fall rates and cognitive screens, among others, and we believe our results reflect top-tier performance and on PACE organizations. It's our strong belief that we have highly engaged employees, delivering great service and quality, growth and financial performance will follow. I'll now spend a few minutes walking through our key focus areas.  Starting with existing center growth, new participant monthly gross enrollment is back to pre-sanction levels. We enrolled over 200 participants across all of our centers in both August and September, which is consistent with the company's best presanction periods. Specifically, the enrollment ramp in our previously sanctioned markets continues to gain momentum as Sacramento was now at presanction levels, and Colorado has seen monthly sequential improvement over the last 6 months.  Further, our East region gross enrollments were up 33% for the first quarter of fiscal year '24 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year '23. Contributing to our post-sanction enrollment ramp is the success of our new digital marketing initiatives. We've seen first quarter sales qualified leads increased by approximately 75% year-over-year, which gives us increasing confidence that our marketing messages are reaching our target audiences, and there is strong interest in our value proposition from underserved seniors, looking for services and support to help them stay simply in their homes as they age. Given the increased digital lead volume, we've made a modest investment in an inside sales team that has worked in the digital leads, which allows our field enrollment teams to remain focused on self-generated needs from our community referral partners. While it's still early days for the inside sales capability, we're optimistic about the impact on growth, field enrollment productivity and reducing participant acquisition costs. You'll recall last quarter, we touched on enrollment as a joint effort between innovation and our state partners and the state subcontractors who may perform assessments, validate our assessments and ultimately process the applications and activate new enrollments. We continue to observe situational delays in some markets in the processing of enrollment applications, and we primarily attribute this to state resource insurance. While this doesn't impact the eligibility of our prospective participants, it can delay enrollments and cause eligible participants to seek other solutions. We are working collaboratively with all the stakeholders for which we have some dependency to address delays proactively as they surface to ensure we can enroll deserving seniors as quickly as possible. I'd like to take a moment to thank our partners for their ongoing support and collaboration as we work together to help more seniors benefit from PACE. In Florida, we continue to make progress on the administrative requirements to open centers in Tampa and Orlando. We recently moved to the next stage of the process at Tampa, which is the final review by CMS. In Orlando, we conducted the state readiness review in October and anticipate feedback imminently. You'll recall from last quarter's update, that we're targeting opening around the end of the calendar year. While we are doing everything in our control to open these centers as quickly as we can. Now all the steps are in our locus of control, and it is becoming increasingly likely that opening dates for Tampon Orlando could shift to early in the new year.  Overall, we remain enthusiastic that these 2 centers will expand our total center and census capacity by over 20% and believe each center with sites capacity of 1,300 will meaningfully increase our overall organic growth curve over the next couple of years. Regarding our de novo Syntron in California, a large market, Southeast of Los Angeles, we continue to work with the Department of Health care services in California toward a midyear calendar 2024 opening. We're excited to get these new centers up and running and serving the communities.  In addition to same-center organic growth, we believe these new locations create visibility into multiyear double-digit top line growth and embedded future earnings. Operationally, we continue to make meaningful progress improving how we're managing our centers according to what we call the One Innovate way. We're reducing variation in business processes, policies and procedures among our centers, which is leading to improvements in operational clients, productivity, clinical quality and unit economics across our platform.  Clinically, we continue to strengthen our payer capabilities through our clinical value initiatives. This quarter, we achieved meaningful improvements in inpatient utilization, which was 5.3% relative to 5.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year '23. We've kept our short-stay skilled nursing utilization rate below 2% this quarter, which you'll recall was down approximately 23% in fiscal year '23 relative to fiscal year 2022. And we've begun transitioning our assisted living facility in nursing home providers into high-performing networks, which include providers who consistently deliver more compliant and higher quality care, lower cost and are more collaborative with our care teams. We're excited about the impact this will have on the quality of care we can offer our participants.  Further, we continue to work with our vendors to identify improvements in risk for capture accuracy. Counterbalancing the improvements in utilization that we're seeing, we have observed some modest increase in inpatient unit cost and higher outpatient services utilization in the first quarter, which isn't unexpected as we continue to work through the wondering risk pool impacts of the Colorado station on participant acuity. We continue to work through the multiple levers to get to targeted levels and ensure a financially attractive margin overall.  Regarding technology, we have 14 of our 17 centers live on Epic, with the remainder scheduled for the second fiscal quarter. Though it takes time to realize the full extent of anticipated benefits of our new system, we're encouraged by the operational efficiencies that are emerging in the positive feedback our administrative and clinical teams are sharing. For example, since going live in Pennsylvania, Virginia and Colorado, we have exchanged over 200,000 participant health records with specialists and hospital partners using Epic's interoperability capability within their provider ecosystem.  Previously, this level of health information exchange consumes significant labor and time and was prone to inefficiency and rework. Now we have a single record source, which is shared and available real time with many of our external partners. We expect that in time, the network effect will grow, and it will enable better service, access, quality, cost and labor efficiency.  Further, Epic ranks its users against the overall Epic community as our clinicians go live and features are implemented. As a testament to our early progress, Epic has shared with us that we're in the top quartile of feature adoption in the areas of physician productivity, nurse productivity and population health intent. As I've mentioned, these are all dials and not switches, but we're pleased to see these activities starting to have an impact and ultimately value in our business.  In summary, we're just beginning to unlock the full potential of the organization. I greatly appreciate the continued commitment from our more than 2,100 colleagues nationally and the ongoing support of our valued government partners. We remain focused on demonstrating incremental improvement quarter-over-quarter in each of our focus areas. I believe there is momentum building from our team's work. And in time, this will translate to improved financial performance and enable us to return to normalized margins. We are humbled by the responsibility to serve the many underserved pay cells in our communities and are thrilled to be returning to responsible growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Ben to review the financials in detail.\nBenjamin Adams: Thank you, Patrick. Today, I will provide some highlights from our first quarter fiscal year 2024 financial performance compared to the fourth quarter as well as provide insight into some of the trends we are seeing evident to the winter months of the year. While it's still early in the fiscal year, we continue to track and make progress on the guidance targets we provided on our fourth quarter earnings call.  Starting with Census, we ended the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 with 17 centers and approximately 6,580 participants as of September 30, 2023. This represents an ending census increase of 2.8% compared to last quarter. We reported approximately 19,540 member months in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, a 2.3% increase compared to the fourth quarter. Total revenue increased by 3.2% to $182.5 million in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in member months coupled with an increase in capitation rates associated with annual Medicaid rate increases effective July 1, and partially offset by favorable Medicare risk or true-ups recorded in the fourth quarter.  We incurred $99.4 million of external provider costs during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, a 4.6% increase compared to the fourth quarter. The sequential increase was driven by an increase in member months as we continue to grow Census coupled with an increase in cost per participant. The cost per participant increase was driven by higher assisted living and nursing facility unit costs as a result of annual provider increases, higher cost per admission due to acuity and an increase in pharmacy expense. These costs were partially offset by reductions in permanent and short-stay nursing facility utilization and a reduction in inpatient utilization. Cost of care, excluding depreciation and amortization of $55.3 million was 3.5% higher compared to the fourth quarter.  Primary cost drivers include salaries, wages and benefits primarily associated with annual merit increases and an increase in fleet and contract transportation utilization as a result of census growth, higher fuel costs, vehicle repairs and maintenance. These costs were partially offset by a reduction in third-party audit remediation and consulting costs. Central level contribution margin, which we define as total revenue less external provider costs and cost of care, excluding depreciation and amortization, was $27.9 million for the quarter compared to $28.5 million in the fourth quarter.  As a percentage of revenue, center level contribution margin was 15.3% compared to 16.1% in the fourth quarter. Sales and marketing expense was $5.4 million, a $750,000 decrease compared to the prior quarter. The decrease was mainly due to lower marketing spend as we focused on our digital channels in the first quarter ahead of a new marketing campaign that we launched this month. Corporate, general and administrative expense declined slightly to $28.9 million, a $50,000 decrease compared to the fourth quarter. Net loss was $11 million compared to a net loss of $12 million in the fourth quarter.  We reported a net loss per share of $0.08 on both a basic and diluted basis. And our weighted average share count was approximately 135.8 million shares for the quarter on both a basic and fully diluted basis. Adjusted EBITDA, which we calculate by adding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, de novo losses and other nonrecurring or exceptional cost to net loss, was $2.2 million for the quarter compared to $700,000 in the fourth quarter.  Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 1.2% for the fiscal year compared to 0.4% in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 million is inclusive of de novo losses, which was $1.6 million for the first quarter and primarily related to our centers in Florida. This compares to $1.5 million of de novo losses in the fourth quarter. Turning to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $88.4 million in cash and cash equivalents, plus $46.8 million in short-term investments. We had $85.5 million in total debt on the balance sheet, representing debt under our senior secured term loan plus finance lease obligations and other commitments.  For the first quarter, we recorded negative cash flow from operations of $33.6 million, inclusive of approximately $15 million in delayed payments from California that we received in October and we had $2.6 million of capital expenditures.  Finally, I will briefly touch on some of the trends that are developing as we head into the winter months. Regarding Census, our census growth is tracking in line with our guidance expectations. As Patrick mentioned, we continue to expect that states will have short-term constraints around their ability to process new enrollments as they prioritize their needs to process Medicaid redeterminations along with their other obligations. However, we are not seeing that impact our Census in a meaningful way. Regarding revenue and rates, we have yet to finalize Medicaid rates in New Mexico and remain in active discussions with the state for fiscal year 2024. In California, we have started the annual rate process with the state, and we expect to know more about the state's timing in the coming weeks.  Regarding cost trends, as we head into the winter months, it is important to remember that we typically see an increase in external provider costs as a result of seasonality. Specifically, we expect to see higher inpatient and short-stay nursing home utilization as well as increased acuity of our participant mix.  In closing, we continue to focus on improving the margin profile of the business by concentrating on the key drivers we highlighted last quarter. Accelerating census growth, which also serves to rebalance the participant risk pool as well as unlock staffing capacity, ensuring our participant risk scores are commensurate with our risk pool through improved participant data management as we fully implement Epic, optimizing revenue per participant through proactive actuarial discussions with our state Medicaid agencies and executing on clinical value initiatives to improve participant care and reduce unnecessary costs. We hope to share more information on these key initiatives on our next call. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jamie Perse with Goldman Sachs.\nJamie Perse: I wanted to start with just some of the comments on enrollment trends and just your level of confidence in the guidance that you laid out so far and your progress this year. Maybe comment on the headwind you're experiencing in terms of enrollment, how much that impacts guidance for the year? And then also just the Florida delay and potential opening of those centers in the early part of next calendar year. How much was contemplated in guidance with respect to that? And should we be thinking about that as a headwind relative to your prior guidance?\nPatrick Blair: Well, thanks, Jamie. I'll get to start and then hand it over to Ben. In terms of just our confidence levels and momentum around enrollment and we're feeling very good about the progress we're making across all of our markets. We're pushing ourselves every month on this every month, I'm pushing the team to find some new way to accelerate our growth. And I think the team is doing a great job. I think in my prepared remarks, I talked a bit about the inside sales capability, which is a new capability that we're seeing is some early indicators that it's going to have an impact.  And I think there's still incremental opportunities out there to become more efficient, more productive, but when we look at Colorado or Sacramento, some of the new markets that are coming online, we're feeling really positive about the momentum that the team is building. And in our markets that have been online for a while, we're achieving some better growth rates than we have in the past.  So overall, feeling really good about that. In terms of the headwinds, I think you're referring to just comments related to the processing of enrollments. And we pointed that out a couple of times. I think last quarter was the first time we raised that. Really, as I said in the remarks, it's really situational. It's not happening in every market. We're working through each of those issues with those states.  At this point, we're not concerned that as a wider scale issue that we have to be concerned with the team is just doing a good job. It's just one of those things that I think it's the first time we've really seen resource constraints in some of our markets as it relates to processing enrollments. And we know both our states and CMS have a lot on their plate as it relates to redetermination. So I think those are some of the highlights on existing growth. I'll pass it over to Ben out here to hit Florida and sort of how to think about guidance.\nBenjamin Adams: Yes. I mean I think Patrick actually captured most of it there. The one thing I'd say is if you take a look at the growth that we had in the first quarter, both in terms of census and member months and then begin to annualize out those rates, you sort of end up at a place that makes you feel pretty comfortable with that guidance. And if you also look at what's happening, I think, in the enrollments over the last couple of months, it feels like we're building momentum on the enrollment slightly on a month-over-month basis. So I think you sort of factor those things 2 things together, and you feel like we're pretty confident we're going to end up right in the guidance range.\nJamie Perse: My next question is just the external provider costs. Those were a little bit higher than we expected. It sounds like some of that was in Colorado and just the shift in acuity there, the mix of patients. Can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in the inpatient and outpatient utilization trends? And then I guess, just any comments on how to think about the cadence. It sounds like you typically see a step-up in the calendar fourth quarter, your second quarter just around flu and all the dynamics that go with that and as well as COVID. So maybe just any comments to frame what we should think about for the step-up in external provider cost sequentially?\nPatrick Blair: Jimmy. Again, I'll kind of get us started, and then I'll hand it off to Dr. Feifer to put a finer point on it. When I think about from a participant expense perspective, maybe what's not going exactly to plan. And it's really a couple of hotspots around yard emissions. We've always done a great job managing ER admissions, and we saw a little bit of a tick up relative to historical trends and so we've got a number of initiatives lined up against that. I think we have 11 or 12 initiatives that really focus on making sure people call us before they go to an emergency room. And I feel confident in the work that Rich and team are doing.  So I think that's one that hopefully just kind of falls back in the line. The second area is around inpatient unit costs. As we noted, we're seeing some improvements in inpatient utilization, and I think maybe that's a variance with what some of the other payers might be reporting. For us, it's probably, hypothesis makes more acuity but on the unit cost side. And so we're digging into that, trying to answer why that's happening, but I'll let Rich just go a little bit deeper on each of those. And then your point about seasonality, it will play a role given how frail our population is for sure, whether that be flu or COVID.  So it will be a perfect straight line quarter-by-quarter of the drop in the anticipated, I should say, the anticipated improvements in medical costs. But we think we're doing all the right things. We've got a lot of great initiatives that are underway, and it just takes a while for them to flow through sort of the cost structure. And as you know, at this point, we're really in complete a lot of the claims history. So there's a lot of estimates still in our numbers, and we'll just let those things play through as well. But overall, I'm really feeling good about the team and what they're focused on. But let me ask Rich to hit his fire points on each of those.\nDr. Rich Feifer: Great. Thanks, Patrick. Let me pick up where you left off on the second question about respiratory illness and seasonality. We are already seeing an uptick in respiratory illness, but we are not seeing that translate into higher inpatient utilization at this point. Although we do anticipate that to some extent, and we budget for it. We are working really hard to maximize influenza and COVID vaccination rates to protect our population. We are seeing more COVID just as everyone is seeing in the community, but so far, most of those cases are actually mild even in our vulnerable population. Back to the point about outpatient utilization, as Patrick said, we are seeing very effective reductions through a lot of the interventions of our team reductions in inpatient utilization. And in some ways, that's leaving those who are ultimately admitted to be more severely afflicted and have higher unit costs because they are the ones who really need to be admitted. So in some ways, it shouldn't be surprising to us that we're seeing some increase in severity or acuity in addition to the aging of our population, but we're working on that very closely to ensure that there are things that we could mitigate whether they be rates or steerage to lower-cost providers. I'd also echo Patrick's point around ER diversion because we are seeing increases in ER utilization, which are going in the other direction from inpatient. Part of that relates to our facility partners, assisted living facilities and nursing homes and to Patrick's point earlier around moving to a high-performance network part of our definition of a high-performance network going forward will be how well those facilities work with us when there's a minor change of conditions so that we can address that change of condition without utilizing the emergency so it's a key intervention going forward.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair.\nMadeline Mollman: This is actually Madeline on for Matt. Kind of following up on the patient acuity question. I know one of the things that you are anticipating once sort of the sanctions were lifted, was that the pace and acuity mix would normalize a little bit because you were able to enroll new patients. Can you talk a little bit about like what you're seeing in terms of new enrollee patient acuity and how that mix might have changed now that you've had a couple of months of being able to enroll patients?\nPatrick Blair: Sure. I'll start again and have Rich filling gaps. The first thing I would say is that the sort of the mix issue is obviously very dependent on the rate of growth of our new enrollment and the progression of our existing patient base and discipline, frankly, that's attributable to death. So all those factors come kind of play into the risk pool changing. What I would say is, if I think about the mix of new participants, again, still early because it's there was a bit of a ramp in Colorado, in particular. But I think one of the things we're starting to see is fewer people enrolling with us that are in an assisted living facility. Pace is a great solution for people, and that's an important lever for us to avoid nursing facility care.  And I think historically, we maybe saw a little bit higher levels assisted living facility enrollments. I think we're starting to see some of that, let's call it, backlog, pent-up demand, maybe starting to play through. So our mix is increasingly looking more and more what we would expect a community mix to look like between people in nursing homes, people in assisted living and people who are coming to us living independently.  So still early, but seeing some good signs that, again, the work that Rich is leading is having an impact. And our high-performing network is another great example of making sure we're providing all the access that's necessary for this.\nDr. Rich Feifer: Well, yes, exactly, as Patrick said, we are seeing lower acuity people being enrolled than our existing population by definition because these are people who are living either independently or in assisted living. Now we have had and seen a backlog of interested people, people wanting to enroll an innovate pace who were living in assisted living in Colorado. And as that backlog work to sell out, we're seeing much higher rates of true independent living, and so our acuity and our mix will become even more favorable over time.\nMadeline Mollman: Got it. That's really helpful. And then just one more on the de novos. With the Florida de novos maybe being pushed back a little bit. Is that changing how you're thinking about this full year de novo losses?\nPatrick Blair: Yes. I mean the for facilities, if they're going to get pushed back or get pushed back by a relatively small amount of time, these are things where we might move it back by 4 weeks or 8 weeks. What you find is that, we have de novo losses associated with those facilities. To the extent that those get pushed back, the de novo losses are decreased slightly for the course of the year.  At this point, I think we're sticking with the guidance that we've got related to de novo losses. But as we get towards February, where we hope we're going to have an Investor Day, we'll know a lot more about the business, we'll know a lot more, but timing of floor facilities. And to the extent there are any update to be given then we'll give them that.\nDr. Rich Feifer: Yes I would just add one last point on that is, obviously, we're timing our hiring and being very agile and being absolutely certain that we ensure we don't assume any cost any earlier than is absolutely necessary. So we're managing this very well.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."
