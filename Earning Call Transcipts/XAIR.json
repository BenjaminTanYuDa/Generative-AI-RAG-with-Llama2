At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Corey Davis, LifeSci Advisors. Please go ahead.\nCorey Davis: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, after the market close, we issued a press release announcing the fiscal third quarter 2024 operational highlights and financial results. A copy of this press release can be found on our website, www.beyondair.net under the News & Events section.

Go ahead, Steve.\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Corey, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Today, we announced a strong step in the right direction with a greater than 60% increase in revenue this quarter versus last quarter. While this is a small number in absolute terms, there are several factors that give us confidence in hitting our fiscal year 2025 revenue guidance of $12 million to $16 million. Filters shipped in fiscal 3Q grew by more than 100% compared with shipments in fiscal 2Q. It's important to note that this growth does not yet reflect the software upgrade received from the FDA in September as it takes time for such a manufacturing change to result in upgraded systems. Our first new hospital start with the updated system was on February 1. As this rollout of the new machines has just begun, the financial impact in the March quarter will be a bit muted as compared with the levels of revenue we expect to see in the June quarter. It is important to understand that we will maintain a balance for the next several months between upgrading our existing customer base and adding new customers. The increase in demand for product evaluations has surged since our upgraded system was displayed at the American Academy of Respiratory Care in early November. Since the conference, we have completed, started or definitively scheduled as many evaluations as we have completed in the previous 10 months. Prior to the upgraded system, we had zero multiyear contracts. I am pleased to announce today that we now have three such engagements with more multi-year requests than single-year requests by a wide margin. For reference, upgrading our software removes all compatibility issues, reduces the system noise, improves alarms and improves sensor accuracy. We have told every hospital that we welcome a head-to-head comparison with any competitor in their hospital. However, not surprisingly, we have had very few instances where a competitor was willing to sit in the same room with us at a hospital to cycle through multiple use cases with our system and their system. While still in its early stages, we have also been pleased with the progress made since securing our innovative technology contract award from Vizient, the nation's largest provider-driven healthcare performance improvement company. We're excited by this opportunity to expand our reach through the Vizient customer network. We also anticipate adding LungFit PH to more group purchasing organization platforms over the course of the next year. To capitalize on this positive growth trajectory, we will continue to build out a field team based on the growth opportunities as they evolve. One last point to make on the U.S. nitric oxide market. Our PMA supplement for the expansion of our label to include cardiac surgery was accepted and is under substantive review by the FDA. Our clinical and regulatory team is to be commended for putting together a strong submission. While there is no firm date for FDA to complete their review, we would expect a decision before the end of calendar 2024. Once approval is received, we anticipate an impact on revenue growth after a few months. Looking outside of the United States, we still expect to receive CE Mark in the first half of calendar year 2024. As we have mentioned previously, in addition to opening up doors in Europe for our system, receiving this CE mark will trigger a milestone payment from our partner, Getz Healthcare, which has signed an agreement with us to commercialize LungFit PH in several countries in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan. Moving on to our pipeline. During the quarter, Beyond Cancer announced that its Phase 1 study evaluating ultra-high concentration nitric oxide, or UNO, in advanced relapsed or refractory unresectable primary or metastatic cutaneous and subcutaneous solid tumors has cleared the first cohort of 25,000 parts per million single-dose UNO by the Safety Review Committee with no reported dose-limiting toxicities. This means that there is an UNO dose of 25,000 parts per million nitric oxide that is safe for human use. And given the data shown in November at the SITC conference, there should be confidence there is an immune response much like we saw in preclinical studies. As a reminder, this is a first-in-human study that is being conducted in two parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. The dose escalation part will consist of three UNO dose cohorts, 25,000, 50,000 and 100,000 parts per million nitric oxide, or possibly a concentration below 25,000 parts per million. The dose expansion portion of the study will begin once the recommended dose is determined with the primary objective of the trial to assess safety and tolerability of UNO with a secondary objective of assessment of efficacy by immune biomarker response to UNO therapy. One last note is that we anticipate completing the Phase 1a study and presenting the data in the first half of this calendar year and then initiating a Phase 1b study in the back half of the calendar year, which will include combination therapy with anti-PD-1 therapy, given the strong combination data shown to-date in the preclinical setting. I encourage all of you to visit Beyond Cancer website to get better educated on this potential transformational therapy for those suffering from solid tumors. Our viral community-acquired pneumonia, or VCAP, study is underway. As a reminder, this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study will treat hospitalized patients with 150 parts per million nitric oxide intermittently for up to seven days. Due to viral pneumonia following seasonal patterns of activity, this is a seasonal study running through the fall and winter months. As a result, we have decided to conduct this study over two seasons. Thus, we expect to announce top line data by the middle of calendar year 2025, with interim data updates when appropriate. This will not change the timing for a pivotal study in the '25-'26 season. Obviously, viral pneumonia is a significant unmet medical need given the times we live in. Turning to our autism program. We are pleased that the program remains on track for human data in 2025. Please recall that this early stage development program is being conducted in partnership with The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which continued to produce exciting preclinical data. As a reminder, the data thus far have shown that reducing nitric oxide production by inhibiting neuronal nitric oxide synthase, reduces nitrosative stress biomarkers in the brain and reverses the molecular, synaptic and behavioral autism spectrum disorder associated phenotypes. To be clear, a reversal of behaviors associated with autism was demonstrated in several different genetic mouse models of autism. We believe this program offers tremendous potential and look forward to providing updates as we progress throughout the year. Now, I will turn it over to our CFO, Doug Larson. Doug?\nDouglas Larson: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, are as follows: Revenue for the fiscal quarter was $0.4 million as compared with $0.2 million for the previous quarter and $0 for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. While we are seeing positive operating margins on our individual contracts, there are three reasons why our overall gross margin remains negative. First, we incurred costs related to the software upgrade of the LungFit devices. Note, there will be similar costs for the next two quarters as we complete the upgrade of all of our devices. Second, because we prebuilt several hundred devices that are currently being upgraded, we have depreciation of devices that are not currently generating revenue. Third, consistent with this early stage of growth, we are suboptimal in our physical warehousing infrastructure, but as we grow this effect will dissipate. Our supply chain is committed to being a great partner to the hospitals we engage with and having the right number of high-quality upgraded systems in the right location is key. Research and development expenses for the fiscal quarter were $6.8 million, compared with $5 million for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. Of the $1.8 million incremental spend, $1.2 million was due to development costs associated with our pipeline, mainly from the start of our VCAP study. Investment continued to ramp up in Beyond Cancer, but this was mostly offset by favorable comps in NTM and autism. The remaining $0.6 million was almost exclusively due to loaded salaries in Beyond Air's R&D teams. SG&A expenses for the fiscal quarter were $9.8 million compared with $8.9 million for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. The $0.8 million increase was mainly due to stock-based compensation and salaries with the majority being noncash compensation. Other income and expense for the fiscal quarter showed a $0.2 million loss compared with a $0.2 million gain for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. There's a lot of moving parts again this quarter, but the biggest movers are an increase in interest expense of $0.8 million, being partially offset by a $0.4 million increase from gains in our marketable securities. For the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023, on a GAAP basis, the company recorded a net loss of $17.1 million, of which $16.1 million or $0.50 per share was attributable to the shareholders of Beyond Air, Inc. compared with a net loss of $12.7 million or $0.43 a share for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022. Net cash used in the quarter ended December 31, 2023 was $12.7 million. We alluded to a higher cash burn this quarter in our last call, with payments required towards our VCAP study, development of our Gen 2 device, continued in-human trials in Beyond Cancer and advances in our autism program. We also raised $5.5 million on our ATM in the quarter to partially compensate the planned cash burn. As of December 31, 2023, the company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $31.4 million. And as a reminder, we also have $5.2 million held on deposit by our contract manufacturer. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Steve.\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Doug. We will now take any questions you may have.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Bednar: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions here, guys. If I could just start maybe on some of the recent developments, clearly, some more steps forward on the contracting front, some wins you mentioned there, that's all good. When I step back and think about where we're at in the context of your $12 million to $16 million revenue guidance for next year, you're clearly signaling confidence about future contracting as well. So, I guess, when I back that up and needing a good jumping off point to exit this year in order to move into that $12 million to $16 million range, and also consider January tends to be, I think, a good contracting period or at least a lot of discussions happening here at the new year, can you talk about maybe the commercial signals you've seen here early in calendar '24?\nSteve Lisi: Sure. Thanks, Jason. Appreciate the question. Like we mentioned in some of the prepared remarks, seeing customers asking for longer-term contracts with us, locking us in, which is very good. We're very happy to do so. They want to contract for the long term with us. That's confidence in our system, especially with the upgraded software. We're seeing, as I said earlier in the prepared remarks, a massive increase for us in requests for evaluating our system. So, we are scheduled consistently over the next six to eight weeks, and we're scheduling more beyond that. So, the interest is certainly there. Again, we are attending to our existing customers as well as entertaining new customers in parallel now and for the next couple of months. Our existing customer base is very important to us. They've helped us understand how to optimize our system and they've been working with the system prior to the software update. So, we appreciate that. And we're going to take care of them as well as bring in some new customers as well. So, once they're taken care of and we can focus our efforts 100% on new customers, that will be very exciting for us as a team. This is not just a Jan 1 start for hospitals. You mentioned that's certainly a busy time at Jan 1, beginning of the year. But there are other points in the year where there's lots of contracts starting up, July 1 being probably the biggest along with Jan 1. So, there's a lot going on. There are starts, we just -- like I mentioned earlier, we have a start on Feb 1. There're hospitals starting mid-month. There're hospitals starting on the 1st of every month. So, it's just a matter of us having the supply available and making sure that our existing customers are taken care of. So, we see what's coming. We're very excited about it. We'll be adding people to the team to be able to handle what's coming in the next three to six months. So that's all I can say. I mean, I don't know what else you'd want, what are the metrics you need, but if you need some more metrics, just go ahead and ask.\nJason Bednar: No, that's super helpful. I'm just trying to get more anecdotal and qualitative to get a sense, and it sounds like things are moving in the right direction for sure. Maybe I'll use your personnel reference there to segue to the next question is more -- just any more color you can give around Duncan's departure? Just maybe how quickly you're looking to backfill this spot? You're, obviously, at a critical inflection point commercially. I just want to make sure there's, call it, a seamless and quick transition here.\nSteve Lisi: Yeah. I think that the transition will be seamless. I don't know when we'll have someone new in that role starting up. But we have a pretty strong team here internally. So, we're certainly working together as a team to bring these things forward. I wish Duncan the best and he's done a great job for us. But we're focused on the task at hand. And I think we have the right people at the company right now. And obviously, we need to add as we grow as opportunities come our way. But we're going to wait for the right person, bringing in the wrong person because we need someone quickly is not the right attitude. So, I think that with what we have in place, we certainly can wait for the right person to come our way, whether that be in 30 days, 60 days or 180 days, I can't tell you that right now, I don't know. But I want the right person in that role.\nJason Bednar: Okay. All right. Makes sense. And then, one last one. Doug, I appreciate the help on some of the gross margin moving parts. I know it's super early days here, but just trying to get a sense if -- is there a way to quantify or strip out what some of those one-time costs would have been? It sounds like they were elevated here in the second quarter -- sorry, your fiscal third quarter and -- but they're going to be there for the next two quarters. Just trying to get a sense as we model this out appropriately, what maybe an adjusted gross margin would have looked like or adjusted cost of goods sold would have looked like for you in the quarter?\nDouglas Larson: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. I am a little hesitant to break out the pieces. But between the depreciation on machines that aren't deployed and refits for the devices that we were upgrading the software on, we're talking somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 in the quarter. So that -- I hope that gives you kind of an idea of -- I think that will recur next quarter again. And then, as the sales pick up and we are done upgrading all the devices, those numbers are going to disappear. And then, as we get more revenue, obviously, those -- that depreciation just becomes a normal part of our cost of sales.\nJason Bednar: All right. Perfect. All right, thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Les Sulewski with Truist. Please proceed with your question.\nLes Sulewski: Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, just on the environment in the hospital setting, can you just true up how the pricing environment is driving the decisions among the hospital groups that you are engaging? And then, I guess, second part to that, give a little bit more color, if you could, around the sizing of the new -- of the three new engagements you've mentioned? And what would be your expectations on the conversion rate on that?\nSteve Lisi: Let me start with that. What do you mean by conversion rate on that?\nLes Sulewski: Conversion of contract...\nSteve Lisi: The three new engagement we mentioned -- so, we have those contracts. Those are inked. Those are just multi-year deals.\nLes Sulewski: Got it. okay.\nSteve Lisi: Those are already done there.\nLes Sulewski: Can you give a little more color on the sizing of that, if that's possible?\nSteve Lisi: I would say that two of them are probably slightly below market average, and one of them is probably double what you consider market average. So, these are -- they're good-sized contracts. I really want to give too much detail on it, but these are good-sized hospitals. They're doing pretty good volume, even the two ones that I would consider to be a little bit below what the average-sized hospital would be, do pretty good volume. But the other one is a lot of volume. I mean, there's patients, a lot of patients on every single day. I mean, we've got over 20 machines in that hospital. It's a big hospital. So I hope that helps.\nLes Sulewski: It does.\nSteve Lisi: So, let me go back to your price question. It's -- price certainly plays a role. There's no doubt about it. I think that's true in any situation, the hospital wants to get the best price that they can, but that's not the only thing that plays into a decision for the hospital, but it certainly plays a role. I mean, we can't be naive to that fact. And I think that -- I've said this before, I think that the pricing environment is not too far off from what we expected when we entered this market. It's pretty much within the range that we anticipated. Some hospitals will get better pricing than others based on certain factors, volume being probably the biggest factor. But I don't think it's the only factor, and I don't want to give you the impression that this is a race to the bottom in this market for price, it's just not true. I think it's a healthy pricing environment.\nLes Sulewski: Got it. Very helpful. On the VCAP study, can you just give a little bit more color how this was extended into two seasons? And then separately, on the one-fold increase on your filter shipments, can you translate that into utilization, or is this a seasonal inventory stocking? Just give a little more commentary on that, if you could.\nSteve Lisi: Yeah, there's no seasonal inventory stocking here for this stuff. That's just the growth. I mean that's just -- the numbers are what the numbers are. There's nothing -- no seasonality about it. There's no stocking up. I mean these hospitals, normally, they're ordering what they need for the next -- it depends on the hospital next 30, 60, 90 days, I mean, it's really individual hospitals will have different needs, but they don't need to stock up a year of supply of this stuff. This is not how it works. So, it's just a true growth. So, on the VCAP study, I mean, look, this is safety study. If you're doing efficacy, it needs to be in one season, safety doesn't necessarily need to be in one season. Given that we won't change our date for our pivotal study, to take a little pressure off of my team, we got the approval late in the June quarter last year. It was tight to get all the sites up and running on time for the season. So, we made a decision around Thanksgiving that we would extend this over two seasons. It was always something that was in our back pocket, just in case, but we just couldn't get all the sites up and running as quickly as needed. And rather than try to spread ourselves then, we decided to focus on a couple of core centers, and we'll spread it out. I think it's the best way to go, trying to get it done in one season, given the short time frame. We gave it a shot. I don't think we didn't, but you had to make a decision before we really got into the swing of the season on that, and that's what we did. So, it was always something we considered internally. Again, as long as it doesn't push out our pivotal study start, I don't think it's a problem at all. I think it's actually the right thing to do given the situation.\nLes Sulewski: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe from a high level, could you kind of quantify the pecking order, your pipeline strategy, anything that could be pushed back further if there's risks involved, whether it's financial or time? Any kind of color around the high-level strategy process and thoughts around the pipeline?\nSteve Lisi: I mean I think we're pretty much showing everybody what we're doing. I mean VCAP, cancer, autism are the ones that we are working on right now. Again, autism is relatively inexpensive compared to the other two programs, obviously. I mean it's preclinical. It's not costing us a lot. And I think once getting it to first in humans for that one in '25 and getting some data, I mean, that's not a high cost. I mean, when we start to go into maybe Phase 1b or Phase 2a for that program, that's when the cost will really kick in. But until then, it's not overly expensive. NTM is our next program up. I think we'll be meeting with FDA before the end of this year, calendar year that is, to get some ideas from them and work with them on a trial design. Hopefully, that will be a pivotal trial design. That's our goal. COPD, obviously, has not been moving forward. That's evident in our corporate presentation. So that's the one that's kind of just sitting there on hold at the moment. Bronchiolitis also on hold. I think that's been clear for the last couple of years. So, I think it's very clear what our priorities are in the pipeline and where they are. So, I don't know if there's -- I don't know if I answered your question, but I think I gave the rank there.\nLes Sulewski: No, that's helpful. Thank you for that, Steve. Appreciate it.\nSteve Lisi: Sure, yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Yale Jen with Laidlaw & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nYale Jen: Good afternoon, and Steven, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe to start on the LungFit PH. Have you guys actually reported what the total number of hospital has been using the -- including the three multi-contract ones that to be used or already using the device?\nSteve Lisi: Yeah. We haven't said how many hospitals are out there. We don't want to give any information out to the general public about how many hospitals we're in or where they are or who they are. So, we're not going to comment on that. But...\nYale Jen: Okay. That's fine. That's good. Maybe just a little bit more color in terms of the software update in terms of the specific general aspect of the updates, which makes the -- make a significant difference compared to the previous -- earlier one.\nSteve Lisi: Yeah. So, just to little tiny background. Remember, we froze the design of our system in early 2019. So then we had this lovely global pandemic. So, it took a while to extended the time to submission, extended time to approval. So, there's a lot of things that three-and-a-half years of this -- of no changes in our system where the rest of the world is having changes makes it difficult for us to catch up right away. So essentially, this software update gave us optimal accuracy with our sensors for monitoring and our delivery. It gave us compatibility with all the systems out there that are important. I would say all the systems, I don't think we're incompatible with anything at this moment in time. That's very important for us to be compatible with all the ventilators and that are out there that are used. There's a little bit of noise from some of our compressors, so the software is able to reduce that noise. I don't think that was a big deal, but certainly, nicer for the hospitals to have that, and we're able to improve on the alarms. So that's really it. I think the compatibility and the sensor accuracy are probably the two biggest things that it did for us. So, that's it. I mean I would say those two things are really the driver for why we did this. And a little frustrating that it took as long as it did, but it's here now, and the feedback is as expected. Everybody is very pleased and happy with it. And like I said earlier, we're getting a lot of -- a lot more interest and a lot more looks from hospitals since we displayed this in early November at the American Academy of Respiratory Care.\nYale Jen: Okay. Maybe my last question here is that in terms of the NTM, just a company recently, AN2 Therapeutics, has a pause there Phase 2/3 study of a similar indication at this point based on I guess the efficacy as they indicated. Do you see any impact on your development in the LungFit go for this indication? Or any comments on that?\nSteve Lisi: I'm sorry, what company was it that you were mentioning? I didn't hear the name.\nYale Jen: It's called AN2 Therapeutics and pause there.\nSteve Lisi: Yeah, AN2 Therapeutics.\nYale Jen: Yes.\nSteve Lisi: Yeah, I believe that these are using an antibiotic, is that correct?\nYale Jen: Right. And basically, they suggest that they have subpar efficacy, at least that they hinted in their press release and that's the reason they paused the Phase 2/3 study.\nSteve Lisi: Look, anything that's positive for these patients is a big win. So, I'm very happy to hear that they may be able to help patients, that's fantastic. So, it's more options for these patients. They have very few. So, I think it's a good thing. And I think that it could even make the path easier through FDA, perhaps we have to see. We have to wait and see what happens with them. But right now, our studies are being done on top of antibiotic therapy. So, I think we would just be used together with antibiotics. I don't know if we're going to be doing any monotherapy studies in the near term. So, at this point, any success with antibiotics is great for us, great for patients. Nitric oxide enhances the efficacy and certainly helps with the tolerability of antibiotics as we've seen in our studies. So, I think they are all positive.\nYale Jen: I think they actually -- I think they paused their study because they don't have enough efficacy on their study.\nSteve Lisi: It was a failure, Yale. I hadn't the data.\nYale Jen: Yeah.\nSteve Lisi: So, it was stopped for negative reasons?\nYale Jen: For negative reasons. It's not the early stop.\nSteve Lisi: Okay. Well, that's too bad again, these patients need options. So, we'll be hoping that things would work for them. So, it doesn't change our strategy at all. I mean, we're just going to be used with existing antibiotic background therapy. If there's any way we can go upfront due to [indiscernible] patients as a monotherapy, that would be great. But at this point in time, I think it's a little early to do that. But we'll speak with FDA, you never know. But in any case, this doesn't change our strategy. We are certainly a unique mechanism of action for treating NTM lung disease. So, it's not going to change the way we look at things. Our data speaks for itself. I mean we had very strong data in the last study we did, so we're pretty excited about it.\nYale Jen: Okay. Great. I appreciate it. Congrats on the progress at this moment.\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Yale. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Marie Thibault with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nSam Eiber: Hey, good afternoon. This is Sam Eiber on for Marie. Thanks for taking the question this afternoon. Maybe I can start on the CE mark as we get closer to approval here. Just any thoughts on how to think about the ramp both in Europe and APAC? Any target markets that you'd highlight for us, revenue contribution? And anything included in the fiscal '25 guidance for international at this time?\nSteve Lisi: Yeah. Sam, I don't think that we're going to have anything from the European Union in '25. I mean, we still have to get the CE mark, then we'll ink a deal and then we've got to ramp things up. It takes time in Europe. Australia, New Zealand, I think that the TGA approval in Australia will lag the CE mark, give or take, 90 days. I mean you can't be sure, but that's a rough estimate, and then we'll have to ramp things up. So, if there's any effect from there, it would be minimal in '25, fiscal '25. So, I wouldn't think it would be very impactful. I think that this is more of a fiscal '26, '27 impact for us on both fronts.\nSam Eiber: Okay. That's helpful to think about. And maybe I can just use my follow-up here on, some of the comments around adding to the field team. I guess just any way to quantify or think about that ramp here, and obviously, incremental contribution to operating expenses in the back half of this year and fiscal '25?\nSteve Lisi: Yeah. I mean we already budget for this, right? In our budget, in our forecast, we already have people being added. And what we're doing now is adding based upon the interest in what we see coming our way, right? So, we need to be prepared for this. We need to bulk up our team a little bit for the interest in our system. So, it's in our budget. It's not going to change anything. Whether we are one or two people ahead or one or two people behind in a certain quarter, it's all going to smooth out over the next four, six quarters. I mean we're probably going to be where we are in four to six quarters. Just each quarter might be a little bit different in terms of who starts when. But this is all part of the plan. It's in our budget. It's in our guidance for burn, it's all there. This is nothing new. It's not going to increase our expenses. I mean it's exactly what we expect to happen when we see the demand coming, we're going to bring people on.\nSam Eiber: Okay. Well understood. Thanks for taking the questions, Steve.\nSteve Lisi: Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Kaplan with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Kaplan: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to -- if you can give us a little bit more color on your -- why you're confident in your guidance in terms of the $12 million to $16 million for 2025? And what you need to see, I guess, in terms of conversions of some of these conversations that you're having with different hospitals to achieve that?\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Matt. So look, you don't win them all. There's no way we expect about 1,000 here, but we do expect to be winning a good portion of these discussions that we're having. What we need to see is keeping our existing customers, re-signing them because a lot of the re-signings are coming up in the next couple of months. I think that will be important. And it will also be important to bring on some new customers. What we need to see is June, July, August type things or where we believe we'll be bringing on significant numbers of new customers because we'll have already taken care of our existing customer base by every time we get out there, and we'll have time to build up our inventory to a point where we can take on more hospitals. So that's what we need to see. And we're already seeing it. We mentioned we had the new start, Feb 1. We had another start in February. So, it's two hospitals starting in the month of February, and we'll have more coming. I think we're going to be seeing hospitals, hospital starts every month, multiple hospital starts every month, hopefully, and the sizes will vary. Some are small, some are medium, some are big. We might even get lucky, Matt, to get one of those giant-size customers. We'll see. We'll see if we can break into that club of having some of the big, huge users of nitric oxide in the United States.\nMatt Kaplan: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, in terms of the PMA supplement for cardiac surgery, obviously, the label and approval took a lot longer than you expected for initial indication. How is the review going? Is it just starting? And how do you expect it to progress? Is this something you expect to be completed later this year?\nSteve Lisi: Matt, I don't like to comment on things I have no control over. But I think before the end of this calendar year is a fair assessment that we'll hear back from the FDA, one way or the other. It could be sooner than that. It could be the summer, it could be the fall. I mean it's very difficult to pinpoint it. And I don't want to give a hard date here. But I would say it's going to take more than 180 days that some people may think. So, please don't put 180 days. I don't think we're getting the approval in the month of May. I would think it's going to take several months beyond that. And right now, it's a pure guess on my part because the interactions with FDA, as you're aware, we're still a little bit short of when you would normally hear feedback from FDA. We're still a little bit of ways away from getting a full picture of FDA's first pass of our application. So that's just a guess on my part. We do feel confident in our application. We think that the data that have been generated are very strong. And we really look forward to discussing with FDA. I mean, my team can't wait. We're gearing up. We're sitting here twiddling our thumbs, trying to prepare, guess what questions will be asked and try to be ready for it. That's all we can do. So hopefully, next update in June I'll have a little bit more information for you. But right now, it's just our opinion.\nMatt Kaplan: Great. All right. Well, thanks for taking the questions.\nSteve Lisi: Perfect. Thanks, Matt. Appreciate it.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to Steve Lisi for closing remarks.\nSteve Lisi: Well, thanks, everyone, for tuning in. Much appreciated. We look forward to sharing with you our progress on the next call. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."

At this time, participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Edward Barger, Head of Investor Relations at Beyond Air. Please go ahead.\nEdward Barger: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today after market close, we issued a press release announcing the fiscal second quarter 2024 operational highlights and financial results. A copy of this press release can be found on our website, www.beyondair.net under the News & Events section.

Joining me today on the call are Steve Lisi, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Duncan Fatkin, Chief Commercial Officer; and Douglas Larson, Chief Financial Officer. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Lisi. Steve?\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Ed, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. I'll start today's call by highlighting the revenue guidance we announced earlier today in our quarterly press release. For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, we anticipate $12 million to $16 million in revenues. The impetus for providing guidance at this time is threefold. First is the great work done by our commercial and supply chain teams to provide hospitals with confidence in LungFit PH and our support for users of the system. Second, the Vizient contract we announced in October, and third, the FDA approval of an update to our software which was granted in September. Our entire fleet of systems will be updated by the end of January with production of new machines ramping up significantly as well to meet anticipated demand. Looking outside of the US, in September, we announced the partnership with Getz Healthcare for commercialization of LungFit PH in the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan. We look forward to triggering a milestone payment once CE mark is received, which is expected to occur early next year. We are very pleased to have the endorsement of a company with the reputation of Getz. Another recent milestone achievement under the LungFit PH program is the PMA submission for the expansion of our label to include cardiac surgery. Our clinical and regulatory team is to be commended for putting together a strong submission, and we look forward to a positive impact on our revenues beginning in the back half of fiscal 2025. Moving on to our other programs, at the SITC conference last week in San Diego, Beyond Cancer presented top-line data from the Phase 1a first-in-human trial. In this study, five patients, all of whom had failed an average of six prior treatment regimens, each received one five-minute intratumoral administration of 25,000 parts per million nitric oxide. The treatment was safe and well-tolerated. Additionally, an immunostimulatory effect was clearly evident over the 21-day observation period with upregulation of key biomarkers such as cytotoxic T cells, T central memory cells, M1 macrophages and dendritic cells, while downregulation of T regulatory cells and mononuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells were shown. I would like to emphasize that the effect on these immune biomarkers is very similar to what we have seen in animal studies. Our animal studies presented and published over the last three years have consistently shown efficacy with monotherapy UNO as well as in combination with multiple checkpoint inhibitors with respect to tumor regression and survival in multiple tumor models. Also during the quarter, Beyond Cancer presented positive preclinical data at the EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics, demonstrating a statistically significant survival benefit in mice treated with UNO plus anti-PD-1 alone. This was a pooled analysis of multiple studies done with 50,000 or 100,000 parts per million nitric oxide for a single administration of five minutes or 10 minutes. Additionally, Beyond Cancer's second manuscript was published in the cells journal in an article titled Intratumoral Administration of High-Concentration Nitric Oxide and Anti-mPD-1 Treatment Improves Tumor Regression Rates and Survival in CT26 Tumor-Bearing Mice. We're very excited by the data and progress of the UNO program and look forward to sharing the data from our completed Phase 1a study in 2024. Our cancer team will also be initiating a Phase 1b study in 2024 as well as approaching the FDA and other regulatory authorities about a Phase 2 program that is expected to begin before yearend 2025. I encourage all of you to visit the Beyond Cancer website to get better educated on this potential transformational therapy for those suffering from solid tumors. About Viral Community-Acquired Pneumonia or VCAP study is underway. As a reminder, this randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot study will treat hospitalized patients with 150 parts per million nitric oxide intermittently for up to seven days. Keep in mind, we have already completed four studies treating viral pneumonia, which have consistently demonstrated both safety and efficacy. Due to viral pneumonia following seasonal patterns of activity, this is a seasonal study running through the fall and winter months. As a result, we expect to announce top line data by the middle of calendar year 2024. Viral pneumonia is a significant unmet medical need with over 300,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States and more than 15 million worldwide. Let me conclude my opening remarks by touching on our newest program to treat autism that is on track to have human data in 2025. Recall that this is in partnership with The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which continues to produce exciting preclinical data. In September, we announced the publication of new data showing a therapeutic effect for at least 10 days after a single injection of an extended release formulation. Just like the daily injection, the data show reversal of behavioral phenotypes associated with autism, and we look forward to additional data from the university. Now, we'll turn the call over to our Chief Commercial Officer, Duncan Fatkin, for a closer look at the LungFit PH commercial launch. Duncan?\nDuncan Fatkin: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to our investors. As Steve mentioned, we have given revenue guidance for LungFit PH for fiscal 2025. Since we last spoke in August, we have more than doubled the number of hospitals using LungFit PH. Another metric I would like to share with you is the shipment of NO2 filters to our customers. In fiscal Q1, our first quarter with customers, we shipped approximately 450 filters. During the quarter that we're reporting today, which ended September 30, that number eclipsed 1,300, and in October alone, we shipped over 900 filters to our customers. We expect to continue this acceleration given the recent approval of our software upgrade for LungFit PH by the FDA. Based on hospital feedback, we sought and gained FDA approval for software updates that address some minor limitations on device usage. We expect these updates to further increase the separation in value between LungFit PH and our competitors in the marketplace. I can make that statement with confidence given our recent experience at the American Academy of Respiratory Care that took place a week ago. Another event that gives us confidence in accelerating our growth in the market at this stage is our Innovative Technology Contract Award from Vizient, the nation's largest provider-driven healthcare performance improvement company. This recognition represents a seal of approval for our revolutionary technology from the largest group purchasing organization in the U.S., representing more than $100 billion in annual purchasing volume. This achievement validates the positive customer experience and feedback that we have been reporting for some time. We are very excited by this opportunity to expand our reach through the Vizient customer network. I would like to emphasize that an Innovative Technology Contract signifies to Vizient members that the LungFit PH has unique qualities that may enhance clinical care, patient safety, healthcare worker safety, and business operations. As mentioned previously, we are building out a field team based on the opportunities developed over the past year and the growing interest in LungFit PH as we broaden our reach. Over the next 12 months, as our revenues build, we expect to continue increasing our sales team across the majority of the continental United States to capitalize on the opportunities afforded by the Vizient contract, the updated LungFit PH system, and the anticipated approval of a label expansion for cardiac surgery. Now I'll turn it over to Doug.\nDouglas Larson: Thanks Duncan and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial results for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023 are as follows. Revenue for the fiscal quarter was $0.24 million as compared with zero for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022. Research and development expenses for the fiscal quarter were $7.1 million compared with $4.5 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022. The additional $2.7 million was due primarily to an increase in stock-based compensation, salaries and development costs associated with the pipeline. SG&A expenses for the fiscal quarter were $10.2 million compared with $8 million for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022. The $2.2 million increase was mainly due to stock-based compensation, professional fees and salaries. Other income and expense for the fiscal quarter showed a $0.1 million gain compared with a $0.2 million loss for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022. There's a lot of moving parts, but essentially interest income roughly offsets interest expense and the gain we saw from the remeasurement of warrants and derivatives associated with our long-term debt was only partially offset by true ups to our non-product related litigations. The fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023, the company recorded a net loss of $17.4 million of which $16.2 million or $0.51 per share was attributable to the shareholders of Beyond Air Inc. compared with a net loss of $12 million or $0.40 a share for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022. Net cash used in the quarter ended September 30, 2023 was $16.5 million, including $6.4 million in one-time payments, which had previously been disclosed and accrued. Aside from these one-timers, cash burned in the quarter was $10.1 million, which is in line with our guidance of approximately $10 million per quarter. As of September 30, 2023, the company had cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $43.9 million. And with that, I'll hand the call back to Steve.\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Doug. We will now take any questions you may have.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] The first question we have is from Jeremy Jacoby of Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Jacoby: Hi, thanks for taking our questions. Can you just give us your puts and takes on how you got to this guidance range and then what's causing the delay in the CE mark approval? Thanks.\nSteve Lisi: So delay in the CE mark approval is not in our control. We're not saying it's not coming by the end of December. We just think it's more likely it'll come after that. Again, this is not in our control. So with respect to what's driving the guidance, it was pretty straightforward. We got a software upgrade from FDA for our system, which had been waiting for quite some time. This gives us the ability to be compliant with lots of different devices out there that nitric oxide systems go on, ventilators obviously being the main system. So this is important as well as some other tweaks to our system to optimize performance. Obviously, we have visibility into hospitals that are waiting for this upgrade. We have visibility into hospitals that are on Vizient as our GPO that we're now a part of and again, the feedback we get from existing customers and potentially new customers is very encouraging for us with respect to our ability to deliver on the service side, which is critically important in this market. So hope that answers your question. We feel highly confident in that range.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Marie Thibault of BTIG. Please go ahead.\nMarie Thibault: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Maybe I can try to understand a little bit more about the ramp. Thanks for that great detail on filters shipped. Are the filters when they're shipped, are they typically, is there a big stocking bolus and then folks are reordering as needed? What's sort of the dynamic, how to think about that ramp you gave us, the October number, which is very impressive, but I don't want to make the mistake of prorating that over the entire quarter if that's not the appropriate approach. And then anything to cite in terms of pricing along these contracts? Are you seeing a wide range? Are things sort of staying stable with what you'd expected?\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Marie. I think that the pricing is pretty much as we as expected. It's within the ranges and it's not all one price for everyone, obviously, but it's within the range of what we've expected over the past year plus. So, that's not -- that's not going to change in our opinion. The market's kind of stabilized in the range that we expected. Yeah, the filter stocking is, if you look at it on a monthly basis, it can be chunky. There's no doubt, but some hospitals will want to deliver every month. Some will look every quarter and, there's obviously interim there. So, if they do a monthly and they're running out, they'll call us sooner. Same thing on the quarterly basis. So, I don't know how to guide you with respect to the October number. Obviously, these things will move depending on how we get more contracts coming on with hospitals. So, just really put that out there to show you that there is this upward trend, obviously, in usage and in number of customers that we have.\nMarie Thibault: Yeah, it's helpful for sure. Okay. And then I guess my follow up, glad to have the fiscal '25 guidance. Some of those drivers like Vizient, like the new software approval, they seem like they could start to help the adoption earlier ahead of fiscal '25. So, help us think about maybe time points for that. Are there times when folks start to look at kind of the list of vendors on their GPO, GPO list, that sort of thing. How to think about one of these drivers could start to hit.\nSteve Lisi: Yeah, thanks for that and these things take time. So, the Vizient GPO came a middle of October. It takes three to six months on average to contract with a hospital roughly. So, that's a timeframe you need to see the improvements come as well as the software upgrade to our system or class three medical device. This doesn't just happen overnight, which is why you heard in the prepared remarks that we'll have things pretty much up to specs for all of our existing systems, the market plus ramping up new systems that'll happen. It's happening now, but it'll take a few months and we'll be completed with that process in January. So, yeah, if you think about it that way, you're looking at things happening towards the Jan, Feb, March timeframe, when you're going to see the major impact from these events.\nMarie Thibault: Okay. It's very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Joseph Downing of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Hey, this is John for Jason. Appreciate the question. Yeah. So curious how your conversations are going with hospitals in the current environment, are you seeing any lengthening of decision cycles or just slower contracting processes in general? And then just a quick follow up, anything else to note on how hospitals might be behaving differently right now in terms of forming new partnerships or embracing technology.\nSteve Lisi: Okay. Yeah. I don't think the hospitals are going any slower than what is normal for them. Post pandemic, things are a little bit slower post the pandemic and we're still in that mode. Things don't bounce back as fast in the, in the world of the hospitals nor in the supply chain world. So things aren't back to what they were prior. So that's why it's, you're looking out three months to six months to get things done with a hospital. So, I don't think that's really changed in the past year or so and it's probably not going to change going forward. So, there was another part to your question. I'm sorry.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Yeah. So, in terms of how hospitals might be behaving differently in terms of forming your partnerships or just embracing new technology.\nSteve Lisi: Yeah, I think look, the embracing new technology part is, it's normal for these things to take time. Again, we had to prove ourselves to the hospitals that we support them. These are lifesaving technologies. So you can't not be able to support the hospital in a crisis situation where, they have an overload of need and they may need another machine or two or more filters or more kits or so forth. They had to be sure that we could support them and provide them in those critical time periods and obviously, we've proven that over the last year plus and that's a major part of why we've given out guidance at this point. So the adoption curve is based on a number of things and one of them is confidence in us. The other one obviously is optimization of our system to work across all, be compatible with all ventilators across the offerings from the event companies. So these are two obviously critical things and then of course the GPO contract. So this is just the timing that we're on. These things took time to get through and now we feel that that's complete and what we need and we can move forward. So again, I don't think the first six to nine months that we were out was something that was ever conveyed as us taking significant market share. That was really the time period to learn and to get the hospitals comfortable with us and here we are in this period after that where we think we'll be taking share and we're happy to show you guys that we'll be taking share. We've certainly hit milestones with respect to our optimization of our system and getting the comfort of the hospitals. So that's just where we are today. I don't think the adoption curve was going to be any different than what we saw. Maybe it could have been a little faster with a few things falling in our favor but it's just where we are.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Appreciate that, Steve. And then just piggybacking off of your comments there about gaining share, are you seeing any pickup in interest or great interactions with potential customers as a result of competitive struggles across the landscape?\nSteve Lisi: Absolutely, 100%. Our system, we had this big Respiratory Conference in Nashville last week and it's clear if anybody was there. I'm sure there weren't too many people on this call that were there but it's clear we have the best system out there overall and, there are some struggles from our competitors and it's certainly coming our way. There's no doubt that there's increased interest in our system, increased interest in doing business with us. We wouldn't have put that guidance out there. This is a very, very careful decision that we made to put that guidance out.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Great. Thanks, Steve. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Matt Kaplan is from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.\nMatt Kaplan: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to get a little bit more, perhaps some granularity with respect to when we should start to see an inflection with respect to the impact that the new software and the GPO contract should have to have, should start to have on revenues and is that something we're starting to see, the momentum, I guess you're seeing in October in terms of the filters. When does that translate in terms of increase in revenues?\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Matt. like I said, this is about three months to six months to feel the impact of these events, which took place in September and October. So you're really looking in the Jan, Feb March timeframe when you're going to see us, in our opinion picking up significant contracts and volume picking up. I wish it were sooner. I wish I could tell you December is going to be a bang up month, but, this is just the time that it takes. Things don't move that quickly. I do think there'll be progress in the December quarter over the September quarter, we just reported, but I wouldn't expect it to be massive magnitudes because this is a three to six month process. So that would put us in the Jan, Feb, March timeframe for us putting up numbers that that would give you comfort and confidence that we're going to do what we say we're going to do.\nMatt Kaplan: Okay. No that's helpful. And do you think the kind of increases in revenue would be kind of chunky and as you get additional GPOs and additional contracts, or how should we think about that ramp?\nSteve Lisi: Oh, yeah, it's going to be chunky, Matt. I can't predict when certain contracts coming up. So one month could be, three new hospitals and they're small. The next one could be one hospital that's five times those three combined. These are just timing issues with respect to when contracts are up and, that's something that is obviously beyond our control. So, it may not be as smooth as you would like to model, but, we've taken that into account and that's why we're putting the guidance after fiscal '25, and March 31, 2025 and that's why we're doing it this way, because it's very difficult to predict on a monthly or quarterly basis. We'll get better clarity as we go forward. I hope to give better clarity, either in February or June, when we report our next two quarters. Hopefully we'll have a, I'll be able to give more details on how chunky it might be and when, but right now, it's very difficult.\nMatt Kaplan: That's helpful. Thanks for giving the guidance and then one question on the pipeline with your, the VCAP study that you just started, what do you hope to show when you complete that study?\nSteve Lisi: Well, we've done four studies already in pneumonia, three in infants and one in adults during the pandemic. So, you're going to see pretty much what you saw there. You're going to see safety, which will have to be the primary endpoint in a pilot study, of course, safety, tolerability and then you'll see our efficacy endpoints will be there as well. Same efficacy endpoints you saw in the other studies. We have them on our website. They've been published at medical conferences as well as journals. So, you're going to see the same thing. You're going to see, these patients improving faster than if they don't have nitric oxide in general. Again, this will be the fifth time we've done it. So, I think anybody would be shocked that you go four for four. You're probably going to go five for five. So, if you're going to want to take a look at our previous results, you'll know what's coming.\nMatt Kaplan: So, just a follow up on that. So, the goal of this study is to generate data that you can take to FDA to get clearance to a pivotal or what do you hope to show?\nSteve Lisi: Yeah, this would be the final study before we go into a registration study. That's correct. The next study will be a registration study in the United States.\nMatt Kaplan: Oh, great. Great. Thanks, Steve. \nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Steve Lisi for closing comments.\nSteve Lisi: Yeah, thanks everybody for joining today. Internally here, we're very positive on our outlook. We wouldn't have put that guidance out there and as Matt mentioned on the last question, we're very excited about our pneumonia program. Just one last note on that, it is a seasonal condition. So, these studies do move quickly. So, with that, I will say thanks again and talk to you soon.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines."

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Lisi. Steve?\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Ed, and good afternoon to everyone joining us today. Since it’s only been about six weeks from the last time we spoke, we’ll keep the prepared remarks short today. LungFit PH continues to be well received in the market and we have begun Phase 2 of the commercial launch. We are very happy to report that we have now in excess of $1 million in contracted annual revenue, though only a small portion of these revenues are recognized in the June quarter. We continue to match our momentum in the marketplace with the thoughtful expansion of our commercial team. Our Chief Commercial Officer will discuss this further in a few minutes. We provided a thorough review of our pipeline during the last call. Everything continues to be on track. Before turning the call over to Duncan, I'll reiterate a few near-term catalysts and highlights. By the end of the calendar year, we expect to submit a PMA supplement to FDA for the LungFit PH cardiac label expansion, receive CE Mark in the EU, and present data from Beyond Cancer's first in-human trial. Additionally, following agreement with FDA, we will be conducting a pilot study in viral community-acquired pneumonia in the United States this winter. Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Commercial Officer, Duncan Fatkin, for an update on the LungFit PH commercial launch. Duncan?\nDuncan Fatkin: Thanks, Steve, and good afternoon to our investors. As Steve mentioned, we have eclipsed the million-dollar mark for signed annual contracts. We're very pleased with the momentum our team is building as we progress with Phase 2 of our launch. The overall feedback from hospitals regarding LungFit PH continues to be extremely positive, and we would again like to thank all the hospitals and clinical staff that have partnered with us and committed to using our device. Our plan is to build out our field team based on the opportunities developed over the past year and the growing interest in LungFit PH as we broaden our reach. These additions will be carefully targeted and designed to ensure a strong and sustainable foundation for growth. We also expect to add to the team, pending the anticipated cardiac label expansion, which we expect to significantly expand our reach in the hospital. We have planned for a thoughtful and measured increase in the size of our team through to the approval of our next-generation LungFit PH, which is anticipated in calendar year 2025. In closing, we are confident that LungFit PH is the best-in-class nitric oxide technology available today, and we continue to be excited by the support we have received from hospitals throughout the U.S. I'm looking forward to providing updates on progress in the upcoming quarters. With that, I will turn the call over to Doug Larson, our Chief Financial Officer, to provide an overview of our financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023. Doug?\nDouglas Larson: Thanks, Duncan, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 are as follows; Revenue for the fiscal quarter was $0.1 million, as compared with zero for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022. Research and development expenses for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 were $4.7 million, compared with $3.2 million for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022. The $1.5 million increase was due to an increase in headcount and incremental research, mainly in cancer and autism. SG&A expenses for the fiscal quarter were $10.9 million, compared with $8.2 million for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022. Almost all of the $2.7 million increase was due to salaries, as additional headcount is needed to scale operations in the field and in the back office. Other income and expense for the fiscal quarter showed a $0.8 million gain compared with a $0.2 million loss for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2022. The gain this year was mainly driven by the remeasurement of warrants and derivatives associated with our long-term debt. For the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, the company recorded a net loss of $15.1 million, of which $14.1 million, or $0.45 per share, was attributable to the shareholders of Beyond Air, Inc., compared with a net loss of $10.9 million, or $0.37 a share, for the fiscal quarter and to June 30, 2022. Net cash used by the company, excluding one-time expenses, was $10.6 million during the fiscal quarter. We forecast our average quarterly cash burn to be approximately $10 million per quarter as we move through fiscal 2024. In June 2023, up to $40 million in debt financing was provided to the company by Avenue Capital, of which $17.5 million in gross funds were drawn in the quarter. As of June 30, 2023, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $57 million. And with that, I will hand the call back to Steve.\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Doug. We will now take any questions you may have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Les Sulewski from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Les.\nLes Sulewski: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the progress, guys. Just to confirm, the $1 million is now the annual base, and can you quantify the market opportunity out there that's remaining over the remaining of this year? Do you have a sense of how many hospitals are out there near end of contracts with a competing product that are marked in your book for an opportunity to convert? And I have a follow-up.\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Les. Appreciate it. So, yes, I guess the $1 million is the base, but that would not be starting at the beginning of this fiscal year, so it wouldn't be a start from April 1. It would be a start from this quarter when we obviously sign the contracts to get us above that level. So I just want to be clear on that. Yes, look, I don't think that we're going to really reveal how many hospitals we're speaking to right now and what it looks like for the rest of the fiscal year in terms of opportunities for us. I don't think we want to share that information, but I do think that we will be in a position when we report our next quarter in November to give you some guidance on that and probably some guidance for our anticipated revenues for the full year.\nLes Sulewski: Got it. I understand. And then on the cardiac label expansion opportunity, what size is that potential to TAM? Is that essentially kind of calculated into your figures that you initially rolled out, or is there more to the story here? Just kind of walk us through the high-level overview of what you think of the cardiac label expansion. Thank you.\nSteve Lisi: Okay, so cardiac surgeries, nitric oxide use there, it's the biggest of all the, I guess, subcategories for use of nitric oxide in the hospital would be cardiac surgeries. So I think it's very important to get this label expansion. It will help us have access into an area that's exclusively now off-label. So that's an area where we don't market and we don't detail. So that's certainly going to open things up in a good way, I would think.\nLes Sulewski: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Marie Thibault from BTIG. Please go ahead, Marie.\nMarie Thibault: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions. Now that we have revenue, I want to try to understand, how many contracts were signed, how many hospitals now have LungFit pH, any details on contract value and length of some of these contracts, just any additional detail you can offer at this time would be really helpful.\nSteve Lisi: Sure Marie, probably not too much. But most of the contracts are annual contracts. Sometimes they renew for two years, another year or three years. But we haven't said, I don't think there's too many too many contracts beyond three years out there. But there might be a few, not for us but perhaps for others. Again, we're not really discussing the number of hospitals we have there are multiple hospitals is there's plenty for us to get plenty of feedback from our customers that they're very happy with the with our service and with the product. But we're not going to give an exact number. I apologize for that. Not really sure how much really more we want to say it is a competitive environment. So we're kind of keeping things close to the vest, if you can understand that. There are other people listening.\nMarie Thibault: Of course, okay. And maybe I can ask about gross margins. It's not surprising, of course, that they're negative to start this early in the launch. But how do you think about that flipping positive? What's sort of the right level to think about for gross margins and those COGS in the first year of expansion? Thanks for taking the questions.\nDouglas Larson: Hi, this is Doug, I can I can jump in with that one. No, in the next, in the next couple of quarters, at least, that gross margin is going to turn positive. The drivers behind that are actually the devices that we're producing we're starting to depreciate them. So there's some costs there for devices that aren't actually deployed yet. And then setting up our supply chain infrastructure so that we can expand across the U.S. or wherever we have an opportunity. So those are basically the fixed costs, if you will, that are going to be absorbed very quickly as we expand. So again, my expectation is that either next quarter, or the following quarter, will be in positive territory.\nMarie Thibault: Thank you for that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Henry from ROTH Capital. Please go ahead, Scott.\nScott Henry: Thank you, and good afternoon. A couple of questions. First, with regards to selling expenses, I guess, what would you estimate the quarterly selling expenses are today? And where would they be at peak, just trying to get a sense of how much it costs to market pay all the reps how we should think about that number?\nSteve Lisi: So Scott, there, there is a, there is a, an industry standard for a fully loaded wrap. So I'm sure you know that you've been modeling this for a long time. We're certainly on the low end of things, we just started our second phase where we're starting to bring more people in and hire them. So from a pure headcount, we’re probably around 15 people or so on the commercial side and growing, and that number is probably going to get up, well, north of 50, probably close to 70, 75 people at peak. And that peak will probably be, two to three years from now, depending on how quickly we bring people in. So it's not going to be a very rapid expansion. But I would say to us that industry average is a good number, because not all those people that I've mentioned, those numbers will be reps, but the, when we get out to peak, the vast majority will be reps. Right now, it's a much lower ratio for reps to others, because we really need our clinical specialists, the respiratory therapists are the ones that are out there training and the hospitals that are working with us, right, so we need to train in the beginning, it's very important to have the customer service level very high, and the reps will be expanded later.\nScott Henry: Okay, great. That's, that's helpful. And then the $57 million of cash, how much of that is in beyond cancer? Just so you get a sense of the net cash you have?\nSteve Lisi: About 30% or so? About a third maybe.\nScott Henry: Okay, thank you. And then when we think about this burn of kind of 10 million a quarter in at the same time, you'll be expanding sales. Would it be safe to say this is kind of a low point and by low point I mean, this is the where the burn is going to max out you probably as you add sales, you'll also be bringing in gross profit. So make sure we think about this being the maximum burn decreasing, maybe not this year, but soon thereafter.\nSteve Lisi: Yes, and no, Scott, I mean, it does depend on what we do with our pipeline. So if we move into a pivotal study, in calendar 2025 whether that be for pneumonia or and or NTM, we're going to spend, so that's going to cost money. But obviously, it'd be for very good reason. We've done for pneumonia studies that have worked well. And during our fifth pneumonia study, in a few months, we would expect the number five to look just like the first four terms of overall efficacy and safety profile. So with that kind of confidence going into a pivotal study, we're going to spend money on it. We don't know how big it will be yet, we're still waiting to get this last study done and speak with the FDA. But I can't say that those costs wouldn't force us to spend more money than then 10 million in one quarter. I just don't know. But if we're not running pivotal studies, then yes, you're right.\nScott Henry: Okay. And that leads it to kind of a bigger picture question for you in the board. From the standpoint of, is there any concern that you, you might cast too wide a net? I mean, a lot of these, these programs are great. But it's the it's the working capital problem. A new business often faces that. If you stretch yourself too thin, there can be financial distress. Okay, how do you how do you balance that? I know you have a pretty good balance sheet right now. But you got a lot of good ideas that you're chasing right now.\nSteve Lisi: Yes, Scott, we're not chasing them all. That's for sure. For that reason. I mean, we're not we're not chasing COPD at the moment. NTM is not until 25. So we're not stretching. I mean, we're almost two years away from an NTM study starting in COPD is going to be based on available funds, where we'd love to do it, we'd love to do it in three months. But, we can't. This launch is the most important thing. So the other programs like, cancer is funded, it's we haven't entered into the real expensive part of cancer yet. We haven't gotten into Phase 2 human studies, which is where the big money will be spent. That's another 25 occurrence most likely. And the Autism Program is this, there's not much being spent at the moment on that it's still obviously in preclinical stage with our partner in Israel. So, again, that that expense, probably won't kick in. Heavy expenses won't kick in till 26 or 27 calendar. So can we accelerate these things? Sure. If we have more cash or sales come in, and we have a good gross profit, then yes, we can. But right now, we're being very prudent in terms of which programs we're working on, and how quickly we're pushing them. So right now, pneumonia is full steam ahead. And cancer and autism are moving, but the other programs are not moving right now. Just because you're right, we don't have the balance sheet to do everything that we want to do. And it's not everything we want to do. I mean, it's everything that the data tells us to do. Right, NTM data are very strong. Pneumonia very strong. And with NTM and pneumonia being as strong as they are, it begs the question why we're not doing a COPD study. But again, the answer is we're not funded do that study. So we're just going to bide our time. Make sure that this launch is successful, or more successful, it's already been successful. We'll see how that works out. But yes, we're being very prudent with our cash. Doug doesn't like spending money. He's, he's a very good CFO. He beats up everybody. So…\nScott Henry: Okay, great. Thank you for the color on that. I'll jump back into the queue. Thank you for taking the questions.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead, Jason.\nJason Bednar: Hey, good afternoon, thanks for taking the questions, and congrats on reaching that $1 million milestone. Maybe if I could start on the contracting so far, and where we're going in the future? Totally understand, see, there's only so much you might be able to share. But can you speak to whether the contract sizes are what you expect them to be so far? And is there any difference in overall contract size you'd expect as maybe you move further down the road with Phase 2 of your commercial plans? Just anything you can share there?\nSteve Lisi: I think that they're fairly in line with what we thought in terms of overall size. There, there's a mix, right, that the volume at hospitals is a huge range in the U.S., you have hospitals doing, 1000 hours, 500 hours, 2000 hours, your hospitals doing 50 plus 1000 hours of nitric oxide a year. So, it varies all over the place. So I think it's, it's in line with what we had expected. And I would say the same thing about the pricing, pretty much what we expect as well so right now we're not really seeing anything that that's outside of the parameters that we had entering into the market.\nJason Bednar: Alright, that's great to hear. And then I'd be curious, just maybe on the competitive response from some of your closest peers. Just thinking, given where you're at and where you maybe hope to be in a year or two, I think having some perspective today would be would be enlightening. And just how are you seeing them behave As they start to lose contracts to you? Are they getting more aggressive and follow up contracting efforts? Are they holding the line on where their pricing? Again, just curious how the success you're starting to have and contracting is influencing their behavior at all?\nSteve Lisi: They've been aggressive from day one. I don't think it's changed. I think they're nervous. They're worried. That's how they're acting, it's how they're behaving. I might do the same thing if I were in their shoes. So I don't think that there's anything that they're doing that that, again, is surprising to us. I would expect some of the things they're doing to be done. I might not do everything they're doing. But certainly some of the things they're doing if I were in their shoes, I would do. But it's a competitive environment, there's no doubt about it. And you would expect all the players to do everything they can to, to either keep customers or take customers from a competitor. So I mean, Duncan, you're on the line. If you have anything else to add to that you're a little closer than I am.\nDuncan Fatkin: Jason, appreciate the question. I think that there's a couple of things, I would say, firstly, a lot of the competitor activity was apparent to us before we even started to get contracts. So a lot of the work that was done was to block us from even getting in there in the first place. So I think that what we've done is we've broken through in various locations. And actually, once people get exposure and do evaluations, etcetera, then then things start to build. And the, the way that these things work is they then start to see that another hospital in their area is using the device, and they get more confident. And so the neighboring hospitals start to get involved. The other thing that happens is that the initial contracting is easier with individual hospitals, there's not that many of those nowadays. So the larger groups and small networks take a little bit longer. And we're starting to get to those now. And we're getting to that phase where a lot of those contracts are running out, which wasn't the case at the beginning of our launch. So it's a much better environment for us. In other words, a competitive thrown a lot of sort of ammunition at us already to stop us from getting in the response once we're in isn't that different? So we're feeling much more positive about where we are as we get through that process.\nJason Bednar: All right, perfect. Thank you. Maybe one just quick clarifying question to finish it off. I think it seems like there's no change on the CE Mark, timing or expected time and receiving that. I think that originally in the last quarter you had said, September October timeframe. Does that still hold? I know you're saying by the end of the calendar year, but or should we still expect it here within the next couple months?\nSteve Lisi: I would love to announce it on our next quarter. That would be my goal. But I -- this is this is out of our control. We are, moving as quickly as we can. But again, this is this is a regulatory matter. And sometimes, it just takes a little longer than you expect. So I hope to announce it on our next quarter. That's my goal. So where we'll be like, second week in November, roughly. So I expect to announce it there. If not, I'll let you know where I stand then. But yes, the guidance we just give our guidance based on I -- had here told me, Steve, we got to be consistent with guidance this half that half instead of saying a month. So I'm going to go with that. And we'll say by the end of the year, but hope to say November.\nJason Bednar: All right, very helpful. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Kaplan from Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead, Matt.\nMatt Kaplan: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking the questions. I guess now that you're kind of in in the phase of signing contracts, can you maybe what would be helpful. Can you tell us little bit about the mechanics of signing a contract? Is there a demo period a test drive period and then potential conversion to contract or how does that work?\nSteve Lisi: Yes, in the beginning Matt, it was always a demo and then there’s an evaluation. I think the evaluation is not as important for every hospital anymore. Now that we're out there and there's experience and people chat to each other. And, it's a small world, the arty [Ph] world, there's lots of little conferences, they're all, meeting each other and talking about what's going on. So I think that going forward, we may not need to do an evaluation at every potential customer. And eventually, we won't be doing evaluations at all. I would say that probably, sometime in in calendar 2024, we won't be doing evaluations any longer. It'll just be what we call bench testing. And then we go into a contract. So we're kind of over that initial phase, where everybody was evaluating to the point where some are still evaluating, and some aren't, and eventually, when it gets to the point where there's just no more evaluations, because there's so much experience with our product, and so much comfort and confidence in us as a company being able to support the hospitals, that there will be no more need for that evaluation.\nMatt Kaplan: And then I guess, now that you're in the second phase of the launch, what do you see as the kind of bottleneck in signing new contracts?\nSteve Lisi: I'm going to let Duncan go on that one. But I would say I don't think there's one, one specific bottleneck, there's not one thing that that stops you from getting a contract. I think it's, hospital specific, they all have different things that are important to them. And sometimes, it hits our sweet spot, and other times it doesn't. So I don't think it's so simple to say that every hospital has the same opinion or viewpoint or needs. So I don't think there's one bottleneck. And I know Duncan you might want to follow up there.\nDuncan Fatkin: Oh, no, it's good question, Matt. I think that contracting during the first 12 months was definitely the, the area we had to spend most time navigating because a lot of hospitals and are part of those systems, as I described just now. So the way they do that, and the bureaucracy associated with those definitely was initially our biggest sort of challenge. And I do think of it like dominoes, once you start knocking over some of those hurdles, then a lot of the others become freer. And then there are individual hospitals situations, changing from one hospital, one device to another involves an investment in training, etcetera. So depending on where they are in their particular supply chain process, they might have other priorities within the hospital, that mean that they're not willing to focus on our particular category at a time, which is kind of related to current contracting, but also related to the hospital's individual priorities. From a clinical point of view, we're not getting pushed back clinically it's really more on the contracting side where we have to navigate that. So that's really where most of our work is evolving, and improving.\nMatt Kaplan: Okay, that's helpful. And then is the average number of devices per hospital and the expectation for the average revenue per device? How should we think about that?\nSteve Lisi: I'm not going to tell you how to think about that Matt, because then everybody else would know. But, there, it's pretty wide in terms of how many hours per year per system a hospital uses, it's a pretty big range is different hospitals have different needs, like I've said. So it's a very difficult question to answer. And I don't want any of our competitors to know how we think about that and how we view it because it's very important in how we approach things. So I wish I could give you those answers. But, but I can't I mean, I can, but I won't.\nMatt Kaplan: Yes, fair enough. Fair enough. Just last question, and as you're getting close to the CE Mark, what's your parting strategy ex-U.S. or where do you plan to go it alone outside of the U.S?\nSteve Lisi: We are not going it alone outside the U.S., that's for sure. We it's enough to build up a commercial team in the U.S. that's all we can handle for the moment. So we will partner ex-U.S. and our goal is to get the best royalty rate we can on net sales, and that's what we'll do. So hopefully, we'll be able to talk more talk more about that in the near future.\nMatt Kaplan: Right. Great. Well, congrats on the progress, Steve. Thank you.\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Yale Jen from Laidlaw & Company. Please go ahead. Yale.\nYale Jen: Good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions and congrats on your first commercial sales. My first question is, in terms of the 59,000 revenue of this quarter, what's the sort of accounting principle behind it? And how has that been recognized? And how should we think about going forward in terms of the same sort of principle applied?\nDouglas Larson: Sure. So this is Doug, thanks for the question, Yale. So the best way to think about it is, for the most part, we're signing annual contracts, most of the contracts from a revenue recognition perspective. I mean, it's a little more complicated than I'm going to make it. But if you think about it, ratably over the life of the contract, that's pretty safe. I mean, we do have to do some testing every quarter to see if we're within the range of use of the machines and things like that. But for the most part, annual contract ratably over the 12 months is how we're going to how we're going to recognize that revenue.\nYale Jen: Okay, great. That's, that's very helpful. The question to just follow up on the previous one, which is regarding getting labor on the cardiovascular side. Question is that after it has been used in real world off label, presumably can also get reimbursed for a long time? So what could be additional benefits? If you guys get a label for your, for your system?\nSteve Lisi: Well, yes, I mean, the main benefits, obviously, are our ability to directly market to cardiac surgeons, as well as potential for reimbursement, there's no doubt. But, Yale it takes time to get a specific code. So we wouldn't have a direct code, day one. There might be miscellaneous codes of some sort, but a direct code would take several years, as you know. Right. Was there any is there anything else you were looking for besides those? Those are the two main benefits?\nYale Jen: Okay, but so does that the just be one confirm that currently, the use in the cardiovascular surgery suite also get reimbursed or not necessarily get reimbursed?\nSteve Lisi: No, it is off label use. There's, I can't speak for what the hospitals do, but it is 100% off label. So I think that reimbursement is difficult.\nYale Jen: Okay, great. Maybe the last question here is in terms of your VCAP trials that you intend to start this winter? Could you give us a little bit more color regarding the study design, and including employment and others? Let's work, how this one should be considered as a phase 2, maybe phase 3, how should we sort of categorize that? And thanks.\nSteve Lisi: Yes, so I would look at the design of our study that we had in Israel for pneumonia, it's going to be very similar to that study. And this will not be a registration study. So we're a device you're not a drug. So it's no phase 1, 2, 3. It's pilot pivotal. So this will be another pilot study, FDA has requested that. So after this study, the next one would be a pivotal or registration study. So this study, then one more, and we would we would hope to get approval from that.\nYale Jen: And maybe just to refresh our memory that in terms of the end point, what was the point they are pursuing and any other colors on the study?\nSteve Lisi: Yes, so obviously, it will be safety is the primary pitch, not a pivotal study so that that's easy, but on the on the efficacy endpoints, in the study in Israel, it was an oxygen specific endpoint. It was a time to oxygen cessation for these patients in and out of the hospital. So you could look for an endpoint similar to that something along the lines of either how long you’re on oxygen or how whatever time period, we pick how many hours they didn't need oxygen. But something along those lines will be related to oxygen. Again, when we did the infants in pneumonia, there were no comorbidities. So it was easy to look at, just hospital discharge or being fit for hospital discharge, those endpoints are not relevant with adult pneumonia as they have multiple comorbidities. And there could be several other reasons besides the viral infection that caused the hospitalization for them to stay beyond the resolution of the pneumonia episode. So we need to measure something else. And there will be some other endpoints besides action related, but I think that is the one that we'll be looking at closely.\nYale Jen: And maybe I’ll squeeze in one, which is that does that end point could be considered as approvable endpoint from FDA, because that therefore, have you -- spoke with agency in terms of this issue.\nSteve Lisi: So this, this won't be a registration study. So I can't say that the endpoints we have in this study, as secondaries would be considered the endpoint to be used in a registration study. But you could guess that, my team and I are not are not, looking at this for no reason we're looking at this because this is what we believe would be something similar to what would be in the pivotal study. But I there's no way for me to guarantee that there's an endpoint in my current study that would be mimicked for my Pivotal, hopefully, it's close to it. But we would still have to sit with FDA to agree upon what the exact primary endpoint would be in that study. We haven't agreed to that yet. And that's pretty standard. But I think what we have is our secondary endpoint on the efficacy side is going to give us the answers we need to get an agreement with FDA on a primary endpoint. I'm pretty confident that we're going to have something that will work.\nYale Jen: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Again, congrats on the first step.\nSteve Lisi: Thanks so much. Yale.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I like to turn the turn the call back over to Steve to close out the call.\nSteve Lisi: Thanks, everybody. Appreciate your time. Look forward to talking to you in three months.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending."
