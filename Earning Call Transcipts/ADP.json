At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time.  I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanny Hussain: Thank you, Michelle, and welcome, everyone, to ADP's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO, and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com, where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items, along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. This morning, we reported strong second quarter results, including 6% revenue growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth. I'll begin with a review of the quarter's financial highlights, before providing an update on the progress we are making across our strategic priorities. We delivered solid Employer Services new business bookings in the second quarter, reaching a new record bookings volume for Q2, and keeping us on track for our full-year outlook. Growth was especially robust across our small business portfolio, and we also experience healthy growth in our mid-market and international business. With steady demand in HCM and a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter, we look forward to the important selling season ahead. Employer Services retention was strong in the second quarter. Although it declined slightly compared to the prior year, we once again exceeded our expectations as we continue to benefit from a healthy overall business environment, and from our very high client satisfaction levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth remained at 2% for the second quarter. The overall labor market remains resilient, and our clients continue to add employees at a moderate pace, which is resulting in a very gradual deceleration and pays per control growth. And last, our PEO revenue growth of 3% for the second quarter, was in line with our expectations, and we are very pleased to have delivered strong PEO new business bookings that were ahead of our expectations. Based on continued healthy activity levels, we feel good about our PEO bookings momentum, and we look forward to seeing a gradual re-acceleration of our PEO business in the second half of this fiscal year.  Moving on to a broader update. During the second quarter, we launched a new brand advertising campaign themed, the next anything. The campaign highlights how the world of work is always changing, sometimes gradually, sometimes suddenly, and trusted business solutions must evolve with it. The theme aligns with our strategic priorities to give our clients the advantage of our leading technology, expertise, and scale. In Q2, we continue to push forward on our first strategic priority to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. A key part of that is the rollout of ADP Assist, our cross-platform solution powered by GenAI that proactively delivers actionable insights in plain language to enhance HR productivity, aid decision-making, and streamline day-to-day tasks for our clients and their employees. ADP Assist seamlessly integrates with ADP products across multiple platforms. Using an intuitive conversational interface, it provides valuable and contextual insights which touch every aspect of HR. For example, in addition to the features we shared with you last quarter, including our natural language reporting capability, in Q2, we integrated natural language search capabilities into our run platform, which allows it to understand intent behind the search terms and use GenAI to mine ADP's deep knowledge base to deliver easy to use and effective content. ADP Assist also helps clients validate payrolls and solve common employee challenges across HR, payroll, time, and benefits. It's a comprehensive experience that is trained on the industry's largest and deepest HCM dataset and our deep knowledge base to surface highly credible and actionable insights so that clients can make smarter decisions.  We are excited about the roadmap ahead for all of our major solutions, and we expect it to help us build on the recognition we continue to earn in the market. In Q2 alone, we were pleased to be recognized for product leadership by three major industry analyst rankings. Everest Group named ADP the highest leader out of 27 providers in its multi-country payroll solutions PEAK Matrix report. NelsonHall identified ADP as a leader in its Payroll Services Vendor Evaluation and Assessment tool in all markets. And Ventana Research named us an exemplary leader across its North American, global, and payroll management buyers guide for performing the best and meeting overall product and customer experience requirements. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions. We shared last quarter that we were beginning to equip our associates with GenAI capabilities through our Agent Assist technology. In Q2, we expanded our call summarization deployment to a greater portion of our service associates and started to see productivity gains with shorter handle time and improved service quality. With our global service associates fielding millions of calls annually, we are incredibly excited to test ways to optimize those client interactions.  Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and we continue to lean into this advantage. In Q2, we announced a strategic collaboration with Convera, a global business to business payments company to help our multi-country clients manage the complexity of global payroll and cross-border payments through an integrated platform. By combining Converaâ€™s payment solutions with our global payroll expertise, we're enhancing the client experience by minimizing the need to access various banking platforms and improving payment accuracy, compliance, and security. We also announced the launch of ADP retirement trust services to support our growing retirement services business. Standing up our own trust services entity demonstrates our scale and commitment to our retirement clients, positioning us on par with financial industry leaders and ahead of HCM competitors that rely on third parties. This commitment can really matter to financial advisors, keeps data within ADP's trusted ecosystem, and provides a cost and price benefit to ADP and our clients over the long term. Our scale also affords us the opportunity to partner with other leading technology providers in innovative ways, and we continue to expand on many of those partnerships to provide our sales implementation and service teams with client-specific insights to quickly address market shifts, drive more personalized interactions, and deepen our overall client engagement.  Overall, our second quarter represented strong outcomes on the financial front and with respect to our key strategic priorities. I'd like to thank our associates who continue to deliver exceptional products and outstanding service to our clients, particularly now, as many of them are in the middle of our most hectic time of year completing year-end work. I'm proud to share that their efforts help drive our overall Net Promoter Score to its highest level ever in the second quarter. Thank you again for all that you do for ADP and for our clients. And now, I'll turn it over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide more color on our results for the quarter, as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Overall, we reported a strong second quarter, with our consolidated revenue growth moderating in line with our expectations, and our adjusted EBIT margin coming in slightly better than expected. However, the interest rate backdrop has changed since we last provided our full-year outlook, and we are lightly tweaking our outlook, which I'll detail. I'll start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 8% on a reported basis, and 7% on an organic constant currency basis, coming in slightly ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, we continue to grow our ES new business bookings, resulting in a record second quarter bookings volume. Our small business portfolio and international business provided outsized growth contributions this quarter. And with a steady HCM demand environment and healthy pipelines, we feel on track for our 4% to 7% new business bookings growth outlook for the year. As mentioned earlier, our ES retention declined slightly in Q2 versus the prior year, but again exceeded our expectations. Given our first half retention outperformance, we are increasing our full-year retention outlook slightly. We now anticipate a 40 to 60 basis point decline in our full-year retention, which is 10 basis points better than our prior forecast.  ES pays per control growth of 2% in Q2, was in line with our expectations, and we are maintaining our 1% to 2% growth outlook for the full-year. And client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectations in Q2, as a slight decline in our average client funds balance, which we discussed last quarter, was more than offset by an increase in our average yield. However, we are revising our full-year client funds interest outlook lower to reflect the change in prevailing interest rates since our last update. We now expect fiscal 2024 client funds interest revenue of $985 million to $995 million, and we expect a net impact from our client funds extended investment strategy of $835 million to $845 million, representing a reduction of about $20 million at the midpoint. In total, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 ES revenue growth forecast of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 170 basis points in Q2, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client funds interest revenue growth, but reflecting the impact of a reduced client funds interest revenue forecast, as well as a slight increase in expected GenAI related spend, we are tweaking our fiscal 2024 ES margin outlook and now anticipate the lower end of our prior margin range. Moving on to the PEO, we had 3% revenue growth, driven by 2% growth in average work site employees in the second quarter. These metrics were in line with expectation, and we are encouraged to see signs of stabilization in our PEO pays per control growth. As Maria mentioned, our PEO new business bookings were very strong in Q2. With continued healthy activity levels, we continue to anticipate a gradual ramp in our work site employee growth in the back half of fiscal 2024, and we are maintaining our full-year growth outlook of 2% to 3%. PEO margin decreased 50 basis points in Q2. As we shared last quarter, we assume this year's workers' compensation reserve release benefit will be lower than last year's benefit, and we are further narrowing our PEO margin expectation to be down 80 to 100 basis points in fiscal 2024 versus our prior expectation of decline of 50 to 100 basis points.  Putting it all together, there is no change to our fiscal 2024 consolidated revenue growth outlook of 6% to 7%. With the two changes to segment margin, we now expect our adjusted EBIT margin to increase by 60 to 70 basis points versus our prior outlook, for an increase of 60 to 80 basis points. We continue to expect an effective tax rate of around 23%, and we still anticipate fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%, with the middle of that range the most likely outcome given current assumptions.  Thank you, and I'll now turn it back to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Mark Marcon with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good morning, and congratulations on all the accolades that you've gotten from the third-party reviewers. I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about some of the initiatives. And specifically, one that stood out was the - was setting up your own trust. Can you talk a little bit about the investment there and how we should think about how that would end up unfolding? And what do you think some of the reactions would be with some of your third-party partners? Like, you've got bank partnerships and CPA partnerships and obviously benefit administration partnerships. How do you think they'll end up reacting? Thank you, Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Mark, and good morning. Appreciate the question and appreciate your well wishes on all of our recognition. Certainly excited to see across the board the recognition we mentioned during the prepared remarks, but also the continued momentum across all of our initiatives. Happy to comment on retirement trust services. It is really a demonstration of our scale. And so, when I think about what it means to our clients, what it means to the ecosystem that you mentioned, banks, CPAs, I think it's all incredibly positive. And trust services are a core component of any 401(k) plan. Given the size and scale of our retirement services business, what we found is that the pool of what's known as third-party trustees, if you will, that are capable of handling a business just of our size, is actually becoming shrinkingly more difficult, if you will, in terms of the number of providers that are able to offer standalone trust services to a retirement offering of our size. So, in terms of that, we made the decision to launch our in-house trust services. We believe that this is a great value to our clients, to the ecosystem. It puts us on par with other industry leaders and the financial services, and really a competitive advantage against some of our HCM competitors that continue to leverage these third-party trustees. So, for us, I think it's a big commitment to the business that we have, the retirement business that is, which really can matter to financial advisors, and as you said, CPAs and banks. Really by taking the trust services in-house, the implication is that we have better control over our costs. Ultimately, that yields a better price for our clients, a better service. We also have the ability to maintain all of the data inside of ADP's ecosystem, which as you know, is a big component of who ADP is in terms of data integrity and all those things. So, that's kind of the retirement trust services in a nutshell, Mark.\nMark Marcon: Terrific. thanks for that. And then just, it was noticeable that you basically are anticipating a lower level of decline in terms of the ES retention, which is coming off of record levels. To what extent is that due to an anticipation of lower levels of bankruptcies as opposed to just the improvement that you've been seeing in terms of your client service scores?\nMaria Black: So, retention is going incredibly well, right? And we mentioned that in the remarks. Year-to-date retention has definitely been better than we expected. And so, I think things are fundamentally really healthy right now. One thing to keep in mind as kind of think about the outlook, is that we are, as you mentioned, we are coming off of some of the record highs that we've seen over the last several years. And while we believe that from specifically a down market perspective, we're close to being normalized back to fiscal 2019 trends, we do also anticipate some pressure in the back half from perhaps out of business and bankruptcies having more of a material impact. We haven't seen it to date, but we certainly want to ensure that we're cognizant of the fact and we believe it's prudent - given that we have retention running at such record levels, we believe it's prudent to plan for it in the back half to have some pressure. And obviously, just like any year, Mark, retention is always noisy until we have some normal variability and conservatism in the back half. Just like you, I'd like to think that there's opportunity there. I think only time will give us the answer to that, but that's kind of how we're thinking about the back half.\nMark Marcon: Really appreciate that, Maria. Thank you, and congratulations.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate all the detail this morning. I wanted to quickly just touch on PEO. You called out a strong acceleration in the business, but it looks like outlook for revenues was changed - you may have mentioned that, but I'm just trying to capture how much of that is timing issue versus the concentration you have in professional services and technology, which still seem a little bit soft, at least in the employment reports.\nDon McGuire: Yes, James, thanks for that question. We've been happy to see the stabilization in the pays per control in those sectors, the financial services and technology sector. So, although there's still a little bit of noise there, it's certainly stabilized from what we saw in the prior quarter. So, that's positive. I do think that as we looked at our sales results, our bookings for PEO, we were very happy with the bookings. Maria mentioned that already very good. I think as we kind of put those together, the improvement in the pays per control and the improvement in our bookings, I think we're going to be heading towards that re-acceleration that we've been pointing to over the last couple of quarters in the PEO. But really just trying to get the impact of those two components, those variables, is really what's going to help us get that re-acceleration going.\nDanny Hussain: And James, just to clarify, the pays per control, although itâ€™s stabilizing, it's not providing any sort of upside versus our prior forecast. So, bookings are going well. It takes a quite a bit in terms of bookings to really drive a material change to the current year revenue, which you well understand. With pays per control still providing sequential, gradual drag, those two are sort of netting out to an inline outlook.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Thanks for that, Danny. And then quickly on AI, it seems like there's a little bit of incremental investment there and certainly a big focus on this call, but wondering about how we should think about the - how you're anticipating a return on that investment and over what kind of timeframe. And maybe more qualitatively, what kinds of paybacks, whether it's increased customer satisfaction or internal operations, et cetera. Thanks.\nMaria Black: Yes, so I'll start on the on the AI side and tell you all the reasons again that I'm so excited about it. Maybe Don can give you a little bit about how we're thinking about the return on investments that we're making. So, just to remind everyone how we're thinking about AI, in its most simplistic way, I think about it really in three buckets, the first of which is product and innovation. So, putting generative AI into all of our innovation cycles. So, that's everything from product development to the features and functionality that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And by the way, later this morning, we're actually issuing a press release that goes through some of our product and innovation, call it, philosophy and launches of products, right? So, some of what this press release speaks to is how we're thinking about and our design principles around making things easy, smart, and human within our product and innovation cycles to really drive things like payroll assist, things like ADP Assist into the market in a meaningful way. So, product is really kind of the first bucket. And as you'll see, we're making significant investments there. We do have ADP Assist now more broadly deployed across the product set, and we're seeing meaningful impact as it relates to our client experience on that. The second bucket is what I call efficiency and service efficiency. And this is really about giving all the same things that we're looking to give our clients to make their jobs easier and more effective and efficient, and giving those same tools to our associates. And so, we have Agent Assist. I'm pleased to say that from an Agent Assist perspective, we've more than doubled the number of associates today that are engaging in AI tools overall. Specifically, a big piece of that is anchored in Agent Assist and the things we're doing around call summarization. Again, I'll let Don comment on investments and return, but just to kind of give you a flavor of what we're talking about here, the feedback we're getting from our associates is, there are times we're shaving off a minute or two minutes by aiding things like call summarization. And while that probably seems minuscule, what I would offer to you is we have thousands of service associates, and we also have millions and millions of calls that we take every single year. And so, we're pretty optimistic and excited about a minute here and a minute there, and what that means from an incremental opportunity for us over time, right? So, we continue to lean into our service efficiency and really getting all of our associates more effective as it relates to their ability to engage with our clients. And then last but not least - by the way, I could go on and on and on all day on this topic, but last but not least and very, very important is how we're thinking about generative AI in our go-to market motions. And so, we have for years been at the tip of the spear of sales modernization. We have partnerships that are two decades old where we've always been leading the way with what it looks like to have a best-in-class modern distribution and sales force, and this is no different for us. So, we already have a broad set of our sellers leveraging tools along the lines of Generative AI, many of which are through our best-in-class vendors and partners that we have, and we're seeing great impact there. Things that I used to do myself at a personal level manually, such as pre-call planning, by the way, things like call summarization for prospecting, these are big items for us as it relates to our go-to-market motions, and we've just started scratching the surface. So, all in, really excited again. Just to kind of wrap it all up, I think it's about product, service efficiency, and our go-to-market motions. We are making active investments. Some of those investments are things that we've shifted that we were already working on in digital transformation. Some of it is incremental investments. And so, I think with that, I'll turn it over to Don who can kind of talk about how we're thinking about our incremental investments and moreover the return on that.\nDon McGuire: Yes, so I think Maria just outlined some of the exciting areas that GenAI will have for us and some of the things that'll change, how they'll make the client experience better, how they'll help our associates, how they'll help us sell more, et cetera. But I would say at this point in time, what we're really talking about is some modest investments in GenAI. I think it's going to be a little while before we start to see returns from those things, but we certainly do anticipate returns. But in the near term right now, it's really a time for investing in these tools, et cetera, and we'll see those outcomes, those financial outcomes somewhere down the road.\nJames Faucette: That's great. Thank you both very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi there, and thanks for taking my question this morning. You guys called out higher seller expenses as just one component of the margin headwinds in PEO. I guess the question, is this just the cost to compete in PEO at this point? In other words, is it becoming more expensive to compete in PEO, or do you expect expense levels related to selling to sort of abate in a more normalized time period?\nDon McGuire: Yes, I don't think there's - just to answer the question, there's nothing really unusual or fundamentally different about our selling expenses and how we go-to-market in the PEO. I think certainly as we see higher sales, as you know, we get a lot of our sales, half of our sales, give or take, from internal. So, some of that's a little bit of our internal housekeeping if you will, how we allocate expenses between business units, et cetera. But higher sales generally translate into higher selling expenses. So, really nothing fundamentally different in how we go-to-market. Certainly, not seeing any fundamental differences in the competitive landscape that's driving those expenses.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. And then one follow-up for me. In the context of the international product launches like Roll in Ireland, and also I guess the partnership you guys just announced with Convera, can you comment on the international value proposition itself, whether it's sort of largely the same as it is in the US, or are there distinctive products, needs, partnerships required in these markets that you guys sort of still need to build out to more fully execute on the international opportunity?\nDon McGuire: Yes, I'll start, and Maria can add here in a second. So, as you know, you look at our revenue as - international revenue as a percentage the total, and itâ€™s not where we'd like it to be, even though roughly 40% of the people we bear around world are in international. So, and the reason for that is that we have fundamentally different offers in the US. We have things like PEO. We also have money movement services, tax services, pretty much broadly distributed. Some of those offers don't have the same value proposition outside of the US market. So, our opportunity there is not quite the same. Perhaps it will be as time goes on, some of those services may be available in other markets, but as we speak today, they're not there. The value prop isn't the same. With respect to Convera as a partner, just to speak to that one a little bit, we have thousands of clients, and those thousands of clients have thousands of entities spread across multiple countries around the world. And if you think about the complexity and the difficulty of paying their people in some of these small countries and then getting the payments to the various social security providers in those countries, having somebody like Convera who can help a large European or a large US multinational manage the treasury function in those small countries around the world without having to set up all the banking, et cetera. So, someone like Convera acts as a great partner for us to facilitate those cross-border payments in a very - in a compliant way, et cetera. So, I think that's very positive for us. So, we do have some partners in international like Convera as I just mentioned, but we still see it as a great opportunity for us to continue to grow.\nMaria Black: That's right. If I may, one of the things, I think what Don is suggesting is really the opportunity we have with international. And so, when you put it in the context of the business that we have in the US there, there is a tremendous opportunity for us to think more broadly in international partnerships as the one Don just outlined with Convera, is a big piece of that. What I would also add is that from an international perspective, we did call out the performance specifically in Q2 on international. That's, by the way, bookings. That's on the heels of a solid Q1. What I would offer as well, we have record retention. We have record customer experience and client experience in international. So, I think we have a tremendous value proposition in international. By the way, some of the recognition I cited during the prepared remarks is really about how best-in-class our offer is with respect to the international offering we have. So, that said, as Don mentioned, we're not satisfied. I think there's more opportunity to us to scale and grow our beyond payroll offerings, partnerships that are a big piece of that, but undoubtedly, we're performing and competing very, very well internationally.\nRamsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Sounds like good things ahead. Appreciate it.\nMaria Black: Oh, you know what, let me just comment because you mentioned Roll in international, so I just thought I'd mention that really quickly, which is, we are very excited about the down market in international. Roll is one way that we're getting after that. And the pilot programs that we're running are teaching us a lot as we think about the down market and international.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys, congrats on the solid results. Don, I just wanted to ask about average balances. I know we were expecting a little bit of a headwind from the payroll tax deferral. Maybe you can quantify that as part of the reason for the drop of balances down 2%. And then what's the go forward there we should expect? Is there a more of a headwind from the payroll tax deferral for balances and maybe expect a similar decline in the back half of this year?\nDon McGuire: No, I think you were right to call out the payroll deferral, payroll tax deferral. That definitely was behind the decline quarter-to-quarter. We don't - that's now behind us. So, that's not going to be there. So, we are expecting 2% to 3% balanced growth throughout the balance of the year. So, we think that's very positive. I think the big callout though on the whole CFI program is just the fact that since we spoke last, five-year and 10-year interest rates are down about 80 bps on both of those. And so, I think that's a little bit of the headwind and that's roughly the $20 million or so that we're calling down the float number for the balance of the year. But still very optimistic about growth. Certainly, the reason that it's not growing as quickly perhaps as it did last year, we've certainly seen some moderation in wage growth, and we've talked about even though pays per control are behaving as we expected, they are certainly lower - pays per control growth is lower than it was in the back half, but will be lower in the back half of this year than it was in the back half of last year. So, those would be the major influencers, if you will, to the full balance as we go forward to the back half.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And is that part of the moving of the ES margins to the lower end of kind of the range you talked about? I think you talked about rates there. Just what was the surprise from three months ago on rates that that maybe caused you to push the margins towards the lower end or where you think the lower end, the new margin range? \nDon McGuire: Yes, so, you're right. I think the float certainly is a component of us guiding to the middle of our range, for sure. So, that's a component. We don't try to second guess the markets. We use yield curves that are out there in the market to estimate what we think our returns are going to be. So, no real surprises, other than seeing what's happening in the overall market. And then we're taking the forward yield curves and applying those to our balances, and that's where we land.\nBryan Keane: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Great, thanks. Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just wanted to start off on some trends that we've seen so far in the selling season. Seems like through 2Q it was pretty positive on the booking side, but maybe wondering how we've sort of tracked into 3Q, and then also what you've seen maybe from competitors, any changes in pricing, go-to-market strategy and all that would be helpful.\nMaria Black: Yes, good morning, Scott. We feel good about the demand environment overall at this point. I think companies are still hiring. We saw that this morning actually as well. And companies are still investing in their people, their talent. They're investing in HR. I think there are a couple things I'd highlight to you. The down market, definitely companies are continuing to hire and they're continuing to buy. We had tremendous second quarter results. By the way, that business has been executing incredibly well really for many, many quarters. And that's our run offering, but it's also all the things that are attached to run. So, think insurance services, retirement services. All of the down market is doing incredibly well. To give you a little bit of a line of sight, because it is the 31st of January, so we do actually have a tiny bit of visibility specifically to the down market. And you asked about trends into the third quarter. What I would offer to you is January looks good. I think we're actually on track to onboard something close to like 30,000 units in that business alone in the month of January. And so, that's the size of some companies, if you will. So, it's pretty incredible to see the execution in the down market. We have solid pipelines really across the mid-market as well as off-market. The mid-market did incredibly well in the second quarter. From a competitive standpoint, I think we get a lot of questions around the competitive landscape. Has it shifted in the mid-market? What I would offer to you, it hasn't really shifted. It's been a competitive space per us for a long time. It's an area for us that we're executing very, very well. We have best-in-class products. We continue to take friction away from our clients, make it easy for our clients to engage with us. We know this based on our results and retention. We know this based on our results and record NPS. We had good bookings in the mid-market. So, I think the mid-market is solid and certainly not getting any easier for our clients to be employers in the mid-market. As it relates to the international space, I think I covered that already, so I won't touch much more on international, but a good Q2 on the heels of a good Q1. And then in our enterprise and upmarket space, this is an area that has normally, I think it's kind of the new normal on longer deal cycles that have more individuals involved in those cycles. We're paying close attention to it and certainly all the things that are happening kind of across that space. But I would suggest to you that we feel relatively solid about our pipelines and our ability to bring that business in the back half.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. That's helpful. And just a follow-up for Don, just on the float income guidance, sort of noticed a pretty notable increase on your outlook for the client short portfolio. So, just wondering if you can maybe give a little bit of color on sort of the changing geography on those investments for the balance of the year. Thanks.\nDon McGuire: Yes, so maybe let me clarify that for you a little bit. So, really, we haven't changed our investment strategy at all. What we have done is we've tweaked a little bit the way we're going to - we were borrowing funds in the market day in, day out. So, what you're seeing is, we're actually entering the market a little bit early. So, instead of borrowing everything we need to on a peak borrowing day, we've simply spread the borrowing out over two, three days so that we can tap the market in a more - in a smoother way, if you will. And I think if you're looking at the average balances on that - on the appendix sheet that's in the release, you'll notice that that number's gone up in the short fair bit, but that's the driver. So, it's not a change in our investment strategy at all. It's just a change in a bit of a tweak in the way we're actually borrowing funds in the market when we need larger amounts of - when we have larger amounts of borrowing.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. First question I had is on EBIT margin. Can you comment on what drove the outperformance versus your view for that to be down I think in 2Q? I'm curious if that was an aspect of timing within the year versus better-than-expected efficiency. And I think, Don, I heard you mentioned some GenAI investments to come. Is that incremental spend versus the prior plan?\nDon McGuire: So, yes, let me start - Bryan, let me start with the first part of your question. So, there was a little bit of modest revenue outperformance in the quarter. So, I think that was a contributor to the margin. And then we had some expenses. We always have focus on expenses. There's a few things, a little bit of bad debt, a little bit of headcount, et cetera, and perhaps a little bit of timing, but nothing significant to really call out as a contributor. In terms of the GenAI spend, yes, we are spending a little bit more than we said we were going to last quarter. So, we do have a bit of incremental spend. It's not a huge amount, but I know that lots of folks like to measure things in 10 bps. So, we are calling it out. Not an incredible amount, but a little bit more than we had said in the prior quarter.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then just I guess a follow-up then on GenAI and ADP Assist here. Is that a feature you're able to monetize directly or more so kind of an enhancement you're offering for free to drive the CSAT stores higher? And I guess understanding you're leaning into these developments, do you kind of view it - when you think about the monetization of GenAI products, is this a near-term dynamic or more so kind of feature and product differentiation that's a longer term monetization dynamic?\nMaria Black: So, Bryan, ADP Assist is really the overarching, call it, brand, if you will, that we're leveraging to talk through all the things that we're putting into our product to make things easier. The way that I think about it is itâ€™s really just the next phase of digital transformation for ADP using new tools and technology. So, said differently, our intention is not to charge to make things easier for our clients to do business. That is our commitment to our clients, always has been, is to make it as easy as possible to process payroll, to have accurate payrolls. And so, it's not a monetization effort as it stands. It's really about just leveraging the new technology to step change the digital transformation that we've had underway candidly, for many, many decades since the dawn of the computing era. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about ADP Assist. In terms of monetization in general, do I believe there's monetization as it relates to GenAI? Of course. I think itâ€™s more about the dollar long term, right? So, I think about it - the dollars that we're putting in today will yield multiple dollars for us in years to come. So, there will be distinct monetization opportunities as we create new products into the market, as we think about various things of that nature, perhaps features and functionality. There will also be gains in sales and retention that will lead, in my mind, to investments that are proven today in GenAI to drive incremental bookings and retention over the long term. So, I think it's about putting a dollar in today with the belief that it will yield many dollars of margin to come, if you will, as well as bookings, et cetera.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe on the PEO business, I was curious, I know you guys called out some of the bigger verticals inside of the PEO business and that there's maybe some more softness there than you'd expected in technology and professional services. Any change in the exposure rather inside the PEO business or within like the big verticals? Are you guessing any change in the trends that you saw maybe over the last couple of quarters?\nMaria Black: The trend in specifically professional services has stabilized. And so, I think Danny made the comment earlier, it's no longer contributing to the deceleration. So, it used to - the professional services cohort used to contribute to the acceleration of pays per control, then we found ourselves where it was contributing to a deceleration, and it's largely stabilized at this time.\nSamad Samana: Got you. And just as you think about the pricing environment, I know that we're still not at when the company does the annual price increases, but as you think about maybe for new deals or for new customers that are onboarding, any change in the kind of price pressure or competitive nature of what your competitors are offering in terms of discounts or what ADP's is having to offer? And just as we look ahead to price increases, how are you thinking about this year's price increases?\nDon McGuire: Yes, we're not really seeing any changes, Samad, in the price environment, the competitive environment. We think we're priced appropriately, and we've always acknowledged that we're a little bit of a premium to others. But we're happy with that because we think we offer better service and stability, et cetera. So, no real changes. You're right. It is a little bit early. The budget cycle kicks off here in the next six, eight weeks or so, and we'll certainly be looking at the pricing increases for next year and weighing all the regular factors, what's inflation been? We thought our price increases were very well received last year. We thought they were in line. So, we'll keep that in mind. But as always, we're always interested in the long-term value prop with our clients and being competitive in the market. So, we're always measured, I believe, when we think about the price increases that we do hand out to our clients.\nSamad Samana: Great. Appreciate you taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Mcveigh with UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Mcveigh: Great. Thanks so much. Maria, I think you talked to kind of implementations a little bit. Can you remind us maybe what percentage of the revenue is done internally on implementations today, and if that's a shift philosophically, what that can be over the course of time? If I heard the remark right. Maybe I picked it up wrong, but just any incremental thoughts on that?\nDon McGuire: Yes, I'll maybe - Kevin, you're a bit soft by the way, but you're a little bit hard to hear, but I think the question was what kind of revenue we derive from implementation, and is that â€¦\nKevin Mcveigh: Yes.\nDon McGuire: Yes, so it's not a substantial. Sub 10% of our overall revenue comes from setup - we internally call it setup fees. So, it's not a substantial amount.\nKevin Mcveigh: And then do you see that - Don, over time, does that become less if you outsource that? And is there any way to think about the margin impact from that initiative?\nDon McGuire: Well, I mean, you also - so, no, I don't think there's a big opportunity there. We certainly have had conversations. We certainly have lots of folks who would like us to outsource our implementation because they think it's a revenue stream for them. We like to have that control over the client from sale-through to go live in service. Not to say that we won't work with third parties to help us from time to time, which we do. But it's really not that large a factor. Certainly, there's some money there to be had, but it's not that large a factor in the overall scheme of things. There's also some interesting accounting, of course, around implementation and setup fees and the deferral over the terms of the contract. So, once again, it would take a lot of changes to do anything, make any changes to the bottom-line financials in the near term.\nKevin Mcveigh: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks so much. Good results here. Just want to dig in on your prior comments. I know a lot of people asked on PEO and the healthy activity there and the confidence in the acceleration. Is ADP doing anything differently, or is industry demand changing? I understand itâ€™s not - it doesn't sound like there's a cost of pricing change there. So, I just want to make sure I understood that. Thanks.\nMaria Black: Yes, good morning, and thank you. I am happy to talk about PEO bookings. I think as mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're very pleased with our PEO bookings. This really is the fourth quarter that we've seen positive PEO bookings momentum, and the Q2 specifically exceeded our expectations. Most of the pressure that we felt in the PEO has been a byproduct of kind of the pressure on pays per control and having to overcome that, which is why the focus on bookings has been so paramount for us. And certainly, we deliver that in the second quarter. In terms of from a demand perspective, I speak about the PEO all the time, as you know. I think the demand continues to be incredibly strong. I wouldn't suggest that there's anything unnatural that we are doing outside of a tremendous amount of focus across the enterprise to ensure that we're executing on the PEO booking side. But in terms of anything unnatural or demand changing, I think the value proposition, as I always say, is stronger than it's ever been. I think clients in that space are looking toward ADP to help them from a PEO value proposition. So, everything from payroll to benefits to navigating the complexity of being a business and having the ability to execute on a co-employment relationship. So, I would say the value proposition is as strong as it's ever been. I think it remains strong. The demand is there. The organization is focused on PEO bookings as an execution lever for us. And I'm pleased to see that we did just that in Q2, and we've really had - this marks the fourth quarter of positive bookings momentum from the PEO.\nTien-Tsin Huang: No, that's great. Thank you, Maria.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Caroline (indiscernible) on for Jason. Thanks for taking our question. So, pays per control growth has been 2% quarterly through the first half, but the guide for full-year 2024 is still 1% to 2%. So, what are the drivers of the second half deceleration, or do you think that the high end has become more likely?\nDon McGuire: Caroline, thanks for the question. We said we would go to - we'd be 1% to 2% for the year, and we certainly have that 1% to 2% range still in the back half. We're not really anticipating any slowdown in pays per control, but we certainly have it built in. So, perhaps we're a little bit conservative there. But as we sit here today, the employment demand continues to be robust, although still declining somewhat, but I think we're confident that in the back half, we're going to be declining a little bit, but still coming in on that 1% to 2% range for the year. Not really much more to say there other than employment demand, labor markets continue to be maybe a bit softer than they were, but as we saw this morning in our NER report, hirings still out there, still good growth. So, not a lot of extra color, I don't think, to add around pays per control. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nDan Dolev: Hey, guys, great results here. Just a strategic question, obviously if you look over the next 12 to 18 months, interest rates are coming down. There is a big debate out there on the ability to offset some of those headwinds in terms of revenue. Can you talk about maybe some idiosyncratic initiatives that you could do to offset the headwind from declining interest rates? Thank you so much.\nDon McGuire: I think that's really a macro question. I guess the macro answer to that would be that if interest rates start to decline, we'll see an offsetting increase just in economic activity. And if we see that increase in economic activity, we should see revenue go up. We should see bookings opportunities go up, et cetera. So, I think that if interest rates come down - and there's lots of debates, whether it's two cuts or four cuts, et cetera, who knows, but if they do come down, we should certainly avoid the recession. Nobody's asked about a recession on the call today, so thank you. I think the consensus is that there's not going to be a recession. So, certainly any of the polls suggest that the economy's healthy with 3.3% GDP growth in the last report. So, if rates come down, the economy should remain healthy, and a healthy economy should help continue to contribute to our growth.\nDanny Hussain: Dan, I'll just add also, our model involves reinvesting further out in the yield curve, and as you know, we're still reinvesting at higher rates than what's embedded in the securities that are rolling off. So, even if we do start to see short-term interest rates fall next year, which is obviously consensus at this point, a lot of that will be offset by the reinvestments that we have further out in the yield curve. And so, it's too early to be talking specifically about the interest rate outlook for next year, but we would just recommend you keep that in mind.\nDon McGuire: Yes, that's fair. I think if you look at our reinvestments, our current reinvestments are still at 4%, which is higher than our average yield today. So, there still are opportunities. Our float is expected to continue to grow over the next 12, 24 months. Certainly, it's going to grow a little more slowly than we would've expected at the end of last quarter, but there's still upside from float, which is perhaps not as much upside.\nDan Dolev: Great. Great results, again. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Christiansen with Citi. Your line is open.\nPete Christiansen: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions. Now that we fully lapped ERTC, I'm just curious if you've noticed any changes in client demands or competitive tactics, particularly in the down market?\nMaria Black: Yes, good morning, Pete. The ERTC, as you know, and I think what you're referencing is the new deadline that was pulled forward five quarters actually. So, the deadline actually as it stands is potentially today. I think we're still waiting for the final kind of execution, if you will, of that new deadline. But arguably, we're having to execute on behalf of our clients with today in mind. And so, there's a tremendous amount of volume that we are pushing through on behalf of our clients, and it has put pressure into the system, which is hard to watch and witness, by the way, as it relates to the very clients that are supposed to be helped by this and the challenges that they're facing trying to navigate it. So, we're doing everything we can in our power to help and process these claims. In terms of financial impact for us as it relates to ERTC, it isn't a financial impact to us. I think it's very de minimis as it relates to our overall revenue, as it relates to our overall incremental. We really, from a standpoint of what we're looking toward, it's about supporting our clients. And so, I think some of our competitors have used it more as a business and a revenue than us as it relates to how we're thinking about it. But undoubtedly, the advancement of this deadline to today has not been ideal for really anyone engaged in it.\nPete Christiansen: That's helpful. And then I'm curious, the combination of HCM and payments functionality, has certainly been a theme. EWA is obviously a big portion of that and now cross border. Do you see opportunities to increase penetration there or to add more capabilities either through partnership, M&A, furthering payments, and I'm thinking perhaps even like in disbursements, those sorts of things? Thank you.\nMaria Black: From a strategic standpoint, Pete, what I would offer is continuing to solve for our clients and employees and how they engage with us. If you imagine across ADP, we pay 41 million wage earners in the US. That's 25 million. I think last time we talked about our Wisely offering, what we disclosed was that we had 1.5 cardholders or something like that. So, to just kind of give you the opportunity scale of it, we believe there's tremendous opportunity to increase how we're engaging with our clients, whether that's through the likes of Wisely, it's through the likes of EWA, as you're suggesting, or it's any other type of payments and things that we can do to make it easier for our clients and employees to move through the world of work, right? And so, the way I think about it and the partnerships that we're actively out there in the market talking to and thinking about, anywhere we can add value in our clients and employee life and flow. So, as they move through their day and they clock in through ADP's mobile app, which by the way, we have 10 million users that are actively using our ADP mobile app, so as they're engaging with ADP, are there opportunities for us to insert value there? Whether that's things like EWA, it's things like payments, it's things like financial and wellness apps like the companion app we have through Wisely. These are all top of mind for us as we go through our strategic discussions and as we think about partnerships in the future for ADP.\nPete Christiansen: Thank you so much. Super helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one last question, and that question comes from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. So, just a multipart question on PEO and following up on some of the commentary earlier on solid bookings and moderating PPC, sorry, paper control headwinds. As we look at the WSC growth, we have continued to see a sequential improvement there, better than what we saw last year. And just given the commentary, is it fair for us to assume that we should continue to see that improve as we go through the year? And then on revenue per WSC, I was wondering if you could comment on, looks like pricing trends are positive, but if you could comment on any other puts and takes participation, anything else that could help drive better revenue per works at employee. Thanks.\nMaria Black: So, the answer to your question is, yes, we do expect that the booking contribution, coupled with a bit of stability on the pays per control side, coupled with retention getting more favorable on the back half, all of those things should lead to the re-acceleration that Don mentioned earlier, that we've been pointing to in the back half. I think in terms of other componentry within the PEO, you mentioned a few of them. There's payroll per works on employee. There's workers' compensation. There's State unemployment. Some of these things are things that we're still waiting to really see the outcomes. I'll give you an example. One of those is State unemployment in terms of - obviously, we sit here today forecasting what that looks like. Most of those rates are issued throughout this quarter. And so, while we have some line of sight, in the end, we don't know entirely what the State unemployment outcome - we do expect that it creates a little bit of a - rates are going down year-on-year again this year. But again, only time will tell. Sometimes the States, as an example, make very strange decisions that aren't always in line with what's happening from a broader labor and unemployment perspective. So, all that to say, I think - I don't know that I could sit here today and give you any componentry that seems strange or out of the norm. I think they're all things we're watching as we look toward the re-acceleration in the PEO in the back half.\nAshish Sabadra: That's very helpful color. Congrats on the solid results.\nOperator: Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Maria Black for any closing remarks.\nMaria Black: Yes. So, really quickly, I think I'll end with how I ended my prepared remarks, which is a huge shout-out to all of the associates and the entire ecosystem across ADP. So, that's ADP associates, partners, channels, all of the stakeholders that really contributed to what was a good, solid Q2, but also a good, solid first half. I'm really excited about the back half and what we'll accomplish, not just in fiscal 2024, but moreover in calendar 2024. It's a time and it's an exciting year for ADP. This year is the year that we actually round our 75th anniversary. And then when I think about who this company is over the last seven decades and 75 years, I can't wait to see what we're going to do in the next 75. So, look forward to sharing in that celebration with all of you as we head into 2024 together. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does include the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning. My name is Michelle, and I'll be your conference operator. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to ADP's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. I would like to inform you that this conference is being recorded. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Danny Hussain, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nDanyal Hussain: Thank you, Michelle, and welcome everyone to ADP's first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Participating today are Maria Black, our President and CEO; and Don McGuire, our CFO. Earlier this morning, we released our results for the quarter. Our earnings materials are available on the SEC's website and our Investor Relations website at investors.adp.com where you will also find the investor presentation that accompanies today's call. During our call, we will reference non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe to be useful to investors and that exclude the impact of certain items. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. Today's call will also contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations. I'll now turn it over to Maria.\nMaria Black: Thank you, Danny, and thank you, everyone for joining us. This morning, we reported strong first quarter results, including 7% revenue growth and 12% adjusted EPS growth, and we made significant progress on the three strategic priorities we shared with you last quarter. Let me begin by quickly reviewing some of our financial highlights from the first quarter. We had a solid start to the year in Employer Services new business bookings with record-level volume for first quarter which was supported by a particularly strong September. Among our best performers were our small business portfolio and our compliance-oriented solutions. Overall demand in HCM has remained steady and we maintained a healthy new business pipeline at the end of the quarter across our business. Our Employer Services retention rate once again exceeded our expectations. Although, retention declined slightly versus the prior year, including in our small business portfolio, we continued to see resilience among our clients. More importantly, our overall NPS scores reached a new all-time high, positioning us to stay near these historically high retention levels. Our Employer Services pays per control growth was 2% for the first quarter as our clients continued to add employees at a pace that is gradually slowing. And our PEO revenue growth of 3% in the quarter was relatively stable versus last quarter, reflecting solid PEO bookings performance offset by deceleration in PEO pays per control growth. Don will speak to our updated guidance in a moment, but the demand environment for PEO as well as our other outsourcing services remains healthy. Moving on, we made meaningful progress across all three of our strategic priorities that we outlined last quarter. Let me start with an update on some actions we took in Q1 to lead with best-in-class HCM technology. First, we began embedding Gen AI features into our products. In Q1, we integrated Gen AI into Roll to further enhance its conversational UI and make it even easier for small business owners to quickly obtain customized Payroll and HR guidance. We also began rolling out ADP Assist, which delivers insights and recommendations to make complex HR work simple. We've enabled ADP Assist for select Workforce Now clients, beginning with a Report Assist feature that allows practitioners to easily extract the insights they're looking for. We look forward to continuing to build on the live feature set of ADP Assist to further enhance the experiences of both HR practitioners and employees. We also had some exciting product developments beyond AI. Our clients tell us they need personalized experiences and deep integrations to help them manage the complexity of running a business today. To help address this, we recently launched a new product called API Central, which enables businesses to easily and securely connect their ADP workforce data across systems using pre-populated APIs and tools. This is a feature our clients have increasingly asked for and we have already seen a strong uptake. In Q1, we complemented the launch of API Central with the acquisition of Sora, an intelligent workflow automation and data integration tool. Sora's unique capabilities will allow our clients to automate people processes by unifying various applications such as HR, IT, CRM, and more, creating a smarter and easier-to-use experience for our clients. In Q1, we also launched ADP Workforce Now for construction, a comprehensive offering designed to help clients with the unique payroll and HCM needs of the construction industry. This verticalized offering combines tailored Workforce Now capabilities and reporting with a team of dedicated specialists for the construction industry. While ADP has always served clients across the full spectrum of industries, construction stood out to us as a vertical with enough complexity to warrant a more tailored solution, and we're excited to further strengthen our offering in the mid-market. We also announced the launch of our corporate venture capital fund earlier this month, leading with best-in-class HCM technology requires that we stay attuned to the frontier of HCM innovation. And now, in addition to the organic efforts we are developing in ADP Ventures, we will invest in and partner with early-stage startups to strengthen our core business our core business and to extend into natural adjacencies. Two of our early investments focus on improving lifestyle benefits to drive associate engagement in simplifying the incredibly complex leave management process that businesses and their workers have to address. We're excited to build on these partnerships and develop new ones. Overall, Q1 was a very busy quarter on the product front with much of the work we're doing representing seeds of innovation that will position us to continue shaping the future of work. Our second strategic priority is to provide unmatched expertise and outsourcing solutions. In addition to launching the pilot of ADP Assist for our clients, we also launched the pilot of our new Agent Assist embedding Gen AI in the flow of work for ADP Associates. So far, we have enabled our call summarization capability to select associates. Thanks to this Agent Assist feature, those service associates no longer need to spend time writing up case notes after client calls, which should make our associates more effective and also allow us to quickly aggregate real-time client feedback to continuously improve our products. We are also piloting Agent Assist real-time guidance for our associates to help them with support content and guided workflows and to more easily share their accumulated knowledge in a way that's customized to individual client cases. We are excited to continue working toward additional Agent Assist features to help our implementation and service associates deliver better, faster service and to help our client satisfaction scores continue to reach new record levels. Our third strategic priority is to benefit our clients through our global scale, and in Q1, we expanded on this advantage. In August, we extended our leading global footprint by acquiring the payroll business of BTR, our longtime partner in Sweden. Acquisitions like this strengthen our multi-country payroll ecosystem while also positioning us to grow a local HCM business in countries with attractive growth prospects. In Q1, we launched Roll in Ireland, representing the beginning of an expansion into the European market, where we believe an AI-based payroll app coupled with our existing on the ground ecosystem will allow us to expand our SMB business outside the U.S. And during Q1, we also announced plans to deepen our existing partnership with Workday to deliver enhanced global payroll compliance and HR for the many clients we jointly serve around the world. Partnerships like this reflect our long-standing commitment to provide the personalization and overall experience our clients desire. Before turning it over to Don, I wanted to highlight a couple milestones in two of our businesses. Our suite of workforce management solutions, sometimes referred to as time and labor management, reached more than 125,000 clients in the first quarter, benefiting from a double-digit growth rate these last few years. Scheduling and precisely tracking time has become more important for employers over recent years in order to meet evolving legislative requirements, and we look forward to continuing to invest in our workforce management solutions to drive higher client attach rates. We also now serve more than 150,000 retirement services clients, which is up more than 20% from the 125,000 clients we served at the end of fiscal 2022. We anticipate growth for our retirement services business will remain strong in the years ahead as the provisions of the SECURE Act 2.0 and additional state mandates continue to phase in and as companies of all sizes continue to recognize the importance of positioning their workers well for their eventual retirement. I'm proud of our start to fiscal 2024 with both strong financial results and meaningful strategic progress. Our roadmap for the months ahead is keeping us incredibly busy. And with this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to recognize our associates across sales, service, implementation and technology whose efforts and outstanding performance are positioning us to consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. Thank you, all. With that, I'll turn it over to Don.\nDon McGuire: Thank you, Maria, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide some more color on our results for the quarter and update you on our fiscal '24 outlook. Overall, we had a solid Q1 and are not making changes to our consolidated outlook, but there are some moving pieces I'll cover. Let me start with Employer Services. ES segment revenue increased 9% on a reported basis and 8% on an organic constant currency basis, ahead of our expectations. As Maria shared, ES new business bookings had a solid start with especially strong growth in September. The demand environment is stable, our pipelines are healthy, and we are on track for our 4% to 7% growth guidance. Our ES retention did decline slightly in Q1 versus the prior year, but that was slightly better than we expected. At this point, we are maintaining our outlook for a 50 basis point to 70 basis point decline in full year retention, which continues to embed an expectation for small business losses to increase due to higher out of business rates. But if recent trends continue, then we would hope to outperform that range. ES pays per control growth was in line with our expectation in Q1. It decelerated modestly to 2%, and we expect this very gradual deceleration to continue in the coming quarters and are maintaining our outlook for 1% to 2% growth for the full year. Client funds interest revenue increased in line with our expectation in Q1, but we're raising our full year outlook based on the latest forward yield curve, which result in a modest increase in average yield to 2.9% from our prior expectation of 2.8%. We now expect client funds interest revenue as well as the net impact from our client funds extended strategy to be up $35 million from our prior outlook. Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar strengthened, representing a drag relative to our prior fiscal '24 revenue outlook. In total, our strong Q1 ES revenue growth combined with higher than expected client's funds revenue for the rest of the year effectively offset the adverse FX movement and we're maintaining our fiscal '24 ES revenue growth range of 7% to 8%. Our ES margin increased 220 basis points in Q1, driven by both operating leverage and contribution from client's funds interest revenue. For the full year, we are raising our fiscal '24 outlook to now anticipate an increase of 150 basis points to 170 basis points, which reflects the benefit of higher yields, partially offset by higher spend on Gen AI projects and usage, as well as a small amount of dilution from our recent acquisitions. Moving on to the PEO. We had 3% revenue growth driven by 2% growth in average worksite employees in Q1. As Maria mentioned earlier, our PEO bookings growth was solid, but pays for control growth continued to slow and was lower than expected, particularly for clients in the professional services and tech industries. This resulted in a slightly softer Q1 worksite employee count than we were anticipating. As a result, we now expect fiscal 2024 PEO revenue growth of 3% to 4% with growth in average worksite employees of 2% to 3%. Our PEO sales pipelines are healthy and we continue to forecast their worksite employee growth gradually ramping in the back half of fiscal '24. PEO margin decreased 90 basis points in Q1 which is more than we had planned. The decline was primarily driven by a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit as well as higher selling expenses. We now expect PEO margin to be down between 50 basis points and 100 basis points in fiscal '24 with the continued assumption for higher selling expenses as well as year-over-year headwind from a lower workers' compensation reserve release benefit than we experienced in fiscal '23. Putting it all together, there is no change to our consolidated outlook, but I would like to share some color on cadence. In Q2, our client funds balanced growth will lightly impact the payroll tax deferral that we had in our average balance for the past two years, which creates some grow over pressure on our client's funds balance and will result in more modest ES margin expansion in Q2 than other quarters this year as well as a modest revenue impact. As a result, we expect consolidated revenue growth to moderate before accelerating slightly in the back half. And we expect adjusted EBIT margin to be down slightly before ramping in the back half of the year. This was already contemplated in our guidance at the outset of the year. So again, no change to our consolidated guidance. We continue to forecast fiscal '24 consolidated revenue growth of 6% to 7% with our adjusted EBIT margin expanding by 60 basis points to 80 basis points. We still expect our effective tax rate for fiscal '24 to be around 23% and we anticipate adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 12%. Thank you. And I'll now turn it back to Michelle for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first just want to double-click on the PEO side. I think that, the information you gave helps to understand some of what happened in the revised guidance, but maybe just help us understand what's giving that back half ramp confidence, especially, as you expect pays per control in the kind of broader macro to continue to decelerate. Where should we get the acceleration in the PEO WSEs? Is it purely based on bookings ramping? Is it based on an expectation that the base will stabilize? Maybe just dig into that a little bit further because they're moving in different directions.\nMaria Black: You bet. So, good morning, Samad. It's Maria here. I thought I'd kind of break down your question with respect to the PEO, call it, double-click. So I'll start by commenting on the first quarter. So, I've mentioned, we did see deceleration in PEO pays per control. So as Don mentioned in the opening comments, that is a byproduct of what we're seeing in the pressure with respect to, as you know, that business tends to skew more into professional services technology. The pays per control deceleration is happening at a faster clip in those cohorts than the broader base. And so said differently, the pays per control growth in the PEO is decelerating faster than we expected and faster specifically in those cohorts. So in terms of the contributions, that is the contribution to the deceleration or the new guide to worksite employee growth that we're seeing in the first quarter. We did have strong bookings in PEO in the first quarter. That said, it did come in slightly below where we had hoped for, so it was still higher than overall employer services. It was a good quarter for the PEO and this is now the third quarter in a row that we've seen strength in bookings in the PEO. And that's important to note because really the strength in PEO bookings is what ultimately will yield the reacceleration that you're asking about in the back half. That coupled with kind of what we're seeing in retention. So while retention is stable and stabilizing inside the PEO, it isn't back to the high growth levels that we saw, call it, a couple of years ago in the last year or so, and as such as those compares continue to lap coupled with retention continuing to accelerate, if you will versus stabilize. We will see contributions from retention, we'll see more contributions from bookings and that's really why we anticipate the worksite employee guide for the year that we've given.\nSamad Samana: Great. And Maria, I actually had a follow-up for you as well on the international side.\nMaria Black: Yeah.\nSamad Samana: After seeing the rollout of the product into Ireland. And I'm just curious, how should we think about the expansion beyond the U.S.? I know ADP already has a presence and it's a meaningful contributor to revenue, but just should we think about international maybe being an offset to some of the slowdown that we're seeing in U.S. revenue? Just how should we think about the cadence and impact as you move more international with your core HCM solutions versus just helping U.S. employers that already had an international presence?\nMaria Black: Yeah. Absolutely. So I'll speak to Roll, which is what I commented on in the opening comments. So we did roll out, no pun (ph) unintended, our roll offering into Ireland. And it is an exciting bit for us, albeit it's very early days, right? It's actually only been a couple of weeks. But we're excited about it because it's the first of many countries where we intend on taking the, call it, very down market offering into our various countries throughout international. And it's really about marrying that product with what we see as still potentially greenfield opportunity within our international space and really leveraging the ecosystem that we have, that's everything from distribution to all the services call it around, the offers in various countries. So we're very excited about that. Now, in terms of the overall growth contributions in the short term of rolling out Roll into Ireland, I would say they're negligible. I would say even Roll over time this year, I think it would be, not a meaningful contributor to bookings. To me, I think this is really about a long-term investment that we're making across international and what we see as a continued opportunity for us. So you kind of mentioned is this companies that have a presence in Europe, that exist in the U.S. with folks working in or call it in international? And the answer is, this is both of that coupled also with a lot of our, what I would say, best-of-breed offerings in international. So we see growth opportunity really across the board in international and that's everything from the down market, which we're going after now with this new product offering of Roll. So we see it in the SMB space, we see it in our best-of-breed space and we also see it in our global MNC space. So really excited about the long-term growth opportunity that continues to be international. And while on international, I thought I would just mention because it's important to note, we did have a very strong quarter with respect to international, albeit that quarter is obviously off of a compare Q1 of last year that was less favorable, but it is on the heels of what was a very strong fourth quarter finish in international. And so, all the way around, I continue to be incredibly excited and optimistic about what it is that we can go accomplish and continue to build in our international offering.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. So, Maria, I was hoping if you can comment on just how you're seeing the overall macro situation evolve and maybe how that may affect demand? And if you can specifically unpack that within the ES segment, maybe talk about some of the areas that came in better than you expected versus any areas that may have been lighter or downtick versus the prior quarter.\nMaria Black: Absolutely. Good morning, Bryan. So happy to comment on what we saw in the first quarter with respect to the overall performance of bookings, but also the demand. So I'll kind of start with the overall performance. I mentioned in the opening comments, we did see strength, continued strength in our down market, so really excited about that. Also saw tremendous strength in our compliance solutions offering. So think of it as all the stuff that hits compliance tax, things of that nature. So we're pleased with what we saw with respect to new business bookings. Those are the two that really outperformed. And it's exciting to see because really that entire down market offering and that's everything from our run offering to retirement services, insurance services, we continue to see tremendous strength there. We saw that all of last year and definitely the finish last year, and it makes me happy because it's a lot of the places that, well, good performance makes me happy regardless, but it's a lot of the places where we've been making meaningful investments both in the product as well as the distribution. So excited to see the continued performance there and the outperformance. The overall results do keep us in line with our full year guide. So excited to confirm that again here today. In terms of the overall demand environment and I feel like I've been saying this quarter-to-quarter, but we're not really seeing any major changes in demand. Demand is still strong, demand is still healthy. We see that in our bookings results. There are all sorts of other indicators that we look at in terms of pipelines, in the up-market, in the mid-market, certainly in the down-market. We're looking at things such as new appointments and kind of activity, excuse me, activity measures to really give us a guide on whether demand is strong. And I would tell you pipelines are healthy year-on-year and certainly activity is healthy. And so we don't see a big demand change again this quarter. In fact, itâ€™s kind of the opposite stepping into the quarter on the heels of a strong September. We feel really good about where our pipeline sit year-on-year, which again is giving us the confidence in the full year guide. As always though, Bryan, we continue to keep an eye on the macro. We continue to keep an eye on our global space and international and making sure that we're understanding both any macroeconomic changes coupled with any demand environment that could shift given everything kind of going on in the world, if you will. So that's the current story on kind of pipelines demand in the quarter.\nDon McGuire: Yeah, maybe..\nBryan Bergin: Okay.\nDon McGuire: If I could add a couple of comments on the macro, certainly macro continues to be pretty positive. Unemployment rates continue to be near decade lows here in the United States. Unemployment rates around the world continue to be quite low. The discussion about whether or not we're going to be in a recession, I think the odds are now not for a recession. So soft landing is pretty much what is being anticipated. Interest rates are expected to have peaked here in the US. So I think all things considered, things are pretty positive. I think the one area that we put in our original guidance for the year and that we continue to look at is our guidance had in fact contemplated a slowing and pays per control growth. Maria mentioned that and talked about that in the PEO business, but we are confident. We are still seeing growth, albeit, we are seeing growth at a slower pace than we had previously. But once again, that was fully contemplated in our original guide for the year.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Don. My follow-up on the PEO. So heard you, the bookings are a little bit lighter than you expected to start, but you're also calling out, I think higher selling expenses impacting the PEO margins here year-over-year. So can you -- maybe talk about the puts and takes there driving that dynamic?\nMaria Black: Specifically on PEO margins? I will let Donâ€¦\nDon McGuire: No. But I think originally, Bryan, you mentioned bookings were lighter than expected. I think our bookings came in â€“ our bookings came in pretty good, as Maria has mentioned.\nMaria Black: Yeah. I think he's referencing the comment I made around PEO bookings was slightly lighter than expected. By the way, still higher than ES, which we expect to be the case throughout the balance of the year. So that's the kind of nuanced [Multiple Speakers]\nBryan Bergin: So the question there, you're also citing higher selling expenses impacting the PEO margin. So it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect there. Just trying to understand that.\nDon McGuire: Yeah. So we had planned the year, we talked about the growth being stronger in the second half in bookings, sorry, in margins than in the first half. And certainly we have seen some investment and some higher selling expenses and we'll see in the first half than we will in the second half, but nothing really surprising. A little bit off, but certainly we're in line with what we expected.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask just a couple of quick follow-up questions. First, I think the comment was made that you're still anticipating a bit worse performance in terms of out of business rates on a go-forward basis, but to-date those have been a little bit better than you had anticipated. Can you help provide some detail as to what you're seeing, why you think we're seeing better, survival rates, and kind of the things you may be looking at as indicators that could get worse on a go-forward basis.\nDon McGuire: Yeah. Demand continues to be strong in the economy overall, and I think that's supporting what tends to be this view that we're not going to enter into a recession. At best, there's going to be a soft landing. So I think that strong demand environment, particularly consumer demand is keeping small business afloat. So when you also look at what we're seeing in terms of new business formations, there seems to be continued strength in new business formations. So generally I would say that the environment, irrespective of the higher interest rates, the environment continues to be favorable for small business, and I think that's translating itself into what looks to be lower out of business than contemplated now. We have continued, as we said in our original guide, and as we will reiterate or update here today, we have continued to think that we will see a little bit more normalization in other business. So we'd have contemplated that, but we think we are getting closer to where we think we're going to plateau or hit the bottom there. So I think we're very close, and once again, I think it just comes back to demand environment. It tends to be supporting the economy more broadly and more generally and small businesses benefiting from that as well.\nMaria Black: Yeah. I think if I may, I think the only thing I would add is that it's still very early in the year, right? So when I think about retention, we did have a record level in fiscal '23. We were near that record level a year before, we were at that record level the year before that. And so we've had this tremendous strength. And I think Don is spot on in terms of all the reasons from a macro perspective that we've had that strength in terms of client retention. And so as that normalizes, we believe it's still prudent for us to have the retention guide that we have, which is really a byproduct of how we planned the year in the back half. So I think I got the question last quarter and so I'll answer it proactively this quarter, which is, are we just being conservative? And I think the answer to that question is, it's still early in the year. And so, if we do continue to outperform retention in the way that we outperformed in the first quarter, we hope that we will outperform for the full year. It's just early to take away that conservatism sitting here just, three short months into a very long year.\nJames Faucette: Yeah. And then, I want to go back to kind of a headline related question. You saw that -- you saw or you indicated that you'd seen kind of a 25,000 sequential improvement in retirement services and -- for clients, you alluded to some state mandates there, particularly around SECURE Act 2.0. Can you talk a little bit about what state mandates you've seen or that may be impacting that business or how long before we start to see benefit in their retirement services, post a new state mandate? So maybe we can help track headlines and anticipate like, how big of an impact any new requirements may have?\nMaria Black: Absolutely. So I think I've spoken quite a bit to retirement services as well as the SECURE Act over the last year or so. And I will tell you, I was excited to report the new milestone today in part because that business continues to show strength, but also because it's a business that I know is adding tremendous value into the world of work. And so, it is an exciting time. It does come as a byproduct of the offering, the investments we've made into the offering, and also these state mandates, some of which are anchored into the SECURE Act at the federal level, some of which are anchored state by state. Candidly, I could probably spend an hour with you and go state by state in terms of all the various mandates. What we see over the next year or so is the threshold of companies that need to comply with the state mandates starts to creep into, call it, the further down market, if not the micro market. And so, as all these states, a lot of them being on the West Coast, if you're looking for headlines tracking states like California, as they continue to pull down at what level do you need to comply with the state mandates and/or the SECURE Act, the more opportunity we will have to ensure that we're helping our clients to solve for this piece, keep them compliant. But again, back to doing good in the world, it's also something that's bringing the value to each one of these employees that are engaging with these clients, so.\nJames Faucette: Great. Appreciate that color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just want to ask about the decline in PEO. Looking at the employee base of PEO declining versus not necessarily the case, looks like almost the opposite in the employer services. So just trying to think about the trends. And does, typically the trend you see in PEO bleed into employer services and why maybe it's been a little bit weaker for pays per control there in PEO versus employer?\nMaria Black: Yeah. So just to clarify, pays per control in PEO is actually higher. We don't give that number, but it is actually higher than employer services. So I think the first piece suggests is that the bases are actually just different, right? So if you look at the pays per control across the broader ADP, it's really a reflection of a mix of industries. As I mentioned earlier, the PEO tends to skew, by design, by the way, for the offering. It's really -- the offering is the most valuable if you will to the cohorts that we offer it to, which tends to be more professional services, tech-oriented companies that want to offer employers or their employees benefits of choice, if you will, to be employers of choice. And so that skews that base slightly differently than the overall. And what we're seeing within the PEO base is a delineation between those cohorts and the rest of the base, if you will. So we cited it in the prepared remarks, but the deceleration that is happening at the PEO is still a byproduct of within that base having professional services and tech decelerating at a faster clip than the rest of the base. So to answer your question, does it bleed across? I think, we're already hearing these headlines in the market in terms of -- and we see it within our own ADP Research Institute data with respect to professional services and tech hiring being in a different position than the rest of the market. So I think I would suggest it's already been bleeding across. If you look at the last couple of quarters of that, by the way, that also tracks BLS data shows the same thing. You see it in wages. And so all of that to suggest, I would say, the trend we're seeing in the PEO is already in the macro, but the bases are slightly different, which is why you would feel it, the impact of it perhaps more significantly in the PEO PPC than you would in the broader PPC. That was a mouthful, by the way.\nBryan Keane: No that was helpful though. Thanks for that clarification. And then the other question I just had is the strength you saw in the ES new bookings especially in September and the way the pipeline looks, but you're not changing the total outlook of 4% to 7%. Just trying to figure out -- do you feel like you guys are maybe trending if things hold trending above the guidance range for bookings given the strength you saw in September in the pipeline and for SMB strength in the quarter?\nMaria Black: Yeah. What I would offer is that I'm incredibly pleased with the results in the first quarter, especially on the heels of what was an incredible finish last year. And so the pattern that we saw in the first quarter and the strength in September is not a typical of the pattern we see in this -- the first quarter on the heels of an incredibly strong fourth quarter. And so I am excited about the first quarter results, I am excited about the strength in September. But the excitement is actually less about, call it, the finish in September and more about what we see on the year-on-year demand environment, what we see in activity, what we see stepping into this next quarter. And that does give us confidence into our full year guide at that 4% to 7%. What I would also offer though is it's a long year, and when you think about where the skewing, if you will, or the contribution of new business bookings happens for us on a full-year basis, it is in that third and fourth quarter. I'll much call it larger than the first and second quarter. And so we believe it's prudent to given the line of sight that we have today, just a quarter in. But we feel confident in the guide, we're excited about the performance, we're excited about how we're stepping into the quarter. The second quarter that is but we also still have an entire year ahead of us.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.\nMaria Black: You bet. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give us your latest thoughts on the competitive environment in PEO and how that's sort of evolving over time? I think there's somewhat slower than historical growth across the industry. Are there any signs that the market is, saturated with providers or is there any competitive overlay to PEO performance?\nMaria Black: I would suggest that the PEO ASO conversation, if you will, or PEO HR outsourcing offerings kind of continues. I don't know that there's anything new to report, Ramsey. I think from my vantage point, it's always been a very competitive environment. We all have slightly different PEOs from one another. I think we talked a lot about ours today and the way that it skews to professional services and tech. I think you have others that skew to different types of industries. You also have other PEOs that perhaps are a bit more down market. We tend to skew a little bit more upmarket than some. And so I think all the PEOs look slightly different. I think we all know our models are also not identical in terms of how we actually go-to-market, whether it's through the strength that we have in the competitive advantage of being able to have ADP's client base contribute about 50% of those upgrades. So I think how we go to market, our models, never mind the models of, you know, fully insured to self-insured, et cetera. I think similar trends are within the ASO offerings, or some refer to them as HRO offerings. And so I think within there, you also have various models and various go-to-markets in terms of the, some competitors perhaps some -- have some flexibility or more movement between ASO and PEO than I think we've cited in the past. And so, I think all that to suggest I think the competitive environment is about the same and remains. I think Iâ€™m optimistic and expect growth in both our PEO bookings as well as our HRO and ASO offerings throughout the balance of this year. And so I think we remain very, very excited and optimistic about the growth of those -- all of our HR outsourcing offerings, both in this year as well as the long term.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. And a follow-up for me. Could I ask you to revisit those comments you made about higher selling expenses in PEO? What does that mean exactly? And also just I wanted to make sure I understood that, Don mentioned that, there's some expectations those may continue, but they're still, in essence, sort of a non-recurring step up in expenses. It's not a permanent step up in, in expenses in the segment.\nDon McGuire: Yeah. We saw higher selling expenses in Q1 for the PEO, and we expect to see higher selling expenses year-over-year in the first half, but we do think that that's going to settle down into the second half. So we're not looking at the kind of growth that we saw last year. I think we commented quite extensively on the many, many salespeople we added into the business last year and had great success and allowed us to finish the year the way we did. So those folks are in place. So we are continuing to add some sellers. We will add though, most of those sellers in the first half and it's important to also, I think, call out here that, what we are seeing with our sellers is that we are getting much better retention within the seller community. So we are hoping and expecting to benefit from the improved tenure that we should see from the selling organization as we go through the balance of this year.\nRamsey El-Assal: I got it. So it's headcount-related primarily. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks so much.\nMaria Black: Yeah. I think it's a timing thing. I think that's theâ€¦\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Just staying on PEO for a second and maybe if we can just refresh a little bit here. I'm just thinking back to the Analyst Day two years ago, we thought it was a medium-term 10% to 12% grower. Now it's 2% to 3% at the moment. There was definitely some post-COVID normalization. But maybe just, Maria, if you want to take us back through the dynamics in terms of just how the business has evolved from your perspective? And is there a potential path back to double-digit growth for this business if the macro is a little bit more cooperative?\nMaria Black: Yeah. So I'll let Don kind of speak to the medium-term targets and kind of the path back. But I think, from my vantage point, and I said it earlier today, that step one is the continued reacceleration of bookings. And so this is the third quarter that we're pleased and we did have a solid contribution of PEO bookings to the overall bookings picture in this quarter. That was the case last quarter, it was the case the quarter before. And I think the reason that I go to that is not just because it's the piece that will accelerate the growth and path us back to what our long-term goals and medium-term targets are with -- for that business. I think it's also because it speaks to the demand environment. It speaks to the value proposition and the strength of that offering that still exists in the market. And so I think that's a big piece of it. I think step two is the continued acceleration -- reacceleration of retention. So I mentioned that retention has been stable and as we reaccelerate retention back into that growth, that also will contribute to obviously the revenue. And then last but not least, Jason, you mentioned it, the macro headwinds, and I think I talked about the last couple quarters, how that's been the post-pandemic, call it, nuances that impacted that business. I think we talked a lot about the renewal over the last couple of quarters. Now we're seeing these trends in PPC. My view would be that all of the post-pandemic waves that have been, call it, flowing through the PEO and all the variables that make up that model. We're still seeing some of those case in point being really call it the reversion of what we saw several quarters ago, which was when professional services and tech was in a massive hiring boom, now we're seeing the opposite of that, right? So I think we still have some of these waves, kind of shuffling through or whether or going through -- flowing through the PEO. And if and when the macro changes with respect to that, that certainly will help reaccelerate that business as well. So in terms of the path back, I'll let Don kind of speak to the medium-term targets.\nDon McGuire: Yeah. I think Maria covered it very comprehensively there. I would say that when we established the mid-term targets, I think a lot of things have changed since then, certainly the inflation environment and that we've seen in particular and Maria just mentioned professional services and technology, we saw incredible growth in those sector -- in those segments and growth beyond what we thought we -- or what we had predicted in the mid-term targets or spoken to. I think now we're seeing some reversion. We do, though, continue to be incredibly positive about that business. We think it definitely has a place, and we think that we will make our way back. But as Maria also said, it's a little bit early to forecast when we think we're going to get back to some of those mid-term target growth areas that we had discussed.\nJason Kupferberg: Understood. That's good color. Just a follow-up on float yield. It looks like it was actually a tick down slightly quarter-over-quarter here in Q1, amid a higher rate environment. But just curious what the callouts might be there.\nDanyal Hussain: Hey, Jason. That just relates to the mix between short-term and extended in long. So in Q4, we were a little more levered to overnight partly because of this debt ceiling issue. We had to be deliberately skewed shorter duration. But in a typical Q1, we would generally have a lower short portfolio. And so there is seasonality in the average balance wouldn't read much into it. The year-over-year number is a much more relevant metric.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi. Good morning. Forgive me, if I'm asking another clarification on the PEO side. Just --what the -- was the slight softness in the bookings also related to the PS and tech sectors and also with the pays per control within PEO, is that more of a healthcare participation issue or just labor weakness in those sectors?\nMaria Black: I really apologize, you actually blipped out during the first part of your question. Would you mind just repeating -- yeah, there was a word missing so.\nTien-Tsin Huang: No, I probably didn't ask it very well. Just wanted to make sure the bookings softness on the PEO side, was that also in the professional services and tech sectors. And then also just on the pays of control, was is a labor weakness or health care participation?\nMaria Black: Yeah. Listen, so I'm glad you're asking this question actually because I just want to reiterate, we were very pleased with our PEO bookings. And so there wasn't softness, there was strength and growth in the PEO quarter bookings. In terms of how we skewed the year, it was slightly lighter than we had positioned our planning, which is why it contributes the way that it does to the overall worksite employee growth. But, it's -- again, the worksite employee deceleration is really about the PPC story. And so I just want to reiterate, we were actually very pleased with the quarter from a PEO bookings perspective. In terms of the industries, I think it's a mix. I think we continue to see the PEO execute with respect to the industries that we target which tend to be into those categories. As it relates to, this comment around kind of within the PEO, the deceleration that is happening faster in professional services and technology versus the broader base of the PEO. Again, I don't want to give kind of the numbers of what that is, but it isn't like the entire base is sitting in professional services. It's just that subset, if you will, of the base. And it is really, again, kind of triangulate to the macro that we're seeing and the same type of data coming out of ADP Research Institute, out of the BLS and it's really about hiring. So it's less about, call it, layoffs and it's really where the professional services and tech industries, we're doing massive hiring, call it, a year ago, six quarters ago, it's really a lack of hiring that's happening in those businesses. Did I answer that question?\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yeah. [indiscernible]\nDanyal Hussain: Tien-Tsin, just on the participation piece of it, the pay per control wouldn't be impacted by participation rate, but the reported revenue would be. So to the extent, workers are taking plans, cheaper plans or fewer plans. And there's a little bit of that. You do see it in the revenue per WSE, but the WSEs themselves wouldn't be impacted.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you, Danny. I didn't ask it. Well, that's perfect. That's what I was looking for. On the -- we get questions around pricing as well. That's why I was asking about the participation side of things and if there's a difference there, it sounds like it isn't. On the international front, just my quick follow-up. Just I think Sweden was the call-out in terms of acquisition. Why is Sweden important to own? Just I'm not as familiar with some of the specific countries that you're targeting. And I'm curious if this is just part of a -- maybe a broader plan to aggregate international payroll.\nMaria Black: Absolutely. So listen, I have to take this question because I think you may know that I'm actually -- I was born and partially raised in Sweden. So I thought it was prudent to make it the very first country that I announced. I'm actually completely kidding. This was obviously well in motion before my time. But I -- it sounds like I might be closer to Sweden than you are. And for us, it is an exciting time for us. We have had this partnership with BTR for quite some time for us to be able to acquire the payroll business of BTR is exciting because the Nordics are growing, and this does give us a physical footprint into Sweden, which allows us to expand further into the Nordics and really take advantage of the growth trajectory of those economies. So this is obviously payroll, but also in the beyond payroll opportunities that we will have in years to come. So really excited about the acquisition not just because it's near and dear to my heart, but moreover because the Nordics represent growth, and it's exciting to think about us having a physical presence there.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. You called out strength in ES bookings, particularly in the small business market with RUN. Could you provide some texture into the bookings trends you saw in mid-market with Workforce Now and then up-market with enterprise? And any insights you have into international bookings in the quarter would also be appreciated.\nMaria Black: Absolutely. So yes, we did have great strength in the down markets, kind of moving on up in the mid-market. Certainly, we have continued solid demand in the mid-market. That's inclusive of our Workforce Now platform. It's also inclusive of our HR outsourcing offering. So I spoke a bit about the ASO models, the HRO models earlier in that mid-market also support -- is supported by the PEO. So we do see continued demand from the mid-market. I think the way I always think about it is not getting any easier for companies in that mid-market to navigate being an employer today. And so we expect continued strong mid-market growth. I think in the up-market, since you asked about the enterprise space, one of the call-outs we made last quarter was about the strength that we saw in our next-generation HCM offering, and we did see that strength continue into this quarter, which we think is fantastic. We also see strength in the pipeline in that space year-on-year. So excited about what we're hearing from our clients, the sentiments around the offerings that we have in the enterprise space. And then I think I touched a little bit on international earlier, but our international business did grow nicely in the first quarter. Again, it was a benefit of a little bit of an easier compare year-on-year. But we also had, as I mentioned, a really strong finish and a strong fiscal '23 in our international business. Again, what I measure is partly the results. But as I think about the look forward, it's really about pipelines and what I would say, our international pipeline year-on-year have a fair amount higher than they did a year ago, which gives us the strength to really feel good about our international bookings to remain healthy through fiscal '24.\nDavid Togut: Thanks for that. Just as a quick follow-up, Don, you called out part of the 90 basis point margin decline in PEO being traced to a difficult comparison on workers' compensation reserve adjustments a year ago. Can you quantify for us how large those were as we think through the margin comparisons for Q2, Q3 and Q4 of FY â€˜24 in PEO?\nDon McGuire: Yeah. So as we've had very favorable reserve releases over the last number of years and somebody called out last year in the K, you would have seen the favorability there. So just to be clear, we are still seeing favorable reserve releases, but we are not seeing -- we didn't see the reserve release to the extent that we did Q1 to Q1 of the prior year. So the numbers will be in the Q, but it's about $6.2 million less than it was in the prior year. So that's the quantification of it. And if you kind of translate that into the margin, it's about 60 bps to 90 bps -- 60 bps of the 90 bps decline comes from the lower reserve release. Now once again, we think that we're going to continue to see reserve releases and were favorable as the actuaries get back to us and let us know what's happening, but we're not seeing any underlying changes or large changes that would lead us to be any less optimistic about seeing continued releases in the reserve.\nDanyal Hussain: And David, sorry, just to clarify, it was a $6 million benefit in Q1, which is about $8 million less than the prior year.\nDavid Togut: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. At HR tech, you got to see a lot of your new solutions, particularly focused on, the AI Assisted solutions. Maria, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about your philosophy with regards to, which solutions you would charge additional for -- how are you thinking about monetization? And then I've got a follow-up in terms of process improvement.\nMaria Black: Sure. Good morning, Mark. I'm pretty excited about all of our new solutions that you would have seen at HR tech. So I think I'll take a minute to kind of think or talk through how I'm thinking about Gen AI in general, and then I'll tell you how I'm thinking about monetization because I think it'll make more sense on the other side. But when I think about Gen AI, I think it will impact everything. So the answer is it's going to be everywhere impacting everything that we do across the entire client life cycle. So it's about how we develop products. That's everything from developer co-pilot types of tools that everyone is talking about. It's about how Gen AI will be embedded into our product, it's about how we go-to-market and modern seller stuff that I've spoken about for years and how we actually have the ability now leveraging Gen AI to actually acquire clients. And then the most obvious being how we serve them, how we implement them, how we become more productive and make our clients more productive as we serve our clients. And so when I think about Gen AI, and I think most -- everyone has probably likened it to things like whether it's software or the Internet, I think my answer to you is, it will be in everything that we do and in the fabric of who we become. And so in terms of the monetization side, I think it's less about, charging a PEPM (ph) on a per feature. So let's say, you know, some of the things I talked about today, which probably doesn't sound that exciting, like report writing or if you look at the earnings release document, you'll see in there a job description that's pulled in the screenshot showing roles. So these things probably don't sound that exciting, but they're pretty exciting because they are the seeds of innovation, as I used earlier to really show what -- how Gen AI will interact with everything that we do kind of in the fabric. So said differently, Mark, like, I don't think we're going to be charging separately to get Gen AI job description written or Gen AI report written. I think it's really about continuing our innovation journey to do all the things we've always done, which is really about becoming more productive. It's about solving things for our clients and making them more productive. And I think that, to me, the fruits of that labor really end up in new business bookings, and they end up in retention. And so that's not to suggest that there may not be things. But I don't think it's really to me about $0.50 PEPM (ph) here and there. To me, it's really about the innovation journey we've been on. This just allows us to do it at a faster clip. And I'm really optimistic and excited about the things that we're seeing. In terms of other things that we're measuring, we actually have the entire organization rallied to engage in these tools. We actually have some goals that we put out there in terms of -- by the end of the year, how many of our associates that set across sales and implementation and service and technology that are engaging with these tools. Right now, they're sitting at already above 10% of our base of associates that have the ability to touch these tools are already playing with them. I would tell you our entire sales organization are comping up a bit because the digital sales or inside sales where we've deployed a lot of these modern tools over years, have an ability to become that much more productive, engaging our new prospects and new sales. So as you can probably tell, like, I literally could go on and on and on, but I think my answer to you is, it will be everywhere across the entire client life cycle that we have, and I'm very optimistic about the long-term implications of this on all the major metrics that make up this great business model.\nMark Marcon: That's terrific. And then with regards to just the productivity enhancement. I mean, particularly when we think about service and implementation, from a longer-term perspective, can you describe how much more efficient you think your service personnel could become? And how much efficiency you could end up gaining there and the implications from, continuous margin improvement as you continue to go along that journey? I know it's early days, but just how are you thinking about that?\nMaria Black: Yeah. Listen, Mark, it is early days, right? And that's not for a lack of scoping it, right? So we have had because it's not as though we haven't had all of these business cases over many years on how to become more productive, and we've had machine learning and regular AI in our house for a long time. And this does give us a step change to that innovation. But it's still too early. I think to sit on an earnings call and commit numbers, but that's not for a lack of internally having scoping and line of sight to what we believe are pretty exciting goals for us to go chase. And again, some of those goals have existed for a long time, but now we have technology that I'm hopeful that we can actually finally crack the code on some of these really big enhancements that we see. But certainly, productivity is a big piece of it. I know I talked today about Agent Assist and this idea of call summarization. Again, it probably doesn't sound that exciting. But for someone who used to sit on the other side of that, you see whether it's a prospect call or a client call gets summarized and recapped into a very quick format that's usable. These are, hours and minutes of time. even on the seller side, we actually are launching something called rapid pre-call planning, and I think about the hours I used to spend 27 years ago, researching a company to get myself ready to go in and have a conversation with a prospect that brings value, enabling our sellers to have all of that productivity. So I think it's -- again, it's too early to give you exact hundreds of millions of dollars of types of quantifications. But arguably, we are actively looking kind of case by case and really picking the ones that we believe sequentially will be the most accretive to drive the most amount of productivity, the most amount of value back to our shareholders, but candidly, the most amount of value to our clients.\nMark Marcon: Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one more question and that question comes from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just on the launch of the construction vertical software. I'm just wondering, is this sort of part of a bigger shift to develop more vertical specific HCM solutions for your clients? I understand, construction may be a more complex vertical, but wondering if there's more of a vertical specific strategy that could develop beyond the construction vertical. Thanks.\nMaria Black: So I'd like -- what you're suggesting, and I think the answer to that could be yes. And I think when I think about -- back to selling 27 years ago, I used to sell construction companies and the complexity that they have has always existed and candidly, a lot of the features and functionality that we have and are now pulling together to make it an actual solution for that vertical existed many years ago. And that's everything from things like job costing, obviously, compliance and reporting, think about certified, compliance type of reports for payroll, things of that nature. And so it's really about pulling it together and marrying it with a service organization that can support the complexity of that vertical. I think that, to me, is a big change, so we did add some features. But a lot of these things we've had, and we pulled them together and we're marrying it with the ecosystem of a dedicated service org that can actually really help the construction industry and this vertical saw the complexity of being in that industry. So I think what I would offer is that, it's an exciting time for the construction industry, specifically for our Workforce Now clients, and I see this, just as you suggested at the beginning of other places that we could pull together our existing tech with a dedicated type of service model and solve real challenges in the business for various verticals.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Just wondering if you can give an update on sort of Next Gen HCM and Next Gen Payroll, attach rates and how we're sort of trending there, relative to expectations?\nMaria Black: So Next Gen Payroll. That was the question?\nScott Wurtzel: Both.\nMaria Black: Both. Okay, just making sure I heard it right. So I think I touched base really quickly on Next Gen HCM. And I think I noted to the excitement that we have that we continue to see the strength in the Next Gen HCM offering into Q1. So we had a strong fourth quarter. What I would suggest is that we actually brought in more Next Gen HCM in the first quarter than we saw all of last fiscal year. But again, one quarter these things can sometimes be lumpy. But I think for me, it's really about the sentiment. And so we recently had an Analyst Day. We had a handful of our clients up on stage that, shared with us the impact, the platform is making for them. And as you would remember, we spent a lot of our discussions over the last year talking about scaling implementation, on-boarding the backlog. So pretty exciting to see some of that backlog that's no longer backlog on stage, speaking to the value proposition, and that's supported by continued strength which means our sellers are excited to continue to sell the Next Gen HCM offering. So I think that's all very, very positive. Similarly, we have continued focus in the Next Gen Payroll. And so what I would offer there as we continue to make headway. So as it's not deployed across the entire mid-market. We continue to make headway to solve for more complex features, things of that nature, that will pull it further into the upmarket of the mid-market. But as you know, that Next Gen Payroll engine is also what's attached to the Roll offer. So the other exciting part about that engine is it is the thing that's taking us into the SMB space internationally. So I feel really excited about the road map for that offering and the contributions that it's making into the mid-market today, but also into the long-term growth of the company internationally.\nScott Wurtzel: Awesome. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer portion for today. I'm pleased to hand the program over to Maria Black for closing remarks.\nMaria Black: Yeah. So thank you, Michelle. And listen, it's hard for me not to sit here and reflect on a year ago. And so I was driving in this morning and feeling candidly a bit nostalgic because it's exactly one year ago that Carlos and I sat here and announced the transition of me becoming CEO of this amazing company. And so I'm incredibly nostalgic and proud today. I'm proud of our first quarter results. I'm really proud of the execution of the team, both with respect to the results, but also with everything that you heard in terms of the progress we are making on a very cohesive and strong strategic outline and priorities. But mostly what I would offer is that I remain incredibly humbled by the -- over 60,000 associates that I've had an opportunity to engage with over the last year who continue to make this company everything that it is and absolutely amazing. And I just wanted to say that I'd like to thank each and every one of them for inspiring me every day. So with that, that is the conclusion of our call and until we meet again.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."
