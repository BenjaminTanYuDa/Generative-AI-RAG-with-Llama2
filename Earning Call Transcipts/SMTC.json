        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Semtech Corporation's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After management remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. And I would now like to hand the conference over to Mark Lin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead.\nMark Lin: Thank you, operator. Good day everyone and welcome to all those joining today's call, including analysts, investors, and my fellow employees. I'm Mark Lin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and I'm joined today by Mr. Paul Pickle, President and Chief Executive Officer. Today, after market close, we released our unaudited results for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2024 which are posted to our Investor website at investors.semtech.com. Supplemental earnings materials including net sales data by end market, reportable segment, and geography, as well as the share count table reflecting potential share issuances from our convertible notes at various stock prices are also posted to our Investor website. Unless otherwise noted, all income statement-related financial measures will be non-GAAP other than net sales. A discussion of why the company considers such non-GAAP financial measures useful along with reconciliations of such non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these statements. For a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the Safe Harbor statement included in today's press release and in the Risk Factors section of our most recent periodic report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a reminder, comments made on today's call are current only as of today and Semtech undertakes no obligation to update the information from this call should facts or circumstances change. With that I will turn the call over to Paul to discuss our business and end markets.\nPaul Pickle: Thank you Mark. Semtech's Q3 financial performance generally met my expectations with net sales slightly above the midpoint of guidance. I'll provide a bit more color on end-market performance, which we believe improves understanding and comparability of our business before turning the call back to Mark. Infrastructure net sales were $43.2 million, a sequential increase of 2%. Hyperscale data center applications benefited from continued momentum of AI-driven applications and grew both sequentially and year-over-year. We recorded growth in general compute data center applications as well. We had record shipments in 200-gig, 400-gig, and 800-gig applications with our Tri-Edge and FiberEdgeproducts having been well received in data centers around the world. Net sales for other products in the infrastructure end market including passive optical network, wireless, and infrastructure-focused transient voltage suppression faced a headwind from elevated channel inventories, though POS for each of these products grew sequentially. As stated previously, PON tenders are expected in our fiscal fourth quarter and we have seen some early channel pause in anticipation of this timing. We believe we continue to lead the PON space. Last March, we announced the world's first 50-gig PON chipset which enables multi-gigabit broadband services for multi-tenant locations and will drive new use cases for the PON market including enterprise applications for small business needs. This chipset is currently sampling with module vendors and system integrators with positive feedback. We have also started sampling 1.6 terabits in linear pluggable optics applications at optical module vendors and system integrators with early success. We believe our technology solutions have meaningful advantage in AI applications offering lower cost, lower power, and lower latency. Net sales from these leading-edge applications are expected to begin in the second half of calendar year 2024. On the automotive front, while net sales are currently small, we believe we are making inroads with the next-generation Ethernet protection devices. Adoption of automotive Ethernet continues to accelerate and our leading products in this space are positioning us for future growth. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales from the infrastructure end-market to be flat to slightly down as the market further digests channel inventory. High-end consumer, net sales were $37.6 million, a sequential increase of 10% benefiting from seasonality in TVS products primarily directed at smartphone applications. Sales from these TVS products increased both sequentially and year-over-year with corresponding increases in POS. Strength in the quarter was driven by a measurably greater protection content in current generation products at a leading North American smartphone manufacturer compared to prior generations. Design wins also grew 10% sequentially for handheld devices and wearables further validating our recent innovations in this space. Sales from proximity sensing products declined slightly on a sequential basis, but grew year-over-year, while encouragingly POS grew on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Our PerSe Sensing solution provides capacitive touch end-user sensing capabilities. For wearables, PerSe sensors improve the user experience by providing automated functionality and rapid response interactions such as smart assistant activation, noise cancellation control, and media player management. Our PerSe sensors also provide the industry's best performance of minimizing end-user's exposure to RF energy. This allows equipment manufacturers to achieve compliance with specific absorption rate or SAR regulations while maintaining optimal signal connectivity. While PerSe is well known in the smartphone space, efforts to reduce SAR have opened opportunities and design-ins for applications including notebook computers, tablets, and wearables. For the fourth quarter, we expect net sales from the high-end consumer market to be down due to the aforementioned seasonality and channel inventory digestion. Industrial, net sales were $120.2 million down 26% sequentially, but within expectations with the bulk of the decrease in the ISP modules business. Semtech delivers product leadership in low power wide area and broadband applications and will continue to leverage these areas to return the business to grow. IoT Connectivity Services reported net sales of $24.2 million up 1.4% sequentially highlighting the stickiness and relative stability of this recurring revenue stream. Within AirVantage Smart Connectivity, we continue to see growth in our advanced service line, which offers global access through a multi-EMC multi-profile single SIM solution. Our carrier plus offering which simplifies regional deployments with multiple Tier 1 carriers is showing growth, particularly in Australia and New Zealand. These growth areas are partially offset by the sunsetting of legacy technologies, but net to stable sales. Net sales of LoRa-enabled industrial products declined sequentially but POS and bookings increased, providing some indication of market recovery. Connected gateways increased 3% sequentially and we are encouraged by substitutes, increases in POS for in-node products. Adoption of LoRa-based solutions in the utility space gained further traction in Q3 with multiple European-based utilities announcing RFPs with a requirement for a LoRa solution. We are also integrating LoRa into custom SoCs for our customer, which has expanded opportunities in hearing aid applications. Returning to our hardware business and expanding on the regulatory environment, I discussed in our last quarter's earnings call, as the largest North American module supplier, Semtech is definitely seeing a meaningful share shift in pipeline from our competitors to us and pipeline is translating to design wins. Customers in this market have varying degrees of risk tolerance, most sensitive as critical infrastructure such as industrialized laptops used by first responders in cellular routers used by utilities, we are now benefiting from the next wave of concern with applications that involve payments or personal identifiable information. Point-of-sale devices are a prime example where there was perhaps a hyper-focus on cost for point-of-sale applications, the security of Semtech as a North American supplier has resulted in design wins that translates to revenue in the second half of next year. Our near-term headwind for our router business is government spending constraints under the current federal budget situation with traditional end-of-year public sector spend lower than trend. For the fourth quarter, we expect industrial net sales to be flat to slightly down with continued inventory digestion and the aforementioned public sector headwinds, but stable net sales from our managed connectivity offerings. Now I'll turn the call back over to Mark.\nMark Lin: Thank you, Paul. Turning to our Q3 results, we recorded net sales of $200.9 million slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Paul discussed end market net sales performance with infrastructure up 2% sequentially, high-end consumer up 10% sequentially, and industrial down 26% sequentially. I'll refer participants to our investor website for the last five quarters of net sales data by end market, reportable segment, and geography. Gross margin was 51.3%, a sequential increase of 170 basis points and above the high end of our guidance for the quarter. Gross margin reflected well-negotiated supplier concessions to reduce third-quarter manufacturing costs offset by incremental inventory reserves and unfavorable mix. Supplier agreements particularly benefited IoT systems for the third quarter. Netting these items, consolidated gross margin would have approximated the midpoint of guidance. Operating expenses were $82.5 million favorable to the midpoint of guidance with R&D expense sequentially increasing about $900,000 and SG&A sequentially decreasing by $4.1 million. Net interest expense was $22.3 million with only about one week's benefit from the capital structure change completed at the end of October. We recorded net earnings per share of $0.02 based on a diluted share count of 64.3 million shares. Changing gears to the balance sheet, we ended Q3 with a cash balance of $123.8 million and undrawn revolver capacity of $280 million, working capital moved in a favorable direction with inventories decreasing $19.6 million. Principal outstanding on our debt was $1.4 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.57%. At the end of the third quarter, our consolidated net leverage ratio calculated in accordance with our credit facility was 6.49 and we expect to maintain compliance with our debt covenants for the next 12 months. Including the effects of our convertible notes and interest rate swaps, loan principal was about 83% fixed and 17% floating at the end of Q3 and all of the loan principal was long-term. At the end of Q3, there are no scheduled principal payments on our senior secured credit facility until January 2028 and no scheduled principal payments on our convertible debt until November 2027. I'd like to discuss the five-year $250 million, 4% convertible note we issued this past October. In addition to the benefits of increasing our mix of fixed to floating rate debt and eliminating scheduled principal payments on our term loan, we placed emphasis on reducing cash interest costs. A Federal Reserve rollback in interest rates may occur when I turn on the high beams, I expect to be in a protracted elevated interest rate environment. As I mentioned, all of our loan principal is long-term. While deleveraging is a key use of excess cash, the convert eliminated $67 million in scheduled principal payments next fiscal year providing optionality. Also addressing dilution, please refer to the convertible notes dilution table posted at the Semtech Investor website. This table provides incremental dilutive shares on both the 2027 and 2028 convertible notes. On both the notes par value or principal is paid in cash and conversion of par is settled in cash or shares at Semtech's discretion. Assuming the conversion of both notes was settled in shares, dilution of 20% is reached at a stock price a bit above $85 with no effect on diluted shares today. On the date we priced the 2028 notes offering, a $250 million raise would be the equivalent of 15.6 million shares or an immediate 24% dilution, which I do not believe counteracts the benefit of reduced interest expense. I hope this extended explanation provides some insight into management's calculus in issuing the convert. Free cash flow was $12.4 million use of cash, reflecting ongoing restructuring and integration activities, but sequentially improved $6.5 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $28.1 million compared to $39 million in the second quarter. Now turning to the fourth quarter guidance, we currently expect net sales of $190 million plus or minus $10 million. Our industrial end market is expected to be flat to slightly down. The high-end consumer end market is expected to be seasonally down and the infrastructure end market is expected to be flat to slightly down. While end customer demand consisting of direct shipments plus POS has improved, our net sales guidance reflects a thoughtful reduction in channel inventories. This unexpected product mix, gross margin is expected to be 48% plus or minus 100 basis points. Operating expenses are expected to decrease 10% at the midpoint to $74 million plus or minus $2 million primarily reflective of cost reduction actions we've already implemented in the third quarter. SG&A is expected to sequentially decline 13% to $33.5 million at the midpoint. Research and development expense is expected to sequentially decline 8% to $14.5 million at the midpoint and we do not believe we have materially impacted projects that result in near-term revenue or materially affect any of our customers' roadmaps. Net interest expense is expected to be $21 million reflective of timing of interest rate reset periods relative to quarter-end. These amounts are expected to result in a diluted loss per share of $0.05 plus or minus $0.06. I'd now like to turn the call back over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first question, Paul, you talked about the growing pipeline on the module side for North American operators. Just wondering, can you give us a sense, how big is that total TAM, how much of the North American market maybe currently supplied by the Chinese module vendors? Just trying to get a sense of how big this opportunity is. If you size it last quarter at $200 million. It sounds like it's bigger than that now and then I've got a follow-up for Mark. Thanks.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah. Thank you, Quinn. By the way, I think you've got the best title on -- loved the Harry Potter reference on your note this past quarter. Okay. So, getting to your question on the pipeline. I would put that market worldwide just over $6 billion if you want to kind of strip out APAC and automotive in particular, you're talking about just north of $3 billion. I'd be excluding NB-IoT in that as well. So, if you look at the North American portion of that, there is a significant automotive number in North America and another analyst put quartile about $4 billion over five years in terms of revenue into North America. So, excluding automotive, we look at it about a $400 million opportunity.\nQuinn Bolton: On an annual basis.\nPaul Pickle: Yes.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Perfect. And then, Mark, you guided the gross margin of 48% down from over 51%. I'm just, I guess, having a little bit of difficulty kind of reconciling the quarter-to-quarter change. It sounds like there were potentially some benefits in the fiscal third quarter that may not repeat, but it also sounds like there were some inventory charges that you took in the third quarter. So, can you walk us through what are the -- what are the major puts and takes going into the fourth quarter from either increased inventory reserves mix among the product buckets and whatever else might account for the change quarter-to-quarter. Thank you.\nMark Lin: Yeah. Thanks, Quinn. I'll also point out that our guide for Q3 was a 48% gross margin. So regarding the equivalent margin. So there's quite a bit of noise going kind of up and down, but -- and we're quite a bit mix sensitive, maybe take the mix normalized mix at 48%, that translates to 48% target for the next quarter.\nQuinn Bolton: So, really 300 plus points of benefit in Q3 that you don't expect to repeat in Q4.\nMark Lin: That's right.\nQuinn Bolton: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you, Paul, Mark. So, it sounds like POS is starting to improve just broadly speaking, but it also sounds like there is still some channel inventory out there. So, could you maybe quantify that for us in either weeks or percentages or anything like that because it does sound like POS is really encouraging data at this point?\nPaul Pickle: Yeah, I think if you reflect on my comments from the last earnings call, we talked about an improvement -- an improving bookings trend over the last four quarters, I'd say at this point we're five quarters in, if we look at just the IC portion of the business and the component portion, so hardware, we obviously took a significant decline this past quarter. So, it's a little hard to judge where that's going to settle out. So, I'll separate the two for the time being. If we look at it, there is, in some cases the channel is quite lean wherein we're well positioned to respond to any kind of market demand or market upside. In other cases, consumer we'd seen that come back, the inventory pools have been quite good, so the channel is relatively healthy. It's hard for me to put a number on it overall, because it really does depend on the product line. But if I were to speak philosophically we would want roughly 8 to 12 weeks in the channel, in some cases, we're right at the 12-week number, in some cases we're over that number and we're really kind of watching POS. Lastly on the component portion, I would say that for the first time, we've kind of crossed that one-to-one book-to-bill threshold. So that's very encouraging for us in terms of where we sit in the recovery. On the hardware side, I have less visibility on the module business that's seen a significant decline this past quarter. And the reason for that is it's largely a direct business, and those customers don't report the inventory numbers back to us. We obviously do talk to them and we do hear what they're saying in terms of what their inventory levels are, but we've seen some decline in the industrial end market markets similar to what we've seen in routers, roughly 30%. We think our customers are experiencing the same as a result, the inventory levels in terms of weeks on demand or weeks on hand have kind of gone up. And so I think it's still early to kind of look at what we're what we might characterize as a correction there, but we would expect that to play out over the next quarter or two.\nTore Svanberg: No, that's helpful color and as my follow-up on the infrastructure business, I appreciate the guidance, they are flat to down. But could you maybe talk about some of the sub-segments there and what you're expecting especially, data center is that expected to still grow and perhaps that's being offset by still weak PON and Wireless.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah. So, yep, the data center, definitely we're still expecting some positive things. I will highlight that we're fairly early on though with no change in data centers. So, the traction has been quite good. The channel has been pulling those orders in anticipation of usage and most of the stronger production ramps are really kind of slated for Q1 calendar. So, while we're seeing a nice uptick, last quarter, we saw 112% increase in terms of data center numbers. We saw an increase this quarter in terms of data center numbers. I would expect a little bit of absorbing the pools and then kind of a resumption of growth as we kind of look at next calendar year. So the data center number is going quite well. PON is a little bit steady state until we get a look at those tenders. We're expecting those tenders to come in, in the January timeframe. That's a bottom one-month delay, still ahead of Chinese New Year, but we were expecting kind of see those in December. It's now been moved to January. So, we'll see those tenders and will be able to respond accordingly. But overall, I'd say, infrastructure is fairly well positioned. There are some bright spots. Most of its moving sideways, but those increases that we're seeing definitely offset as we kind of look at the module business, although I don't expect significant further decline, we just expect that to move sideways at this point.\nTore Svanberg: Sounds good and congrats on the progress. Thank you.\nPaul Pickle: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Ellis: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. And Mark thanks for the additional transparency with the convert dilution things you posted on the website. So, Paul, I wanted to start off with one for you and follow up a little bit on Tore's question, but maybe take a longer-term view, would be helpful if you could provide some more color on things that you see as we look out over the course of calendar '24, in data center, for example, what are some of the things that you're really excited about in traditional data center versus hyperscale. And then similarly, what are some of the things you have your eyes on in base station and then in PON?\nPaul Pickle: Okay, yeah, thank you for that question. I will say the data center, we're pretty excited. I'm personally excited about data center. What we're seeing there is just an absolutely rapid SAM expansion report expansion in data center. And I would really kind of bifurcate data center or hyperscale data centers into general compute bucket and an AI bucket, those are two very different applications. They have different needs and right now the appetite in AI is pretty insatiable. So we're making grounds in general compute in 4 by 100 applications as well as, as you kind of look at just breakneck speeds in AI and so most of the volume that we ship today really is more 50-gig single lambda, I know kind of throw out 400-gig, 800-gig but we kind of look at, for us it's a generation of device thing. We look at 50-gig devices, we're shipping 100-gig devices and we got out in the market, but are not shipping against those devices quite yet today, 200-gig single lambda that's performing quite well and POCs. So as I kind of look out over the next several years, the massive growth that we expect to happen in AI -- AI-driven data centers is just a significant upside opportunity for us and we're well positioned to take advantage of that. So to me, this is across the board, small customer set very exciting opportunity to say the least.\nCraig Ellis: Got it. And then you talked a little bit about needing to see tenders in PON but on the base station side of the business, anything standing out look at 2024.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah. If you go back to ECOC, we did -- we did a 1.6 terabit test case with Coherent, I should say demonstration and this was for 10-K, let's call it mid-haul type applications. So, in terms of pushing up the speed or the availability to implement high-speed connections in both short-reach as well as mid-reach or long-reach applications both of them we're well-positioned to take advantage of. So as infrastructure just drives data connectivity up and there's that last mile that will happen naturally as well in both European and North American countries as well, China is important to us. There has been with all the infrastructure growth in multi-tenant dwelling growth their data connectivity has been really key. We would expect share in North America and Europe to creep up as they look to implement higher-speed applications as well. So just released that 50-gig part as well. We're looking at 25-gig adoption, but I think for from my standpoint, the tenders in January are going to give us a bit of a near-term effect as we continue to gain market share in other territories, which will give us a little bit more of a long-term tail as well.\nCraig Ellis: Got it and then I'll flip it over to Mark for the second topic and it's on operating expense. So, Mark, very impressive guide, decreasing OpEx by 10% quarter-on-quarter to $75 million, and it sounds from the color that you provided that that decrease is structural. But I wanted to confirm that. And then if you could just any color on things we should expect as we look to 2024 with OpEx for example FICA impacts early in the year, any other optimizations that you might see coming. Thank you so much.\nMark Lin: Sure. Thanks for the question, Craig, it's, we've got $74 million for next quarter and we're pretty confident in hitting that number because the actions that we need to hit that number have really been taken. Of course, this could be seasonality in calendar Q1 with things like FICA resets, but we're pretty comfortable staying around this neighborhood in terms of OpEx. There may be some incremental increases, slight incremental increases in R&D, but that's just really timing.\nCraig Ellis: Got it. Guys, congratulations on the progress. Thank you.\nPaul Pickle: Thank you.\nMark Lin: Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Stoss: Hey, guys, Paul, I wanted to follow-up on the whole cellular module side of the business in your commentary, I'm just curious, a lot of these design wins that you're lapping up now, when do they turn to production? And I'm curious if any of those customers are contemplating or having conversations with you about rip and replace kind of existing products that they already have say, with say Quectel or is it just kind of go-forward products and then I have a follow-up.\nPaul Pickle: Yes. So as we kind of look at it. Most of the programs today that we're bidding on or have captured, they are really kind of talking about the production starts near the end of the calendar year. So I would not characterize those as rip and replace. However, if there is -- I will note that on the customer side, there's a little bit of hesitancy in terms of forecasting, just because of some market uncertainty. So if there a little bit of bolstering and market confidence, I think people will start to mark some of these a little bit early, but right now they are kind of slated at the end of the calendar year. And there are additional wins and pickups that we're noting, not additional follow-on programs that we've classically held. If we get some additional scrutiny out of the China select committee, it's highly possible that we'll see some of those critical infrastructure applications look for an acceleration of nex-gen or that next design and that I would characterize a little bit more in terms of rip and replace. Because I don't think somebody will pull module out of existing hardware without refreshing that hardware as well at least at this point.\nAnthony Stoss: Got it. And then just a broader question on visibility, and also if you think your January revenue guide down a little bit sequentially. Do you think that marks the low on a quarterly basis going forward?\nPaul Pickle: Yeah. So I think I'm remembering my comments from last earnings call, I was pretty confident on the last earnings call that we hit a bottom on the IC business, we continue to see that we're making progress in moving forward on the IC business I think even though some of our peers, maybe are not seeing that we've corrected, a little bit earlier in the cycle and we continue to see that strength. At this point I don't anticipate the hardware business getting any worse. I can say that, last quarter was a little early. We're just starting to see that decline. We've seen some pretty good, let's say, steady numbers out of the routers business, the modules business did pull back as we saw a little bit of a knee-jerk reaction at the customer base, where a lot of that direct business has had and the Fed buying I think was a little bit of a surprise as well for some of that customer base, where our product goes into. We've seen a little bit of sluggishness coming into the Fed buying season. And so I don't anticipate it getting worse. If anything we might get a little bit of pickup sooner rather than later, but I think it's a little bit early to tell.\nAnthony Stoss: Very good. Best of luck guys.\nPaul Pickle: Thank you.\nMark Lin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Rolland: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to talk on AI as well, just given the attention it's all getting. So last quarter you guys mentioned large US hyperscaler I think could place some initial orders for some CDRs and TIAs for AOCs, lot of TLAs there, sorry, but would love an update there on any purchasing and then you talked about sampling some 1.6T products, were those, was that linear direct drive analog PAM4 CDRs and just maybe talk about your 800 and 1.6 opportunities as you see it.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah, I think -- so last quarter we talked about initial orders, but we actually saw some shipments for that large US based hyperscaler. So that is 400 gig application, those -- and I'll be a little bit cautious in terms of their ramp first half is going to be a bit sluggish, but we expect it to pick up as it goes through the end of the year, December was final qualification hardware and then it sets the forecast the forecast gets set according to that. So, right now things are moving rather nicely for that -- that's let's say roughly a $30 million annualized upside once it gets to full production and we would expect that that sales cycle to span three to five years or so. So things are moving rather nicely there. In terms of looking at, we will see occasionally 4 -- we do see 4 x 100s. We do see occasionally 8 x 100s, but really the next node in AI that we're talking about is 200-gig single lambda devices. That's where you start to see 1.6 terabit in any appreciable volume. We're looking at those speeds at both mid-reach 10-K type applications as well as short reach. But right now, it's just a really frothy opportunity environment for me to put a number on when those things start to translate to volume, I think it's a little bit early, but we're seeing really some nice numbers coming out of the POCs and some demonstrations. So, given the environment, I think it's going to be, I would expect this to be pretty quickly picked up, but I see that more of a second half calendar year '24 phenomenon rather than something in the short term, but we're going to see steady uptick of the 400-gig modules, certainly in the first half of the year and then it will strengthen in the second half and then that's when we'll start to see some really nice plans around 800-gig.\nChristopher Rolland: Excellent. Good progress there. I wanted to look at your segments also another way here. If I'm reading kind of the tea leaves right here, on the signal Integrity side, you'd expect that to fall and then Protection and Sensing maybe up and the other two IoT related down, is that kind of how we think about it?\nPaul Pickle: Yeah, I think if we look at APS, we saw some strong pulls, a little bit of digestion into that ramp for that smartphone -- North American smartphone manufacturer. I think we'll see a little bit of pullback, but largely due to some seasonality. That's really strong pulls up until the launch and then a little bit of pullback, so that's Protection. Protection should have a baseline component that's going to steadily improve from here. So, we've seen some nice stability in the base numbers, especially as it relates to the proximity detection and so we'll see that slowly strengthen. I kind of look at a 13-week booking average by product line and it's just been steadily improving, not really snapping back but just steady improvement as those inventories come off and our channel partners kind of anticipate some of those production runs. So SIP is a little bit of digestion, signal integrity is a little bit of digestion on a really strong data center number. We could probably see some surprises to the upside but right now, we're anticipating our revenue being a little bit softer on that channel inventory digestion for the initial launch. They usually like to validate the hardware and the numbers that you're seeing and then they kind of resume an additional schedule. So, Protection and SIP both kind of moving a little bit sideways at this point, but slightly down.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks so much, Paul. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nRick Schafer: Thanks, Paul. Thanks, Mark. I guess my first question if I could just maybe a high-level, and Paul, I was just hoping that you could share a little more about your strategic kind of vision for Semtech and what the Company you think it's going to look like you expect it to look like say in three years from now. I mean what role do modules in particular play long term and the growth opportunities there. I mean, do they justify the risk the associated margin pressure or do you see a path to maybe improving those margins demonstrably sort of more to kind of classic corporate average?\nPaul Pickle: So that's -- it's a -- that's a good question and you're putting me on the spot. So, I certainly appreciate that. So, what do we look like three years from now? There's no doubt that our core competencies really does kind of come from components and I do think that it makes sense to move into module products as long as you can pick up additional stacking margins. So, to have -- to produce a module that essentially has component content that you produce does make sense. I've participated in businesses before where a lot of times you have to produce a reference design and in some cases just makes sense to go out and sell that reference design and commercialize it, manufacture and sell it. You know, this gets a little bit more complicated and that's generally speaking from a Semiconductor standpoint, it gives a little bit more complicated when you start talking about IoT because of the diversity of use cases, you end up having to pull a lot -- a broad range of technologies through in order to produce an entire solution. If I had to be a module maker in and of itself today, the business model would be very different and I think my investor base would be very, very different. So does it justify in and of itself, the margin pressure, I think the answer to that is no. But if we can pull together a bit more of a comprehensive IoT strategy in which it becomes an enabling component on higher margin sales then, yes, I think it's quite possible that, that can happen. It doesn't necessarily mean that we have to own it for the entirety of that three-year, five-year play but cellular backhaul is always going to be a part of an IoT strategy and I do think that we have a rather large IoT opportunity in front of us that we need to kind of re-imagine that strategy and how we're going to capture that in the marketplace. So, if we can combine it and it becomes a part of the story, along with software, along with components, then I think it makes -- it's perfectly fine, makes sense, in and of itself, no, it doesn't justify the margin pressure and we would look -- in the meantime, we would look to continue to capture the opportunity and do you think that there is tremendous upside opportunity associated with modules, in some cases when you're engaging with utility companies, they'll want an LPWA solution or they might gravitate towards private network like LoRa solution. So having the opportunity to do both is an advantage as well as long as you build together a bit more of a broader product offering or solution and story. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of a color without specifically nailing everything down after five months.\nRick Schafer: No, I appreciate that. There's a lot of color, Paul, and actually a great segue to my next question, which is more, if you wouldn't mind maybe give a little bit more on the order trend side, sort of order velocity, however you want to describe it. And I'm curious, it sounded like that business was starting to pick up. I believe it's -- last call, I think you talked about it being stable sort of around $100 million or so a year. I'm curious if that's still kind of where you see that business for the foreseeable and if you could talk at all about sort of your strategy, if you feel comfortable table about the strategy to grow that business, maybe and sense of revenue funnel, if you're sharing those kind of metrics. Thanks.\nPaul Pickle: So you're talking about LoRa in particular.\nRick Schafer: That was a LoRa specific question. Yeah.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah. So I kind of build LoRa is about $100 million business. So thank you for that. Yeah. So I do think, as we kind of look, there is a significant opportunity for components or semiconductor content in IoT and it becomes, because of the diversity of use cases, it really becomes a multi-pronged strategy. You do have to have a software component, this is where we do have a rather mature cloud platform, we do have a rather mature, let's call it, gateway software team as well. And so as we kind of look at that, there's an overall theme that I do think that there is an opportunity for us to capture. But we need to -- we need to adapt this tenet of making private network deployment a lot easier. If we look at the connected in node, connected gateway, numbers those increased sequentially this past quarter, it further shows that there is a rather large opportunity and continued wave, even through a downturn, we're still seeing numbers from an end market standpoint that continue to migrate up where people are wanting an alternative of connectivity for, let's say, low bandwidth, low power devices. And so, that is still an opportunity that we believe in. However, I believe, I've said this before that we need to fill out the technology portfolio. Part of the reorganization that we're going through is to kind of group R&D competencies for us to take advantage of that and so we're in the middle of formulating that strategy in order to capture that vision of what we see making private network deployment very easy and part of that story is certainly LoRa along with a few other components in the technology portfolio. We're formulating that today and we'll be working on that over the next couple of quarters reorganizing around it, and then at the appropriate time we'll be laying it out so that we can kind of talk about what that market opportunity looks like exactly why we have a right to win that market opportunity and what that timeline looks like. In terms of overall opportunity, I know that it's been said that it's roughly we had a $1.1 billion pipeline in the past. Rather than qualifying that number, I'd say roughly, today we're around $400 million on that LoRa-based pipeline and we continue to work it, we continue to see the opportunity and use cases. We need to look for use cases that have a lot of commonality in solution -- product solution and then we need to start to work on delivering a standard solution to that end market, rather than just simply a component.\nRick Schafer: Thanks a lot for all the color Paul. Good luck.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Robert W Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nTristan Gerra: Hi. Good afternoon. Just as a follow-up to your commentary on Sierra Wireless, just looking at where we could see the revenue run rate before any type of synergies, including with LoRa, it looks like your quarterly run rate right now is probably a little bit below what it was two years ago before the big ramp up of last year. So, and you've talked about the October quarter being presumably a trough. So is a $100 million a quarter kind of a good base from which we should be basing assumptions before you -- you build any cross-selling opportunities? And then if you could elaborate a little bit on the share shift within the different businesses for Sierra Wireless? Thank you.\nPaul Pickle: Yes. I will comment on the share shift. I don't think we've noted any share loss or share shift, if anything, we would expect to gain some share in modules especially. If we look at routers, that's pretty steady. The one piece, if you want to call Sierra Wireless, a $400 million business, I said on the last earnings call I believe after it recovered, I would put it right around $460 million. I still think that's probably a good number although in the short term, I think your number is probably a little bit better, but -- so, let's take the $400 million, basically $100 million of it is going to be pretty steady, very predictable connectivity business, it's recurring great visibility. We're growing it, it's not going to be a barn burner in terms of growth rate, but it's just going to be steady pickup, good gross margin, and contribution. So, the routers right now we've seen about a 30% pullback, I'd say that's largely industry-wide. I would expect that recovery to bounce back a little bit from that -- from that base, but certainly not be what it was the previous -- the previous year. If you go back a little over a year, those numbers were a little bit elevated in a frothy buying season, and the modules that has fluctuated quite a bit. We'd probably put it somewhere around $260 million or so on a normalized basis and with some potential upside, we look at it about $390 million - $370 million upside opportunity in North America, but we don't expect to get 100% of that business. So we'll be pursuing that rather aggressively. It will take some time for us to realize that and we would probably look to deliver those in two years out.\nTristan Gerra: Great, very useful. And then from a follow-up question, so you mentioned making private network adoption much easier as an opportunity for LoRa, is that really 100% of your focus on LoRa right now, as it sounds like the bulk of the inventory correction associated with helium is behind. The feedback notably from the Things Conference is that there is basically much easier access to lower implementation than just a few years ago with a fairly clear path of kind of a one to two year ROI for customers who want to implement LoRa. So could you expand a little bit on what you think is still holding LoRa at a revenue run rate that admittedly is lower than the prior management team was guiding for a few years ago and any elaboration on where you see opportunities to improve the adoption?\nPaul Pickle: Yeah, I will say this, and I think the execution in LoRa is pretty good, let's say below expectations that were set by prior management but I still think anytime you grow a business from zero to $100 million in four years in semiconductor land that's usually pretty special. So, it's a unique technology. Obviously, it's a technology that the market is there ready to adopt. When you start bringing together a large ecosystem set of partners that all have to work together to drive the solution, it definitely is going to slow down, but as we look at adoption, it continues to pick up. There's a little bit of a blip in there in terms of helium gateways that maybe was a contributor to the numbers being a little bit larger than what actual market adoption showed, so during that frothy buying season. But I still look at it as good steady adoption. Overall the market needs something that's easy to implement. If we talk to customers that are looking for something that's lower base, they're not necessarily in IoT, they're not necessarily somebody that has the breadth of R&D in order to implement something from womb to tomb. So this is where we have done taken initiatives in the past in order to make LoRa easier to adopt, we are licensing the technology out in order to further that adoption and we'll continue to evolve and deliver to the market tools necessary to speed up that adoption. But I do think that there is a couple holes in the delivery of that that solution that we could fortify in order to speed things up.\nTristan Gerra: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please proceed.\nChristopher Rolland: Hi, guys, just a quick follow-up, the amount of turns business you guys expect to get to guidance in the quarter, POS trends.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah. Last quarter we were just over 50%, we're slightly less than that this quarter. It's not something that we will be tracking and reporting on, but it's slightly better than it was last quarter.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks so much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah, hey guys, thanks for sliding me in. Quick question, Mark. So in the analog space in the industry, we're seeing a variety of companies basically all of them start to guide down, I guess, looking at your results, you're faring much better. My question to you is, why is that -- is that a function of data center offsetting a lot of your traditional analog businesses or is it because you started the correction earlier or is there something else going on that is perhaps helping you do better?\nMark Lin: Yeah. It's both. I'll have Paul, he provided a lot of color on the end markets and for data center. But it is, we did sort of guide down before our peers in that group. So, I think that's another big portion of why we're cutting down from 200 to 190.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah, I think I've said it in a set of investor meetings at one time, the bane of our existence as an operations team that's really good. So when we got all the orders, our team had been able to secure the capacity and deliver on it. And I'm saying that, of course, tongue in cheek, they're phenomenal, predominantly efficient team, but we did -- we were able to secure that capacity and delivered as a result we shipped it all and saw the correction a little bit early. As a result, we're seeing the rebound a little bit early, but we are getting helped out with a couple of key markets, where we do have beachheads, one surprisingly enough is TVS, where we continue to innovate on the next-generation interfaces, we got some of the best specs out there. And yes, you do kind of share this with competition over time. But right now we're the only guy who can deliver and we're seeing upside as a result and AI is just a gift, it's phenomenal SAM expansion.\nHarsh Kumar: So on that -- on the AI stuff, can I ask you if your visibility is extremely solid, in other words you, are you seeing orders just pile up and for multiple quarters visibility or is it a situation where of course you're hand to mouth, but the orders are coming in, kind of spurts of a quarter.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah, I wouldn't say it's -- the orders are piling up, the design-ins are piling up and we anticipate the orders piling up. We did see a nice bookings increase this quarter. So it's early on in that trend, it will strengthen this next year as it rolls out but, ECOC was a nice validation on a few fronts. I think you might have seen some of the press releases that we put out. But just had some amazing feedback that came back from that. Our 200-gig single lambda devices, very well received, very well positioned and the industry does have a decision on which data center architectures they're going to implement, every Hyperscale hesitancy to do a little bit differently, but the bottom line is, it really doesn't matter what direction they go, re-timed, direct, it's all going to add up to additional SAM and growth for us even, it could be a bit more explosive, if they choose a particular route. But overall, it's just a very nice frothy environment and so we would start -- be starting the discussions in terms of capacity, securing the capacity for this next year that would be happening today, and then orders would follow.\nHarsh Kumar: And if I can ask one last one, do you think, Paul, that you are done cutting at this point in time, reached a pretty happy threshold, if you will.\nPaul Pickle: I'd say my goal was, I intimated that we probably had another $40 million to go. We did do that at this point. We pulled out $140 million out of the business and that was done thoughtfully with historical budgeting exercise. So if you go back in time, you look at 2017, you look at what the budgets were at those appropriate stages. And I think everything kind of comes down to just continual refinement and improvement at this juncture. I'm comfortable with the cuts that we made, anything that we do will just be to refine and improve our chances for growth in the future.\nHarsh Kumar: Great. Thank you, Paul. Thanks, Mark.\nMark Lin: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Cody Acree with Benchmark. Please proceed with your question.\nCody Acree: Yes, thank you guys for taking my question. The next one, I guess just a follow-up to Harsh's question, Paul what other segments you said you're reviewing today that you believe are near the bubble to require less investment going forward?\nPaul Pickle: So, I'd say that I've got -- I've got to practice or cadence in my management that I have always implemented, I review everything on an annualized basis. So, if we don't have good projects to invest in, we don't -- we don't just assign budgeting to business units just because they had it before. So, every project requires a justification, every project would have an opportunity attached to it. So, at this point, I scrutinize everything on a regular basis. Obviously, I can look at market expansion in certain areas and certainly feel a lot more comfortable, the risk profile associated with that investment, but we would look to as we kind of pull back OpEx overall, we'd look to re-fortify the beachheads. If those beachheads have -- have some, let's say, some sunsetting attached to them, we would look to take those investments and put them in other areas that are a bit stiffer topline growth.\nCody Acree: Thank you for that. And I guess secondly, just if you can summarize the improving demand that you've noted in the press release about your high-end consumer business and data center, how much of that is for near-term visibility for the current quarter, in the next six months and to what detail can you provide that's offsetting those two businesses. I think your guidance for both was flat to sequentially down.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah. That is correct. I'd say data center came in a bit -- a bit higher in Q3 than we fully anticipated. When I -- when I speak to improving demand, I'm really not talking about revenue, I'm talking about end-market consumption. So that'd be direct shipments plus POS and so you just have to kind of qualify that. To me, that's the best measure of where our business is going and it eliminates all the channel inventory noise. So when I say we have an improving demand, it's -- it's modest sequential improving demand that has been for the most part, improving over the last four quarters. That, I'd look to see corresponding booking rates, that 13-week trailing average booking rates that match that and I'm seeing that correlation. So, anything that I'd give you is not forecasted, it's in the rears, it’s in the rearview mirror, it's demand continually sequentially improving demand that we've seen over the last four quarters at least.\nCody Acree: All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Scott Searle with Roth MKM. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Searle: Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions and sneaking me in. Nice job on the restructuring efforts. Paul, maybe go back to modules, it sounds like you don't necessarily need any sort of a formal exclusion list on Quectel to win business because it seems like customers are diversifying away from that anyway, but I'm wondering, I don't think I heard any comments on that front. Is there an update on that front, and it sounds like based on the normalization of that business at around $260 million or so, that you're basically running at less than half that rate right now. When would you expect normalization on that front? I think last quarter you talked about the middle of calendar '24, is that what we should still be thinking about? So in the second half of '24 we're getting back to levels like that before you start to add on some incremental Quectel business.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah, I was trying to give you color in terms of what the calendar year is going to do for us. So if you do the math on that 260 and kind of tipping my hand when I -- when I think that this is going to recover and I put it in the second half. So this is after some feedback from customers, what we expect as well as some additional uptake from new design-ins. So on the -- on the exclusion list front, no, we don't need Quectel, FiberCom to be officially excluded in order to benefit from this, we are benefiting from it. We will continue to benefit from it. I think it as, even if the China Select Committee came out tomorrow and said okay, everything is fine, we're not going to put them on the list, we're still going to benefit from this, there has been enough shift because of the overall tensions that exists with China and the US, especially around networking equipment, and it's been going on for years. So, it's just now finally coming to a head where people are not willing to jeopardize their Company's business on the basis of using a particular supplier that might be $0.10 cheaper just doesn't make any sense. So, we're getting a lot of pickup, not to mention we have good relationships with Qualcomm. I come with those relationships, because of the previous work done in compute and so we're leveraging that in order to pick up very heavily on those leads, and I should mention that we also sell quite a few Sony chipsets with the LPWA modules as well and have a fantastic relationship there.\nScott Searle: Great. And lastly, maybe to just wrap up on the LoRa front. Thanks for calibrating, it sounds like the annualized run rate now was down at about $100 million. I'm wondering what the growth rate on that business looks like and what the composition of that is today in terms of sales outside of China. I know that's where a lot of design activity has been going. But I'm wondering how that's built at this point in time. And lastly, just on the asset sale front, I know you guys are reluctant to do anything essentially under pressure of the balance sheet, but now that you solved the covenant issues for the immediate future, are there some assets now that you're starting to reevaluate that may not be part of the long-term Semtech? Thanks.\nPaul Pickle: Okay. Yeah on LoRa, I will say, we will probably still reporting very strong China-based number, just because where manufacturing typically is, but if we look -- if I look at where that revenue originates, we're seeing quite a bit of adoption outside of APAC in particular. And so what would the growth rate be, I definitely expect it to be on the order of 10% to 15% in the near term. We could see some acceleration of that as a couple of technology pieces come together and it becomes a little bit easier to implement. But we've seen steady adoption in infrastructure applications especially outside China. We do have some China-based wins as well, but Europe definitely seeing some nice adoption there as well. So 10% to 15% I think is the long-term, our long-term growth rate that we would probably target for that and we can adjust that as time goes on. In terms of balance sheet, we are definitely hyper-focused on getting the leverage ratio down. We will continue to be, I won't comment on any particular asset sale but I'll just say that all cards are on the table in terms of driving that leverage ratio down to the benefit of our shareholders.\nScott Searle: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. And I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing comments.\nPaul Pickle: Thank you for joining and have a good day.\nOperator: That concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Semtech Corporation Conference Call to discuss the Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results. Speakers for today's call will be Paul Pickle, Semtech's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Emeka Chukwu, Semtech's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note that this conference is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. I would now like to turn the call over to Semtech's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Emeka Chukwu.\nEmeka Chukwu: Thank you, operator. A press release announcing our unaudited results was issued after the market close today and is available on our website at semtech.com. Today's call will include forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in these statements. For a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties, please review the Safe Harbor statement included in today's press release and in the Other Risk Factors section of our most recent periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a reminder, comments made on today's call are current as of today only and Semtech undertakes no obligation to update the information from this call should facts or circumstances change. During this call, all references made to financial results other than net sales will refer to non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. A discussion of why the management team considers such non-GAAP financial measures useful along with detailed reconciliations of such non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in today's press release. Turning to Q2 fiscal 2024. The company delivered net sales of $238.4 million in line with the midpoint of our guidance and an increase of 1% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Gross margin of 49.6% and earnings per share of $0.11 was above the high end of our guidance range. In Q2 shipments into North America, China, Europe and the Rest of the World represented 24%, 29%, 14%, and 33% respectively. The additional Sierra Wireless has increased our geographic mix towards North America and Europe. Total direct sales represented approximately 36% of net revenue and distribution represented the remaining 64%. In Q2, gross margin was 49.6% above the guidance range driven by some one-time benefits. For Q3, we expect gross margin to decrease approximately 160 basis points sequentially at the midpoint of our guidance as the favorable impact of a higher mix of IC components revenue is offset by the one-time benefits in Q2 and lower absorption. Due to the softer demand environment and subsequent lower absorption, we expect our gross margins for the rest of the year to remain around current levels. In Q2, operating expenses was $86 million, 6% below the midpoint of guidance due to full cost reduction actions in addition to synergies. We expect these cost reduction actions and incremental synergies to drive Q3 operating expenses lower to between $81 million and $85 million. In Q2 cash flow from operations was at $12 million use of cash impacted by demand softness and interest expense on our debt. Our cash flow from operations will remain a challenge in Q3 due to a softer demand environment. Our gross debt at the end of Q2 was $1.4 billion or approximately 5.3 times leverage on a net basis. We expect our leverage levels to increase for the remainder of the year as we navigate this softer demand environment. We expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants included in our debt agreements. The Q2 weighted average cash interest rate was approximately 6.37%. In summary, our financial performance continues to be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds. Meanwhile, we are taking focused actions to realign our operations to enable us not only to manage the current headwinds, but also to position us for strong earnings growth when the demand environment improves. I will now hand the call over to Paul.\nPaul Pickle: Thank you, Emeka. While our net sales for the second quarter met expectations. I'm proud to note that our cost saving measures enabled us to surpass estimates on both gross margin and EPS fronts. Yet as we navigate today's economic climate our Q3 outlook remains cautiously reserved reflecting elevated channel and customer inventories stemming from previously optimistic projections. We are intensifying our focus on cost control and operational enhancements in response. IC component sales after an initial dip this fiscal year is now showing stability with a 16% sequential growth in net sales. Further improvement is anticipated for the rest of the year and into the next due to customer design engagements being prime to boost consumption in the upcoming quarters, particularly in the infrastructure and consumer end markets. Our IoT systems product group witnessed an 11% sequential decline, bringing the total to $119 million on a pro forma basis, while we have experienced a decline in demand for both module and router products. Modules revenue is presenting a particular challenge in the current quarter. However, we are seeing silver linings in the broadband module business horizon with legislative discussions putting our low-cost APAC competitors under the spotlight. This presents us with an unexpected opportunity to expand our market share. In quarter, pipeline engagements have significantly increased as a result and we are gearing up to seize this window to our advantage. Despite a minor drop in wireless radio-enabled component sales LoRa end-node sales increased slightly. LoRa's potential for private networks especially where power reach and mobility are crucial remains significant. While LoRa may not be a cellular infrastructure substitute, its unmatched value proposition for specialized private networks remains unabated. We are envisioning a more inclusive strategy to harness this vast potential, especially at the outer fringes of the IoT realm. Q2 IoT Connected Services remained relatively consistent at $24 million, a 20% year-over-year growth was achieved from smart and enhanced carrier connectivity. Given the relatively low attachment rates for our cloud services platform, we will be focusing on enhancing hardware revenue with a high margin software sales and a renewed focus for our IoT-managed connectivity in cloud platforms. The Signal Integrity Products group grew 12% sequentially in Q2 quarter to $46 million. Cloud Hyperscale Data Center revenue was significantly up sequentially in the quarter benefiting from the momentum in AI-driven applications. Product sales were driven by strong 100 gig, 200 gig, 400 gig data center and broadcast revenue. TriEdge and FiberEdge applications all improved sequentially with the large US hyperscaler placing initial orders for a 400 gig active optical cable application. These gains were offset by weaker 10 gig China PON and wireless infrastructure revenue. Channel inventories remain high amidst improving although cyclically weak end market demand. China infrastructure demand although stable remains muted. Our product portfolio in PON is well-positioned and is poised to benefit when this market rebounds in the upcoming quarters. The advanced sensing and protection products grew 35% sequentially, primarily driven by anticipated production of new design in secured and smartphone applications. We are especially well-positioned with new protection circuitry for North American smartphone vendor. Proximity sensing or our PerSe product was also up in the quarter ahead of anticipated regulations in China for specific absorption ratio limits starting in fiscal year '25. PerSe is still in the early innings of the design cycle. But the penetration and early ramp is encouraging. We continue to make progress in diversifying our end markets for the advanced sensing and protection products group, with approximately half of product revenue coming from industrial, telecom and automotive applications. For Q3 2024, we project net sales between $190 million and $210 million. Non-GAAP earnings for Q2 are expected to range between minus $0.09 and plus $0.22 per diluted share. We are steadfast in our commitment to the synergy plan presented to investors earlier this year and aim to fulfill it ahead of schedule. Post my induction I launched a robust cost reduction initiative, which along with other measures has decreased our OpEx run rate by about $100 million compared to last year's combined entity pro forma. Further refinements are on the horizon. During my short tenure at Semtech, I've been immensely impressed by our team's dedication and talent. Our unique state-of-the-art products create a competitive barrier setting us apart. After extensive discussions with team members, I'm optimistic about navigating current market challenges. The tech industry has seen fluctuations due to pandemic-driven demand, but the need for electronic advancements remains robust. At Semtech, our vision is clear. Enable a smarter, more connected planet. Our focus for the upcoming months will be to execute this vision. I'll now turn it over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Pickle: Hello, Craig?\nOperator: Oh, I'm sorry.\nPaul Pickle: I think we have to take everybody off mute.\nOperator: One moment. Thank you. Our first question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Paul, welcome to Semtech. I guess first question, obviously guidance coming in, I think, much below expectations on a revenue basis. The semiconductor business has already been hit pretty hard by the combination of weak demand and market inventory. Paul and Emeka can you give us some sense for the October guide at $200 million? Is the semiconductor business flat down or up? And where do you see this Sierra Wireless contribution coming in the October quarter? It looks like it's got to be well below $100 million if the semiconductor business, as I think you indicated in the script might be flat trending higher in the back half of the fiscal year.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah, thanks for the question, Quinn. I think for the most part, we definitely see a -- seen a bottoming out of semiconductors that happened fairly early in the cycle. And of late, I think we've seen a little bit of pullback in hardware. Routers is off in terms of end-market demand, and when I say end-market demand I'm really looking at POS numbers. So it's off slightly, but modules has substantially pulled back. The mix between those routers has it tends to be heavy channel-dependent. Those inventories are not too terribly out of whack given the POS pullback, but modules is largely a direct business and we've seen at least some indicator from our direct customers that they are sitting on some substantial inventories over the next several quarters. So I've seen the hardware business pullback, semiconductors conversely is doing fairly well skipping along the bottom perhaps we are beyond the dead cat bounce that one looks forward to resume a kind of normal rate. And then I'd say for the most part going forward we'd expect continued improvement in the high-margin semiconductor business versus the hardware.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Thanks for that color. And then a follow-up question. Paul, you referenced sort of having already reduced the OpEx run rate with synergies and other actions by $100 million. You guided OpEx in Q3 to a level of $81 million to $85 million. Is that the right baseline to think, when model going forward, do you think you can bring GAAP OpEx even lower? And how long will you hold OpEx at kind of that baseline level, before you start to increase OpEx?\nPaul Pickle: So the way -- it's a good question. I wouldn't necessarily look at the current quarter as a baseline. We are going to have some ebbs and flows in that number in terms of R&D projects that was pulled back on R&D projects in the previous quarters. Those are coming into fruition now which kind of, if you read between the lines there, it says our baseline is perhaps a little bit better than what we are currently showing. In terms of how good can it be? I think the way I kind of look at it and the way the team is looking at is to say, all right, everybody kind of bloated expense during the COVID cycle. So if we go back, imagine a run rate business that was pre-COVID look at those OpEx levels where the company used to be at, we should be able to easily get back there. So I think that there's without giving you an absolute number, there's improvements to be made. The first tranche is, I don't want to say easy because it's always difficult to make those changes. The decision-making is perhaps a little bit easier. The second tranche needs to be a bit more thoughtful going forward and so I need to spend some more time discovering the workings of the organization and how it can be optimized and expect that to be a continual improvement on a go-forward basis. But I do believe that there is more efficiency for this company to garner.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Ellis: Thanks for taking the question and trying again. Paul, welcome to the call. I wanted to start Paul with an intermediate-term question for you. Since this is your first call, can you just take a step back and look out over the next 6 to 12 months. And just frame up what your priorities are as you come into the role and start to interact with the street and look at the initial phase optimizations you can make with the Semtech business?\nPaul Pickle: That is a great question. I think when you come into a company you'd like to be afforded the opportunity to learn and really go through a proper discovery purpose or process. And I think we've -- the current state of the economy, this current state of the company has necessitated, hey, we are going to have to walk and chew gum at the same time coming in and enacting some cuts. I will say my priorities are a little bit split and I believe that's not as it's really kind of a twofold approach needs to be done in parallel where we kind of look at how can we structure the company for its most efficient profitability model given the current makings, projects, products and then the various go to market along with assessing, what we are really good at the beachheads and technology, that we have and putting together good strategic plan for a long-term vision and long-term operating model. I think we are making nice progress. I'm making nice progress along those fronts. I would say, of late, it seems like I spent a good portion of my day on the tyranny of the urgent, an affectionate term, but still we have a good team here as soon as we identify something I'm able to delegate and continue to kind of think a little bit longer term. So short-term get us back to financial health on the intermediate constructive plan for long-term operating model envision that works and will drive shareholder value.\nCraig Ellis: That's real helpful, thank you. And then I'll follow up with Emeka on a couple of clarifications. So Emeka, can you just help us understand how we compare the prior $50 million Sierra-related synergies target with $100 million in expense reduction that Paul just mentioned? And then with respect to the gross margin color, what are the biggest changes that have occurred from where we were expecting 100 basis points to 150 basis points of expansion through the year or two flattish from here? Thank you.\nEmeka Chukwu: Hi, Craig. I think so with regards to the synergies I think the last time I gave a number for the synergies, I said it was about $50 million that we were expecting. I think we are doing a little bit better than that now. I don't have an exact number, but we are doing a little bit better than that. And then in addition to some of the other actions that Paul has already taken when the company that is how we are getting to a $100 million reduction from a pro forma number. With regards to gross margin, is actually very simple. We are seeing the benefit of the mix of a higher mix of the IC component revenues that is good for gross margin. However, when the guidance was initially discussed, Craig the expectations was that the revenue levels will be much higher and we will be able to improve the utilization of our manufacturing business and stuff like that. So right now we have a lot of fixed manufacturing overhead, that we are not able to absorb and that is the primary reason for coming off of the previously expectation that was set for about 100 basis points and 150 basis points in gross margin improvement.\nCraig Ellis: That's helpful. If I could just sneak one more in for Paul. Paul, you commented in your prepared remarks about the strength in signal integrity and it looked like it was within data center. Can you just talk about the visibility you have to that strengthened? And what some of the specific program drivers are for that? Thanks, guys.\nPaul Pickle: So, we've got quite a bit of visibility there. It's -- I will say though it's a bit more difficult to plan for those particular customers because when they are ready to go, they turn on a dime and it's also the kind of thing that we don't have a ton of channel inventory that's out there waiting to be consumed either. So it's we are cognizant of it. It's very much a hands-on process where we are running proof-of-concepts, understanding that the programs are coming and staging them, getting ready for when the orders dropped down in terms of planning that in a particular quarter, it's a bit more difficult. So I think we have a good sense that it's going to be coming a bit more of a relevant figure for us over the next several quarters but exactly which quarter it's a little bit more difficult for me to determine.\nCraig Ellis: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Stoss: Thanks. Hey, Paul. Just to put a finer point on what Quinn was asking on OpEx. So if there was some, I guess one-time things that elevated the OpEx. Should we think about OpEx coming down to couple million dollars each quarter sequentially? And at what point do you think your goal of getting to $100 million cost taken on in total will be done, in which quarter? And I have a couple of follow-ups.\nPaul Pickle: So I don't think I said a couple of $100 million dollars, but I think on a run rate basis, we are a $100 million off. I think we can improve that. I won't put a number on it at this juncture. In terms of the rate of fall-off, I think, don't expect it to be significant windfall chunks that happened, but we'll be looking to execute as quickly as possible. And I'll say through Q1 is the current plan to have most of those operational efficiencies in place, after that it would be continual improvement, that we would look to enact. So try to give you a little bit of a timeline avoid putting an exact number on it until I have a good feel for what that budgeting exercise is.\nAnthony Stoss: Got it. And then, at what point, are you going to reach a determination of what assets you may want to keep either from Sierra or Semtech? Are you getting closer to that?\nPaul Pickle: I think if I look at, first of all, right now, every asset that's a positive contribution is an asset to keep at this juncture unless I can hit certain clearance ratios associated with those assets, and that really kind of comes down to the short-term exercise. If you ask me long-term do I need certain assets. I've already made a determination what is strategic in my mind and critical for our future. Other than that, we don't need certain assets in order to get that job done for the long-term vision of where we'd like to go. I'd like to spend a little bit more time on that plan. But I have a good sense of which assets I can divest and it just comes down to whether or not I can reach those clearance ratios. Having said that, I really don't think this is a conducive environment to doing a deal or running a process. So my goal and my determination at this point is to be -- is to get the company to a point where we are not forced to do a divestiture, but we can do that if it strategically makes sense. I think of it more as a long-term principal paydown.\nAnthony Stoss: Got it. And last question, just your comments related to the FCC coming out last week, highlighting the Chinese module makers and you said your pipeline is increasing. This has been discussed from the Commerce Department and other agencies for almost three years. What's giving you confidence now that they actually might do something?\nPaul Pickle: Yeah. We saw a significant boost in the pipeline and I think it's, to the point where I'll quote one customer, they don't believe that it's necessarily an issue or risk, but they just don't feel like they can fight the politics anymore. So if we kind of look at it from that standpoint, I think we -- if I can offer better quality, better security maybe a slight premium to the costs that they're currently paying for a low cost APAC counterpart, I don't know why somebody wouldn't come my way, because we are certainly going to solve that problem. We also have the ability to put in place TIA-compliant modules, if that becomes a requirement as well. So it really kind of comes down to, from an infrastructure or critical industrial applications, we will be the guy to beat and we are going to make sure that we are the guys to be.\nAnthony Stoss: All right. Thanks, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nHarsh Kumar: Hi. Thank you. Paul, congratulations on your first earnings here at Semtech.\nPaul Pickle: Thank you, Harsh.\nHarsh Kumar: For what you've got here is, you've got two companies, couple of different product lines. And as an analyst, I am trying to understand what is Semtech? What is Sierra Wireless? And I was wondering if, just from sake of simplicity if you would be willing to give us how much is core Semtech revenues? And how much is core Sierra Wireless revenues? And within Sierra Wireless, if you don't mind breaking our routers versus modules, because you called out, I think you said the routers were off slightly and modules were down quite a bit. So, I was wondering if you could help us level set some parts and pieces, so we can be better at modeling.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah. And so if we look, my commentary was on modules versus router was in the current quarter. So I'm kind of projecting a little bit -- really kind of talking about the guidance here. You got routers. I'm going to give you some rough percentages so don't expect us to reconcile to the dollar, but essentially, you've got $300 million of module business, you've got $100 million connectivity and $100 million of routers. I'm really oversimplifying the actual buckets and allocations, but routers pulled back approximately 30% to 35% or so. But modules is substantially off in going forward quarter. I don't expect that to sustain at those levels. I expect that inventory to be consumed. It is a business where you are into placing a purchase order for a chipset manufacturer. So any acquisition of those chipsets really need to make sure that the modules follow through. And so a lot of those orders tend to be in NCNR. So you can kind of see how we had a bit of a pile-up even at the end customers even though modules is largely direct about 80% direct business. So good visibility into those customers, good visibility into demand. I'd say that their consumption, their end market demand is off a little bit, but it really it does come down to the ordering patterns that kind of made this happen.\nHarsh Kumar: Thank you, Paul. That was super helpful. And then the other one that a lot of the customers are our clients or investors are asking us is they truly believe and I think you're seeing is pretty much is, Semtech is off the ground and kind of or let's just say having along the bottom, but things looking a little bit brighter, but customers really want to understand maybe simplistically put how many more months or quarters or weeks of excess inventory exist there before we maybe start to see similar positive trends at Sierra Wireless? Would you be willing us -- willing to shed some color on that?\nPaul Pickle: Sure. I definitely take, kind of an end-demand or consumption, look at the business, and I've been going through that pretty exhaustively at least on the IC side. We've got really good data that exists in our analytics systems here. And so, I can say confidently that at this juncture we've got a couple of quarters underneath us where that end market consumption has stabilized, and in fact, we are starting to see some upticks. I'll say the possibility exist for some Q4 upsides although we are not currently putting it in the forecast and so it does feel like we've been skipping along the bottom here at least for the semiconductor business. In hardware, I think it's a bit of a -- couple of different factors. It's surge cycle kind of happened alongside semiconductors. But due to supply chain and cycle times, you can get a little bit of a pile-up or later effect, that whipsaw effect is coming in a little bit later stage, but for the most part, I still have a high degree of confidence in the overall health of the business. There is not one piece of business here that I can note that is going to terminate early or accelerate into life. And so it's merely a product as you noted of just kind of consuming channel inventories and then focusing our go-to-market sales efforts and making sure that we are not leaving any stone unturned. So in terms of how many quarters of inventory? I've largely believed that we are not going to spring back. I'm not quoting a V-shaped recovery where we are going to spring back to previous levels. I think those were largely overstated. All true, all good orders but customers were extremely optimistic they were just -- they were telling the truth. They were just wrong in terms of how much product they needed. So I kind of think in terms of a bit of a U-shaped recovery how it's going to play out in the results and I still think mid-next year recovery cycle for us would largely be in line of channel inventory drawdown along with a methodical pickup in POS, back to moderate levels.\nHarsh Kumar: Can I sneak in just one last one. Do you think things get worse from the guidance, that you gave of roughly, call it $200 million? Do you think we got to take another step down or do you think we are troughing out at the bottom for your total business?\nPaul Pickle: I believe it's at the bottom.\nHarsh Kumar: Okay. Thank you. Thanks so much, Paul.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. Welcome Paul, and Emeka I assume this is your last call. So thank you for all the interactions over the years. My first question for you, Paul. So it sounds like you're finding a bottom, but assuming that we kind of stay here for a while. At one point, would you have to take some actions as far as the balance sheet is concerned, because you're 5.3 times levered, that number is only going to go up next quarter. So at what point -- what are some of the things that you looking forward to take some more drastic actions?\nPaul Pickle: Well, the first step is the size of the business. According to what end market consumption is, I don't want to get into the point, where I cut too deep into R&D and limit our ability to grow in the future. So philosophically speaking we are kind of looking at all support functions and trying to optimize the organization. I will say from that standpoint, I do think that there was a lot of optimization to be had. So spending levels didn't need to be at the levels, that they were in the combined entities in order to support the businesses that they have. So I do think that there is some improvements there to be made and I think that will be in fairly good shape. I think that exercise, given the fact that the capital end markets are not -- it's not really conducive to doing a divestiture although we are not opposed to that. All cards are on the table in addressing the balance sheet. I'm really resigned to making sure that we get there on our own organically and can develop a plan that drives 12 to 18 months of a fair bit of confidence in the model to drive those covenants. And I think that we've got that developed. Anything on top of that would be additional and an improvement in the current outlook. But I think that we are going to be in good shape at least for the next 12 months to 18 months. If we get a recovery mid-next year and this is what's in the model, then I think it's all improvement from there. So trying to take a fairly conservative look in terms of recovery expectation. I'm not banking on the market going up. I'm going to make sure that we size the business accordingly. The size of the spend for the business, that we have and then as the market picks up, I think we'll be in a much better position because it will be upside from that standpoint.\nTore Svanberg: Yeah. Now that's really helpful. And as my follow-up and Emeka, on gross margin, I think the mix and sort of the fixed cost absorption makes sense, but at what level would the semiconductor gross margin start to improve a little bit more materially because you talked about some fixed cost absorption that at current levels you're not really able to overcome. So what does the semiconductor business have to be in order to see, more step function improvements in gross margin, because obviously the mix is -- mix overall is moving in the right direction, right. But I'm just trying to understand that the fixed cost absorption, part of it.\nEmeka Chukwu: So, first of all, thank you for your kind words. I really enjoyed working with both you and all the sell-side analysts, all over through the years, and hopefully, our paths are going to cross somewhere else in the future.With regards to your question, I think we would expect that to see the gross margin for the semiconductor business as we see maybe a change in some of the mix an increase in the 10 gig PON which is pretty high gross margins for us, seeing some recoveries in the LoRa business from the current levels. The LoRa business is suffering a little bit from high levels of inventory in the channel at this point. So we continue to see a mix of the ITA industrial and automotive revenues for our advanced protection system. So is a combination of the mix of revenues in addition to higher levels of revenues for the semiconductor business, but I think like Paul said, we have seen definitely very good signs that a semiconductor business looks like. It is poised to start going back up. So I would expect that as we go forward to start seeing some higher levels of gross margin as well.\nTore Svanberg: Got it. So it sounds like for at least the October quarter, this will be a higher sort of revenue mix in consumer, especially with some of your smartphone design wins and things like that, but then beyond that given, you could start to see PON and LoRa and other contributions.\nEmeka Chukwu: Yes, exactly. I think you got that right. And then just with overall higher levels of revenues, I actually driving the need for more inventory deals and stuff now was that drive absorptions higher so and consequently as a result, the gross margins will start to tick up again.\nTore Svanberg: That's very helpful. Thank you, again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Searle with Roth MKM. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Searle: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Paul, congrats on your first quarter and nice job on the cost front. And Emeka I want to wish you all the best in your future endeavors. It's always been a pleasure working with you.\nEmeka Chukwu: Thank you.\nScott Searle: Maybe to just dive in on the compliance front quickly Paul and Emeka. You've done a lot on the cost side of the equation. We are taking a step down on the topline. Can you get back into compliance without a major recovery on the topline? Are there some other -- it sounds like there some other additional OpEx levers to pull and/or an ability to get some flexibility on the debt covenants? So I kind of like to understand the thought process and the strategy beyond the initial quarter as we get into fiscal '25?\nPaul Pickle: So I think the answer to that Scott is yes for the next 12 to 18 months. And obviously, as that leverage ratio cap continues to step down we'll need some recovery in the business beyond a year and a half or so into FY26, but the way I kind of look at it as we took immediate actions for compliance for the covenants buying ourselves some buffer in that regard and then we need to continue to optimize cash generation in order to service the debt and then it becomes about principal paydown. So this is really kind of a two-year haul, but in the short-term, I don't see an issue with covenant compliance. I think we've got enough tools in the tool bag to make sure that continues to happen. We do need some recovery if we are going to hold on to this debt over the long-term and continue to service it and pay it down in principle through its term. But I think longer out with the market recovery we've got a little bit more options under our belt in terms of divestiture and the like perhaps refinancing as well. It's going to be -- this is going to be a bit more of a longer story, but in the short-term, I think we have secured ourselves 12 months to 18 months.\nScott Searle: Perfect. Very helpful. And if I could, I guess, kind of a multipart question following up on some earlier questions. From a revenue standpoint, a couple of the product lines that are seeing some headwinds routers were down in the current quarter, modules are looking to take that step down and normalize from an inventory standpoint. I'm wondering on both fronts there when do you see router starting to recover? Are you seeing that supply-demand balance come back in? And then with modules, it sounds like you've got some other potential upside opportunities with Chinese OEMs not being welcoming the US, and starting to see that in your order book now. So I'm kind of wondering what you're factoring in on that front. And lastly, I think LoRa took a big step down in the quarter. I'm wondering, how long do you see it at these levels before starting to recover? And then kind of putting them all together, what is the normalized level of sales that we should be thinking about 12 months from now? The combined companies who go back 12 months ago was around $400 million obviously below that, obviously not a normalized environment, but what's kind of the number that we should be thinking about as the world starts to recover. Thanks.\nPaul Pickle: So Scott, I just have to ask a clarification question. So were you saying routers modules and LoRa together, those revenue levels or you are talking about the whole?\nScott Searle: The whole. The whole.\nPaul Pickle: Okay, all right. So I guess I don't have an answer for you on the whole quite yet, but I would say if I looked at demand and try to anticipate a moderate recovery, let's say, back to normal levels. I can kind of -- it's pretty easy to go look at over the COVID cycle, see the rush of demand, and then try to draw a line through that. I think we've got some businesses that have historically grown at specific CAGRs over the last decade. So it's pretty easy to draw a line through those and say, this is what it should be independent of cycles, but I'd say, we are still probably north of $1 billion. I'm attempting to put a number on it, but I'm going to admit that I haven't exhaustively looked at every single product line. But that's kind of where I would couch it for the time being on a combined basis. In terms of routers, when does it recover? I think that this is temporary. Routers did not see that big of a blip, big of a ramp-up during the COVID cycle. There was a little bit of increased demand during the frothy buying cycle but not extreme not like we saw with modules. Modules is little bit more problematic because you had some 3G cut-overs. And you had a bit of a panic that ensued in terms of modules and so there was a lot of double ordering out there and that's why we have a bit more of an inventory pile up. So modules going to take us a little bit longer to work through. Having said that, I still like the fact that we've got a couple 100 million let's say, over a couple of 100 million pipeline increase this quarter due to just the legislative discussions that are going on in terms of who goes on the entity exclusion list. So to me, that's a nice opportunity. It really does equal market share gain and it could result in a significant drawdown of inventory in North America and EMEA as we gain market share. So that's kind of an optimistic view of the world. We are going to attempt to go out there and capture those sockets as best we can. And then I think routers in terms of those fire safety applications, we've rolled out a couple of new platforms, new products, the uptick is pretty good. But there was a lot of buying by the channel during last year and up until the close of the acquisition. So I'd say that, you're going to see a slow drawdown although POS never really had a huge significant uptick and it's not really falling off nearly as quickly as the rest. I think I covered all your questions. There was a lot in there, but hopefully, I got it.\nScott Searle: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Rolland: Hey guys, thanks for the question. Thanks, Emeka for all the conversations over the years and welcome Paul. So I guess -- hi, great. I guess maybe following on kind of Quinn and Harsh's line of questioning here. In terms of the Sierra business would you kind of put it in the combined $85 million range for next quarter? And I did notice, there was some 3Q seasonality for that business traditionally before you guys owned it. I was wondering if that was coming into play here and that could help us into the January quarter for you guys. But beyond that Signal Integrity and Protection and Sensing, we should think about both of those being up in October as well. Thank you.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah, I think that's correct. When you say the Sierra business we kind of -- we are breaking them out into, in terms of connectivity. I just want to be really clear connectivity is still pretty strong. That's a $100 million business that just clips along and we'll slowly continue to gain market share. Good gross margin business as well that came with the Sierra Wireless acquisition but that Connectivity business is pretty solid independent of the hardware revenue that has fallen off. The $85 million might be a little bit light, but it will see a pullback and then I would expect routers to kind of rebound going forward. And then modules depending on how well we do with the current opportunity in front of us, we can maybe see a little bit of upside there over the next couple of quarters as things get called in. Typically there is a certification cycle that's associated with designing an embedded module. So there is an activity or a time associated with that, but it shouldn't go too terribly wrong, I typically would handicap it around 60 to 90 days or so.\nChristopher Rolland: Excellent. And Paul, when do you think we could get a new long-term model for the company overall? And what would be kind of a platform for doing that? Would you do that on a quarterly call? Would you put an Analyst Day together? And yeah the timeframe on any update would be great as well.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah, that's a great question. Certainly, it would be very reasonable to have that in the 12-month timeframe, and perhaps before, but I think we would target the Analyst Day 12 to 18 months out and just kind of give a broad overview of an invigorated strategy, if not new strategy at that point and then we would lay out the long-term targets, at that point as well.\nChristopher Rolland: Thank you. And maybe just one last one. You guys typically give turns needed in the guide to make the guide that would be great. And then lastly, would we ever expect any LoRa metrics again, or is that a thing of the past?\nPaul Pickle: The turns metric --\nEmeka Chukwu: I think that was above 50% for the quarter.\nPaul Pickle: Yeah the turns needed in the quarter is just over 50%. I'll be honest, I'm not a huge fan of giving turns, because it's not indicative of very quickly ramping revenue. And so it can cause you to draw some misconceptions or wrong conclusions about the directionality of the business, but at this point we are approximately 50% turns.\nChristopher Rolland: Great. And LoRa metrics?\nEmeka Chukwu: So, Chris, the 50% was at the beginning of the quarter and not now.\nPaul Pickle: Not. Sorry, at the beginning of the quarter.\nChristopher Rolland: Yeah, understood. And LoRa?\nPaul Pickle: I'm sorry, what was your question on LoRa?\nChristopher Rolland: You used to give a ton of LoRa metrics and I think that stopped since the combination of Sierra. You used to give LoRa-related revenue, revenue guidance operators, gateways, pipelines, ton of information. Is that ever going to come back?\nPaul Pickle: So I don't anticipate it coming back by itself. I think you know I'm happy to give you that LoRa is approximately $100 million business every year. We are going to be shifting the focus two more of an end-node -- end connected node focus from and then also what pieces are necessary in order to enable that use and rollout of Private Networks. I think adoption of LoRa at the last mile of IoT edge, some people don't like the label last mile, but let's call it the fringe, it definitely has a value proposition there. It definitely makes sense. The totality of what has been called LoRa inclusive in that has been infrastructure. It's been helium. It's been a number of things, but at this point, I just don't believe are viable and it's not something that I want to tout. So if you could give me a couple of quarters to better define what that LoRa rollout strategy is going to be or that wireless strategy is going to be, we'll be happy to talk to it in future quarters.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks so much, Paul. Good luck, and really appreciate you taking the helm here.\nPaul Pickle: Thank you, sir.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Cody Acree with The Benchmark Company. Please proceed with your question.\nCody Acree: Thanks, Paul and welcome. And Emeka thank you for all the help over the years. It has been very much appreciated. Paul, if you could just take a step back at what the Sierra Wireless acquisition? And can you just give us your high level view of the strategic fit of the companies as you see them today?\nPaul Pickle: Yes, thank you, Cody. I'm smiling because you asked a difficult question to answer, but I'll give it my best. So at this point, I will say the investment thesis for the acquisition still holds true today. If we look at it and we say, okay, we have a unique radio technology in LoRa and I would further refine that to say a sub-gigahertz, low power, low bandwidth, far-reaching protocol, where can that best be used and how do we create a platform or an ecosystem that makes it very easy to adopt and rollout. That is the operative question. And so if you look at what would be required in that implementation that ease of use implementation, you would obviously need LoRa chips on connected endpoints of which we do have and sell today. You would need, configuration software, you would need device management system software, you would need traffic routing software that would sit on a gateway or router through some other backhaul cellular or otherwise. So from that standpoint, you can connect those dots. You would also need a cloud platform to enable that configuration. You need a Snap or Kubernetes on a router, a gateway sitting on the edge and then that would feed into a cloud and then you would -- that would allow you to provide API hooks into customer software or provide individual insights for those connected devices on that edge. So all those components exist in the acquisition. Now, the question was -- would naturally be is the acquisition necessary to fulfill that vision? And the answer to that is no, you could go off and develop it on your own, but certainly helps to have all these pieces together. So now that we have those pieces, how do we best pull those pieces together for an ease of use play in IoT, and that is something that we are going to have to think really hard about. It's not enough to have the individual pieces. It's the orchestration or the coordination between those pieces and end market in order to make that a reality. So we are going to be spending some time on that vision, reimagine what it takes to get there. Independent of whether not we need assets -- strategic assets or not, and we'll work on an execution plan. So I've got a few ideas on that. We've got some of our bright minds working on that as well, and we'll be rolling that out over the next couple of quarters.\nCody Acree: Do you think, Paul, that there is a strategic application fit with your customer base that is obvious that may have not been as with the initial acquisition?\nPaul Pickle: I do, there is a -- it really kind of comes down to use case. We say application, but I'd say, it comes down to use case. We have one particular customer. There's two RFPs out there that are requesting the use of LoRa and they like the aspects of LoRa. It's been a bit of a more complicated program in terms of installation and rollout that would include both cellular modules and routers and software. And so there is a strategic application or strategic fit with certain customer use cases, and I can give you one example. We've got a customer that was doing an installation for a field of tanks and they want to be able to monitor each tank rather than putting a cellular router at each tank connected to devices that are pulling in telemetry pressure, temperature capacity and the depth of whatever those fluids are, they would rather have one cellular router and that to have be connected to a bunch of sensors across the field, that would represent the field -- the entire tank field. And it would be a much a lower cost of installation, lower CapEx requirement, and it would make that installation fairly easy in terms of configuring devices that are pretty belaborous right now. So if you look at it, yes, it does fit really nicely with where the market wants to go, but there's some pieces missing in terms of making it a reality and that's what we have to focus on.\nCody Acree: Okay. Thank you, Paul. Thanks for the help.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah. Hey, Paul. The example you just described, actually fits perfectly for smart meters. And I was curious if you've received any interest from any kind of utility companies for a similar deployments, because I think it would simplify smart meter installations in small cities extremely well.\nPaul Pickle: It would also lower the cost and maintenance of those smart meters. So if you just look at power consumption LPWA as opposed to LoRa, if you just look at bandwidth requirements and you could argue that bandwidth costs are fairly low on LPWA, but they are essentially free when you go to LoRa. So I do think, I'm saying private networks, but that doesn't mean that it can't be a rather large private network that's rolled out by utility or a municipality as well. So I think LoRa is a perfect fit in those areas. And I guess, from our standpoint, we would be able to support both applications. There might be some applications where they need an LPWA solution. We are happy to accommodate those, but we can also accommodate a LoRa-based solution as well.\nHarsh Kumar: Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Paul Pickle for closing comments.\nPaul Pickle: All right. Well, thank you guys for joining us today. Thank you for taking it easy on me for my first time around and look forward to talking to you in the future. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

And with that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Emeka Chukwu. Emeka?\nEmeka Chukwu: Thank you, Anojja. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I trust you all saw the news that the board has completed its search for our new CEO. We are pleased to welcome Paul Pickle to Semtech. Mohan will comment further, but we are all excited about Paul's impressive mix of semiconductor and IoT experience and look forward to his arrival later this month. And I also want to congratulate Mohan on his retirement. Mohan has led Semtech very successfully for the past 17 years, and we have all enjoyed working with him. Like the many Semtech employees, we wish you well on your next adventure. Coming to Q1 fiscal 2024, the company delivered net sales of $236.5 million, above the midpoint of our guidance and an increase of 41% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. These numbers include the $136 million of revenue from our acquisition of Sierra Wireless. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 48.5% was in line with our guidance and our earnings of -- and our earnings per share of $0.02 was above our guidance. In Q1, shipments into North America, China, Europe, and the rest of Asia represented 31%, 24%, 15%, and 30% respectively. The addition of Sierra Wireless has increased our geographic mix towards North America and Europe. Total direct sales represented approximately 39% of net revenue and distribution represented the remaining 61%. Turning to our end markets. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to see macroeconomic challenges affect our business in the first half of fiscal 2024, which we did see in Q1. Net revenues from the high-end consumer market decreased 38% sequentially and 55% versus the prior year. High-end consumers represented 9% of total net revenues. Net revenue from the industrial end market increased 130% sequentially and 125% over the prior year due to the inclusion of Sierra Wireless. The industrial end markets represented 75% of total net revenues. And finally, the infrastructure end market declined 30% sequentially and 49% over the prior year and represented [15%] (ph) of total net revenues. In terms of POS, we saw the majority of POS, 60% coming from the industrial end market due to the addition of Sierra. The infrastructure and consumer end markets were balanced with 21% and 19%, respectively. Q1 bookings grew 1% sequentially, driven by strength in our Advanced Protection and Sensing Business Unit. Q1 non-GAAP gross margin was 48.5% in line with the midpoint of our guidance. For Q2, we expect gross margin to stay roughly flat. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we expect our gross margins to trend higher through the year, as material cost synergies are achieved, and revenues in our higher margin Semtech organic businesses increase. These benefits were slightly offset by lower absorption, as we work to reduce our internal inventory levels. We are still expecting 100 basis points to 150 basis points improvement in gross margin by Q4 of this year. In Q1, operating expenses were $93 million, $6 million below the midpoint of guidance due to our strict management of discretionary spending. For Q2, we expect further reductions to our operating expense, down another 2% sequentially. And expect to see continued declines throughout the remainder of the year as we execute on our integration plans and operate to optimize for financial performance. In Q1 of fiscal 2024 non-GAAP operating margin was 9.3%, significantly better than expected, driven by actions we took to preserve operating profit. In Q1, cash flow from operations was $90 million use of cash, impacted by the fiscal year 2023 annual bonus payouts and the payment of acquisition related expenses. We expect our cash flow to recover in the second half of the year, as acquisition related expenses taper off and demand improves, allowing us to improve profitability as current inventory levels are reduced. Our gross debt at the end of Q1 was $1.4 billion or approximately 4.3 times leverage on a net basis. We expected to see an increase in net leverage in the first half of the year as we navigate this software demand environment. We announced today, that we negotiated another amendment to our credit agreement to get further relaxation through our leverage and interest expense coverage ratio covenants. Given our current projections for revenue and earnings, we now expect to have an adequate cushion through fiscal 2025. The Q1 weighted average cash interest expense was approximately 5.65%. And as we have said before, the main priority for free cash flow will be to pay down our debt. In summary, Q1 performance was better than expected, but still impacted by macroeconomic headwinds. Looking ahead, we continue to make progress on our integration of Sierra Wireless. Our synergies are ahead of plan and as a result, we still expect the Sierra acquisition to be accretive to earnings in fiscal year 2024. We are getting good customer feedback on our cellular and LoRa integration plans. Overall, we are seeing higher design wins, and with the steps that we're taking to improve our financial performance, we believe that our business will thrive as demand improves and channel inventory gets back to normal levels. I will now hand the call over to Mohan.\nMohan Maheswaran: Thank you, Emeka. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining today. On May 30, we announced that Paul Pickle will join as a new President and Chief Executive Officer for Semtech. I will ensure a smooth transition with Paul and support him and the board as needed for the next 16 months. Thank you all for your support and interest in Semtech over my tenure as CEO over the last 17 years. I've enjoyed working with you all and I'm counting on you to continue to support Semtech through the next phase of growth. Today marks my last earnings call as Semtech's President and Chief Executive Officer. Onto our Q1 fiscal year 2024 performance by product group, as well as the outlook for Q2 of fiscal year 2024. In Q1, our quarterly net revenue increased 41% sequentially and achieved a new record of $236.5 million, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. We also posted non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.02, driven by lower OpEx as synergies were ahead of expectations. Both net revenue and EPS were better than guidance, while inventories remained high, Q1 bookings for the organic Semtech business were up sequentially, increasing our confidence that the organic Semtech business has stabilized, albeit, at much lower levels. In Q1, our Signal Integrity Product Group revenue was down 32% sequentially and represented 18% of total revenues. As expected, all our infrastructure businesses were very weak in Q1. Our China PON and base station businesses were especially weak in Q1, as overall demand softened and inventories remained high. Our hyperscale data business -- data center business was also weak in Q1, but we are expecting this business to rebound modestly in Q2 as inventories reduce. We are anticipating a strong second-half performance from our data center business, driven by our North American design wins. AI is driving significant demand at hyperscalers and our SIP portfolio is primed to take advantage of the upcoming data center buildouts. Our Tri-Edge, FiberEdge, and CopperEdge platforms deliver lower power and lower latency advantages over DSP solutions, which are key requirements for future AI data centers. We are growing our data center footprint with North American partners and we are already well positioned in China, where we believe that data center build-outs will regain momentum in the next 12 months. In Q1 we announced the industry's first 200 gig per channel FiberEdge type TIAs, which are generating positive interest and design wins with Tier-1 customers in North America. In addition, our CopperEdge platform is in the early stages of penetrating the 100 gig and 200 gig per channel active copper cable segment in North America, which we believe has tremendous potential in the data center market. We remain confident that our full portfolio of data center platforms, including ClearEdge and Tri-Edge CDRs, FiberEdge PMDs, and CopperEdge re-drivers will enable us to rapidly grow our hyperscale data center business over the next several years. While our PON business saw a sequential decline in Q1, we believe excess inventories are starting to reduce, increasingly we are seeing service providers outside of China, starting to deploy PON systems, which is very encouraging -- which is a very encouraging sign for our future PON business. Our PON portfolio has recently been expanded with the industry's first 50 gig PON OLT chipset, which already has design wins at Tier-1 European customers. We believe our 2.5 gig, 10 gig, 25 gig and 50 gig PON PMD portfolio offers customers the broadest and the highest performance PON PMD portfolio in the industry and we expect that PON business to return to growth in the second half. Revenue from our wireless base station business was also down in Q1, on both the sequential and year-over-year basis, as the macroeconomic slowdown in China has impacted demand for both 4G and 5G base stations. However, new tenders recently issued in China should drive meaningful growth in this segment in the second half of FY 2024 and in FY 2025. In Q2 of FY 2024, we expect a continued reduction of customer and channel inventories across our infrastructure businesses, and we expect a modest improvement in revenues from China, as our Chinese demand begins to recover. As a result, we expect our Signal Integrity Product Group revenues to increase sequentially in Q2. Moving on to our Advanced Protection and Sensing Product. Q1 net revenue from our Advanced Protection and Sensing Products Group decreased 25% sequentially and represents 15% of total revenues. The drop was driven by lower demand from the consumer segment as we are faced with high inventories in both China and Korean smartphone markets. We expect inventory digestion to continue for several quarters. However, we continue to achieve solid design wins on new smartphones with our leading USB-C protection platform across all Tier-1 global smartphone customers. In Q1, we announced the expansion of our PerSe Product portfolio with the release of a new SaaS sensor for 5G mobile devices. Semtech's PerSe technology senses human proximity and enables smartphones to implement RF power control. New [indiscernible] regulations in China starting in FY 2025 are beginning to be a catalyst for new proximity sensing growth, with bookings and POS up significantly from Q4. We expect this to increase, as adoption of our [indiscernible] sensors continues in the second half of FY 2024. On the broader market for our protection products, we are seeing strong demand from the automotive segment, as adoption of our high-performance system protection portfolio is accelerating. Specifically, we are seeing increasing adoption of Ethernet, USB-C and antenna protection from the automotive segment. In Q1 for the first time in our history, our broader protection business exceeded our consumer protection business, and represented approximately 55% of the total protection business. In Q2, we expect our Advanced Protection and Sensing business to see revenues grow sequentially. Turning to our IoT business. As a reminder, our new IoT business has two sub-businesses. The first is the IoT Systems Product Group, which is made up of Semtech's LoRa business, the Sierra Wireless Module business, and the Sierra Wireless Routers business. The second product group is the IoT Connected Services Group, which includes Sierra's Managed Connectivity business and Semtech's LoRa Cloud Services business. In Q1, total IoT revenues increased 170% sequentially to approximately $159 million or 67% of total revenues. While our LoRa enabled revenues were down in the quarter, driven by the lower demand for helium gateway chips, our LoRa and POS volume grew -- our LoRa end POS volume grew -- our LoRa end node POS volume grew 29% sequentially with strong growth in Europe, Japan, and China. This is a strong indication that our strategy is working. We expect future LoRa end node deployments to continue to increase, as the demand for low-power sensor networks, incorporating Edge AI routers becomes mainstream in IoT world over the next few years. The adoption of LoRa continues to grow across many IoT use cases globally, especially in North America and Europe. Some of the recent exciting announcements this quarter included, Sustainable Harvest deployed LoRa enabled sensors and LoRaWAN-based gateways across its Durian fruit farms in Malaysia to improve farming practices, lower operational costs and increase crop yields. Durian is a challenging crop that needs 24/7 maintenance for high yield and LoRa-enabled sensors give farmers real-time data for the health of their farms every step of the growth cycle. [indiscernible], a large European-based IT systems solution provider announced that they have joined the LoRa ecosystem and will incorporate LoRaWAN into their strategic portfolio, targeted at the retail, manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and public infrastructure segments. Lacuna Space, the direct satellite LoRaWAN company, launched its latest satellite on SpaceX, raising its number of satellites to seven, to bring low-cost connectivity to the most remote parts of the world. In Q1, we launched a new multiband LoRa transceiver for use in IoT endpoints, enabling a single, low-power device to be used anywhere in the world. The highly integrated LoRa Connect platform provides LoRaWAN connectivity for terrestrial low-power wide area networks as well as supports LoRa 2.4 gigahertz for global connectivity and S-band for direct connection to satellites. This new multiband LoRa radio is perfect for global logistics and asset management use cases. And in Q1, the LoRa Alliance launched a new LoRaWAN-accredited professional program to support the IoT industry's need for skilled LoRaWAN engineers and developers. New LoRa opportunities continue to emerge across multiple end markets, including smart utilities, smart logistics, and asset management, and connected spaces. While our LoRa-enabled businesses is expected to decline this year due to the negative impact of our Helium gateway business and a weak China, we are expecting LoRa end node deployments to continue to increase globally, and we expect our LoRa-enabled business to return to strong growth in FY 2025. In Q1, the Sierra Wireless IoT Module business increased 31% sequentially, as demand for IoT LPWAN connectivity solutions increased. Interest in Sierra routers -- Sierra's routers in the public safety and industrial IoT segments continues to increase. Specifically, we are seeing increased adoption of our routers for utility monitoring, EV charging, and precision agriculture. In addition, we are pleased with the strong growth of our IoT-connected services business, which grew 10.3% annually. As we grow our managed connectivity subscriber base, we see a massive opportunity to deliver value-added IoT services to our customers. We are investing in both our IoT-managed connectivity platform and our future IoT cloud services platform. As we start to marry our LoRa ecosystem strategy together with our IoT module router and services strategies, we expect to deliver a uniquely differentiated and highly attractive IoT portfolio to the low power IoT industry over the next few years. In Q2, we expect our IoT business to decline sequentially, as we continue to face high channel inventories and relatively weak demand across all our IoT hardware businesses. In Q1, Semtech's overall design win volume was up 32% sequentially and our module design win value was up 50% sequentially. Both of these metrics bode well for a strong FY 2025. Now let me discuss the outlook for the company for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. As a result of our LoRa revenues and our increased leverage, we are taking action to ensure our operating profits remain at acceptable levels. These actions are on top of our planned synergies. In addition, the Semtech board continues to carry out a detailed portfolio review and we'll discuss its findings and any actions with the new CEO, who will be joining Semtech approximately June 30th. We are currently estimating Q2 net revenues to be between $233 million and $243 million. To attain the midpoint of our guidance range or approximately $238 million, we need turns orders of 39% at the beginning of Q2. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP earnings to be between minus $0.02 per share and plus $0.06 per diluted share. I will now hand the call back to the operator, and Emeka and I will be happy to answer any questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Ellis: Yes. Thanks very much for taking the questions. Mohan, I was hoping you could just start by providing a little bit more color on some of the things you're seeing out in the end markets [serve one] (ph). Can you comment on what you've seen with order activity quarter-to-date? What are the pluses and what are the weaknesses, and in areas where per the press release, you're seeing signs of stability, where do you and the people in the sales team feel more confident that things have stabilized, where are things still relatively weaker or richer in inventory?\nMohan Maheswaran: Yeah, Craig. So I think the -- obviously, the consumer business now in China particularly is starting to show some signs of life. Of course, it's come down and it's very low levels. So that's not a surprise, it's going to turn around at some point and we're starting to see improved orders from the consumer business, a little bit of improvement in the China business, particularly in consumer. And so, that, I would say, probably the primary area. I would say, we're also seeing continued improvement in the automotive industrial area, that one is not been so bad. So I think in general, those are the two kind of strong areas. I would think -- I would say the other areas, in general, are still relatively weak -- bookings are still relatively weak. But remember, there's a lot of inventory out there. So we're expecting -- it's really looking at POS and the digestion of that inventory, that's the key thing. And there are some positive signs there as I mentioned in the infrastructure side and the data center side specifically, and I think I would say also in the broader kind of protection business.\nCraig Ellis: Got it. That's helpful. And then Emeka, I wanted to follow up. So a quarter ago, we were pacing very well on cost savings and I think you raised the cost savings target from $40 million to $50 million. Now, we've had better operating expense in the quarter, it's better than what I expected in the guide. So how should we look at that prior $50 million expense reduction target and the potential for that to move up either now or with time?\nEmeka Chukwu: Yeah, so Craig, we're definitely doing very well on the synergies front, the numbers that we're seeing is a little bit above the $50 million that we had upsized to last quarter. I'm not really at this point to quantify that it is coming in nicely above that number. We've also definitely like I said in my prepared remarks, we are definitely watching every penny of OpEx at this point. Our discretionary spend is something that we're keeping very close eyes on, the traveling expenses, some of other discretionary supplemental compensation we are keeping an eye on all of that. So we are definitely very pleased with what we have seen in the first quarter in terms of our ability to manage operating expenses and given where the business is right now. Like Mohan said in his prepared remarks, we are looking at all the things, and hopefully we'll continue to do a good job on that.\nCraig Ellis: That's good. And then if I could just sneak in one more. You mentioned that you had achieved some incremental covenant flexibility. Can you just talk more specifically to that point? And was there any incremental cost to interest rates on the debt you have out or was that achieved with some other means? Thanks so much, guys.\nEmeka Chukwu: Yes. So definitely on the covenant side, obviously, just given the outlook for the business, other macroeconomic issues that we're seeing. The fact that our inventory and the channel continues to remain stubbornly high. We sort of anticipated that the covenants might be challenged in the second half of the year. So we took proactive steps to get back to our banking group to walk with them. So, yes, there was an incremental cost. It cost us probably about 50 basis points in terms of amendment fees. And because the leverage is anticipated to be higher, the interest rate associated with those are going to be a little bit higher than what we originally had communicated, and the original agreement that we had out there. But having said that, I think our expectation is that, with all the synergies, the fact that we are running ahead on synergies, also looking at things, continuously getting better in terms of demand in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that the acquisition is going to be accretive to our earnings in fiscal year 2024.\nCraig Ellis: Thanks, Emeka. Thanks, Mohan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Searle with Roth Capital. Please proceed with your question.\nScott Searle: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. Nice job in the quarter. And Mohan, I want to wish you all the best again in your future endeavors. It's been a pleasure working with you over the past couple of years.\nMohan Maheswaran: Thank you, Scott.\nScott Searle: And maybe just to follow up on Craig's question on the covenant front, and like I just want to clarify a couple of things, it sounds like there were some small penalties, there is an increase in interest rate. But I want to make sure in terms of the guidance that you gave for the second quarter that is included, right? That interest expense is already included in there. And then going forward in terms of further reductions in the OpEx structure and/or evaluation of the portfolio and potential asset sales, that is not being mandated by the bank, that is in fact just part of your general pruning of operations and optimizing things going forward, is that correct?\nEmeka Chukwu: Yes. So the second one, I'll just take that. Yes, that is just is what every good business would do in a time like this, and we already have that set in motion. It wasn't -- it was not something that was mandated by the banks. And with regards to the interest expense, yes, our guidance has factored in the new agreement. I think in Q1 the weighted cash interest rate was about 5.65%. In Q2, we anticipated that based on our guidance to probably be about 6.1%.\nScott Searle: Great. Very helpful. Thank you. And if I could just -- in two of the end markets, first, in terms of IoT modules, it sounds like you're still working through some inventory issues there. Mohan, I'm not sure if I heard your comments, looking into the second half of this year. But you are expecting some relief in the inventory work flow at that point in time. It sounds like the design activity remains very high. So, we're getting back on a path to normalcy. And then just to clarify your comments around the data center, there is a tremendous amount of interest in activity as it relates to AI and what's that doing the demands of the data center. Do you get back to -- given the new products that you have, given those demand dynamics, by the end of this fiscal year, entering fiscal year 2025, do you start to get back -- start to approach the levels that you have seen two or three quarters ago? Thanks so much.\nMohan Maheswaran: Yes, Scott. So let me start with the -- on the IoT side. I think Semtech's IoT business, we saw softness in China, we saw softness in general, probably a little bit earlier. The Sierra business now has seen some weakness and continues to see some weakness, particularly on the modules and the router side and the hardware side, some of that is North America and Europe catching up with the softness in Asia. And I think we're going to see that in Q2 and maybe Q3. But after that, I think we'll start to see a little bit more positive momentum. And this is speaking about kind of the traditional Sierra modules that they've been selling. Obviously, there's a lot of design win -- designing activity around the new approach that we're taking now with modules and how we're thinking about things, and that could generate some interesting opportunities I think going forward. With regard to data center, I think, yes, our expectation is that, obviously, Q2 -- Q1 was very weak, Q2 will be stronger, and we're expecting the second half to be stronger than the first half. Could we get back to the levels of the first half of last year? I think we need to see some of our design wins that we've got going on. We have good momentum in North America, as we've stated, and we have some new opportunities with the CopperEdge as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, they're probably more FY 2025 kind of drivers, but we're hoping to see some of that in the back end of this year.\nScott Searle: Great. Thanks so much and best of luck going forward.\nMohan Maheswaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. Q - Harsh Kumar Yes, Mohan, I want to also wish you best of luck with your retirement, enjoyed working with you all these years. I just had a couple of questions. The first one, generally speaking, kind of, if I had to pin you down and say, how many quarters of inventory do you think there is on an aggregate basis for Semtech plus Sierra Wireless combined? Would you be able to tell us, is that a quarter or two quarters? And are you losing any design wins or is it just -- the slowdown is just purely a function of the fact that there is excess inventory in the channel?\nMohan Maheswaran: Yeah, I'm not aware of any design wins we've lost, Harsh, I think most of it is just inventory buildup. And it's difficult to say -- when you look at inventory, you obviously have to look at consumption in parallel with inventory, right? Because as consumption increases then inventory comes down and you can -- you start to see the opportunity and that's kind of what we are seeing. So in consumer as an example of that where I think most of the inventory is. We are starting to see a few positive signs there as I mentioned that China Consumer is starting to look a little bit more positive. So -- and as you know, if the consumer comes back quickly that can absorb inventory very quickly. So I think in the other areas like infrastructure, I think the same commentary applies to the PON business where we have some inventory and base station business, where we have some inventory, that -- those can be quite absorbed quite quickly depending on tenders come out there and demand picks up in China for example. I think where we are currently seeing demand, I would say, data center is the strongest in the infrastructure areas. And I would say on the industrial side, it's probably still the automotive area, and then the consumer area and the consumer area has been extremely weak for a long time. So that's not a surprise, right.\nHarsh Kumar: Yes, yes, totally. And then Mohan, I had a follow-up, but I'll ask a two-part question, if you don't mind. On LoRa side, is Helium all completely played out and do you think it's bottomed out in your guidance at this point in time? And what would make it come back? So, is the funnel or are you seeing so pretty good design activity here? And then secondly if I was to make a statement, this is part two of the question that, that -- I think your -- maybe your business is about bottomed out in the last quarter that happened. What would you say? Would you agree with that statement in general based on all the commentary or would you say that maybe there is some color required there?\nMohan Maheswaran: No, so I think the Semtech organic business has definitely -- Q1 was probably the bottom. I don't think it'll see any further decline from that. And that's clearly why we're guiding Q2 slightly up and part of that is the improvement in the Semtech organic business. And that kind of narratives the same on the LoRa side. Yes, the Helium was kind of an opportunistic business that came, has now gone away. And so it's, yes, clearly in the guidance that it's not in there. Could it you come back? We're not banking on Helium coming back. I don't think that was ever the strategy for LoRa and we're banking on low-power IoT sensors growing. And as I mentioned LoRa end nodes are growing. We're still seeing a lot of demand for LoRa across the globe. We're seeing a lot of use cases being deployed. All the dashboard metrics that I've been giving out for years and years now, I think are still doing well. Obviously, China is weak at the moment and because of what's happened with Helium, the metrics don't look as good. But I think one of the things to remember, anyway was part of the strategy as we integrate Sierra. We're looking at a very different playing field now. The opportunity to go and tackle a much larger space and with a broader portfolio. So, I think that's the way you should think about it. But, yes, to answer your question, I think it's pretty much built into the guidance any weakness from Helium.\nHarsh Kumar: I appreciate it, Mohan and best of luck. Thank you.\nMohan Maheswaran: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on the retirement Mohan. It's been great working with you these last 17 years. Let me start with a comment on working capital. You guys did a really good job there. Inventory days now back down to 159, DSOs 56. As we think about this new combined entity, where would -- what would those metrics ideally be? I know Emeka, you mentioned that you still expect to lower internal inventory somewhat, but where do you think eventually this business will land on DSOs and inventory days?\nEmeka Chukwu: So, Tore, as we continue to get very familiar with the new Sierra business, my expectation would be that the inventory days will continue to come down, both in terms of Sierra's inventory and Semtech organic inventory, right? Probably I wouldn't be surprised to see those days of inventory probably get down to the 120s or something like that by the end of the year, given the plans that we have. So we just have to see how it plays out. Of course, demand is going to be a key factor in that equation. With regards to receivables, Sierra typically has longer payment terms for their customers than the Semtech organic business does, 59 days is not that bad, but I think I would expect to see that come down, I would like to see that maybe come down to 50 or 55 days.\nTore Svanberg: Great. That's great perspective. And Mohan, you talked about expectations for growth, we're assuming in the data center second half of the year. I mean I think that's -- that makes sense, given all the dynamics there. But you also mentioned you expect base station to actually grow in the second half, any data points that give you that conviction?\nMohan Maheswaran: Just new tenders in China, Tore, we know about. We don't know exactly how that's going to affect our business yet, but we know that is happening. Whenever you here, obviously, in the base station business and PON business, it's all about service providers and all about tenders and it's all about how many systems are going to be deployed. And so, when you see tenders going out and you see quantities of -- unit volume quantities, then it just becomes a question of how the shares are allocated. We're pretty much, as you know in most of these 5G systems in China, where we are -- and 4G systems, we have very good relationships and very good penetration and the same on PON side. So I think our expectation is that, if those come to fruition, and then obviously that's always a question on timing then the second half will be stronger If not FY 2025 is going to be very strong.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you. I'll go back in line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham. Please proceed with your question.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, everyone. I will echo my congratulations and great working with you. Wanted to start just on a follow-up on Tore's question on the base station business. I think in the past you guys have said you get much higher content in sort of the 3 gigahertz to 6 gigahertz bands rather than the 700 megahertz band, just wondering if these tenders are going out in China or in those higher frequency bands where you might have greater dollar content in those base stations?\nMohan Maheswaran: Yeah. I believe so, Quinn. So I don't know exactly the detail, but I believe they are.\nQuinn Bolton: Perfect. And then on the turns percentage. I may have missed what turns was in fiscal Q1, but 39% I think is back up towards the higher end of certainly recent ranges, with visibility still being pretty low, how comfortable are you with turns up near 40% for the second quarter?\nMohan Maheswaran: Yes, I think, actually this is kind of closer to our historical levels. So, we actually -- if you go back pre-COVID where we're returning 40%, 50%, as you know, consumer business that's kind of normal. So this is kind of getting back to normal levels, I think. So, we're quite comfortable. Obviously, we have a mechanism. We look at backlog. We look at what's on the books. We look at channel inventory and we have to make some adjustments there depending on what we expect to happen to POS in the consumption levels. So -- but that's driving the turns number, but we are quite comfortable, yes.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Then lastly, quick one for Emeka, just on the OpEx reductions, it looks like they're coming in nicely ahead of plan. How much of that is in the near-term, just lower variable comp or lower selling expense, you mentioned watching travel expenses pretty closely, that as the business recovers may come back versus cuts that are more permanent, whether it's headcount reductions or just you're being streamlining R&D expenses, and those expenses don't necessarily come back as the business recovers?\nEmeka Chukwu: I think it's roughly equal, Quinn, in terms of us seeing higher levels of synergies, and then some of the other opportunities that I spoke to. So -- but I think even if anything is going to come back, we're not expecting them to come back in this current fiscal year. We are definitely managing things on a very tight basis for the rest of the year.\nMohan Maheswaran: I think I'll -- the other point on that Quinn, as you know, if you go back and look at our history, lot of the variable comp is driven by our ability to derive profitability. So it's dictated by the revenue, right, and the growth in the revenue. So, a lot of those expenses won't come back, if the revenue doesn't come back.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it, okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Ramsay: Yes, thank you very much guys. I appreciate you taking the questions. I guess the first one that I wanted to get to and obviously, there is some with the new CEO coming in and the board doing different evaluations of things. I wanted to ask sort of a nuts and bolts question. Just with the non-IoT business, so the signal integrity and the protection and sensing segments, what's the operational overlap between those two business segments from a R&D perspective, from a go-to-market and sales perspective, from FAE perspective? I'm just trying to understand that there are obviously synergies and things, but how independent are those businesses or how integral do they need to be to run together, just general big picture thing? Thanks.\nMohan Maheswaran: Yes. So, Matt, I think if you go back and look at Semtech's history, we've always had businesses that are largely discrete businesses, the standalone. That's what analog companies do. It's a portfolio of different analog businesses and each of these analog businesses, we largely don't do the whole system. I mean, we are doing analog functions. So Advanced Protection has advanced sensing functions, advanced protection functions. In our SIP business, we do CDRs and PMDs, but we don't do some of the digital functionality. So, that's the way we run it. But they are very different independent businesses. They don't really have a lot in common with each other. But we target attractive markets and that's most high-performance analog companies do, you look for opportunities to continue to expand in those businesses and that's what we've done with our integrity product business, which used to be the old [indiscernible] business that we acquired. That's what we've done with our protection business for many years now. And even the IoT business for Semtech, the organic Semtech business was largely just radio business, low power radio business with LoRa. We had some other functions -- analog functions around it. The difference now, of course, with the acquisition of Sierra, we have brought in a modular router and a software-as-a-services business. But as -- those of you who've kind of kept in aware of what we were doing with LoRa, as we expanded from our radios, from our LoRa end node radios into gateway radios and connected to systems and networks, we started to look at cloud services as an opportunity and part of the rationale, of course, with the Sierra business was to try to accelerate that and bring in sensing service business, and really build on the edge capabilities that we have. And so those are slightly different than kind of the chip business approach that we have. But I think it can really take Semtech to a whole new level and that's why we did the acquisition. But to answer your question, the protection business and the Signal Integrity Product business, and the IC business of IoT are very different businesses.\nMatthew Ramsay: Thank you for that. I appreciate the perspective. I guess as my follow-up question in the IoT business largely came from Sierra. There were obviously cloud infrastructure pieces or connected services business that were affiliated with the old LoRa business and also with big IoT franchise that came in from Sierra. Is the intention to integrate those cloud platforms into one and how is that evaluation started and is progressing well? I guess what kind of overlap is there, and opportunity to sort of put those two cloud platforms together? Thanks.\nMohan Maheswaran: So when you look at the Sierra software-as-a-services business, it's really a managed connectivity business, it's managed network business. It's really managed network services with some elements of services around the managed connectivity. With Semtech, it's all about the end nodes and managing those end nodes, and thinking about sensors. And so, marrying the two together, we're essentially saying we're building a higher value platform for our customers. So a customer that wants to build a private network for example and manage its sensors on that network, and have managed connectivity and understand where the security holes are and understand the provisioning of those sensors on the network and understand the location of the sensors on the network and the health of the sensor. I mean, that's really the kind of end game, I think for us. And I think we're not -- we really have a very nice platform to do that now. The Sierra advantage platform, the software platform that we have, which we've had for many years combined with our cloud -- LoRa cloud platform, and obviously there's work to do on the integration side. But really once we've done that, I think it's going to be a very unique and very differentiated platform.\nMatthew Ramsay: All right. Thank you very much guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. Just two quick follow-ups. The turns 39% that was at the beginning of the quarter, how would that number be now, as you're almost halfway through the quarter?\nMohan Maheswaran: Yes, we don't normally give that, Tore. Sorry, if I had given that number out. We normally talk about the terms of the beginning of the quarter. I would just tell you that we're confident that will make our guidance, right?\nTore Svanberg: Got it. But I mean, it's safe to say that the world is back to turns, right? Because, obviously the industry has had a lot of turns in the last two years, so, we're sort of back to that, right?\nMohan Maheswaran: Yeah, I think -- so -- you remember during COVID, I mean the turns went to zero, right? So, we basically had a (technical difficulty) backlog and that was an unrealistic such situation and so now we're getting closer. I don't think we're quite there yet, but we're getting closer to the pre-COVID levels, where we were routinely turning 45% a quarter, right?\nTore Svanberg: Got it. And the 67% that's now IoT, what percentage of that is services at this point?\nMohan Maheswaran: Let's see, do you have that number, Emeka?\nEmeka Chukwu: No, I don't have that number. Sorry, but I can get it to you.\nTore Svanberg: Okay. That's fine. We can follow up. Thank you.\nMohan Maheswaran: Yes. Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rick Schafer with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi, this is [Way Mark] (ph) in the line for Rick. I wanted to wish you the best in your retirement. It's been a pleasure working with you. My first question, in your prepared remarks, you guys mentioned bookings increased 1% quarter-over-quarter from the organic Semtech and more particularly from the advanced protection and sensing segment. I was wondering if you could parse that out a little bit further? Are you seeing more of this strength from the protection business or more from the proximity sensing side?\nMohan Maheswaran: We see, both actually. It's -- the consumer business in general has been really soft over the last few quarters as you know, particularly in China. And I would say that we're starting to see improvements in both the consumer business -- consumer protection business and consumer sensing business. But I would say on the proximity sensing business, a lot of it now as I mentioned in China, the new regulations for FY 2025 starting calendar year 2024 are driving design -- more design wins. So I would say that the consumer protection business is what's driving the current demand increase.\nUnidentified Participant: Got it. Great. Thanks. As for my follow-up, particularly within the protection, it looks like the broad market side reached 55% of your protection business of that mix. But given the higher growth of this segment, do you expect this mix to shape out for the rest of the year compared to the consumer side?\nMohan Maheswaran: No, I expect consumer to come back actually and be a larger percentage again. I think what it demonstrates is the value of having that diversity and the fact that we have momentum in the broader protection business bodes really well for the future. Because that's a business that I think will go on for the next 10 years growing, as we start to just get broader industrial penetration. The consumer business, of course, is very volatile, right? It goes up and it goes down. Currently, it's very down, which is why our protection industrial businesses got a larger percentage, but I do think that once that protection businesses and we've got good design wins, so once the demand comes back, I think that will come back quite quickly and be a larger percentage.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Ellis: Yes. Thanks for taking the follow-up and since I missed it in the initial round, Mohan. Congratulations, great pleasure working with you and good luck in your next phase. I wanted to follow-up on a couple of longer-term things. One, I think China is implementing proximity sensing standards that go into effect in January of 2024. As the team works with smartphone companies around designs for early next year, what are you seeing in terms of content and proximity sensing win rates versus where you might have been in other generations of phones, et cetera. Is this looking something -- like something that could be a meaningful incremental driver, does it just support the run rate of the business as you have it?\nMohan Maheswaran: Yes. So first of all, it's something that we've been working towards and hoping for quite a few years now. It's been actually -- probably two years later than we'd liked, but it's finally coming to fruition. And the main reason for that and the reason why it's valuable for us is, it means that most of the smartphone manufacturers that sell into China will now include proximity sensing or SAR functionality in their phones. As you know with Samsung and some of the companies that we have partnered with and have penetration with, they have multiple phones, and some of their phones that don't have proximity sensing and they ship into China, but now that that will change. So we are starting to see that momentum already in China and outside China, so that's good. So it's more design win. Of course, we don't have to see the momentum from a revenue standpoint, but I expect to see that in FY 2025 for sure.\nCraig Ellis: That's helpful. And then from time to time we talk about the Amazon Sidewalk initiative, and I know it's something that the company has worked on. Just any color on how you feel like the team is progressing with Amazon and prospects for that to monetize as we go through the year?\nMohan Maheswaran: Yes, on the sidewalk side, Craig, is that the [Technical Difficulty] So I think it's early, but I think obviously the smartphone world in IoT is really just beginning I think in many ways. And I think Amazon's vision and their Sidewalk initiative is something that we've always supported and feel like, we feel very good about. And I think as we start to see some of the use cases and applications that there -- that are out there, we're excited about it. Now, we're excited about it from a smartphone standpoint, regardless of Amazon Sidewalk. So, I think it's going to continue -- we're going to continue to see LoRa kind of become a mainstream technology in the smart home connected spaces area. Obviously, we are really hopeful that the sidewalk also has tremendous success. There already have a lot of gateways out there in their ecosystems and now it's about end devices. And so haven't got any kind of major update, but I think that we're still very positive about it.\nCraig Ellis: Got it. Thank you very much, Mohan.\nMohan Maheswaran: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nMohan Maheswaran: Thank you. Before we close, I want to share that we delivered our inaugural ESG report this quarter, showcasing the many ways our low-power products having a significant impact on society, as the world adopts technology to monitor and manage our scarce natural resources. You can find this report on our website. In closing, our global teams are executing well in a challenging economic environment. I know I'm leaving the company in excellent hands with the arrival of Paul Pickle as the next Semtech President and CEO. Thank you all again for the many years of support. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."
