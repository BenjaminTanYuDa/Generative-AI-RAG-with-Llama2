As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Investor Relations section of Atlassian's website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassian's Head of Investor Relations.\nMartin Lam: Welcome to Atlassian's second quarter of fiscal year 2024 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call today, we have Atlassian's Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; Chief Financial Officer, Joe Binz. Earlier today, we published a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our second quarter of fiscal year 2024. The shareholder letter is available on Atlassian's Work Life blog and the Investor Relations section of our website, where you will also find other earnings-related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor datasheet. As always, our shareholder letter contains management's insights and commentary for the quarter. So during the call today, we'll have brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A. This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we have. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current. Further information on these and other factors that could affect our business performance and financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recently filed Annual and Quarterly reports. During today's call, we will also include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in our Shareholder Letter, earnings release, and investor data sheet on the Investor Relations section of our website. We'd like to allow as many of you to participate in Q&A as possible. Out of respect for others on the call, we'll take one question at a time. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks.\nScott Farquhar: Thank you for joining us today. As you've already read in our shareholder letter, Q2 was full of significant milestones for Atlassian. When we first went public eight years ago, we had just over $100 million in quarterly revenue and supported 54,000 customers. Fast forward to today, and we just posted our first $1 billion revenue quarter, Jira Software crossed $1 billion in Cloud ARR, and we surpassed 300,000 customers. These accomplishments are a true testament to our amazing team, our diverse and passionate customer base, and the high-value mission-critical products we deliver. Mike and I are extremely proud and thankful for every single Atlassian who's helped to get us here. In Q2, our R&D engine continued to deliver incredible innovation across our cloud platforms. We rolled out Compass, Virtual Agent capabilities in Jira Service Management, and our first wave of Atlassian Intelligence capabilities into general availability. We also welcomed Loom to the Atlassian family and have been thrilled to see the team deliver on their ambitious AI vision with many new features, including an enhanced editing experience that makes updating a video as easy as editing a text document. Customers see the value we're delivering in the cloud and are turning to us for strategic guidance on how we can unleash the potential for their teams. We're excited about the momentum we're seeing across the business and remain laser-focused on executing against our key strategic priorities, cloud migration, serving the enterprise, ITSM, and now AI, and we're in a great position to get after them with massive market opportunities, strong customer commitments to the Atlassian platform, our unique ability to combine over 20 years of insights with the immense power of AI, and most importantly, a world-class team. With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a lot of milestones this quarter and in what looks like a solid quarter. In the shareholder letter, you talked about even absent Loom, still expecting an acceleration in the cloud business into the second half. It sounds like you saw some signs of stabilization in the quarter, but I was hoping you could drill in a little bit further on what gives you guys the confidence to look for that, to expect that acceleration into the back half of the year in what still seems to be a uneven microenvironment? Thank you.\nJoe Binz: Yeah, thanks, Keith. This is Joe. Let me start with the cloud revenue results in Q2. They were up 27.5%. Loom contributed about a point of growth, so our results ex-Loom landed in the middle of our guidance range for the quarter. There were a few cross currents in that performance, so let me walk through them in terms of consumer -- customer segment and growth driver trends to try and help, and then I'll transition into your question on the confidence around H2. From a customer segment perspective, we had very strong sales execution in the quarter, which drove healthy performance in our enterprise customer segment. This resulted in better-than-expected billings on an annual and large multi-year deals, a significant portion of which landed on the balance sheet and unearned revenue. This also drove healthy upsell to premium versions of our products. Results conversely in SMB were slightly lower than we expected and that was driven by paid seat expansion and a mix shift from monthly to annual subscriptions, which, as you know, signal stronger customer's commitment, but also carrier's lower pricing. And as you know, dynamics in the SMB business, good or bad, are largely realized in the quarter given the linearity in that part of the business. In terms of the trends on our key growth drivers in the quarter, migrations from server and data center exceeded our expectations, and that's driven by the significant investment and execution focus we put there. In terms of paid seat expansion, while the overall rate of paid seat expansion remained lower than the prior year, the pace of deceleration or slope of that trend continued to moderate from Q1, and within that trend, as mentioned earlier, enterprise was better-than-expected and SMB was slightly worse. We also saw the rate at which consumer -- customers convert from free to paid at the top of our funnel stabilized relative to Q1 and that's another positive leading indicator. And then finally, other cloud growth drivers like cross-sell and customer retention, churn, and monthly active usage continued to be very healthy and performed in line with our expectations. And beyond that, we didn't really see anything noteworthy in terms of linearity in the quarter or across products, regions, or verticals. They were largely in line with our expectations. In terms of the confidence around the H2 guide, the midpoint of our H2 cloud guidance range ex-Loom does assume slightly accelerating growth rates. The factors that give me confidence are the recognition of those strong Q2 billings on annual and large multi-year agreements rolling off the balance sheet, the increasing momentum on cloud migrations as we focus on unblocking more customers for moving to the cloud and continuing to bring new innovation and value to our cloud offering, the benefit of price increases that are laddering into the model and the momentum we're seeing in enterprise driving healthy upsell to premium and enterprise versions of our products. I talked about the slope of the trend line on paid seat expansion rates and that continues to moderate quarter-over-quarter. And I also mentioned, the leading indicator around free to paid conversions at the top of the funnel. So those are the types of things that give me confidence in the ability to deliver accelerating cloud revenue growth in the second half of the year. And I hope that helps.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Thanks. Appreciate you taking the question. For Scott or Mike, there has been plenty of build-up and probably too much focus from us on the server end-of-life. For investors asking us whatâ€™s next, the letter does a good job in framing some of that out, but maybe you can share your vision around what the cloud migration opens up for Atlassian from here? And then, Joe, just as a follow-on the 10 points of migration tailwind that cloud line has been, how should we think about that post-server end-of-life? Will that at all lessen or does it simply shift more towards data centers? Any puts and takes there for us to consider useful. Thank you, all.\nScott Farquhar: Michael, thanks for the question. Scott here. Firstly, for those of you new to the Atlassian story, just a reminder, we said historically that about 10 points of our cloud growth has come from migrations, and for those who are really new to Atlassian story, this coming quarter in the next few weeks, we will have our end of server support will be happening, which has been a three-plus year journey with our customers. And so the three points I want to make in answer to your question, Michael. Firstly is that, migrations will continue for multiple years. And we said historically that's about half our migrations to the cloud come from our data center customers. In this last quarter, even with a lot of server customers migrating with the end of support, 60% of our migrations in last quarter came from data center customers. So with that, we expect to see migrations continue for a long time to come. And we've also made huge R&D investments in order to continue our customers moving to the cloud and you continue to see us doing that. We've launched Data Residency in Canada. This last quarter, we also did Bring-Your-Own-Key for Jira software. We continue to remove blockers for our cloud customers and that continues to open up the aperture of migrations. The second point I'd like to make is that cloud continues to be the gateway for the experience, and customers once they get to the cloud are really getting the best we can offer and you'll see us continue to deliver innovation in cloud. So whether that's Compass, which has continued to grow, Jira-Product-Discovery, which we talked about and popping 4,000 paying customers, also Loom in our ecosystem, and all the AI functionality that we have already developed and continue to develop are only available in cloud. And so with that, our customers get a better experience, but we also have an incredible opportunity to sell customers more products and more functionality that really makes a difference to them. And lastly, enterprise. The third thing is enterprise, which is through these migrations and having these discussions with customers around migrating to cloud, we've really deepened our relationships with our best customers whether they are North American financial services customers or German auto manufacturers, these discussions have led to us being seen more-and-more as strategic partner for them and I want to do more with us, and you saw that, we talked about Mercedes Benz in our letter, the Mercedes Benz migrated 30,000 seats from data center to cloud, and -- Jira and Confluence, and as part of that they were so excited by the usage of our ITSM solution in that process, so they then have adopted that and started using it with their customers. And so, we are becoming more and more a strategic partner for these large enterprises. Joe, do you want to talk about some of the puts and takes?\nJoe Binz: Yeah, thanks, Scott. Michael, it's really too early to give a specific number on the migration impact to cloud revenue growth beyond FY '24. I would just echo what Scott said, we continue to expect migrations to be a significant driver of cloud revenue growth in FY '25 and beyond. That's driven primarily by the significant size of the data center installed base. There's a lot of opportunity there because those are some of our very largest customers, and for them, it's more a question of when and not if they move to the cloud. So, we continue to expect to see migrations be a significant driver of cloud revenue growth beyond FY '24.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nGregg Moskowitz: Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question. And maybe I'll focus on the data center business. So, it's impressive that that business is still actually growing 30% plus, even after adjusting for the net benefit from migrations, obviously 41% reported. Joe, when you look at that strong growth, how should we think about the relative contributions from installed base expansion versus pricing versus net new logos? Thanks.\nJoe Binz: Yeah, thanks, Gregg. You're right, it was another strong quarter for data center. It was solidly ahead of our expectations, driven by stronger-than-expected migrations from server. That's partially offset, as you point out, by the stronger migrations to cloud. I'd say the biggest driver once you get past the net migration impact is really seat expansion, and that goes to my point earlier around, paid seat expansion performance in enterprise was actually quite strong this quarter. And so we believe that's a statement around macro, as well as our ability to serve those customers and the big investments that we've made to improve our enterprise-grade capabilities, address things like scalability, certifications, data residency, app integration, all these things are very compelling and moving customers to the cloud, but also in terms of -- and as a result of that, customers are staying with us and they're moving to data centers, a stepping stone that will ultimately result in a migration down the road. So it's primarily paid seat expansion from our perspective once you get past the migration impacts.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nFred Havemeyer: Hi, thank you very much. I wanted to ask as we start this year, we've once again seen that layoffs in the tech industry had been picking up, although at a substantially lower scale than what we saw in the prior year. So I wanted to ask, as we look at your outlook in the cloud revenue growth, how comfortable do you feel that guidance once again de-risks for the potential impacts from any sort of layoffs in the tech industry? And secondly, have you seen any signs at all that these layoffs maybe impacting anything in your free to pay conversion or anything else to date? Thank you.\nJoe Binz: Yeah. Thanks, Fred. We haven't seen a dramatically different impact than we expected coming into the year relative to the recent announcements. Obviously, it's something we keep an eye on and track. If you think about the guidance, we really haven't changed conceptually how we freshen the guidance ranges for the cloud. Just to reiterate, the high-end of our cloud guidance range for the year assumes healthy acceleration in H2 growth rates that we talked about with Keith. That's driven by less macro headwinds and the related impact that would have on improving paid seat expansion. It also assumes strong migrations from server to cloud following server end of support and continued strength in data center migrations, cross-sell, upsell, and customer retention. On the low end of the guide, that -- for the year, that does assume increasing macro headwinds and the impacts you're talking about and the related impact that would have not only on paid seat expansion but also areas of our business that have held up well to date, such as migrations and cross-sell and upsell. And then lastly, I would assume we do a relatively -- we get relatively weak results post server end of support on migrations from server to cloud. So at the midpoint of our guidance, we're assuming that paid seat expansion rates are kind of steady to where they are today. That drives slightly accelerated revenue growth. At the high end of the range, we get favorable macroeconomic outcomes that drive improvement in that, and thus better revenue. On the low end, we assume that we see the headwinds and that impacts those paid seat expansion rates.\nScott Farquhar: Just to add on to Joe there. He talked about SMB paid seat expansion being a bit weak, but when I look at the enterprise business and we're talking with our biggest of customers, I see great excitement amongst them for what we're providing and that comes in a lot of different ways. It comes in competitive switchouts. We see a lot of our customers looking to us to replace more expensive versions of other products at this particular stage. I had thought that might happen earlier in the economic cycle, but it's actually showing up pretty strongly now in a lot of the deals that we're doing of replacing other products out there that might be older and or more expensive. We're also seeing that in AI and the excitement around customers who are excited to use our AI features, and then the new products that we are delivering in cloud are having great customer reception, though still very early days, I think that Jira Product Discovery is a great example we talked about where we're delivering innovation and value to these customers in cloud and they're picking it up and running with it. So they're all strong areas that I think are sort of counter to any layoffs in tech narratives.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead from UBS. Please go ahead.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. I'd like to focus on the remaining server cohort. The sequential decline in server maintenance of $10 million was at least a little bit less than I was modeling. Are you surprised by that stickiness? Can you offer us any help in sizing the cohort that will likely not migrate at the end of support date and continue to run on supported versions and perhaps offer a little color as to what that cohort looks like in terms of customer size, vertical, anything? Thank you so much.\nJoe Binz: Yeah, thanks, Karl. This is Joe. I'll go first and then Scott can chime in if he has anything to add. In terms of the server performance that you referenced, server delivered much better results than expected results in Q2 and it's certainly been more resilient than we expected over the course of the last year. I'd highlight that it's not because of slower migrations to cloud and data center, those remain squarely on track if not ahead of where we expect it to be. In general, what we're seeing is better renewals, better customer retention, and less-than-expected churn, which highlights the mission-critical nature of our product and customer commitment to Atlassian's roadmap and platform. And of course, it also means mathematically, we have a bigger opportunity than we originally thought in terms of future seat migrations to the cloud, which is a great position to be in. In terms of the end of support moment, we're about two weeks out, and really there has been no change from what we discussed last quarter other than that we're seeing those stronger renewals and customer retention. We end of support in a couple of weeks, there has been no change to our focus around migrating as many of those server customers as possible. The customers that remain on that server installed base are predominantly larger, more complex accounts that are typically blocked from the cloud at the moment. So we continue to expect most of those customers that migrate -- will migrate to data center. And we continue to hold prudent assumptions to account for customers who will choose not to migrate in FY '24 and that's also factored into our guidance.\nScott Farquhar: Yeah, just to add some color there, I think Joe's talked to the financial aspect of it. Obviously, with an end of life moment, it's hard to predict in a week-by-week basis exactly what happens, so we put a lot of effort into looking at every single customer that still exists on server and what it will take to get them across the cloud in an ideal sense or to data center if they can't move there. As Joe referenced, it really comes to the stickiness of our products and kind of a testament to what we built and how valuable we are for our customers that we haven't seen churn there. And for many of these customers who can't move to cloud, data center is a drop-in replacement that does not require many months of planning, and so customers can leave it the last minute and switch out to data center, and I expect to see a lot of that happen as we cross the end of server support threshold in the next few weeks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Congratulations on the results. From a trend line standpoint, the cloud migration is a big opportunity clearly, but when you look at the trend over the last five to six quarters or so, the cloud has decelerated from 49% or so, I think there was Q1 last year to 27% and a big chunk of that is coming from migrations. So if we look at the net underlying cloud growth rate, it has decelerated, where server continues to -- data center, I'm sorry, continues to be a champion, it's gone from 54% or so to 41%. Can you help us understand what could be causing the dichotomy that maybe there is a preference for the data center product? If that's the case, then what does the long-term look like for the company? Because companies generally either have a cloud product that wins or an on-prem that wins, rarely does both win but maybe it does for Atlassian. Can you help us understand what are you really betting on? Where do your customers really -- where do you wish your customers really go and how you're going to make it happen? Thank you so much.\nJoe Binz: Yeah, Kash, this is Joe. Customers are not choosing data center over cloud. What's happening here is server migrations to data center and cloud, both exceeded our expectations and so we don't see more customers choosing one over the other. If there was any weakness in our cloud performance versus expectations it's that paid seat expansion, has been lower than we expected and this quarter it was slightly lower than we expected, particularly in SMB. DC strength on the other hand, as I mentioned earlier, was also driven by stronger migrations from server as well as paid seat expansion. So we feel really good about the fact that customers are looking at datacenter as a stepping stone to the cloud, and ultimately, we want to get those customers to the cloud, because that's where our customers receive the best experience, the most secure experience from Atlassian, and it gives us a chance to add more-and-more value over time as Scott discussed earlier in the call.\nScott Farquhar: Let me add to that, which is -- every customer I've talked to, whether that be a German bank, kind of we would consider one of the more conservative end of the scale through to small, medium-sized businesses out there, even in regulated environments, all of them are telling me that cloud is the future. And if you went five years ago, we were telling customers cloud was the future. These days, customers are telling me that's the case. And in many cases, they either need time to plan a migration if they've got tens of thousands of users, that is a chance not only to migrate to the product we have in cloud, but expand your usage of Atlassian, look at other products that we can replace, and so we see a lot of that happening, but that takes a little bit of time at the largest customers or in some cases, but decreasing. Our customers are blocked from the cloud and they're pushing us to say, I need data residency or I need certification or FedRAMP. So we're thinking about a lot of that with our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nick Altmann from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks, guys. I wanted to circle back to sort of the stabilization in the free to paid conversion. I guess when we think about how in the quarter you saw that stabilize, do you think that was an anomaly just because perhaps it's a stronger spending period for software or you kind of see it stabilizing over the next coming quarters? Thanks.\nJoe Binz: Thanks for the question. We do see it as a stabilized -- a durable stabilizing factor. We think it's super important because it's a leading indicator of success. Today's land and new customers are tomorrow's expansion opportunity. So we fundamentally believe that a lot of the -- lot of that is macro driven. I'd also say, we've done a good job of investing to improve the efficiency of our funnel and to improve the efficiency and the hit rate on that free to paid conversion. And so hats off to the team inside Atlassian thatâ€™s doing a phenomenal job on driving improvements there. So some of it is macro, some of it is absolutely our own execution, and overall, we feel it's durable moving forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for taking the question. Great to see data centers driving more than 60% of cloud migrations at this point. So in the shareholder letter and you've just been mentioning how you've been unblocking some of the largest customers on data center to help them move to cloud? Do you have a rough idea of what percentage of data center revenue you considered block today? And if unblocked, would these customers be willing to move to the cloud after recently moving to data center? Thanks.\nJoe Binz: Yeah, Ryan, we're not going to -- I'm not going to be able to help -- I'm sorry, go ahead, Scott.\nScott Farquhar: That's okay, you go.\nJoe Binz: Yeah, Ryan, I was going to say we're not going to be able to provide a breakdown today on what that blocked percentage is. Keep in mind, those data center customers are primarily our largest and most complex, so you can imagine it's all the things we're investing against and making progress on. I mentioned earlier, scalability, data residency, certifications, app integration, a lot of investment, a lot of effort going to unblock that, that's why we're confident in the ability to continue to grow migrations from data center to cloud, and so we feel very confident in our ability to continue to drive migration over the next coming years.\nMike Cannon-Brookes: Ryan, just to chime in, this is Mike here. [I'll give you two] (ph) a break because they haven't asked many product questions today. I will say it's about the long term partnership with our customers. I think that's really important even more so for the biggest of the big. One of the things that the customers will tell us is they've been really impressed by our delivery over the last three to five years in the cloud of enterprise capabilities. We have a public cloud roadmap. So we do talk about FedRAMP delivery, data residency delivery, compliance delivery across all the different geographies that we operate in. Last quarter, we hit 100% of that roadmap in terms of delivery on time and what that's building is this long term strategic partnership, long term relationship with those biggest of the big customers. We believe in our enterprise business over the next decade and hopefully many decades. It's about building a partnership with those biggest customers that we have, and that partnership is built on trust. It's built on continued delivery of the things that we say we're going to deliver. And when you talk to those customers, as Scott mentioned, they are believing that cloud is their long term future. They understand that. They're working on moving at all sorts of different rates. We have a great proportion of our migrations coming from data center today, but that engineering delivery has been a hallmark of our strength in terms of building that partnership with those customers, and obviously, we intend to continue that over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Bachman from BMO. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: Yes, many thanks and congratulations on the solid quarter and guide. Joe, I wanted to direct this for you. You've implicitly given us guidance for the June quarter, which is post the expiration of server, and I just want to get your thoughts to what extent is the June quarter a reasonable proxy without -- for FY '25 growth rates? So I'm not asking for '25, but I'm just asking is there anything usual in the implied growth rates for cloud and data center that we should think about as we're considering our '25 estimates? In other words, is the February deadline going to pull forward a bunch of revenues or is there anything else that we should think about for the June quarter exit run rate? Thank you.\nJoe Binz: Yeah, thanks. It's really too early to talk specifically about FY '25. In general, I'll talk a little bit about the individual lines. If you look at data center, we do expect growth rates there, will continue to decelerate as server to data center migrations drop essentially to zero and the data center to cloud migrations accelerate as we continue to deliver on removing cloud blockers. In terms of the cloud, we've talked a lot on the call about migrations being a multi-year journey, so I won't rehash that. In addition to that, keep in mind, we have a number of other growth drivers in that model. First of all, paid seat expansion with an existing customer is the biggest driver and even bigger than the migrations factor that we've talked about and that has been an area in the model that's been most impacted by macro headwinds over the last year. So, a lot of your view on '25 is going to depend on macro outcomes. Then our opportunity to cross-sell additional products to our over 300,000 existing customers, our ability to upsell the premium and enterprise editions of our product is another significant growth driver. And then with a smaller impact, other drivers like the free-to-pay conversion that we've talked about, the price increases that we've made, and new high growth products like Compass, Jira Product Discovery, and Loom. And I just point out, we're in a super dynamic space right now, particularly with AI, and there's a lot of opportunity to add value with solid execution. So we feel very confident in our ability to deliver healthy revenue growth over a multi-year period in the cloud. And then obviously server is going to be zero essentially in two weeks when we get to the server end of support. So that's the color I'd give you for now. We'll continue to update you over the course of the next six months, but that's how I would -- that's where our mindset is, and that's how I think about it directionally.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Please go ahead.\nFatima Boolani: Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to shift gears to Jira Service Management. You're clocking in about 50,000 customers since about three, 3.5 years from launch, about 20% of your base. I was hoping to add some more quantitative color on what the monetization curve looks like, and when should we expect a JSM to become as large or rival the size Jira and Confluence as a revenue contributor to the business?\nMike Cannon-Brookes: Thanks, Fatima. I can take that. Look, we remain incredibly excited about JSM and the service management market broadly, both in terms of IT service management and enterprise service management for all functions within a business. I think we've done a really good job at continuing to grow that business alongside our other businesses that we have. It's always hard when you're playing catch-up. It's got about a decade to catch up on Jira Software and the agile & DevOps market. It certainly has the potential to do that and we continue to see it being our fastest growth broad market that we have. It's also worth noting that for a lot of our customers, our strength is in the combination of the markets. So people who buy Jira Service Management, some of them, as Scott mentioned, are migrating off expensive and legacy tools, and we see increasing numbers of switch outs which is always comforting to see but more importantly they're buying it because of our connection to developers and connection to the work management market and broader connectivity across their organization. Increasingly you're going to see a blending of this as software and technology become the core strategic advantage and operating and delivering on that service alongside that is incredibly important. So I think we are very bullish on the long-term monetization of Jira Service Management and the ITSM and ESM spaces broadly, both because of our competitive positioning, as we've seen and demonstrated this quarter and last quarter and the quarter beforehand but also because of our connectivity to the two adjacent markets which is strategically why we're there in the first place. Scott might have some customer color that he wants out on top of that.\nScott Farquhar: Yeah, look, I just want to remind everyone that ITSM is [indiscernible] It really goes together with our Jira Software, which is development teams and all the other products we've got there, work very closely with IT teams and increasingly so every single day and that's something that only we deliver in this market and we've been recognized actually over the last few months by this. We were a leader in Forresterâ€™s ESM Wave where we received the highest possible score for strategy. And as a company that we've been doing this for a while now but it wasn't the thing we started with. It's really comforting to see that we're being recognized for the unique things that we only we can provide in the market. And not only is that being recognized by analysts, but key switch-up stories, right? We have a luxury travel company who's been a 15-year customer of one of our large competitors in the space who started out, who switched up for JSM and switched away from that legacy vendor. And we see that again and again with large logistics provider who moved 1,400 agents to JSM. So we've been strong historically in the SMB space. That's kind of where we started. We're increasingly seeing strength in the enterprise space as well, as well as industry analysts are recognizing us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alex Zukin from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for asking the question. I want to maybe shift a little bit towards understanding the unlock in kind of the OpEx and COGS basis post-migration. If we think about elevated COGS activity, salespeople continue to be focused on migration that start to unlock and focus on cloud and cross-sell and up-sell, as well as the incremental R&D costs that you've been kind of putting into the entire platform as you've been doing this over the last couple of years. What's the right way to think about that opportunity on kind of the operating margin side in the OpEx portfolio as we go -- as we get even into the next few quarters?\nJoe Binz: Yeah, thanks Alex. This is Joe. Let me start with sort of our view of H2 on OpEx and then I'll touch directly on your question around the points of leverage we see from an OpEx and cost management perspective. We'll see OpEx growth rates accelerate in H2 and this is really driven by two factors. One is the ongoing growth and investments in our core strategic priorities. Those are things like cloud and enterprise and artificial intelligence, ITSM, and the other core markets that we're in. And the other thing is more mechanical, it's we're lapping the benefit we received in H2 last year from the restructuring and lower bonus expenses. You've heard me talk about our philosophy overall on OpEx management. We continue to focus on maximizing return on every dollar spent. We're focused on making disciplined prioritization and resource allocation calls and driving operational efficiencies as we gain scale. I'd say the other factor to keep in mind that's over time, not necessarily in the immediate future, is on the other side of the significant multi-year investments in cloud and enterprise capability, we will have the opportunity to reallocate that investment to other areas that will drive long-term growth. And that will be another potential point of leverage for us as we think about it. In terms of gross margin, in general, gross margins will track with the revenue mix. Cloud gross margins structurally obviously have lower gross margins than our licensing business. So as that becomes a bigger mix of our overall revenue, that will put pressure on gross margins blended. At the same time, the mindset we have on cloud gross margins is to derive consistent year-over-year improvement through the great investments we're making on the engineering side to optimize cloud infrastructure to improve support. And so again, you're right, we're going to make big investments on post sale activity to drive deployment and usage and engagement. And then we're going to have an opportunity to redeploy that and become more efficient over time. And that will be part of that story. So that's the general framework on how we're thinking about both the cloud [cog] (ph) side as well as the OpEx side going forward.\nScott Farquhar: Alex, maybe I can just add a small bit of color from an engineering point of view. Look, philosophically, I think all world-class engineering organizations in any large SaaS or SaaS type company should be working on continuing to optimize engineering costs. As you're running, as we are, an incredibly large cloud platform that's now geographically diverse, as you see from all the data residency improvements and other things, there are opportunities to save money effectively by running things more efficiently over time and some of that learning comes from scale, some of that learning comes from deployment, some of that learning comes from new technologies. We certainly have a large investment as a world class, world leading R&D organization in continuing to do the things we did last quarter, cheaper, better, faster and more efficiently. Sometimes that money is returned, as Joe said, in the finances. At other times it's invested in other things. So it might be we learn how to do things more efficiently and run systems and services more efficiently that then allow us to do things like Data Residency in a global sense. Other times in things like Atlassian Intelligence, a lot of the AI features, it's about getting the features out first and then working out how to cost optimize over time as we watch customer usage patterns, we can work out how to scale and make that more efficient. So certainly something in engineering we spend a lot of time working on and we've had great results over the last two to three years. As our cloud platform has grown increasingly more complex, but also that gives us more leverage.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Brent.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. On Atlassian Intelligence, I believe it's GA now, I'm curious if you could give us a sense of what we're seeing, what you're seeing, and then ultimately the monetization path in AI. And I guess one of the questions we're getting is if you're seeing a faster move to DC versus cloud, does this slow your AI adoption pathway down or not?\nScott Farquhar: Brent, I'm glad I can take that one. I was worried about you all not asking an AI question until well into the call. Just checking you're all okay there. Look, high level, Atlassian Intelligence and AI generally is a huge advantage for Atlassian. Like, we deeply, deeply believe that. It's a company that focuses on knowledge workers and unleashing the potential of every team. It's a company that has a huge amount of data that customers have entrusted us with. The ability to remix, summarize, and give that data back in different forms to customers using a lot of these large language models and machine learning technologies is incredible. It's very exciting in terms of what we can deliver. As you mentioned, the initial Atlassian Intelligence feature set largely went GA during the quarter. It has had fantastic customer reception. There's no other way to say that. We saw that when we announced it at Team 23 last year in Las Vegas, and we've continued to see that as we've worked with all of the early access program and then beta customers and now being in GA. The ability to change how people do work in non-technical teams and in technical teams is just an unlock. Where we talk about our mission to unleash potential of every payment. It's literally doing that in fantastical ways. We had more than 20,000 customers that used the features during the beta period, which for us, as far as the beta goes, is sort of off the charts in terms of interest, which is fantastic. And as you mentioned, we do see server and increasingly more of a data center customers, it being a factor in their movement, right? It being a factor in their migration. There's a clear logical understanding among customers that the large language model driven and machine learning driven features are based in the cloud, which means that the customers move to the cloud in order to get access to those features. And it is another reason in a whole tapestry of reasons why customers are looking to move and we've certainly seen really great adoption of those features so far. Really excited about Atlassian Intelligence. Really excited about virtual agents in Jira Service Management, continuing to just drive straight efficiencies for customers and again driving that movement up to premium enterprise editions as we've talked about beforehand. And lastly, as I mentioned earlier, Loom AI and the Loom intelligence features that we shipped last month, again, driving great adoption of Loom because it's a different category than the other Atlassian Intelligence features, but the ability to create and consume video more efficiently is really quite fantastic using some of these technologies. So I don't think our excitement could be higher and our commitment and the amount of resources we're spending in R&D to do this equal to the best in the world is paramount for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nAri Terjanian: Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Strength in deferred revenue performance was notable. I was wondering if you could help unpack how much some of the newer initiatives around step-up credits, dual licensing, hybrid ELAs, as well as Atlassian Advisory Services help drive the strength in the larger enterprise deals there. And how should we think about some of those newer programs flowing through to revenue over the coming quarters, meaning to the extent there was dual licensing, how does that flow through to DC and cloud? And similarly, advisory services, how does that flow through to revenue, be it showing up in other or cloud or DC? Thank you.\nJoe Binz: Yeah. Thanks, Ari. This is Joe. You're right. We were thrilled with our billings performance in the quarter. It was higher than we expected and was a record for the company. As you mentioned, you see this performance in our [indiscernible] revenue balance, which accelerated to 30% year-over-year growth. You'll also see it in the remaining performance obligations, which increased over $1.9 billion. The outperformance there this quarter was driven by great sales execution that we talked about earlier and that resulted in several large multi-year agreements. And those are the agreements that you were referencing, hybrid ELAs, dual licensing, they're having a material impact on our ability to grow our business in the enterprise space. I'd say the way you're going to see that show up is primarily in the form of migrations because a lot of that is targeted at establishing those relationships with our customers over multiple years. Many of those customers are using data centers as a stepping stone until they're ready to move to the cloud. It shows up both in a data center and in our cloud revenue. It grows from a P&L accounting perspective. And we basically attribute revenue based on the relative list price between those two. So it's roughly 50-50, give or take, between those two things as you think about the mechanical accounting of it.\nOperator: Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I will now turn the call over to Mike for closing remarks.\nMike Cannon-Brookes: Thanks everyone for joining the call today from wherever you join in the world. We really really appreciate you being here. As always also appreciate your questions and continued support of Atlassian and analysis. A small note, we look forward to seeing all of you hopefully at Team 24 in Las Vegas at the end of April. And with that, have a kick-ass weekend."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon and thank you for joining Atlassianâ€™s Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Investor Relations section of Atlassianâ€™s website following this call. I will now hand the call over to Martin Lam, Atlassianâ€™s Head of Investor Relations.\nMartin Lam: Welcome to Atlassianâ€™s first quarter of fiscal year 2024 earnings call. Thank you for joining us today. Joining me on the call today, we have Atlassianâ€™s Co-Founders and Co-CEOs, Scott Farquhar and Mike Cannon-Brookes; our Chief Revenue Officer, Cameron Deatsch; and Chief Financial Officer, Joe Binz. Earlier today, we published a shareholder letter and press release with our financial results and commentary for our first quarter fiscal year 2024. The shareholder letter is available on Atlassianâ€™s Work Life blog and the Investor Relations section of our website, where you will also find other earnings related materials, including the earnings press release and supplemental investor data sheet. As always, our shareholder letter contains managementâ€™s insights and commentary for the quarter. So during the call today, we will have brief opening remarks and then focus our time on Q&A. This call will include forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions. If any such risks or uncertainties materialize or if any of the assumptions prove incorrect, our results could differ materially from the results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements we make. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements represent our managementâ€™s belief and assumptions only as of the date such statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise such statements should they change or cease to be current. Further information on these and other factors that could affect our business performance and financial results is included in filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time-to-time, including the section titled Risk Factors in our most recently filed annual and quarterly reports. During todayâ€™s today, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are in addition to and are not a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in our shareholder letter, earnings release and investor data sheet on the Investor Relations section of our website. We would like to allow as many of you to participate in Q&A as possible. Out of respect for others on the call, we'll take one question at a time. With that, I will turn the call over to Scott for opening remarks.\nScott Farquhar: Thank you for joining us today. As you've already read in our shareholder letter, we've been busy. We kicked off FY â€™24 by executing well and playing the fence. We continue to push hard on our biggest bets, cloud, enterprise, and ITSM, and those bets continue to pay off. We're also shipping ever more new products and innovation to our customers. This quarter, we launched Compass into general availability. This is on the heels of launching Jira Product Discovery last quarter, which is off to a fantastic start with several thousand customers already. I was just at a high-velocity IP service management event here in Sydney when we announced the general availability of virtual agents in Jira service management and debuted a host of additional AI capabilities. We heard from some of our credible customers who shared how they migrated their legacy ICSM solutions to Jira Service Management and are now delivering exceptional service experiences faster than ever. Through our cloud platform, thousands of customers through our early access program, are already realizing value from the AI capability to be introduced across their cloud products powered by our last-gen intelligence. The early feedback has been terrific and we're incredibly excited by the opportunities that AI presents us. Along with the organic innovation happening here at Atlassian, we also announced our acquisitions of AirTrack and Loom. AirTrack builds on our previous investments in IT service management, and will enable enterprises to better account for and trust all their critical assets within their organizations. Loom, which has a passionate customer base of 200,000, will bring the power of asynchronous video messaging to the Atlassian platform. We firmly believe distributed work is here to stay, and Loom will allow teams across the globe, or even in the same building, to collaborate seamlessly and deeply human ways. People are increasingly turning to video as a way to collaborate and consume information. And we're incredibly excited about the opportunities that video can be applied across our platform. Our customers are looking to Atlassian to provide them solutions in the collaboration space and Loom gives us an incredible opportunity to further unleash the potential of their teams. We're also playing offense on talent. Atlassian is the cornerstone of our success and we're focused on adding and retaining amazing talent across the company, including great senior leaders. We recently welcomed Zeynep Ozdemir as our Chief Marketing Officer and Vikram Rao as our Chief Trust Officer. And we promoted Kevin Egan to Chief sales officer, all of whom bring great experience to our leadership team. I also want to acknowledge Cameron, as this will be his last earnings call with us. Mike and I are incredibly grateful for his 11-years of dedication, impact, and most of all, friendship. With that, I'll pass the call to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nRyan MacWilliams: Appreciate you guys taking the question. I'd love to just double click on the timing of remaining migrations. I think at this point, there might be a little more server revenue, so on the model than investors expected. So any expectation for like when those remaining migrations will move over and the composition of those remaining customers, like are they more likely to go to data center or cloud from here? Thank you.\nCameron Deatsch: This is Cameron. I'll take the first here and then I'll have Joe follow-up. So as many of you know, we have the server end of life coming up the next few months, mid-February. We will cease all support for server customers after that date. And over the last few years, we've been actively, aggressively going up to all of our customers across server and data center attempting to get them to the cloud. And this has been very positive for us. It's gone very in line with our plans over these few years. But obviously there are many customers out there that will wait till the last moment before they make this decision. And we see that today in our enterprise pipeline, we have healthy pipeline with enterprise migrations going up over the next few months. As far as what I want to make sure that is very clear here is post February, we still will have many migrations. So many customers between now and February will be going from server to either data center or preferably cloud. But for those customers that choose data center, we will continue to be migrating those data center customers to the cloud in the coming years. So the short answer there is, yes, we do expect to see a flurry of activity over the next few months with that big compelling event in February, but migrations will continue post the February date. Joe, you have anything to add?\nJoe Binz: Yes. Thanks, Cameron. Ryan, really no change from what we discussed last quarter in terms of the server and the support dynamics that are baked into our guidance. As Cameron mentioned, we end support for server products in 2024. There may be significant quarter-to-quarter variability, as Cameron mentioned, based on when and how those server customers ultimately choose to migrate. We continue to assume the percentage split on migrated seats between data center and cloud will be relatively consistent with historical trends up to that end of support moment. And then with end of support, we continue to expect most of those remaining server seats that migrate, will migrate to data center and we continue to hold prudent assumptions to account for customers who will choose not to migrate in FY '24, and that's also factored into our guidance. I hope that helps.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Karl Keirstead from UBS. Please go ahead.\nKarl Keirstead: Just ask about your observations about the macro. I think every investor on the line is seeing some challenges across the space with, I'd say, a bit of a skew towards some pressure in the SMB space. Could you talk about the trends you're seeing, SMB versus enterprise? And then perhaps elaborate on the seat growth comment you made in the prepared remarks.\nJoe Binz: Yes. Great question, Carl. Thanks for asking. You recall by the end of Q4, we were seeing signs of improvement and stabilization in SMB and a very healthy enterprise environment. Those trends continued into Q1 and played out largely as we expected during the quarter. Now keep in mind, Q1 is typically not a big quarter for us when it comes to large enterprise deals, and we have significant revenue mix from SMB. Now having said that, there's really nothing unusual or noteworthy to call out in the relative Q1 performance between those two customer segments. In relation to the cloud aspect of Q1, the trends we saw in Q4 continued into Q1, and those were also largely consistent with what we expected. The cloud business does continue to be impacted by pressure on paid seat expansion and free-to-paid conversion at the top of the funnel. Although we continue to see some signs of stabilization as the rate of deceleration in those areas continue to moderate slightly. The other parts of our cloud business migrations, upsell to higher-priced versions, cross-sell, customer churn, those all continue to be very healthy and perform in line with our expectations. And then from a linearity perspective, linearity in the quarter is what you'd expect to see, and the trends and impacts were fairly consistent across products, regions and verticals. I hope that color helps.\nScott Farquhar: Also just to add on there at the risk of three people answering one question. One of the tailwinds we've seen is consolidation. We are actually seeing that across the market, more and more of the conversations I'm having with customers large and small them trying to simplify the number of tools that they are using out there. And because Atlassian is so mission-critical, we are one of the vendors that they turn to, to consolidate on. A good example of that was Domino's, pizza that runs 4000 stores across sort of Asia Pac and across the world actually. And they consolidated 6 tools down to 1 Jira Service Management installation, and we're seeing that more and more across the customer conversations.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Joe. Just on Karl's question on the overall macro. In terms of linearity, was there anything different that you saw throughout the quarter? Or was that also pretty consistent to your comments about what you've seen in the last quarters, a few quarters between SMB and enterprise? And also, if you could just add on many of you're kind of asking about close to $1 billion for Loom. Kind of what was the magic sauce, if you will, that drove that type of price point in the desire to complete that transaction?\nJoe Binz: Thanks, Brent. I'll address the first part of your question regarding linearity in the quarter, and then Mike will pick it up on the Loom question. Linearity in the quarter was exactly what you'd expect to see. So there was nothing unusual or strange about Q1 from a linearity perspective overall. Mike?\nMike Cannon-Brookes: Sure. Joe, I can handle that. Hi, everyone. Look, from a financial point of view, we think Loom is a great acquisition for Atlassian. The strategic rationale always comes first for us in this particular case. It is a product that's leaning into a lot of trends that we think are working really well from the point of view, firstly, distributed work and the increasing desire for asynchronous collaboration across lots of different businesses. Secondly, just the shift in the way that people are sharing and consuming video in the enterprise, specifically at the younger generation, become more a part of the workforce. And certainly, AI is changing the way that video can be created and consumed in really interesting ways that I think it will make it more a part of the formats that we all collaborate on and work over time. From a financial rationale, look, the business itself and the product of Lorne is going to continue as a stand-alone individual product, as we've said. As Scott mentioned in his remarks, over 200,000 customers now, it's got a fantastic brand, and it's the leader in that space and is a fast-growing standalone business in and of itself. Secondly, we believe for ourselves, there's obviously a lot of opportunities in video and combining our video infrastructure team with Loom's video infrastructure team. We have video as a first-class citizen across our platform family of products today. But obviously, the long capabilities will improve that in each of our spaces, whether that's in service management or in broad business collaboration or, of course, in software teams. And lastly, there's obviously an opportunity for us to combine products, as you've seen us do a little bit already with Atlassian together to cross-sell Loom as a product into our existing base of more than 265,000 customers. So, we think it's a fantastic deal. We're super excited about the product we've been customers of it for a long time. I know think it can do great things as part of the Atlassian family.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nKash Rangan: Hi, thank you very much. Nice to see the stability in your end markets. I was curious to see, what do you think about the data center growth rate at 42%. It seems to be outpacing the Cloud, probably should be flipped the other way. I'm sure you would like that, and we would like that too. Any refined thoughts on how you view the data center business growth profile? And the things you might be doing incrementally in terms of functionality for the cloud product that would make it more of a compelling value proposition for the customer to go cloud as opposed to server products? Thank you so much and thatâ€™s it.\nJoe Binz: Yes, Kash, this is Joe. I'll start. You're right. It was another strong quarter for data center at 42% growth. That was slightly ahead of our expectations, and it was driven by really strong renewals, migrations from server and seat expansion with an existing customers. It's worth noting we're growing a significant installed base on data center, which is a great stepping stone to the cloud for those who are currently blocked for moving to the cloud at the moment. And it's a good sign of how committed customers are to the Atlassian road map and platform. And having a big installed base on data center is a high-class problem to have because that will fuel future migrations to the cloud. Cameron?\nCameron Deatsch: Yes. I've had dozens of conversations with many of our largest customers about this exact decision that many of them are making. And the reality is we see having both cloud and data center as a long-term competitive advantage. For Atlassian, we provide optionality for these customers in the coming years. As far as the functionality perspective, the good part is, there is very few customers where we have not been able to handle all their scale, their data requirements, their privacy requirements, their compliance requirements, or their needs for customization to cloud. So rarely is there a technical conversation where customers can't go to cloud. It's really just are they ready? Can we move the migration? Where is that -- where are the stat in their business? And is there the compelling functionality to move them over. In every one of those conversations, the customers understand cloud is in their future. It just comes down to the timing to get them over. But either way, an investment in data center investment in cloud is a longer-term strategic investment in Atlassian to get them further committed to Atlassian. And I know and we've shown with our track record that we can and we'll move data center customers to the cloud along with their business needs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Fred Havemeyer from Macquarie. Please go ahead.\nFred Havemeyer: Hey, thank you. Good to be catching up on this call. I wanted to focus in on how you're thinking about AI overall as an overarching strategy. And I can't fail but notice, of course, your new Chief Marketing Officer has a PhD in Machine Learning. A number of your product offerings you're describing, of course, including Loom, being able to integrate generate AI-related summaries. Just it seems like there's an overarching theme here? Of course, you spoke to a part of it, but from top to bottom, it seems like you're trying to become more like an AI-focused company as well. So perhaps, could you elaborate on that? And just how you think of the ongoing Atlassian branding and what value might be marked? And perhaps being more of an AI-first company. Thank you.\nMike Cannon-Brookes: Thanks, Fred. Look, I can take that first, and then Scott can follow-on. Yes, certainly. Great observation. I'm not sure if you or ChatGPT observe that, but Zenith does have a PhD in machine learning. She's also our CMO and fantastic that will obviously be in addition to her capabilities in AA marketing, but obviously not the singular reason for bringing on board. Look, I think AI we couldn't be more excited by AI and live language models at Atlassian, right. We take the view that it's a huge opportunity for us for a number of different reasons. I think, in each of our markets, this technology transformation will be a huge change in the ability to deliver value to customers, which is where great software businesses are built. We have a lot of very valuable data from our customers that we are the custodians of. And a lot of that data is textual and increasingly, video and audio effectively becoming text with AI. So we have a lot of their data, which is really important in AI to be able to give them fantastic answers or magical experiences. Secondly, we have a fantastic platform that we spent a lot of time building. So you see that in Atlassian Intelligence features that we've already shipped. Our ability to shift those features to all the products in the family simultaneously is a result of new on a decade of building a cloud platform, having the customers' data centralized having singular editor and UI surfaces. So our ability to get features out to customers, we're incredibly, incredibly bullish on beyond just our ability to build them. And thirdly, obviously, with our world-class engineering team and our R&D capabilities, this is a technology transformation. And so you need to fundamentally build new products or build additions to existing products or build features or change the way features are built. That takes a lot of internal R&D and expertise, and we have that in space. So we feel incredibly excited about what AI can do for our customers fundamentally and what value we can deliver. Look, we're in the business of amazing products and delivering the right customers. It's like someone has given us a whole new painting set to paint with a whole new set of materials that we can create out with. And so we're extremely excited. We are certainly placing that at the center of our philosophies on building products. I think that's what software companies are doing. I'm not sure when people say, AI first company exactly what that means, but we are certainly heavily investing in our AI capabilities, all of the governance and privacy and responsible technology principles that are required to do that well for customers and give them the right data providence when we give them answers of any form. But also making sure that we deliver those capabilities and that we are investing in and how we can do that. And this is going to take a few years to play out, but we're certainly really, really excited. Scott, anything you'd add on to that?\nScott Farquhar: Yes. Just a couple of things. We all know that AI is driven by unique data sets, and you can provide unique experiences when you have unique data sets. And if you look at what like has done over the decades we've been in business and the data we have, it's a really unique advantage for us. Firstly, our products are opened by default, which sounds like a simple thing, but -- if you want to train AI on data inside your organization, is that data can't be isolated to a few people. And if you use Confluence, you, as one of our customers, you have decades' worth of data that's available to train their AI on and help them make decisions. That's a really big part of our advantage. The second one is that we have breadth across what we do in terms of the workloads and what people use our products for span the entire organization. And that allows us to do very unique data sets to make decisions across the entire organization. And lastly, that also includes third-party products. We've talked about our open tool chain for a long time. And if you're a single vendor that just does one thing, you can provide information about that one thing. But because our open tool chain spans everything across an organization, we can provide experiences and AI insights that span your entire organization. And so I think those are all really interesting. And then while the vendors work on a little bit about their AI features. We're out there delivering them on our platform, and we're super excited about what we deliver on a regular basis. And we just got a cadence of those things coming out to our customers on a regular basis. And so we're head down delivering the value to our customers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nGregg Moskowitz: Hey, thank you for taking the question. I had a follow-up on cloud migrations. You mentioned in the shareholder letter that the number of user migrations over the past year has risen by nearly 50%. And certainly, it's a high growth rate, but I think the increase was more like 2 times a couple of quarters ago. So I'm wondering, is this change in growth just a function of law of larger numbers and tougher compares? Or is it also reflective of a much smaller opportunity set or even a slowdown in the appetite of customers to migrate to the cloud?\nCameron Deatsch: Yes. This is Cameron. I'll take the first-half of this and Joe add anything if he seems fit. The reality is that we've had ever since we have announced the server end of life, which was a little a little more than three years ago. now we have increasingly quarter-on-quarter, raised our number of migrated seats that come across the board. But of course, we saw some huge jumps depending on different times along that journey we've had based off of either our loyalty discount programs or price changes along the way. As you remember, over the last few years, we've built in these compelling events. We have customers reasons to migrate throughout the years and the customers that migrated earlier, we're financially incentivized to do so. Faster the numbers that we are dealing with now are quite large and they continue to grow significantly quarter-on-quarter. And I believe as we go into the next few months with server end of life, many of the customers who've waited until the last moment will be making these decisions to get the data center cloud, and there will be a lot of energy around that. The good part is all of our customer-facing teams, our partners, our migration experts, you name it are more than capable of handling any influx we get in the next few months as customers wait for the last minute to make their choice on whether to go to data center or cloud. And as I've already mentioned, post February, we will continue to have migrations continue to be a large part of our business as we move data center customers to cloud in the coming years. Joe?\nJoe Binz: Yes, Cam. The only other thing I'd add, Greg, is we do expect FY '24 to be a very big year for cloud migrations. We've guided to 10 points of cloud revenue growth coming from migrations for the full-year. Just to reiterate what Cam said, that's really driven by two factors. We do continue to invest and make terrific progress in enabling and unblocking more and more customers to the cloud. Our tooling, our support, our cloud capabilities get better every day. And then the second point to reiterate what Cam said, is we do have the server end of support moment in February 2024, and that will also contribute to migrations growth.\nGregg Moskowitz: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Turrin from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great. Thanks, good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. Joe, maybe one on margin. You raised the margin outlook fairly meaningfully. The 20% implied is now close to where you ended last year. Can you just help level set where you are from an investment perspective, how much opportunity do you see on the cost management side. And if there are priority areas for us to be focused on as the server migration end approaches, and maybe some resources free up as a result. That's also useful. Thank you.\nJoe Binz: Thanks, Michael. You're right. The stronger-than-expected operating margin performance in Q1 and our guide in Q2 was driven by greater operating leverage. And so we are seeing that primarily on the operating expense side. In terms of operating expenses, I would say it's been a team-wide effort focused on a few core principles. We're focused on maximizing the return on every dollar we spend, making disciplined prioritization and resource allocation calls and driving operational efficiencies as we gain scale. As a result, the savings are really broad-based across all groups from developer productivity and cloud COGS optimization to G&A and everything in between. So it's happening across all teams, and we've made good progress to-date. And I do think it's important to note while we do this, we continue to make the disciplined strategic investments in areas like cloud migrations and enterprise and AI in our core markets to drive durable long-term growth and serve customers. In terms of the long-term trends, you're absolutely right. We've made significant multiyear investments in building out our cloud platform and building out our enterprise-grade capabilities. We do expect that those growth rates and those investments to moderate as we make tremendous progress against that over the next year or two. So that's definitely an additional area of leverage that we should see in the model over the coming two years.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Peter Weed from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. Note, I think you did a great job of mentioning the strength in premium and enterprise edition upsells. But I didn't notice any conversation about cross-sells, new functionality for things like JSM that had been such a powerful growth engine recently. How has cross-sells been progressing? Any change in propensity to adopt new product, or hear I think from some other companies, we're hearing some end-of-year strength with strong pipeline. Do you see some increasing interest here and optimism for strength at the end of the calendar year? Or how are things going with kind of cross-sell, particularly JSM, I would say.\nJoe Binz: Yes, thanks. I'll take the first part of that question, and then Scott will chime in. Cross-sell is absolutely a key driver in our cloud revenue growth rate model. We see a lot of opportunity to sell, to cross-sell additional products into existing customers. That continues to be very healthy. I talked earlier about the fact that that's been one of the areas of our cloud business that has held up really well and been resilient through the macroeconomic environment that we've experienced. In terms of pipeline, I would just say, in general, our Q2 pipeline is very strong, and that's a function of everything that we've talked about that's held up well to date. It's the migrations, it's the cross-sell. It's the ability to upsell our customers to premium and enterprise additions of our products. So we're excited about that, and we're looking forward to a great Q2. Scott?\nCameron Deatsch: I'll take that for you, Scott. This is Cameron. Yes, the well I reiterate the pipeline, the strength we see in enterprise today on our healthy pipeline is not just migrations, but it also includes Jira Service Management. We continue to see Jira Service Management's expansion within our customer base. Nearly 50,000 customers are on Jira Service Management today across all sizes, whether that's small customers, as well as we're increasingly seen some large wins in larger enterprise customers with competitive replacements of legacy tooling. I believe this is only going to continue to be strong as we continue to deliver new innovations like we spoke about earlier today with the virtual agents. And our merchant acquisitions to continue to innovate in the ITSM space. So that is a major focus for us. I also do want to highlight that many of our customers, actually one of the most exciting things about talking about customers about getting to migrate them over an enterprise is a lot of the new capabilities we've launched in our existing products, whether that's white boarding and Confluence, new automation capabilities, analytics capabilities, but we've also launched new products this year. Jira Product Discovery, is getting a lot of attention within our customer base, and we've seen that getting rapid adoption within kind of the early adopters in our customer base. So very excited about that. And just over the last couple of weeks, we launched a new product called Compass. Focused on really hard core developer user base and really have a new innovative experience to help developers manage their complex services platforms. So I'm really excited across the board. Strength in Jira Service Management, but one, we can't lose sight of the many other products that many of our customers are very excited about. And in cloud, the reality is it's just way easier for them to adopt those products. they can simply just turn them on, add them to their environment and get value out of them. So by the time we come around and have a sales conversation, many of them are already understanding the value that these products are providing to them.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ari Terjanian from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nAri Terjanian: Yes, hello. Thank you for taking the questions. We noticed some incremental carrots, so to speak, during the quarter around dual licensing, step-up credit, six-month free trial for cloud. Could you speak to some of those efforts? And if they're providing any lift or also maybe potential dilutive impact on the revenue?\nCameron Deatsch: Yes. This is Cameron again. I'll speak broadly just to everything we've done to incentivize customers to migrate in the past few years. And it's a -- as I continue to say is, when we announced the server end of life three years ago, we had a carefully engineered set of programs to incentivize customers to migrate to the cloud sooner than later. This was a combination of pricing incentives with loyalty discounts extended trials, so that customers could start using cloud at no cost and get used to it, understanding comfortable with the new functionality. Or, of course, when customers purchase cloud to ensure that they can continue to run their on-premise environments like data center during the migration experience, knowing that migrations take different extended periods of time. So we override, all these were well planned, engineered from day one and have them part of our migrations forecasts for the last few years. So we continue to roll those out all the way up to the server end of life in February. The goal really being to make it as easy as possible for customers who want to get to cloud to get the cloud as quickly as possible.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jacob Roberge from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJacob Roberge: [Technical Difficulty] work and work management. And do you ever see that the potential to combine that with Atlassian together? It seems like you're planning to offer it as a stand-alone product off the bat, but could Loom gets integrated into that suite over time?\nScott Farquhar: Yes Jack, I think I missed the start of the question. So tell me if I'm answering the wrong question here. I think the first-half didn't come through. The question is interpreted as, Could LUM get integrated into some sort of a work management suite or bundle over time, like we've done with Jira Work Management, Confluence and Atlassian together. So I hope I'm answering the right question. That certainly is a distinct possibility. As I mentioned, there's a number of ways that we're looking to continue to monetize and grow Loom on as a result of the acquisition. One of those is certainly just Loom by itself as a stand-alone product. It has a significant audience already. It has some really good viral properties and growth factors to it and we think we can help continue that movement forward. Second, certainly monetizing video across our audiences and improving, you might think about it as a competitive position of Confluence, it's a better video features, right? But thirdly, you're certainly looking at different bundles and opportunities in our customer base. I think you can be sure that we will do that thoughtfully when we come to looking at work management or ITSM. I don't forget there's a significant video component in knowledge bases and helping employees to and potential to share quick things either from the customer to the agent or from the agent back to the customer. So we will continue to look at possibilities of bundling and putting it into things like Atlassian together, yes. But our upfront goal will be to focus on integration and firstly, continuing the great growth rate of Loom as a stand-alone product, which is a fantastic business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Bachman from BMO. Please go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: Many thanks for the question, Cameron. I think this is for you, if I could. When you talk about the conversion help the cloud of 10 points I was wondering if you could offer some commentary around what is that same metric? How much help is going to data center? And then for each of those, what happens after February 15? Any kind of guidepost on how we should be thinking about the conversion help for the customers that may be ongoing past the Feb 15 deadline. Any kind of commentary on how much conversion will help post that 15? Many thanks/\nCameron Deatsch: Yes. So one thing for clarity, so the 10 points of growth we mentioned is for our cloud business. That's just what came to the migrations and being clarity on where that growth is coming. So, and of course, as Joe already mentioned, a large portion of the data center growth today is simply server to data center conversions. All of that pricing is actually available on our website. You can see across all tiers. You can see what existing server renewals are and what the existing data center list prices are going forward. Now that's the.\nKeith Bachman: Sorry, Cameron, that wasn't my question. My question is how much, what's the same metric for data center. So of the growth, how much contribution are you getting from conversions?\nCameron Deatsch: Joe, you want to address that?\nJoe Binz: Yes, it's about 15 points to 20 points.\nKeith Bachman: And then what happens to those two metrics after the end of life of server, do you think? Any kind of just directional barometers you would want to provide?\nJoe Binz: I would say, in general, what you should expect post server end of support is, obviously, the server to data center migrations will start to decline. That's going to be a big driver of why we expect to see the deceleration in data center in the second half of the year. We haven't quantified specifically what that curve looks like. And a lot of it will depend on what the customer purchasing behavior is around that server end of support moment. How many of those seats move to data center, how many of those seats move to cloud and the timing on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Fatima Boolani from Citi. Please go ahead.\nFatima Boolani: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to talk about the cloud SKUs and the pricing increases that you've undertaken in the cloud suite of products and solutions, in addition, it seems that every October, like clockwork pricing goes up by 5%. So Joe, maybe the question is for you. How is that being contemplated in your guidance for the year. And as an added layer, can you speak to customers who migrated to cloud in the past, in the recent past, who are perhaps on loyalty discounts? And what that cadence of getting these customers on loyalty discounts up to MSRP, if you will, how that's being considered in your cloud guidance? And then a quick follow-up, if I may, please.\nCameron Deatsch: This is Cameron. Let me just address pricing directly on the cloud. As you mentioned, we did have filed price increases go out this October, very much in line with the previous cloud price increases that we rolled out in October. As you mentioned, for our customer base, this is largely granted no customers like price increases, but it is from all the purposes of non-event. Customers are, understand that these are a regular price increase that comes from Atlassian and relatively minimal at the, roughly, as you mentioned, 5% rate going forward. Of course, we have many customers. Our primary goal here is to continue to migrate many of our existing on-premises customers over to cloud. So it's always allowed us, you've always been very considerate about whether that pricing dynamic on our cloud list prices, compared to on-premises customers. As you already mentioned as well, as part of the last few years, we offered loyalty discounts, which basically discounts off of list price for cloud over the last few years, and customers are on, many of the customers are on one year or two year contracts in cloud. When those contracts come up for renewal, they will be coming up at list price, whatever list prices at that time. The good news of all of those customers understand that dynamic when we speak to them about the loyalty discounts and these programs. And more importantly, since most of them are on have plenty of, annual or two-year contracts. They have plenty of time to plan accordingly for what their renewal will be.\nJoe Binz: And then thanks, Cam. The question in terms of the guidance. As Cam mentioned, the effective price increase is roughly 5% blended. That's a good rule of thumb to use as you think about the impact that is built into the guidance. And do keep in mind, whenever we make these price changes, it takes a while for it to layer into the model simply because they're effective when the agreements are signed and that happens over the course of time is for our annual multiyear agreements.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Derrick Wood from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nDerrick Wood: In the shareholder letter, you guys mentioned that cloud sales from your channel was up nearly 2 times year-over-year. And when I look at your total cloud growth of 27%, that suggests that your partners are really generating a tremendous amount of your cloud growth and perhaps your own channels are a bit softer. Has there been a shift in go-to-market strategy to call out that's causing a higher mix of growth coming from your channel partners?\nCameron Deatsch: Yes, I'll take that one. This is Cameron. So first off, we see that as a very, very good news. As all of you know, Atlassian's channel, our solution partner network is a critical part of our overall go-to-market and has been for all 11-years I've been here and even longer than that. The dynamic you're seeing with the partners' cloud growth in the recent months largely comes downside with our enterprise business. We have, many of our enterprise customers have large enterprise migration needs. All of them usually when they take on a large migration are looking for some sort of technical or consulting health. And this is where our solution partners can provide direct access, plenty of expertise and honestly derisk the migration when it happens. So we have very much tied much of our enterprise go-to-market, not just with our direct sales, but joint sales with our solution partners to make those migrations happen. And that's why you're seeing the outperformance in our channel cloud sales over the last couple of years. I also want to add, it's not just the channel. It's the reality is we've unlocked a ton of new capability in cloud as well as unblocked many customers because of the scale data privacy and compliance capabilities that we've released in the last few years, which only opens up our channel partners and the biggest customers that they are serving continue to open up those doors to have them sign up for new migrations contracts.\nDerrick Wood: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mark Cash from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nMark Cash: Hey, thanks for taking the question. This is Mark on for Adam. I wanted to circle back to the consolidation trend and Atlassian together. We're now a couple of quarters after announcing the offering. So could you first comment on the adoption if it's helping drive cloud adoption? And if the plan of seeing organizations expand seats across buying centers is actually playing out so far. Thank you.\nCameron Deatsch: Okay. Yes. This is Cameron here. Apologies for the confusion there. Listen, Atlassian together is a key strategy to address what we see out there in the market of a variety of project management tools and used by different departments and different teams across the board. And we went to meet many of our customers, many of them are looking to try and standardize and consolidate on a single vendor to manage their teamwork needs. And when we looked out to the competitive offerings and what our customers are looking for, we realized we had a massive advantage with the broad suite of Atlassian products, not just Jira Work Management, including Confluence, new products like Atlas. To allow for customers to have a broad set of use cases supported by a variety of tools versus having, from a single vendor at a significantly lower cost. We come out with many of those customers over the last year have made those decisions and are very happy migrating off of the other Federated sets of tools to the Atlassian Work Management Solutions. Now that's it, we are still, as you mentioned, a few quarters into this. It's still relatively early days in that offering, but we're definitely resonating with the overall demand for consolidating on teamwork tools. and platforms and going at Atlassian has been a massive advantage there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Keith Weiss from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKeith Weiss: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I wanted to squeeze in two, if I can. On different topics. One on just overall customer count, it seems like another relatively smaller than what you've seen historically, customer ad quarter. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the trends that you're seeing with customer accounts and into the free-to-pay migration. But also you took away the disclosure of actually like a point number of the number of customers. Just Atlassian has been like a price times quantity of like you add a lot of customers and then you make those customers bigger over time. Just wondering about like why to take away that disclosure. You're only halfway to your 500,000 customer goal. Why not give the specificity on a go-forward basis?\nCameron Deatsch: This is Cameron, I'll address the first-half of that and then hand off to Joe. So as you mentioned, as we saw over the last year or so, we saw the new customer number declining, largely as we saw free to paid conversion rates slow down. Now that said, we still continue to get plenty of customers coming in to our website, many are signing up for free instances and are using free versions of our products, and that only continues to grow year-on-year, but we just saw them being slower to get out their credit card or hit their 11 user mark into that paid cohort. Good news, as Joe had already mentioned earlier, we are starting to see stabilization in that overall impact. And actually, we saw increase from Q4 to Q1 in that net new customer number, largely due to improvements that we have made in our funnel, specifically around the commerce and conversion experience, just simply making it easier for these free customers to purchase our products. Now that said, there's still plenty of uncertainty out there in the market, but seeing that stabilization and slight improvement quarter-on-quarter, we see as largely positive in Q1. Joe, do you want to speak more to the numbers of those?\nJoe Binz: Yes. Thanks, Cam. Keith, we will continue to provide the total customer number on a directional basis. So, that will continue to be provided. We are also adding a new KPI that really goes to our strategy, and we believe this will help investors track progress against that strategy. We are increasingly focused on moving customers, existing customers to the cloud and driving expansion within that massive base, and as we pointed out in the shareholder letter, this goes hand-in-hand with our strategy of driving breadth and that total customer number. So we are introducing an additional customer KPI for investors that we will report on a regular basis and to track our progress against this. And that's specifically the number of customers with over $10,000 in cloud ARR. At the end of Q1, as you read in the shareholder letter, we had over 40,000 customers that met that profile growing 18%. And the reason we think this is a valuable metric is because this represents over 75% of our cloud revenue. So giving investors both the breadth and the secondary metric around shift to cloud and expansion, we think, gives them a great picture holistically of our strategy and our execution against it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Turits from KeyBanc. Please go ahead.\nMichael Turits: Hey, guys. Maybe we can talk about JSM. One of the things that I thought was interesting at Team '23 was that movement to templates as a way of taking JSM beyond just the IT department in the other areas of enterprise. Perhaps you can talk a little bit about the success there and how much non-IT take rate you're starting to get with JSM?\nScott Farquhar: This is Scott here. That's something we're very excited by is the fact that we get really excited thinking about how health happens across an organization. It's typically a frustrating experience for sort of a matter where you sit in the organization, getting help from another team can be quite a frustrating experience. It's often mediated in slack or e-mails and you have to search for that information to actually get something done. And while we see IT teams being sort of the forefront of making that a better experience. The more forward of our customers are saying, why is that not the case also for our legal department to get a contract reviewed? Why is that not the case and I want something to my HR department? And, so as a result of that and building the features there, as you mentioned, with temples, 60% of our JSM customers now use JSM outside of IT. And I think you can see more and more of that. We're particularly excited because at a price point and with our usability, I think we have a better opportunity than any other vendors in this space to go beyond the traditional IT help desk. And so yes, we're really excited about that, and I'm glad you've recognized it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. A couple of questions for me. First, can you give us an update on work management and your progress there in the field? And whether that part of the business is affected more by slower freight to paid conversions. And the second question relates to the migration. It seemed like as part of your prepared remarks, you suggested maybe I got this wrong, that you expect some customers not to migrate? Can you give a little bit more color on that, have you already heard from customers that they intend to not migrate at all and just move elsewhere or leave without support? If you can give us more color on the magnitude of that cohort? Will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.\nCameron Deatsch: This is Cameron. I'll speak to the work management side of this and slightly to the migration piece, then hand off to Joe. So yes, listen, work management is a key part of our overall offerings. And just remember, the products that we put in there our Confluence, our second largest product, and we have massive adoption across our customer base, and massive usage and has been a key part of our SMB, as well as our enterprise business. And many of the new functionalities we drive in Confluence, whether that's the whiteboarding capabilities, automation capabilities, you name it, have been key compelling drivers for migrations themselves. Adding our other offerings like Jira Work Management, which allows for much simpler business-friendly projects tied to your Jira usage is a great way to extend from those technical development and IT teams into these other business use cases and projects, and we've seen significant adoption of those Jira Work Management project templates. We have a new product called Atlas allowing you to basically communicate the status and updates on who is working on projects and the status of those projects and the goals and OTRs associated with them, regardless of where the work is happening. And as we already mentioned, Atlassian together, bringing all those products together in a single offering at a competitive price, allowing customers who are looking to consolidate their work management tools onto a single platform for Atlassian. So absolutely a critical part of our go-to-market going forward and part of our overall financial picture over the last year. As far as the migrations themselves, the server customers, there is a significant portion of server customers who have yet to decide to move to data center or cloud. And we are working with, every single one, I'll tell you right now is definitely aware of this February date. And we will hopefully ensure that we guide them to either a cloud or data center decision post February. As far as going to alternatives or so on, really, we haven't had many of those conversations or see any spike. The migrations process has been very much in line with our plans and continues to be month-on-month. Joe, Mike, do you have anything to add?\nJoe Binz: Yes. Thanks, Cam. In terms of the question on guidance, there is, as Cam mentioned, a server cohort that will not migrate to data center or server in FY '24. And we factored that into our guidance. We based that on an analysis of our server customer base, the trends we're seeing, the customer profile, the surveys that Cam mentioned. So we have accounted for that. We have a prudent assumption to account for that, and that is in the guidance itself.\nMike Cannon-Brookes: I can just add one or two more points on work management. Ittai. Firstly, I think we continue to see value in being quite unique in the market in bridging technical and non-technical teams across the work management space. It's important to note that our three markets don't exist in isolation. They each have unique sales motions and unique target personas, but they are intimately connected in a lot of different ways. For example, you might have marketing teams in Trello that need to connect to engineering teams and operations teams that live in Jira Software, for example, that uniqueness is a really good, a differentiator for us at the moment in the market. Secondly, with things like Atlassian Together, has been mentioned earlier in the call, consolidation on those spaces is a big part of things, and you've seen that with execution so far, but also with the Loom and with the other things that we are delivering and adding to that space. Again, Loom will sit in the work management area as far as Atlassian is concerned. So just wanted to be clear that we are pretty steadfast in our commitment to work management. We think it's a huge opportunity for us, and we're not waffling around at all.\nOperator: Your next question comes from DJ Hynes from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.\nLucas Morison: Hey, this is Luke on for DJ. Thank for taking the question. So I'm going to dovetail off of the other questions around migrations after end of life. I'm wondering if you can comment just sort of how much flexibility do your customers have to extend beyond that deadline? How difficult is it for them to continue using those products once they're no longer supported. And then how long could it take for those remaining migrations to actually play out?\nCameron Deatsch: This is Cameron here. A couple of different dynamics of that question. But first off, will customers, will we extend support to server customers post the server end of life? And the answer there is no. Those customers that gave those customers basically 3.5 years heads up to make this decision, and we're definitely holding by that. That said, if a server customer comes by, just so you know the server licenses are perpetual licenses. So their software will continue to work. They just simply will not be able to get maintenance patch updates, new functionality or any support from Atlassian support teams. So we'll continue to function just fine. But once again, those customers eventually are going to want to have new capabilities or had something that they need support from and they'll call us up. Now if a customer does call us up, a few months after the server end of life. They're on a server unsupported license and need to help move into the cloud. we absolutely will help them move to the cloud as long as they decide to purchase a cloud license. And with that, we're happy to have the technical conversation with them to help them move their server licenses up to cloud and whatever technical discussion is required. But that is the only place where we will, to engage those sort of customers, is if they have decided to purchase cloud itself.\nScott Farquhar: I'd add on to that, stepping back at the macro level. We've had a couple of years now where we've been focused on migrating our customers with a compelling event of server end of life. But at a macro level, half of the migrations we're getting are from data center. And so that figure doesn't turn off come February next year or if that's going to continue to be there. And we're continuing to invest in migrating customers across and we continue to invest in making our cloud platform better and better. That's both attracting new customers to cloud and of course, continuing the migrations from data center. So these are investments that like over time, will plateau and we'll start getting our peak migration investments will, at some age start decreasing, and we also say where more and more of our customers are in the cloud. And if you think about the innovation that we can bring in cloud because of the platform we've got there, that's what I get really excited about. Our ability to bring new products to market is way, way, way faster in the cloud, and you've seen that with our product discovery, you've seen that with Atlas with Compass, with Jira Work Management, which is easy for us to get our customers to migrate from Jira Software and give that nose user in the HR department or in the marketing department to study in Jira Work Management to track their work. It's easy to put Jira Service Management into these customers and cross-sell there. So the ability for us to both build new innovation in the cloud is way higher, particularly because we built this cloud platform that we've talked about and you've seen and the reason we can bring AI to all of our customers and all of our products, so quickly is the investments we've made in this cloud platform. And as we hit peak migration, like we'll be out a bit more and more asset behind building new things in this platform. And of course, acquisitions worked really well as well. The fact that we've got these new customers in clouds is way easier to introduce them to Loom than it is for a behind-the-firewall customer out there. And so I'm super excited. I know we've focused a lot on migration historically, and I know it's really important and it drives a lot of kind of people spreadsheets about how they think about the business. But the more customers we have in cloud, the more innovation we can deliver, the better we can cross-sell our customers, the easier it is for us to get more incremental users inside our inside of products then go wall to wall. And so I'm really excited about more I looked around the opportunities we have and particularly in this moment when customers are coming up for consolidation and they're talking to us and saying, \"Hey, I got to get rid of plenty of other vendors out there because you're mission critical \"and you do things that no one else can. And, you've got a lot of analytics that allows me to show how work moves across my entire organization. They are great conversations to have. And migration is great, but the real benefits are going to come on the far side of those migrations. And I think that's worthwhile pointing out.\nOperator: Thank you. That's all the questions we have time for today. I will now turn the call over to Mike for closing remarks.\nMike Cannon-Brookes: Yes. Look, thanks, everyone, for joining the call today. As always, I appreciate your thoughtful questions and continued support. It'd be a bit remiss of me not to thank Cameron for his 11 years of amazing dedicated support friendship and everything else, ending as our Chief Revenue Officer jointly over the last few years. So just from me and from all of the team, thank you to Cameron before he heads off to his rocking chair and his fortune in retirement, and we hope he really enjoys that. Secondly, on the heels of our high velocity event that Scott talked eloquently about earlier. We have Unleash, which is our agile and DevOps market event next month in Amsterdam. And we'll be hosting a virtual ESG forum, both of which investor, sorry, the virtual ESG Forum is later this month, both of which investors are welcome to please. We hope to see you there. And beyond that, we hope you have a kick-ass rest of your day. Thank you for being here."
