Morgan Ben Budish - Barclays Michael Cyprys - Morgan Stanley Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs Adam Beatty - UBS\nOperator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to StepStone's Fiscal Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are on a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentations, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today, Mr. Seth Weiss, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSeth Weiss : Thank you and good afternoon, all. Joining me on today's call are Scott Hart, Chief Executive Officer; Jason Ment, President and Co-Chief Operating Officer; Mike McCabe, Head of Strategy; and David Park, Chief Financial Officer. During our prepared remarks, we will be referring to a presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website at shareholders.stepstonegroup.com. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call as well as the presentation contains certain forward-looking statements regarding the company's expected operating and financial performance for future periods. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current plans, estimates and expectations and are inherently uncertain and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results for future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, due to changes in circumstances or a number of risks or other factors that are described in the Risk Factors section of StepStone's periodic filings. These forward-looking statements are made only as of today and except as required, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of them. Today's presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, our presentation and our filing with the SEC. In addition to our financial results, we filed an 8-K that details an agreement under which StepStone will buy in the non-controlling interests of the infrastructure, private debt, and real estate businesses over time. Scott and Mike will provide commentary in their remarks. Turning to our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, beginning with slide three, we reported a GAAP net loss of $23.4 million. GAAP net loss attributable to StepStone Group Incorporated was $20.2 million or $0.32 per share. Moving to slide four, we generated fee-related earnings of $50.7 million, up 19% from the prior year quarter, and we generated an FRE margin of 33%. The quarter reflected retroactive fees resulting from interim closings of StepStone's Private Equity Secondaries Fund, StepStone's Multi-Strategy Global Venture Capital Fund, and StepStone's Infrastructure Co-Investment Fund, which in total contributed $8.6 million to revenue. There were no retroactive fees in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Finally, we earned $42.1 million in adjusted net income for the quarter or $0.37 per share. This is up from $31.2 million or $0.27 per share, in the third fiscal quarter of last year, driven by higher fee-related earnings and higher net performance fees. I'll now hand the call over to StepStone CEO, Scott Hart.\nScott Hart : Thank you, Seth, and good afternoon everyone. We delivered solid performance in our fiscal third quarter, generating robust earnings, fundraising and asset growth, setting StepStone up for continued success in 2024 and beyond. As Seth mentioned, we are also excited to announce that we have entered into agreements to acquire the remaining stakes in each of our infrastructure, private debt, and real estate businesses over the coming years. Mike and I will provide additional detail later in our comments. Beginning with our results, gross new commitments were $6 billion in the quarter. While the slower capital market conditions of the last two years have created a more challenging fundraising backdrop, we've continued to engage with existing and prospective clients who remain very constructive on the private markets and more specifically, many of the strategies that StepStone is able to offer. This quarter represents the fruition of many of those conversations and reflects the strength of our client relationships, many of which we've cultivated over decades. We continue to have a strong pipeline for fundraising across both new and existing clients. As we have commented in the past, we believe fundraising should be evaluated over a multi-period horizon. The dynamics of our business may result in episodic inflows, particularly in separately managed accounts, where we raised $4.3 billion this quarter. However, as managed accounts largely pay fees on deployment rather than commitments, the contribution to fee-earning AUM and fee-related earnings tends to be steadier. Additionally, because of our strong retention rate, which is greater than 90%, our separately managed account relationships are extremely sticky and provide meaningful revenue visibility. Shifting to commingled funds, we generated gross inflows of $1.7 billion. We closed on $625 million in our private equity secondaries fund, where we have raised approximately $3 billion to-date. We also had additional closes in our special situation real estate secondaries fund, our multi-strategy global venture capital fund, our infrastructure co-investment fund, and our multi-strategy growth equity fund. We continue to see strong momentum in our evergreen private wealth products, where we raised over $300 million of subscriptions for the quarter and over $1 billion in subscriptions for the last 12 months. We are excited to further expand our private wealth platform with our recent filing of the StepStone Private Credit Income Fund, or what we are calling CredEx [ph]. This is an interval fund for U.S. investors. The fund will focus primarily on U.S. direct lending and specialty credit, and will deploy capital through co-investments and secondaries. Like SPRIM, our all Private Markets Fund, and STRUX, our Infrastructure Fund, CredEx will allow for daily subscriptions and will be investable via a ticker. We believe that the combination of bespoke separately managed accounts, commingled funds, and our growing suite of private wealth offerings drives a sustainable pace of growth that will allow us to achieve the goal we set out at last June's Investor Day of doubling fee-related earnings by fiscal 2028. The strength of our platform creates a powerful flywheel, which helps propel StepStone forward. But our most important asset continues to be the people that work so diligently to enable our success. To that end, I'm thrilled to highlight StepStone's recent recognition from pensions and investments as one of the best places to work in money management. We are a fast-growing multinational asset manager with capabilities across the private markets. We have made a concerted effort to develop a strong, distinct and unified culture at StepStone by embracing our diversity in both backgrounds and capabilities. Our success has been and will continue to be dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain talent. Now, turning to the economic integration of our asset class teams, we are thrilled to announce that we have entered into agreements to purchase the non-controlling interest in each of these businesses over the coming years. As a reminder, when we made the strategic decision nearly 10 years ago to expand our business from private equity into infrastructure, private debt and real estate, there were a couple of things that were clear to us. We needed to build large, experienced senior teams who had built their careers in each of these asset classes to maximize our combined success. And we felt that offering equity ownership in the businesses that they were building would be critical to attract high-quality teams and incentivize a type of entrepreneurial behavior that has made StepStone itself a success. Since the time of our IPO three years ago, we have been consistent in telling you three things. First, this structure has been working well and has had its intended result. As we outlined during our Investor Day last June, the infrastructure, private debt, and real estate businesses have been on a similar trajectory to that of our private equity business during its first 10 years. We attribute much of that success to the quality of our team and the incentive structure driving their behavior. Second, there has always been a shared vision that as these asset classes continue to scale, we would execute an equity exchange to improve our alignment for the next phase of StepStone's growth. And third, any transaction will be done on an accretive basis for our shareholders. We believe that the transaction agreements we’ve entered into achieve all of this and more while benefiting all stakeholders. The structure will continue to incentivize our asset class teams to drive growth in their businesses, while improving StepStone's ability to participate in that growth. The long-term nature of the agreements help ensure that there will be no disruption to the client experience. The transaction creates a path to 100% ownership and reduces complexity over time. An evaluation mechanism, which Mike will describe in more detail, ensures an accretive transaction. We worked incredibly closely with each of our asset class heads, James, Marcel, and Jeff, and their teams over nearly a decade, and we look forward to the next phase of our partnership in the years ahead. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mike, who will speak to our growth in the quarter and will provide greater detail on the buy-in of the non-controlling interest.\nMike McCabe : Thanks, Scott. Turning to slide seven, we generated $17.5 billion of gross AUM inflows during the last 12 months, with over $11 billion coming from separately managed accounts and over $6 billion coming from commingled funds. Slide eight shows our fee-earning AUM by structure and asset class. For the quarter, we grew fee-earning assets by $2.1 billion. While most of the net growth came from our commingled funds, we had positive gross contributions in both commingled funds and separately managed accounts. We experienced $1.7 billion of distributions, including a large distribution of approximately $1 billion from our infrastructure managed account, offsetting the gross AUM contributions, resulting in a flat fee-earning AUM growth within our SMAs. This is consistent with the expectation we set out on our previous earnings call and represents a relatively low fee-paying mandate. We had a record-breaking quarter on two important operating metrics. First, we increased our undeployed fee-earning capital or UFEC, to over $21 billion, our highest level ever, which points to the future earnings power of StepStone. This increase comes from a strong SMA fundraising, particularly re-ups alongside some of our longstanding relationships. Our $21 billion UFEC includes $2.4 billion of commingled funds that are already raised and will be activated over the coming quarters, including $1.5 billion in our VC secondaries fund, which we anticipate activating in the middle of this calendar year, and approximately $900 million in our real estate secondaries fund, which will come off fee holiday at the beginning of March. Second, we generated over $300 million of inflows this quarter on our private wealth platform. On the grounds of this success, along with feedback from our distribution partners, we launched our infrastructure product, STRUX, this past fall, and as Scott mentioned, we recently filed CredEx, a private credit fund we expect to activate later this year. Slide nine shows the evolution of our management and advisory fees. We generated a blended management fee rate of 58 basis points over the last 12 months, higher than the 54 basis points for the last fiscal year as we benefited from retroactive fees. We produced over $4.90 per share in management advisory fees over the last 12 months, representing an annual growth rate of 22% since fiscal year 2019. We generated an FRE margin of 33% for the quarter, which also includes the benefit from retroactive fees. As a reminder, we expect our FRE margins will continue to expand from a combination of operating leverage and strategic cost-saving opportunities. We executed on one such initiative this past quarter with the sale of our non-core subsidiary, Greenspring Back Office Solutions, or GBOS. We acquired GBOS as part of the Greenspring acquisition in 2021. GBOS was the fund administration platform for our venture capital funds, as well as a select number of third-party VC funds. We sold GBOS to the team, who will continue to run the business, now branded VIRIDIS, and will service our VC funds as our third-party administrator, consistent with our operating model. The run rate net benefit from this transaction is expected to increase fee-related earnings by $2 million annually. Before handing the call to David, I would like to take a moment to discuss the structure and timeline of the buy-in of the non-controlling interests mentioned by Scott earlier. We filed an 8-K this afternoon, which includes the full transaction agreement, but I'll outline a few of the key points. As you are likely aware, StepStone currently owns 100% of our private equity business and roughly 50% of the infrastructure, private debt and real estate asset classes. The agreement we announced today pre-wires a systematic buy-in of the interests that StepStone does not own over the coming years. We deliberately structured this as a gradual exchange to ensure our teams remain incentivized to grow their asset classes. The primary consideration for these buy-ins will be StepStone equity, thereby maintaining an important alignment of interest with a smaller portion in cash. The first exchange is expected to take place this summer, subject to customary closing conditions, and will account for approximately one-tenth of the 50% of the business owned by the infrastructure, private debt and real estate teams. We plan to execute subsequent buy-ins of approximately equivalent size each year with the option to accelerate the remaining full exchange after five years if mutually agreed. As Scott mentioned, each exchange will occur on an accretive basis, with each buy-in occurring at a discount to the prevailing step multiple. As a result, the rate of growth of income attributable to NCI should begin to slow and eventually go away as we accumulate full ownership. I'd now like to pass the call over to our recently appointed Chief Financial Officer, David Park. We've had the pleasure of working with David side-by-side as our Chief Accounting Officer since 2019. David.\nDavid Park : Thank you, Mike, and I look forward to having the opportunity to work with all of you in the investment community. I'd like to turn your attention to slide 11 to speak to our financial highlights. For the quarter, we earned management and advisory fees of $152 million, up 18% from the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by growth in fee-earning AUM across commercial structures, as well as $8.6 million in retroactive fees. Fee-related earnings were about $50.7 million for the quarter, up 19% from a year ago. We generated an FRE margin of 33% for the quarter, up 250 basis points sequentially and consistent with the prior year period. Moving to expenses, total cash and equity-based compensation expense was $74 million, down $1 million from the prior quarter. The decline was primarily driven by adjustments to our cash bonus accrual in connection with our annual bonus cycle. Looking ahead to our fiscal fourth quarter, while the sale of GBOS, which closed on December 31, will result in compensation savings, we expect to see an increase in overall compensation expense from our fiscal third quarter due to merit increases taking effect on January 1. General administrative expenses were $27 million up $4 million sequentially. Included in this quarter were expenses associated with our StepStone 360 Private Markets Conference. We will host our Annual Venture Capital Conference later this month, so expect to see a similar level of expenses in the next quarter. As a reminder, our G&A expenses tend to be seasonally highest in our fiscal third and fourth quarters due to these annual investor conferences. Gross realized performance fees were $33 million for the quarter, up $14 million from last year and $26 million from the prior quarter. This period's performance fees reflect $15 million of realized carry and $18 million of incentive fees. Unlike carry, for which investment realizations drive the timing of revenue recognition, most of our incentive fees crystallize annually. The $18 million of incentive fees includes $9 million for spring, with the remainder from private equity and the infrastructure mandates. Our fiscal second and third quarters tend to be seasonally stronger for incentive fees in periods of positive market appreciation, given spring's annual crystallization in our fiscal third quarter, as well as other mandates that are recognized in these periods. In terms of performance fee-related compensation, comp tied to our private equity funds have a roughly 50% payout ratio, while compensation related to our private wealth funds tends to have a higher payout ratio. Moving to slide 12, management and advisor fees per share grew 18% for the year-to-date period and 22% over the long-term period since fiscal 2019. Gross realized performance fees per share were down 56% for the year-to-date period and up 11% over the long-term period. Adjusted revenue per share was flat for the year-to-date period as growth and management advisor fees largely offset the decline in performance fees. Over the long-term period, adjusted revenue per share was up 20%. Shifting to profitability on slide 13, we grew FRE per share by 17% in our first three quarters. The increase was primarily driven by growth in management and advisory fees. Looking over the longer term, we have generated an annual growth rate an FRE per share of 29%. Year-to-date ANI per share is down relative to last year driven by lower performance fees, but has increased at an annual rate of 24% over the long-term period. Moving to key items on the balance sheet on slide 14, net accrued carry finished the quarter at $569 million, up 6% from a year ago, driven primarily by underlying valuation appreciation. As a reminder, our accrued carried balance is reported on a one-quarter lag. Our own investment portfolio ended the quarter at $188 million. Unfunded commitments to our investment programs were $96 million as of quarter end. Our pool of performance fee eligible capital has grown to over $70 billion, and this capital is widely diversified across multiple vintage years in over 200 programs. 75% of our net unrealized carry is tied to programs with vintages of 2018 or earlier, which means that these programs are largely out of their investment periods and in harvest mode. Of this amount, 53% is sourced from vehicles with deal-by-deal waterfalls, meaning realized carry may be payable at the time of investment exit. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it back over to the operator to open the line for any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. One moment for our first question. Our first question comes from the line of Kenneth Worthington of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nKenneth Worthington : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First, on the SMAs. So, $1.1 billion made into commitments in the fee-paying AUM. If I heard you correctly, I think you said $4.3 billion of fundraising that would eventually flow into fee-paying AUM over time. So maybe first, you entered the quarter in SMAs, I think with $56.7 billion of SMA fee-paying AUM. How big is the total asset pool that's going to migrate into fee-paying AUM over time? And I guess over what period would you expect that migration to take place? I guess that's where I'd like to start.\nScott Hart : Sure, thanks Ken, for the question. This is Scott. So a couple things in there. I think one, just thinking about what we think was a very successful quarter from a fundraising standpoint across our SMAs, that, as Mike touched on, was largely driven by strong re-up activity across our client base, as well as some new client additions as well. As we think about how much of the current undeployed fee-earning capital will convert into fee-earning AUM over time. It's really largely driven by the $21 billion of UFEC Mike referenced. Of that, about $2.5 million is in commingled funds that will activate over the next couple of quarters. The majority of the rest of that undeployed fee-earning capital is in the form of separate accounts. As a reminder, our separate accounts tend to pay on invested or deployed capital, whereas the commingled funds tend to pay on committed. There would be some commingled funds in that number, but largely driven by separate accounts. And we'd be consistent in our guidance around how to think about the deployment of those vehicles. We've always talked about it being deployed over a three year to five year time period, and that continues to be consistent today.\nKenneth Worthington : Okay, thank you. And haven't made it through the 8-K, so apologize if this is in here. So on the buyout of the NCI for real estate and for real -- and credit, you said one-tenth of the 50% goes this summer. What is the cadence of the continuation of that buyout? Is it 1⁄10 a year? Is it happening every quarter? What is the cadence of what we should expect, and when does that sort of wrap up?\nScott Hart: Sure, so the cadence will be one-tenth per year over the next 5 years to start. There will be, after five years, the potential to accelerate the buy-in of the remaining interest if mutually agreed, but otherwise would continue on and essentially be done over a 10-year period with one exception, which is that infrastructure could be done over a 15-year period. So yes, all that detail laid out in the transaction agreements, which as you pointed out, we wouldn't have had time to review in any detail at this point in time, but that'll happen on an annual basis with the potential to accelerate after 5 years. Otherwise, base case is being done over 10 years.\nKenneth Worthington : Okay, great. Congrats on getting that done, and thanks for taking my questions.\nScott Hart: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Budish of Barclays. Your line is open.\nBen Budish: Hi, good evening, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe first, can you unpack a little bit more of the incentive fee dynamic? I think that the number was probably a bit higher than most of us were expecting. It was a very helpful color on the SPRIM contribution versus the other pieces, but can you maybe just talk a little bit more about what that cadence should look like going forward? Obviously, it'll be somewhat contingent on performance, but how should we sort of think about that, just given this was obviously quite a good quarter for that, and what should we sort of be thinking through for the next, on a yearly basis, if you can kind of help there?\nDavid Park: Yeah Ben, this is David. Thanks for the question. Our incentive fees are generally tied to programs that either sit outside of steps on vehicles or our private wealth funds. So really, they tend to crystallize annually, and they're really in our second and third fiscal quarters. So if you think about it, Spring was roughly half of the $18 million, and as the fund grows, you can imagine the incentive fee growing in the fiscal third quarter as well. But again, typically you should expect some modest incentive fees over the next couple quarters, but the second and third quarters should typically be the strongest.\nBen Budish: Okay, helpful. And then maybe one strategic question sort of on the retail side. With SPRIM, you were one of the first to market with a sort of broad private markets vehicle. I think versus at least the other public companies we all look at who are a bit bigger and tend to be more concentrated in the wires, you do have a bit of a different distribution strategy. But just, any thoughts on the competitiveness with a private credit fund? It seems like there are more maybe options in the market, but at the same time, you've got some differentiated distribution through like the RIA channel, which is maybe like a little bit less contested. But just, how are you feeling about sort of the competitive environment for that product specifically, just given there are already some other incumbents out there with an offering?\nJason Ment: Thanks, Ben. This is Jason. So as you think about where we are going to have competitive edge in the private – sorry, in the private wealth channels, the credit fund that we are bringing is a multi-manager vehicle, and that compares very favorably in our mind relative to the single manager vehicles, the private BDCs and the like that are out there. In private credit, there is a performance benefit through diversification, through number of loans and number of managers, and we've got white paper research out there on that point. And there is also a benefit from being able to scale deployment with an open architecture model. And so relative to the single manager BDCs, we think we've got space. There is very few comps out there in terms of the multi-manager, though there is one out there that's quite prevalent. What we've done to differentiate there is that CredEx will be a blend of direct lending and specialty credit, as opposed to a pure play direct lending or pure play specialty credit fund.\nBen Budish: Okay, got it. Thank you very much for taking the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thank you. Good afternoon. Congrats on the NCI buy-in announcement. That's great to see. Maybe just to start there, maybe you could talk a little bit about how you approached the valuation dynamics with the buy-in. What sort of mix of stock and cash can we expect to see? Any particular lockups on the stock portion? And what's the sort of expected magnitude of accretion? Thanks.\nScott Hart: Yeah. So Mike, maybe I will start there. This is Scott, and then hand it off to Mike McCabe to touch on a part of the question as well. But first of all, thanks for the comment there and congratulations. We're quite excited about it as are our teams here. So look, the way that we approached the valuation and really the way that we were able to deliver on what we have suggested all along to you and our public shareholders to deliver an accretive transaction with the structure of the valuation at a discount to the StepStone trading multiple. It'll be on a sliding scale depending on exactly where it is that we are trading as a firm at that time. But that's clearly a big part of locking in an accretive transaction. I'll maybe hand it to Mike to talk through just how you ought to think about sort of the second half of your question there.\nMike McCabe: Yeah, great. Thanks Scott, and thanks Mike. Yeah, we're very excited about this as we announced that our IPO and our Investor Day in June of last year, this was a priority. And we've finally reached a stage of scale and team and global footprint across our platform where it made sense to proceed with this mechanism. As Scott mentioned, the buy-in of the NCI will be done at a discount to the prevailing step multiple. And back to Ken's question earlier, it will be done at a cadence of once per year. And just the way the mechanism works is the larger the multiple that StepStone is trading at, the greater the discount. That's the sliding scale that Scott mentioned. You can go into the transaction agreement and conjure up a little more detail, but for the purpose of this call, the range of discount you should expect based on where we're trading could be anywhere between 10% to 30% of StepStones prevailing multiple at the time. In terms of other aspects of the transaction agreement, I would encourage you to go into the document and of course follow up with Seth Weiss with any granular detail after that.\nScott Hart: And sorry, maybe to just touch on one part of your question that I skipped over. I mean the cash and stock component, I mean you should think about the cash being somewhere in the 10% to 20% range really with the remainder in the form of stock. And there will be transfer restrictions on that that would allow the team to sell about a third a year over the first three years, which has been a consistent approach we've used in the IPO, the Greenspring sale, etcetera.\nMichael Cyprys: Nice to see the 33% in the quarter here. And just given some of the changes that you made with selling off the fund admin business, I wonder if there were any other changes as well. I mean, you could just speak to the outlook for the FRA margin. Into the March quarter and also into your fiscal ‘25, do you think we're clearly above 30% on a quarterly basis going forward? And then with the minority buy-in, how does that impact the FRA margin profile over time as I believe the subs operate with a higher margin? What sort of uplifts can we see from that over time?\nScott Hart: Mike, again as we've talked, we've really prioritized investing in the business for growth over time, and our investment in the private wealth platform is one such example. The technology and other areas, as well as our global footprint have been key priorities for us to invest. But we feel we have largely invested in the platform across the organization and expect to see a margin expansion through a combination of operating leverage, as well as some other efficiencies that we think we can capture across the organization. But maybe I'll ask David to comment a little bit on some detail there.\nDavid Park: Yeah, thanks. David here. If you look at our, compensation is clearly the largest expense line item. And we did have some favorability this quarter. If you normalize for the bonus accrual adjustment, you can think about run rate as roughly $75 million. And looking into next quarter, if you layer on merit increases that took effect on January 1, you should largely get there. Looking over time, I think the way we look at it is more on a total comp, cash and equity comp as a percentage of fee revenues and it trended in the low 50% range over the last couple of years. And while this may move, you should see some movement quarter-to-quarter. But we do expect this ratio to trend down gradually over time. Some of the, I guess, movement you're going to see is going to be due to timing of communal fundraising. But again, over time, we do expect FRE margins to trend down over time.\nScott Hart: And maybe to follow up on your second part of your question there, as the buy-in occurs over time, again, we report FRE on a consolidated basis. So don't expect to see margin expansion through these buy-ins per se. But again, I think it ties back to the broader comment about as we scale up broadly as an organization, we should expect to see some operating leverage continue to kick in and add to FRE.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from Alexander Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlexander Blostein: Hey, everybody. Good evening. Just another quick follow-up around the transaction. Mike, can you clarify if you guys are buying all of the earnings or you're just buying FRE or you're doing FRE and carry? And how, if at all, will compensation dynamics at the existing subs or the real estate, infra and debt, how would the compensation change, if at all, for folks that work there? So would they start getting more equity in StepStone? Does anything change in like the carry payout, anything like that?\nDavid Park: Sure. Maybe I'll start with the first part of your question and maybe invite Scott to layer on a few comments as well. But yes, the buy-in is all cash flows, FRE as well as PRE. So its management fees as well as performance fees. And given the episodic nature of how performance fees work, that was really what led to the thesis behind taking a longer-term gradual approach so that we have this cadence of a series of buy-ins that will happen over a period of time, which would smooth out some of the ebbs and flows that we find in the performance fees. And also, as Scott mentioned, the buy-in will be largely equity to just foster that important alignment of interest with some cash. But as far as the underlying compensation to the teams is concerned, maybe I'll invite Scott to share a thought.\nScott Hart : Sure. So no real change, for example, to how carry is treated as carry will continue to go 50% of the team, 50% to the house. Obviously, the ownership of that will change over time. I think the biggest change from a compensation structure standpoint is the ability to increasingly utilize StepStone, RSUs, and stock as a component of one's compensation, consistent with the approach that we've taken really across our team since the IPO. And so going forward, particularly for the investment team, we'll have now multiple levers to pull or components of stock between base, bonus, carried interest, as well as RSUs.\nAlexander Blostein: I got you. Great. Thanks for that. My second question around the secondaries business, it seems to be quite active and the momentum in the market continues to sort of build there for many reasons we talked about. Can you help us frame how much of the $21 billion of capital that's not paying fees yet is sitting in secondary strategies? And when it relates to those specifically, should we expect a little bit of a faster pace of deployment relative to maybe what we've seen in the past, given recent market dynamics?\nScott Hart: Yeah, thanks Alex, for your question. I mean, we've never provided an exact breakout of the undeployed fee earning capital by either strategy or asset class. But what I would tell you is, when we think about the $2.5 billion of commingled funds that will activate shortly, those are entirely secondary funds between our venture capital secondary fund and our special situation real estate secondary fund. But the activation of those will be less driven by sort of this rapid deployment that you talked about. It will be driven by the fee holiday on the real estate fund which will expire in early March here, as well as the completion of the investment of the prior venture secondaries fund, which again we expect sometime middle of this calendar year. As we think about what remains in that undeployed fee earning capital number, again, haven't ever provided an exact breakdown, but secondary is not as meaningful of a component of the undeployed fear in capital relative to some of our co-investment and primary strategies today.\nAlexander Blostein: I got you. That's helpful, color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty of UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good afternoon. Quick, a couple of questions on the NCI buy-in. Great to see the structure laid out and kind of the culmination of that sort of long-term process. So just wondering if there are any contingencies around the performance of the teams in any way, just either around timing or amount or valuation and also a quick clarification around the potential acceleration after five years. Is that like an all or nothing kind of scenario or could it be sort of accelerated without necessarily completing the process? So it would be great to get some color and some details, and also maybe if you could, whether or not you would, to the extent that you did more M&A in the future, whether you would look to have a similar structure or something different. Thanks.\nScott Hart: Yeah, thanks Adam for the questions there. So maybe taking them in order, is there a performance-related component to it? The main part of that is the financial performance of the businesses, which will ultimately drive the value of those businesses over time. And so really our view there is we've come up with a structure that will continue to incentivize those teams to grow their businesses over time and to the extent they are able to or successful in doing that, they will benefit from that performance. On your second question around the acceleration, really any time after the five-year point, if we were to mutually agree to accelerate, that would result in the complete buyout to where we would own 100% of the relevant asset class. It doesn't have to be all or nothing in the sense that you may have one asset class where we mutually agree to accelerate, but not all three. But at that point in time, if there was an acceleration, it would result in us owning 100% of the equity at that time.\nDavid Park: And to answer your M&A question, but before I do, I'll also put a clarification on the first question of contingencies. We also noted in the transaction agreement that if StepStone's multiple were to trade below 16x the contingency, that would pause an exchange in a given year and then resume in the following year. So I want to just clarify that one minor contingency that hopefully is of help here. From an M&A standpoint, I don't think this changes StepStone's perspective on the market. It certainly doesn't affect our capacity or capability to execute on anything strategic in that nature. As we've mentioned, there's a very small amount of cash involved in this transaction, 10% to 20%, that is easily covered by our revolver that we currently have in place. So we feel we have the flexibility and the capital structure to continue to march forward on a strategic front should opportunities present themselves.\nAdam Beatty: That's great. Thank you guys for all those highlights. And then just quickly around commingled fundraise and the outlook there, just wanted to get maybe a high level take on what you've kind of got in the plan for the coming year or two, which vintages might be coming up for a new fundraise and also kind of what you're hearing from LPs at the current moment. Thanks.\nScott Hart: Sure. I mean, certainly in terms of what we are hearing from LPs at the moment, it feels like sentiment is moving in the right direction. I mean, you can imagine with -- for example, the S&P 500 hitting 5,000 for the first time today, and we're not talking as much about the denominator effect. We are still talking about the numerator effect in the sense that the rapid deployment, the strong sort of E-performance and valuations of private markets, portfolios, and the slowdown in distributions does still have some investors over allocated relative to their target allocations. But not only the recovery in the public markets, but views on interest rates and views on the current outlook are certainly meaning that LPs are more willing to commit and transact today. And we've been the beneficiary of that with some of the closings that we referenced during this past quarter, as well as some of the fundraising momentum that we have at the moment. And so as we think about what we have in market at the moment, we do have a number of our key commingled funds and strategies in the market. We're late – in the late stages of fundraising for our private equity secondaries fund, which as we referenced now stands at about $3 billion. Similarly, our venture capital secondaries fund now stands at about $1.5 billion. And those funds will continue to fundraise, but should wrap up in the first half of this calendar year. We continue to raise for our special situation real estate secondaries fund, which has good momentum. Is very well positioned for the current environment and we're in market with other key strategies like our multi-strategy growth equity fund, our inaugural infrastructure co-investment fund, as well as our corporate direct lending fund. So lots of opportunity in the market from a commingled standpoint right now. We'll obviously also continue to be raising across each of our private wealth strategies for going forward here.\nAdam Beatty: Perfect. Thank you for the rundown, Scott. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Scott Hart for any closing remarks.\nScott Hart : Great. Well, thanks everyone for joining us today. We appreciate the questions and the continued interest in StepStone and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the StepStone Group Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Seth Weiss, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSeth Weiss: Thank you. Joining me on today's call are Scott Hart, Chief Executive Officer; Jason Ment, President and Co-Chief Operating Officer; Mike McCabe, Head of Strategy; and Johnny Randel, Chief Financial Officer. During our prepared remarks, we will be referring to a presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website at shareholders.stepstonegroup.com. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call as well as the presentation contains certain forward-looking statements regarding the company's expected operating and financial performance for future periods. Forward-looking statements, reflect management's current plans, estimates and expectations and are inherently uncertain and are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Actual results for future periods may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, due to changes in circumstances or a number of risks or other factors, that are described in the Risk Factors section of StepStone's periodic filings. These forward-looking statements are made only as of today and except as required, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of them. In addition, today's presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, our presentation and our filing with the SEC. Turning to our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Beginning with Slide 3, we reported GAAP net income of $59.3 million, GAAP net income attributable to StepStone Group Inc, was $26.2 million or $0.42 per share. Moving to Slide 4, we generated fee related earnings of $43.8 million up 12% from the prior year quarter. And we generated an FRE margin of 31%. The quarter reflected retroactive fees resulting from interim closings at StepStone private equity secondaries fund and StepStone's multi-strategy global venture capital fund, which in total contributed $3.7 million to revenue, $3.4 million to fee related earnings and pre-tax adjusted net income and 160 basis points to FRE margin. There were no retroactive fees in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Finally, we earned $30.2 million in adjusted net income for the quarter or $0.26 per share. This is down from $37.3 million or $0.33 per share in the second fiscal quarter of last year. Driven by lower net realizations and partially offset by higher fee related earnings. I'll now hand the call over to StepStone's, Chief Executive Officer, Scott Hart.\nScott Hart: Thank you. Seth. And good afternoon, everyone. Despite a number of continuing challenges in the macro environment, including volatility in asset prices, higher for longer interest rates and heightened geopolitical risks, StepStone continued to generate steady results, these results are driven by the breadth of our offering, specialization of our strategies and positive momentum in areas in which we've invested for growth. Although it is a difficult operating environment for asset managers. We believe, we are well positioned in the industry and that we are setting the stage for strong, continued growth in the years ahead. We remain on track to at least double our fee related earnings within the next five years, as we laid out at our Investor Day, this past June. Last month, we hosted the StepStone 360 conference, our annual event for private markets clients and investors. During times like these, our clients have a strong desire to understand the real time trends and developments that we're seeing in the market and in our portfolios. The 360 conference, gives us the opportunity to share our data and insights present on our full suite of products and solutions, and importantly hear directly from many of our clients and prospects. Our clients remain extremely engaged with the private markets and continue to turn to StepStone for help in meeting their long term investing goals. Secondary is a strategy that continues to resonate with our clients in today's environment. While general slow pace of realizations has needed at near-term market appetite for some private market investments, demand for secondaries across asset classes remains very strong and is a key area of differentiation for StepStone. Our deep relationships with general partners, supply a large pipeline of investment opportunities and our superior data and expertise, allow us to identify the best of these opportunities enabling us to buy high quality assets at attractive prices. We are beginning to see greater willingness of sellers to transact as they adjust to the new valuation environment and as other avenues for realizations continue to lag, which should result in an acceleration of our pace of deployment. During this most recent quarter, we executed a successful first close of approximately $1.25 billion in our venture capital secondaries fund. And an interim close of nearly $400 million in our private equity secondaries fund. We expect to activate the venture capital secondaries fund in the first half of our fiscal 2025, while our private equity secondaries fund is active and currently generating fees. Shifting to real-estate, our flagship commingled product is a special situations GP led secondaries fund. As we discussed at our Investor Day in June. The rise in interest rates, coupled with a significant volume of expected maturities in the coming years, creates a substantial opportunity for real-estate recapitalizations, we are a leader in this market and have access to a significant amount of deal flow, much of which we create ourselves. This enabled our investment team to be selective in deploying capital. Encouragingly, we are seeing real-estate deployment opportunities begin to accelerate we have fully committed our prior real-estate secondaries fund and our new fund is now actively investing. This new fund will begin earning fees in this spring. After a five month fee holiday for investors that were part of the first close. To-date, we have closed on approximately $1 billion in this fund. Additional fundraising is progressing well, as we believe investors see our special situations strategy as an attractive means to access, real-estate and one that is particularly well suited for today's environment. The timing of activations, in our real-estate and venture capital secondaries funds, results in relatively modest revenue and fearing AUM growth for this current fiscal year, but provides clear visibility into a meaningful step up in management fees margin and fee related earnings in fiscal 2025. We are also seeing healthy progress in our separately managed accounts. The sales and closing cycle for SMAs, can be long, with exact timing difficult to predict, but we have a large pipeline of both new SMAs as well as re-ups that is progressing well. Included in this quarter's gross additions, were commitments from separately managed accounts for which we've been engaged in discussion for over two years, a testament to the deep relationship building we engage in when partnering with clients. Inclusion of a multi strategy venture allocation among these mandates is yet another example of the synergies from our expanded venture capital capabilities and a proof point that our strategies help solve our client's portfolio goals through market cycles. Shifting to private wealth, the fiscal second quarter was our best quarter ever. With over $350 million of new subscriptions, we've invested heavily in private wealth and these investments are paying off. We anticipate that this will be a significant contributor to operating leverage over time. As we announced in July SPRIM, our core private markets Evergreen fund became available for subscription daily by a ticker. This allows investment in to the fund,, without the need for subscription documents, simplifying the onboarding process and eliminating a substantial point of friction. The ticker had contributed to the acceleration of gross inflows, but encouragingly, we are seeing traction across all of our private wealth products and four pillars of distribution. SPRING our evergreen fund for venture capital and growth equity continues to gain momentum. And in September, we held an initial close of STRUCTURE, StepStone's registered providence infrastructure fund and our third evergreen private wealth family of funds. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that SPRIM has been improved on a second wire-house and SPRING has been approved on its first wire-house in each case with initial inflows expected in the coming months. Another area where we continue to invest in technology and our data science driven portfolio management team and our software engineering team. We've spoken previously about our front-end research and back-end reporting platforms, we have rebranded our applications under one unified and interconnected suite, which we are calling SPY by StepStone. The SPY platform offers research, reporting, pacing and benchmarking applications. This integrated suite is only possible because of the investment we have made in our technology, our people and our relationships with both LPs and GPs. Before handing the call to Mike. I'd like to thank our CFO, Johnny Randel for more than a decade of dedication and leadership to StepStone. Johnny will retire at the end of this year. Johnny joined StepStone in 2010 and has been responsible for building and leading a deep and talented finance team. We are thrilled to announce that David Park, our current Chief Accounting Officer will become Chief Financial Officer, on January 1st. David is already working closely with Johnny on the transition. David has been StepStone's Chief Accounting Officer since joining the company in 2019. Together with Johnny, David helped guide StepStone through our IPO and he's a key leader of our finance team. Johnny, we thank you for your years of dedication, leadership and strategic vision and we congratulate you on your retirement. I'll now turn the call over to Mike McCabe, to speak about StepStone's fundraising and fee earning asset growth in more detail.\nMike McCabe: Thanks, Scott. And I'd like to echo your words of appreciation for Johnny Randel and congratulate David Park. Turning to Slide 7, we generated $15 billion of gross AUM inflows during the last 12 months, with $6 billion coming from our commingled funds and $9 billion coming from our separately managed accounts. Slide 8, shows our fee earning AUM by STRUCTURE and asset class. Fee earning AUM, was flat relative to the prior quarter due to a few moving pieces, this quarter related to activations, as well as step downs that impact the near term timing of our fee earning asset growth and management fees, but do not disrupt our long term growth trajectory. Johnny will provide some commentary on the financial impact. But I would like to take a few minutes to walk through the effect on our fee earning AUM and on our undeployed fee earning capital. First, our venture capital secondaries fund had a very successful first close of approximately $1.25 billion, which currently resides in our undeployed fee earning capital balance. This fund is still in market and we continue to see strong interest. We anticipate further closings over the next six to nine months. We expect that the capital raise this quarter plus additional funds raised hereafter will be activated and become fee paying in the first half of fiscal 2025. We are encouraged to see transactions pickup in real-estate particularly in the secondary recapitalizations and we see significant opportunities for future deployment. As Scott mentioned, our prior real-estate fund is now fully committed to investments. This triggered a step down in the fee base from committed capital to net invested capital near the end of the quarter. This resulted in a reduction of fee earning AUM of $700 million, which is included in the distribution line of our fee earning AUM walk on page 18 of the presentation. Much of the step-down is temporary, driven by the fact that we have committed to but not yet fully funded several investments. The unfunded commitments from this prior fund, amounts to about $400 million and are not yet included in the net invested capital fee base, but are instead included in the undeployed fee earning capital. As these investments, fund through fiscal 2025 the capital will return to our fee earning asset line. Pivoting to our current real-estate vintage, the fund is now actively investing and fees will turn on in late fiscal 2024. We've closed on approximately $1 billion of this fund-to-date and anticipated future closings over the next 12 months. We also had a $1.5 billion worth of distributions from our separately managed accounts, as a reminder distributions include exit activities, expiring mandates and step downs in fee base. About $1 billion of this distribution relates to explorations. Occasionally, as was the case this quarter, these are older mandates that pay on committee capital for life. These mandates typically generate revenue at a lower or stepped down fee rate and at exploration the full capital commitment rolls out of fee earning assets. In these circumstances, there is a disproportionate impact on fee earning AUM relative to revenue. For this past quarter, the management fees that we expect to earn on the $1 billion of managed account contributions will more than offset the fees from the $1.5 billion of distributions. For the upcoming quarter, we expect to see expirations similar in size to this past quarter along with a nominal impact on revenue. These step downs and expirations are a normal course of our business and we will let you know ahead of time when we anticipate them to occur. Shifting to private wealth. We have now surpassed $2 billion in assets under management. To put our growth in context, we first launched our private wealth platform in September of 2019 and crossed the $1 billion threshold in November of 2022. This was a great result for our product suite and distribution network that we built from the ground up. We are thrilled to have grown the platform by another $1 billion in only 10 months, doubling the net asset value in less than a third of the time it took to raise our first $1 billion. Our success in private wealth is driven by progress across our four distribution pillars. RIAs, independent broker-dealers, wire-houses and international. And by the launch of additional funds, such as SPRING and STRUCTURE. Each subsequent fund launch and each expansion of our distribution syndicate is bolstered by a growing brand awareness and by our strong track record of investment performance. SPRIM has generated a 25% annualized return since inception. And SPRING has yielded a 30% return in its first 11 months. STRUCTURE had its initial close in September and is actively investing. Our undeployed fee earning capital increased to $18.1 billion, its highest level ever, driven by a strong initial close of our VC secondaries fund and the dynamics around committed, but not fully invested capital in our private real-estate fund. At least $2 billion of this capital will convert to fee earning AUM, once we activate the current real-estate fund and VC secondaries funds in the coming quarters. Slide 9, shows the evolution of our management and advisory fees, we generated a blended management fee rate of 57 basis points over the last 12 months, higher than the 54 basis points for the last fiscal year as we benefited from retroactive fees and some favorable mix shift over the last 12 months. We produced over $4.70 per share in management and advisory fees over the last 12 months, representing an annual growth rate of 22% since fiscal year 2019. I'd now like to pass the call to our CFO, Johnny Randel.\nJohnny Randel: Thank you, Mike. Before speaking to the quarter. I would like to say a very, very sincere thank you to my colleagues here at StepStone. It has truly been my privilege to work alongside you and I look forward to seeing what StepStone does next. I want to also add my congratulations to David Park. David, has been a great friend, a great partner these past four years and I know that he will be a fantastic leader of the finance organization going forward. Now, I'd like to turn your attention to Slide 11, to speak to our financial highlights. We earned management and advisory fees of $142 million for the quarter up 19% from the prior year, driven primarily by growth in fee earning AUM. Our FRE margin for the quarter is 31%, retroactive fees in this quarter had a positive impact on the margin of 160 basis points. For the trailing 12 month period, we have reported an FRE margin of 31%. Turning to expenses, compensation was up about $5 million sequentially. As we mentioned on the last earnings call, we had relatively limited hiring in our first fiscal quarter. So this quarter reflected some incremental hiring. General and administrative expenses were flat sequentially. But we do expect an uptick in the next two quarters driven by seasonal expenses associated with investor conferences. We just held our StepStone 360 private markets Conference in October. And we will host our Annual venture capital conference in early 2024. As, Scott and Mike mentioned, the timing of fund activations and step downs impact the pace of revenue growth and margin expansion for this fiscal year. The step down in our prior real estate fund will create a headwind on our management fees, while the current vintage fund is on a fee holiday. This headwind, as well as the seasonal increase in G&A expense I mentioned will create some pressure on our FRE margin in the next two quarters. However, we expect this to be temporary as commingled fund raises that we've already closed, but not yet activated gives us clear visibility into a step-up in revenue and margin in fiscal 2025. We currently have approximately $2 billion of capital that has been raised in our real-estate and venture secondaries funds that is not yet activated or fee earning. Once these funds are activated, we expect this capital will contribute over $18 million in annual management fees and have a positive impact on the margin of at least 150 basis points. As Scott and Mike mentioned, the real-estate fund fees from the initial close will activate in late fiscal 2024, and we anticipate the venture secondaries fund to activate in the first half of fiscal 2025. Additional fundraising and deployment across our commingled funds, evergreen funds and separately managed accounts will further contribute to revenue growth and operating leverage in the coming periods. We remain on pace to expand our FRE margin to the mid-30s, over the medium to long term consistent with what we outlined at our Investor Day. Gross realized performance fees were $7 million for the quarter, which is down both year over year and sequentially. As we mentioned last quarter, we are seeing some signs that the realization environment is improving. It generally takes a few quarters for transactions to work through the pipeline, so we expect that realized performance fees will remain modest for at least the rest of the fiscal year. As a reminder, we generally do not control the timing of exit on our investments. Moving to Slide 12, adjusted revenue per share is down for the first half of the fiscal year, we had a 79% decrease in gross realized performance fees per share, partially offset by 18% growth in management and advisory fees per share. Since fiscal 2019, we have grown adjusted revenue per share by 20% compounded annual rate. Shifting to our profitability, on Slide 13. We grew fee related earnings per share by 17% in our first two quarters. The increase was primarily driven by growth in management and advisory fees. Looking over the longer term, we have generated an annual growth rate in fee related, earnings per share of 29% since fiscal 2019. Our, year-to-date ANI per share is down relative to last year, driven by lower performance fees that has increased at an annual rate of 23% over the long term period. Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 14, net accrued carry finished the quarter at $634 million, up 4% from the previous quarter, driven by underlying valuation increases for the period ended June 30th, as a reminder, our accrued carry balance is reported on a one quarter lag. Our own investment portfolio ended the quarter at $188 million, unfunded commitments to our investment programs were $98 million as of quarter end. Our pool performance fee eligible capital has grown to over $67 billion and this capital is widely diversified across multiple vintage years and approximately 195 programs. 77% of our unrealized carry tied to programs of vintages of 2018 or earlier, which means that these programs are largely out of their investment periods and are in harvest mode. 59% of this unrealized carry sourced from vehicles with deal by deal waterfalls in realized carry may be payable at the time of investment exit. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it back over to the operator to open the line for any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBen Budish: Hi. Good evening, and thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first for Scott. You talked a little bit about the pipeline of new SMAs and re-ups, looking robust, but it can take some time to materialize. I wonder if you could unpack that a little, know what are you seeing kind of real time and what is sort of the reason for, I don't know, the delay or what does the pipeline look like in terms of either investor type or the type of assets they're looking to invest in? Any color around that would be helpful. Thanks.\nScott Hart: Sure. Thanks, Ben. For the question. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, pipeline is building and developing nicely. I think one of the changes that we've seen relative to COVID and a couple of years since when much of the SMA activity was really driven by re-ups and expansion of existing client mandates, there has been a very healthy mix of new relationships and new mandates of late as well, particularly when you look at this current quarter, in the last couple of quarters. So that's obviously encouraging and clearly builds the pipeline of future re-ups and potential expansion opportunities. So that's certainly one trend that we're seeing. Second, the driver to your point of perhaps slight delays and re-ups is really driven by deployment, right. It's a matter of fully investing the prior vehicle and coming back around to that re-up opportunity. We have made steady progress there and feel like we have some important re-ups in the pipeline at the moment. And given our continued re-up rate that has been quite successful again north of 90% over time, feel good that, that will convert into new commitments. The last thing I would perhaps mention is that and we made quick reference during the prepared remarks but the presence of venture opportunities, which may come as a bit of a surprise to some of you, I think it is a continued area of interest amongst clients both here in the U.S. and internationally and so we are excited to have a multi-strategy venture mandate in the mix there as well. So, again, given the number of opportunities that we're pursuing, sometimes hard to generalize, but feel good that there is quite a bit of activity and a building pipeline of both new and existing clients in the SMA pipeline.\nBen Budish: Great, very helpful. Maybe one follow-up on the retail side. It seems like things keep trending in the right direction there. You talked about the four kind of channels RIAs, IBD, wires and international. Where are you seeing, I guess, the most traction? What is your expectation as some of the funds. I think you mentioned the SPRIM is going to be added to another wire, SPRING will be added to its first. What do you think the potential size from those new kind of distribution relationships could add and what is sort of the mix right now between those various channels? Thank you.\nJason Ment: Sure. Ben, this is Jason. Thank you for the question. In terms of I guess first geographic areas in terms of the most traction, the team is by far more built out in the U.S. relative to a broad on the dedicated private wealth team and so flows are definitely stronger here in the U.S. today. We expect that will balance out over time as we continue to invest in the distribution partners abroad. In terms of the flows between the products look, SPRIM U.S. is the most seasoned of all the products, it's the largest of all the products to date and so therefore there is a bit of size -- bigger size you're eligible for inclusion by more distribution partners and so therefore that's certainly helpful. And when I look at the kind of day zero comparison, SPRIM versus SPRING. SPRING is off to a very strong start. Clearly the performance there is definitely helpful, at 30% since inception. And so we do expect that to continue to scale nicely. STRUCTURE, it's simply too soon to tell. We're just a couple months in here, but what conversations have been positive.\nBen Budish: Got it. Thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nKen Worthington: Hi, Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. So probably along the same lines, so you announced the release of a daily NAV ticker for SPRIM maybe Scott or Mike, I was hoping you could flush out more on your prepared remarks and give us some progress you're making in terms of the marketing of the new structure? How is education going on the new products for the RIAs. And what is the sales cycle seems like it's developing for this new product with that sort of pre-existing customer base. Is this a three month sales cycle. Is it a year? How long do you think it will take for the fruits of your labor to really become more apparent in the numbers.\nMike McCabe: Thanks, Ken. This is Mike. I think what I might do is invite Jason Ment to address that a bit more specifically since he looks after the private wealth channel.\nJason Ment: Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Ken. On the ticker, I think there it's been welcomed with open arms, certainly by the RIA community in particular. It definitely makes their life materially easier, we expect IBDs to some of them at least use the ticker. I think the wires will be the last there to adopt and don't have real timeline as to when that might be. In terms of the -- let's call it the brand education cross sell. As we look at the different channels, I would kind of cite the following. If I look at the distribution syndicate for SPRIM and this will be all kind of U.S. to U.S. If I look at that syndicate, about a third of those distribution partners have also come into SPRING. And then conversely, if I look at the SPRING distribution base, over two-thirds of those are SPRIM distribution partners as well. So clearly the brand awareness helps. And there's a bit of -- if you like, the StepStone story across private markets you're going to like it in venture and growth specifically. So again STRUCTURE is too soon to tell. But, we'd expect to see a similar pattern.\nMike McCabe: But certainly relating that second wire, something you've been asking about for some quarters now. And we were delighted to be able to announce that this quarter, we expect to see some acceleration of growth across private wealth with this new partnership in place.\nKen Worthington: Awesome. Thank you. And then on SMAs and fee rates. We saw the elevated distributions, you attributed some of this or a bunch of it to step downs and some expirations. As you see this migration from -- of these committed capital contracts should we start to see the fee rate on the SMA side also step up and I don't think we saw this quarter the SMA or the fee rate in SMAs is pretty stable. Is that something that we should see in coming quarters as this trend persists?\nJohnny Randel: Hi, Ken, it's John here. Just let me talk a little bit about that. I think what you'll see over time is, anyone -- fund rolling off won't have much of an impact if we had a series of these over a short period of time, perhaps. But the reality of it is there's just so many SMAs flowing through. There a mixture of rates. It might move a little bit, but we don't expect a dramatic change over time, just given the kind of ongoing pricing of what's in the pipeline and what has been reupping. So we don't expect a material change.\nKen Worthington: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Adam Beatty with UBS. Your line is open.\nAdam Beatty: All right. Thank you, and good evening. Just wanted to take a quick pulse on the Investor Day target of doubling FRE by 2028. Sounds like. the top line, as both Mike and Johnny mentioned, the top line looks to be in good shape, but the AUM has some puts and takes that seem like they're going to maybe even out over the coming quarters. So I guess my question is, over the longer term, say post calendar '24, should we look for kind of AUM growth and fee growth to converge maybe in the high teens, given the target for margin expansion? And if so, what areas do you look to, to be the primary drivers of that through 2028? Thanks.\nScott Hart: Yes. And thanks for the question. This is Scott. Maybe I'll start and Mike may jump in here as well. Obviously, he spent quite a bit of time on this topic during the Investor Day. But a few things, I mean you referenced, some of the step downs and distribution activity that took place this quarter obviously that didn't come as a surprise to us. It doesn't really have an impact on our five year plans that we laid out and one of the things that we talked about during the Investor Day was the fact that there are multiple ways for us for to get there and to achieve those targets. And so as we think about what we're seeing in the business and really the fact that all of the key building blocks for continued growth as it relates to fundraising, continued strong re-ups despite a tough market environment, continue to be there, really the biggest factor in the near term. And as we look at the business just for the quarter has been one of deployment, right. And so, with the slower deployment really driven by overall market activity M&A activity, et cetera being down has resulted in some of the funds that we've now raised or had first closes for not yet activating some of the accounts that pay invested capital investing in line with the three to five year pace that we've always talked about, but maybe a slower pace than what we had seen over the last few years and some of those re-ups taking a bit longer to arrive. But when we think about the business over a five year time frame or really the next few years, I would say no real change to what we talked about on Investor Day. And if anything, feel like with some of the positive news around the private wealth channel, the venture capital fundraising, the progress we've made on different commingled vehicles, feel quite good about the longer term trajectory. But Mike, you may want to jump in with additional thoughts there.\nMike McCabe: That's right. Thanks, Scott. So we feel really good about the way our gross AUM flown for the first half of this year, has developed and we have six more months left in this fiscal year to continue to deploy as well as form new capital. So, on a gross AUM basis we feel really good about our progress. It's the fee earning AUM Adam that you're pointing to where there are certainly some puts and takes as certain mandates either expire or roll off as we bring new mandates onto the platform. And what we're seeing a little bit on the revenue side, as you pointed out correctly, it's still is very healthy and looks good, but there is a little bit of a delay this year which does to your point, make fiscal 2025 a really important year for StepStone across all key metrics. At the timing of activations and the timing of deployment really go live as we enter that fiscal year. I hope that addresses some of your questions here.\nAdam Beatty: No.\nScott Hart: Maybe last -- Adam last thought I would share is I mean look in our view,, right. Our continued ability to meet those longer-term goals. It's going to have a lot more to do with how successfully we invest on behalf of our clients and the great level of client service that we provide more so than whether a fund gets activated, this quarter versus next quarter. And so we're going to maintain that very selective approach, that client first approach that has served us so well over the last 15 years here.\nAdam Beatty: Yes. Back to the touchstone makes sense. Scott, thanks. And then just one follow-up. Scott, actually, you said just a phrase that kind of caught my attention and congrats, by the way, on the Wealth Management Channel getting on the new platforms. It seems like a lot of the work there is coming to fruition. You talked about it contributing to operating leverage and I guess maybe I have a prejudice in my mind, but I always think of the Wealth Management Channel as needing a fair bit of sales effort, needing a fair bit of education effort. I don't think of it as like high leverage, but maybe there's something I'm missing that you can help me with? Thanks.\nScott Hart: Sure. Look -- while that is certainly true. One of the things that we are also offering to clients in that channel is the ability to invest alongside and with the same high degree of quality with our institutional clients. And so when you really think about what we're doing from an investment team and from an investment standpoint, it is really participating alongside of our institutional clients and institutional funds. And that's really where some of the leverage comes into play given how much of the sort of fees drop to the bottom line on the investment side, there?\nAdam Beatty: Perfect. Got it. Now. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Good evening guys. Just maybe I'll piggyback on Adam's question around operating leverage. When it comes to the wealth channel, I believe there is a revenue share or kind of equity ownership share agreement within the channel. As you sort of build it out. Can you give us a sense at what level of assets or revenue base does it start to sort of break profitability and contribute more to the bottom line? Kind of, look on a net basis, sort of like net of minority interest and are we already there and kind of how do you expect that to scale and actually add to the kind of net of minority interest or non-controlling interest, FRE.\nJohnny Randel: Yes, I'll start and then others can add. The reality of it is kind of varies. I mean, I think we are getting there given the scale we've seen and the team we've got attached to it as Scott mentioned there is the investment process, which is a big part of what's we think driving the success in terms of the returns that are being produced that's helped driving the scale. And so when you kind of think about it from a consolidated business perspective, we haven't given specific numbers, but we're kind of in the range. And then from here, that's when you start thinking about kind of that sharing, you mentioned. So the scale and, as Mike talked about doubling it in 10 months. And if that continues, then obviously we do think it can have an impact over time.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Okay. We can follow up, my other question or maybe should have been my first question. I wanted to talk a little bit about the secondaries business with you guys. And Scott, sounds like you're seeing an increased opportunity for deployment there. You mentioned the urgency maybe on part of the sellers to come to market is great today than it's been in the past, given that there's not a lot of exits in the primary market. So help us maybe frame how much in dry powder you guys currently have across your secondaries business, perhaps even including the funds that are currently fundraising. How quickly do you expect to put that to work, given the opportunity set? And maybe just help us think about maybe the frequency at which you could start coming back to markets with subsequent vintages if the opportunities have to continue to improve.\nScott Hart: Yes, thanks, Alex. So, look, I don't think we've put out there an exact number in terms of dry powder that we have across the secondaries business, but if I just kind of break it down and I'll maybe stick with some of the commingled vehicles with some of the incremental closings on the private equity secondaries fund. That fund has now raised nearly $2.5 billion. It has started to invest, but still obviously much of that available in terms of dry powder and has some overage accounts that sit alongside of it. When you think about the venture business, we mentioned the first close at $1.25 billion, which will all be dry powder. But part of the reason we won't activate that fund until next fiscal year As we mentioned, there is still some remaining dry powder in the $2.6 billion venture fund that we raise shortly after the green SPRING acquisition. In real-estate, we've had closings on about $1 billion for the current fund and as we mentioned during the prepared remarks, the prior vehicle is now fully committed and so that kind of gives you a sense across some of our main dedicated commingled vehicles and obviously there's separate account capital both within the private debt and infrastructure businesses that I hadn't referenced as well as in private equity that as that dry powder number. And I think in terms of the pace of deployment, look one of the things, particularly in this type of market environment with some of the risks that exist that we continue to be very focused on is portfolio construction is one of the few things that is completely within our control and so we have taken approach of wanting to build diversified portfolios across a number of different metrics, including across vintage years. And so I would generally expect that these funds are deployed over a roughly three year period in order to achieve that vintage year diversification. So I think that's probably the right way to think about it, recognizing that certain separate accounts may have a shorter or a longer investment period. And maybe last point I would make given how much time we've talked about the private wealth business clearly some of what we're doing in those vehicles is secondary focus as well which would further add to that dry powder number.\nAlex Blostein: Okay, that's great, thanks so much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMichael Cyprys: Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to ask about private credit. I was hoping you could talk about the opportunity set that you see in private credit today, particularly as banks are pulling back. Which of your strategies would you say are best positioned here and which strategies might be able to raise meaningful capital as you look out over the next 12 to 24 months in private credit and I think you have a retail vehicle launching in the credit space as well so maybe you can provide an update on that too? Thank you.\nScott Hart: Yes. So Mike, thanks for the question. I think in the private credit space, we continue to see and hear about quite a bit of interest amongst our existing and prospective clients even during the course of this year. I think the interest as our private debt team travels the world has continued to grow. We clearly view it as a very attractive risk reward when you can think about not only have base rates increased, but spreads have remained fairly consistent. And when you're talking about 12% type gross asset yields investing at the highest part of the capital structure. And when you look at the performance in past downturns, it's clearly a part of the business and a strategy that we think is quite attractive in today's market. The challenge has been, one like I've talked about across the business of deployment with M&A activity down, quite meaningfully, deployment has been slower than we otherwise would have liked, which has meant that we've had to continue to look for alternative deployment methods, that has in some cases meant looking beyond corporate direct lending to areas like real-estate and infrastructure where we think there'll be an opportunity. But also similar to the other asset classes, looking to strategies like secondaries which is one where similar to private equity and venture capital. We think that our position is one of the leading limited partners and one of the leading primary capital allocators positions us very well as a replacement LP or someone to participate in secondary transactions. So that continues to be an active area for our private debt colleagues as well.\nMichael Cyprys: Okay. Thanks. And maybe just a follow-up question on realization backdrop continues to remain soft. As you mentioned, we've been hearing anecdotes from LPs that is starting to create liquidity challenges on their side. Are you starting to hear any sort of pressure points that LPs are pushing GPs to want to find liquidity events, maybe even selling assets at prices that GPs' may not otherwise necessarily want to pursue an exit. Just curious how you're seeing this all sort of play out here as you kind of look out over the next twelve months or so.\nScott Hart: Sure, I think so much of what we've talked about over the last -- call it 18 months has been the denominator effect and the fact that it was really more of an issue of being over allocated. But as the slowdown in distributions has continued now for roughly 18 or so months and you had a period of time which is still true today, where both capital calls and distributions are down relative to where they had been over the last several years. However, I would say that distributions are down meaningfully more meaning that, most LPs are experiencing more capital calls than distributions. And I think you're right that for some, it will start to create some liquidity pressure leading LPs to either tap the secondaries market themselves as a source of liquidity, and as a source of realizations or certainly actively talking to their GPs maybe not so much putting pressure to sell, but letting them know that before they can commit to new funds, they need to start to see some liquidity coming off of their portfolio. And so I think that is a dynamic that is starting to take place in the market place for sure.\nMichael Cyprys: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to Scott Hart, CEO for closing remarks.\nScott Hart: Great. Well, thanks everyone for joining the call today and for your continued interest in the StepStone story. We look forward to continue the conversation in the quarters ahead. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and welcome to StepStone's Fiscal First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Seth Weiss, StepStone's Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nSeth Weiss: Thank you. Joining me on today's call are Scott Hart, Chief Executive Officer; Jason Ment, President and Co-Chief Operating Officer; Mike McCabe, Head of Strategy; and Johnny Randel, Chief Financial Officer. During our prepared remarks, we will be referring to a presentation, which is available on our Investor Relations website at shareholders.stepstonegroup.com. Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that this conference call as well as the presentation contains certain forward-looking statements regarding the company's expected operating and financial performance for future periods and our plans for future dividends. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current plans, estimates, and expectations and are inherently uncertain and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results for future periods and actual dividends declared may differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements due to changes in circumstances or a number of risks or other factors that are described in the risk factors section of StepStone's periodic filings. These forward-looking statements are made only as of today and except as required, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of them. In addition today's presentation contains references to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, our presentation, and our filings with the SEC. Turning to our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Beginning with slide three, we reported GAAP net income of $49.4 million. GAAP net income attributable to StepStone Group Inc. was $21.3 million. Moving to slide four. We generated fee-related earnings of $44.4 million, up 21% from the prior year quarter and we generated an FRE margin of 32%. The quarter reflected retroactive fees resulting from interim closings of our PE secondaries fund, our multi-strategy global venture capital fund, and our infrastructure co-invest fund, which in total contributed $2.8 million to revenue and fee-related earnings, 140 basis points to FRE margin, and $2.7 million to pre-tax adjusted net income. This compares to retroactive fees in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 that contributed $2.4 million of revenue, $2.2 million to fee-related earnings and pre-tax adjusted net income, and 130 basis points to FRE margin. Excluding the impact of retroactive fees in both this quarter and the prior year's quarter, we would have grown fee-related earnings by 21%. Finally, we earned $29.4 million in adjusted net income for the quarter or $0.26 per share. This is down from $47.1 million or $0.41 per share in the first fiscal quarter of last year, driven primarily by lower net realizations and partially offset by higher fee-related earnings. I'll now hand the call over to StepStone's CEO Scott Hart. \nScott Hart: Thank you, Seth and good afternoon everyone. Over the last year, we have generated a strong progression of fee-related earnings, driven by consistent growth in fee-earning assets under management, despite challenging environment for the private markets and the broader asset management industry. The strength and breadth of our platform enables StepStone to operate a comprehensive set of solutions to our clients, allowing them to proactively invest across economic cycles. Our client-first approach has resulted in strong historic growth and we expect to continue along this path as we listen and adapt to our clients' needs across evolving market backdrops. Looking at today's environment, our clients remain patient in making capital commitments. However, the broader market appears to be strengthening and the sentiment among our clients and partners is improving. Public equity indices are up 20% to 40% since the markets dropped with strength particularly in technology. Investment realizations remain modest, but we are seeing green shoots with some recent IPO activity and M&A. Increased transactions would not only lead to stronger performance fees, but would help spur fundraising as realized capital that has returned is recycled back into new investments particularly for those LPs with more mature private markets portfolios. At our Investor Day in June, we set out a path to at least double our fee-related earnings over the next five years. Since our founding more than 15 years ago we have taken deliberate steps to build leading teams and capabilities across all the major private market asset classes and strategies, establish solutions for institutional and individual investors, position ourselves in the fastest-growing geographies, and construct leading data and technology platforms that provide StepStone with distinct competitive advantages in delivering private market solutions. As such, we believe the drivers of growth are already in place, namely managed account re-ups, continued success within our co-mingled funds across both institutional and private wealth clients, deepening market penetration across geographies, and operating leverage. A major contributing factor in our confidence to achieving this long-term growth centers around the diversity of our offerings. Our wide scope of capabilities ensures that we have a myriad of solutions for different market environments and that we are not concentrated in any one area. I'd like to focus on a few of these avenues about which we are particularly excited. Beginning with secondaries, this is a strategy that we've spoken about on recent calls and warrants continued discussion given how it is resonating with investors in today's environment. Investors are attracted to the strong returns, while appreciating the favorable risk and cash flow profile that comes from investing in a seasoned portfolio or asset. At the same time, supply remains strong as GPs and LPs are increasing their adoption of secondaries as a mechanism to harvest returns and generate liquidity. As a trusted partner to GPs and LPs alike, StepStone is well positioned to capitalize on this market given the breadth of our relationships and our data advantage which comes from managing or advising on over $600 billion of assets and monitoring data on over 15,000 managers. We are currently in market with our private equity secondaries fund, our special situations real estate secondaries fund and we are now in market with our venture capital secondaries fund where we are working towards a first close. We also offer secondaries in managed accounts across all the asset classes and see opportunities for further product expansion. The secondary markets in private credit and infrastructure are still relatively new, but are starting to accelerate meaningfully as the primary market in these asset classes have reached a critical mass and LP's portfolios in those asset classes are seasoning. As the largest solutions provider in infrastructure and a meaningful player in private credit, StepStone is positioned to be a leader in developing these secondary markets. Shifting to the geographic landscape, we continue to find opportunities worldwide. We have a strong global presence with offices in 16 countries, which give us the footprint to grow internationally with deepening pools in the emerging capital. We are also growing in North America which made up over half of our gross inflows this quarter. The breadth of our offering has proven to be a competitive advantage as we closed on several managed account mandates that were multi-strategy and multi-asset class. Finally Private Wealth continues to be an extremely exciting avenue for growth. We are averaging inflows of over $70 million a month for calendar 2023, which compares to a $45 million average for the first seven months of last year. In fact, July was our best month of inflows ever with over $100 million in new subscriptions. When we established our Private Wealth platform, we did it with the aim of increasing accessibility to the private markets. SPRIM our core private markets Evergreen fund was designed specifically to help individual investors' clear challenges associated with private market investing. For example, SPRIM has relatively low investment minimums, is suitable for accredited investors, allows for 1099 tax reporting and doesn't require capital calls. Last month we took another significant step to reduce investor friction, by publishing a daily net asset value for SPRIM making StepStone among the first platforms to introduce a daily NAV for a multi-asset class private markets fund. Investors can now subscribe on a daily, rather than just a monthly basis. Additionally, SPRIM is now eligible for the National Securities Clearing Corporation platform for mutual funds, enabling investment via a ticker without the need for subscription documents and simplifying the onboarding process for the investor and financial adviser. I'll now turn the call over to Mike McCabe, to speak about StepStone's fundraising and fee-earning asset growth in more detail.\nMike McCabe: Thanks Scott. Turning to slide 7. We generated $15 billion of gross AUM inflows during the last 12 months with $4 billion coming from our commingled funds and $11 billion coming from our managed accounts. Slide 8, shows our fee-earning AUM by structure and asset class. For the quarter, we grew fee-earning assets by approximately $2 billion with $700 million coming from commingled funds and the remainder from separately managed accounts. This quarter's commingled fund inflows came primarily from our PE secondaries fund our multi-strategy global venture fund, our infrastructure co-investment fund and our Private Wealth platform where we continue to generate strong growth with total assets under management of $1.7 billion. Our investment performance at our Private Wealth products continues to be very strong with SPRIM our Evergreen private markets fund for our accredited investors generating a 28% annualized return since inception and SPRING, our evergreen venture and growth equity fund off to a strong 24% return since its launch in November of 2022. StepStone private infrastructure fund or STRUCTURE is our latest perpetually raised fund for Private Wealth investors having been declared effective by the SEC in July. STRUCTURE is an internal fund, seeking current income and long-term capital appreciation by offering accredited investors access to a global investment portfolio of private infrastructure assets. We expect an initial closing later this year. We also increased our undeployed fee-earning capital by more than $1 billion to a balance of approximately $17 billion, positioning us well to capitalize on attractive investment opportunities. Slide 9 shows the evolution of our management and advisory fees. We generated a blended management fee rate of 55 basis points over the last 12 months, slightly higher than for fiscal 2023. We produced over $4.50 per share in management advisory fees over the last 12 months, representing an annual growth rate of over 20% since fiscal year 2019. Now before turning the call over to Johnny, I am pleased to announce that we are raising our quarterly dividend from $0.20 per share to $0.21 per share. As a reminder, last November we updated our dividend approach to bifurcate our shareholder distributions between a quarterly dividend that would be based primarily on fee-related earnings and a recurring supplemental dividend that will be paid annually and based primarily on performance related earnings. By matching our dividend approach to our business model, we can maximize distributions to our shareholders, while maintaining a capital-efficient balance sheet. As a reminder, we set last year's quarterly dividends of $0.20 per share prior to this shift in approach and therefore had based those dividends on total adjusted net income rather than fee related earnings. We are pleased that we were able to pay out a healthy $0.25 supplemental dividend this past June even with the midyear change in approach. This quarter's $0.21 distribution marks the first time we are setting our quarterly dividend based primarily on fee related earnings. This payout is funded by the vast majority of our fee related earnings after adjusting for taxes and noncontrolling interest. For comparison this dividend would have represented a high-teens percentage increase in our quarterly dividend had we adopted a similar approach last year and based those quarterly dividends on FRE. We expect that our future year's quarterly dividends will increase as we grow FRE. I'd now like to pass the call over to our CFO, Johnny Randel.\nJohnny Randel: Thank you Mike. I'd like to turn your attention to Slide 11 to speak to our financial highlights. For the quarter, we earned management and advisory fees of $138 million, up 18% from the prior year quarter. The revenue increase is driven by growth in fee-earning AUM from comingled funds that were activated over the last year, as well as continued fundraising and deployment across commercial structures. We generated an FRE margin of 32% for the quarter. Retroactive fees in this quarter had a positive impact on the FRE margin of 140 basis points. Excluding the impact from retro fees, our margin was up 60 basis points year-over-year and up 250 basis points sequentially. Cash compensation for the quarter reflected relatively limited hiring activity. We expect some pick up in compensation expense next quarter from incremental hiring. G&A will vary quarter-to-quarter largely driven by travel and events. We saw a decline in G&A from the previous quarter, which included expenses related to our annual VC investor conference. Gross realized performance and incentive fees were $14 million for the quarter, which is down both year-over-year and sequentially but generally consistent with the muted level of transactions we have seen in the market. As Scott mentioned, we are seeing some signs that the realization environment is improving. It generally takes a few quarters of transactions to work through the pipeline, so we expect that realized performance fees will remain modest for the next several quarters. As a reminder, we generally do not control the timing of exit on our investments. Moving to Slide 12. Adjusted revenue per share was down 20% relative to the prior fiscal year, which is the result of an 80% decrease in gross realized performance fees per share, offset by 19% growth in management and advisory fees per share. Since fiscal 2019, we have grown adjusted revenue per share by 21% compounded annual rate. Shifting to our profitability on Slide 13, we grew fee-related earnings per share by 22% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by growth in management and advisory fees. Looking over the longer term, we have generated an annual growth rate in fee related earnings per share of 31% since fiscal 2019. Our ANI per share is down relative to last year driven by lower performance and incentive fees that has increased at an annual rate of 26% over the long-term period driven by growth in both fee-related earnings and realized net performance fees. Moving to the balance sheet on Slide 14. Net accrued carry finished the quarter at $609 million, up 4% from the previous quarter, driven by underlying valuation increases for the period ended March 31st. As a reminder, our accrued carry balance is reported on a one quarter lag. Our own investment portfolio ended the quarter at $154 million. Unfunded commitments to our investment programs were $95 million as of quarter end. Our pool of performance fee-eligible capital has grown to over $65 billion and this capital is widely diversified across multiple vintage years and approximately 190 programs. 78% of our unrealized carry is tied to programs of vintages of 2018 or earlier, which means that these programs are largely out of their investment periods and are in harvest mode. 59% of this unrealized carry sourced from vehicles like deal-by-deal waterfall meaning realized carry may be payable at the time of investment exit. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn it back over to the operator to open the line for any questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Budish from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBen Budish: Hi, good evening, and thanks for taking the question. Scott, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about secondaries. Just curious it sounds like there's a lot of opportunity there. I know you have a number of funds in the market right now. Can you remind us how big is that for you right now and just based on the momentum or the desire of GPs and LPs to transact, where do you think that can go? How do you see it scaling over the next several years?\nScott Hart: Sure. Thanks Ben for the question. And, obviously, this is a topic that we've been talking about really over the last number of quarters, not only as it relates to the secondaries opportunity as it exists for us in private equity, but also the expansion of the secondaries opportunity across the venture, as well as the real estate infrastructure and private credit asset classes. We haven't disclosed an exact total secondaries AUM number, but certainly within each of the asset classes is of increasing importance. When you look at our sort of flagship private equity, secondary fund the previous vehicle was a $2.1 billion fund. We continue to have the largest venture capital secondaries fund, with the prior fund being approximately $2.6 billion and as you mentioned in market with our real estate special situations, secondaries fund as well. So, again, I think an increasingly important part of the business for us and as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, given our positioning in the market and our relationships with both GPs and LPs, one that we think that we are particularly well positioned to continue to capitalize on. Clearly, if you think about deal activity in the first half of the year here, was down slightly relative to last year, but there's probably still a bit of a disconnect between what's hitting in the top of the funnel, which has been quite active versus what has closed. We've obviously, talked for some period of time about the bid-ask spreads that exists between buyers and sellers. I think that's closing. I think part of what we've seen is a stabilization in valuations particularly across the private equity, and even to some extent the venture space with valuation stabilizing in really Q4 and Q1 of this year, which will give secondary buyers like ourselves a bit more confidence to transact in this market. \nBen Budish: Great. That’s helpful. Maybe one follow-up sort of a high-level question. It seems like the story maybe six to nine months ago was really around like the denominator effect. LPs were having trouble, just based on kind of the math of what was happening in their portfolios. It sounds like maybe the story has shifted a little bit somewhat similar, but it's more about they're waiting for capital to be returned. But just kind of wondering from your seat, since you sit in the middle of so many GPs and LPs, to what extent with the sort of rise in public markets over the last many months, is the denominator effect still an issue or are investors still sort of waiting for capital to be returned or does it take a little bit more time to get confidence? What are your kind of thoughts there? \nScott Hart: Yes. That's, a good question. It's certainly the rise in the public markets during the first half this year, takes some of the pressure off. But we've also talked in the past about the fact that it actually wasn't just the denominator, but also the numerator that was contributing to LPs being over-allocated and the rapid investment pace over the last several years, the fact that private market valuations has held up reasonably well particularly compared to the public market and then a slowdown in realization activity really starting in the second half of 2022. And so those issues impacting the numerator, all still exist. I would say. that the recovery in the public markets take some of the pressure off. It doesn't mean that LPs are completely out of the woods. I think the term that we used in our prepared remarks is. we think they're being patient. And part of the reason for that is in the same way that when the public markets declined we didn't see an immediate resetting of budgets or LPs slamming on the brakes. Well, when that goes in reverse and the public markets recover again, don't immediately see LPs resetting their budgets. But once again, I would just say, it takes a bit of the pressure off. \nBen Budish: Got it, very helpful. Thanks so much for taking the questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Your line is now open \nKen Worthington: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. First, for Scott, in the prepared remarks you talked about SPRIM and I'm sure I'll screw this up, so I'm going to pare it back and tell where I'm wrong and I'll follow up to the question. Now has daily NAV has registered I think you said NSCC, with a ticker it doesn't need subscription documents to be signed. So one, correct me where I'm wrong, but what I'm really after is, what are the end implications here for I guess one, end investors? And then two, what are the implications here for broadening RIA distribution as well as the build out of sort of regional and wirehouse distribution? It seems like this could be a big deal. Maybe it's not. But help flesh this out for me. \nScott Hart: Thanks, Ken. And while I commented on during the prepared remarks I'm actually going to ask Jason, to comment in a bit more detail on your specific question there. \nJason Ment: Sure. Thanks, Ken and Scott. So, we think it's a big deal is the short answer. From an ease-of-use perspective and a credit investor using an RIA or IBD that's using a custodian that's approved the ticker, literally buys it on the screen just like any mutual fund, paperwork not required from our perspective. So the ease of use is profound. And for RIAs that have discretionary accounts with their clients, it allows them to kind of buy down -- buy into the fund down their entire book in a matter of minutes, instead of having subscription agreements built out by each individual client to go through it all. So, the ease of use and if we're going to -- it's really a lot improved. And when we start to think about what our goal was with SPRIM, it was to provide that single ticket access for the accredited investor and to overcome the hurdles that investors had in accessing, the private markets. That could have been managing capital calls, that could have been dealing with tax compliance and schedule K-1s. But importantly, it's not easy to fill out a 40- or 50-page subscription agreement, either. And now we've been able to eliminate that for a wide swath of US-based investors. \nKen Worthington: Okay. And then again, I'm sure, I missed this before. What is the timing? I think you said the daily NAV is already live. Are we already like right now today to the point where no subscription documents so it's kind of off to the races, or is this something that kind of works its way in over the next six months? What is the timing element here? \nJason Ment: Yeah. So it went live middle of last month. And the way, it works is wherever you are custodying that custodian has to approve the process for using the ticker. So we're working our way through -- as you know there are a lot of custodians out there working our way through the custodians to get them on site. We've got a couple on site so far and continuing that effort. And then separate and apart from those who use a third-party custodian, there are those groups that self-custody and we'll have to see what the take-up is there. So we don't expect that the subscription agreement is going away anytime soon and there will be certain groups that will always want to use a subscription agreement for their clients to ensure belts and suspenders from a suitability perspective. But for a large swath, we do expect the ticker to be the method of choice for accessing the fund. \nKen Worthington: Then one last one, you talked about the RIAs it kind of feels like that's where this may be more helpful. How does this impact sort of the regionals and the wirehouses and your build-out there? I assume, it's sort of helpful for one helpful for all but maybe it's better on one side than the other or maybe the wirehouses wants subscription. So, any difference between sort of distribution channels?\nJason Ment: Yeah. I think there is a difference between the distribution channels. The RIAs will definitely use this at a higher percentage than the IBDs or the wires. We think some of the IBDs will be using this, but probably not all. Some may also use an abbreviated documentation process. So there's some benefit but not the complete benefit. And for the wires we expect that will be the last holdout in terms of wanting to use the ticker instead of sticking with the traditional sub doc process from a suitability perspective.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Thanks.\nJason Ment: So think of this like equalizing the playing field a bit in terms of the scale of capital amongst the players a bit.\nKen Worthington: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty from UBS. Your line is now open.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you, and good afternoon. I just wanted to ask about the level of undeployed capital which is nicely ticking up there. Great to have that sort of backlog for deployment. Looks like deployment may have -- of that in particular backlog may have edged down a little bit in the quarter. So, just wondering what you're seeing in the deployment environment and whether there's something about the current undeployed capital in terms of fund mix and profile that would either shorten or lengthen the deployment period? Thanks.\nScott Hart: Sure. Thanks Adam. So we've always talked about is undeployed fee-earning capital likely to be deployed over a three to five-year type of period. I think that still remains the case. And I think that type of time range gives us enough flexibility given the deal flow that we have to deploy responsibly and invest responsibly throughout market cycles here. I think you are right to pick up on the fact that deployment has slowed a bit not only in this quarter but over the last few quarters here. I don't think that will come as any major surprise given what has gone on in the marketplace more broadly. And to some extent comes down to which of our accounts pay on invested capital, I would say, while we haven't broken that down precisely it's a bit more heavily weighted towards some of our co-investment strategies and much like the comment I made earlier about secondary is where there's probably a bit of a difference between what's hitting the top of the funnel versus what is actually closing. We have seen a nice uptick in activity hitting the top of the funnel certainly the second quarter of this year up pretty significantly year-over-year. And I think that's going to be a driver of deployment and investment pace starting to pick up. So as we've talked about on the last few calls we continue to be patient, but are cautiously optimistic given the pickup in deal flow that we've seen of late. \nAdam Beatty: Got it. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks for the detail, Scott. And then just turning back to the wealth channel really interesting on the daily NAV for SPRIM and many of the features that come along with that. So, I think that's really something of a breakthrough there. One of the other components as you know of effective retail distribution is the education process and which breaks into kind of a conceptual understanding of the product, but also forms of real-time data or monitoring availability. And obviously, daily NAV will fill in one of those major gaps there. But just wondering given the wealth of information resources that StepStone has how you might be deploying or considering deploying that information advantage into the retail channel. Thanks.\nJason Ment: Yes, I think – this is Jason. In addition to the transparency that's available on the portfolio and the daily ticker just to be clear, that's an SPRIM development not a SPRING development currently. But in addition to that, you're right we try to strategically partner with each of the wealth management firms that we work with and try to meet them where they are. They've got differing needs in terms of access to educational materials like the research papers we put out but also may seek to have a more fulsome access to our data and technology solutions and we try to partner them partner with them in that way as well if it's helpful. So I think unlike a – like a monoline manager, we do have not only a lot of data and technology solutions available but perspective on the market that we can be helpful in things that they're doing away from us as well and I think that's resonated quite well.\nScott Hart: The only thing I would add to that is I think this approach towards education and knowledge transfer is not a far stretch for us, given the relationships that we have with our clients even on the institutional side where we've always had very close partnerships, not the types of relationships where we're just checking in once a year at an annual meeting. We're in very close communication with our clients, hosting training sessions. We actually launched earlier this year our first on the private equity side StepStone Academy session for some of our institutional clients. And so now looking for ways to roll that out more broadly to the private wealth space as well.\nAdam Beatty: Yes. So there's potential cross over there. That's great. Thank you, guys. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, guys. Just building maybe on a couple of more questions around the wealth channel. I think you mentioned that gross sales in July were running at about $100 million, which is a nice pickup from where you guys have been doing. So if you can spend a minute on what the source of that sort of incremental offset has been recently is that additional new platforms, new advisers or higher just same-store sales from the kind of the existing books that you're seeing? And as you think about the expansion plans into other platforms with obviously again this new structure would that also entail the ability for direct distribution, or would clients still need to buy through the financial providers? So in other words, would folks be able to buy it in Schwab and Fidelity or it's still up to the intermediary? Thanks.\nJason Ment: Thanks, Alex. So a couple of things. In terms of where we saw these post-period flows what drove the uptick, I think we saw the ticker come into play for sure on SPRIM. We saw it therefore come deeper into the book at mostly the RIA channel. But we also saw some increased flows from the wires and IBDs that we've been on the platform but it's been kind of in that ramp-up phase and those things are starting to hit stride. So it was a pretty broad-based tick up both across SPRIM and SPRING. So really happy to see that. And then in terms of what could the ticker mean in terms of more direct access, we agree. We do think that this will allow folks to buy into the fund on a variety of different channels including things like self-directed IRAs in the kind of channels you mentioned as well as other kind of direct-to-consumer platforms.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Great. And then just in terms of the structure of the wealth channel, if I recall correctly maybe a quarter or two ago, you guys have restructured it where the team got some of the economics. So maybe just a quick reminder of in terms of the incremental management fees that will be coming through the channel, what ultimately drops down to the bottom line to the StepStone shareholders? \nJason Ment: So if you take the top line management fee there's roughly a 50-50 split in those fees, with 50% going to StepStone Group and then 50% funding the expenses of the private wealth team.\nAlex Blostein: Got it. Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMichael Cyprys : Hey, good evening. I wanted to ask about private credit. It's getting a lot of attention in the marketplace just given some of the challenges in the banking sector. I was hoping you can talk about your private credit franchise how that contributed to the quarter. And hopefully, you could talk about some of the initiatives you have in place to accelerate growth and what are some of the steps you might be able to take over the next 12 months.\nScott Hart : Sure. Thanks Mike for the question. I think private debt has been a meaningful contributor not only in the quarter, but really over the last 12 months and beyond one of the faster-growing asset classes for us. Look when you talk to our private debt team and platform one of the things you hear us talk quite a bit about is the fact that, we view this as an all-weather strategy particularly when you think about the core allocation to direct lending, and what happens from time to time as there are opportunities either to diversify your sourcing channels and/or enhance your returns. I think one of the things that has happened on the back of the regional banking crisis is really an opportunity to do a couple of those things. We want to diversify sourcing whether by looking not only at corporate credits, but also real estate and infrastructure debt, and also expect there will be an opportunity to enhance returns and looking at more opportunistic and potentially distressed opportunities down the road here. But where a lot of the attention has really focused has also just been on this core direct lending allocation as well just given the rise in base rates seeing sort of low double-digit gross asset yields. And I think as the asset class itself has matured and has been proven a bit more battle-tested and we've seen sort of the strong downside being protection and performance through whether it was COVID, the GFC, or the more recent sort of tech-driven downturn over the last 12, 24 months here, I think that has really garnered a lot of attention amongst LPs. And so it's really opened up the eyes of our LPs and our clients as to the attractiveness and the attractive risk-reward of the strategy. In terms of additional steps that need to be taken look, I think, we've built out the platform. It's a sizable team and sizable business today. But I think some of the real opportunities are going to be capitalizing on the growing co-invest and secondaries opportunity. That's been an area that even with the decline in volumes that we've seen over the last 12 months driven by private equity deal activity there have been meaningful co-investment opportunities and secondaries either in the form of buying a portfolio of loans from GPs, or banks, or more traditional LP secondaries. And so I think those are going to be some of the growth avenues going forward here. \nMichael Cyprys : Great. And then just a follow-up question on retail. I think you mentioned $1.7 billion so far across two or three funds. Can you just update us on where each of those funds are in their phase of getting on the distribution platforms? How many are each on -- how many wires are each of them on? And where do you see that or expect that to be in 12 months? \nJason Ment : Sure. Thanks Mike. The SPRIM is on a bit over 150 RIA platforms, 10-plus IBDs and one wire. SPRING is on 50-plus RIAs at this point, and a handful of IBDs. The IBDs actually are adopting a bit earlier in SPRING than what we saw in SPRIM, which is what we would generally expect to see with a second fund family after a first fund family. So that's been positive. Conversations on additional wires for SPRIM and an initial wire for SPRING are continuing and trending very positive. So look building out that syndicate for each fund family not just here in the U.S. by the way, but we can't forget that fourth pillar, which is very important which is the non-U.S. distribution is well underway and we've got a nice pipeline outside the U.S. as well with a number of different wealth platforms. \nMichael Cyprys : Great. Thanks for that. If I could just sneak one final one in here. Just on the daily NAV. Can you just talk a little bit about the hurdles that you had to tackle to bring that sort of innovation to the marketplace? How you thought about some of the pros and cons there just in terms of perhaps more volatility or less of a smoother ride for the customer? And sort of why now on that versus when you had brought some of these products in the marketplace a couple of years ago?\nJason Ment: Sure. Look so, Scott mentioned the tremendous amount of data flowing through the platform. We think that is one of the initial linchpins in order to be able to deliver on a solution like this. The second is just the tremendous team that we've got in our data analytics team and data science team that were able to come up with the modeling around all of this. And then finally, to implement the technology across our homegrown monitoring and reporting software spy reporting and integrating that into our system and on our process for investing is really the last piece of how to actually be able to implement all of this. So the hurdles are high, I think for groups to be able to deliver on something like this in a meaningful way. It took a lot of legwork with all of our vendors like the auditors the administrators et cetera to get everybody on side with all of this. And in terms of the user experience, so far the feedback has been fantastic from the channels.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks for that.\nJason Ment: Why now? Like it's just taken a long time to get to this point. It's not easy.\nMichael Cyprys: Super. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Dunn from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nJohn Dunn: Hi, guys and thank you. You talked about half of gross inflows coming from the US. Can you kind of remind us how that compares to past quarters? Was there any kind of idiosyncratic stuff in there? And then maybe the strongest geographies overseas?\nScott Hart: Sure. I mean, just as it relates to the comparison to prior quarters, we haven't always broken out the exact geographic breakdown. But when you look at the overall business and the breakdown of our management and advisory fees, that has typically been in the roughly 70% outside of the US and the remainder in the US. And so you can get the sense to that is an above-average contribution coming from North America. And look that was driven by a combination of things one being a number of separate accounts that we closed during the quarter. And as you know the timing of closing of sizable separate accounts can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Happen to have a few that closed during the quarter as well as some of the contributions on our various different co-mingled funds that had closings during the quarter. I would say from a geographic standpoint beyond that fairly balanced across other geographies. So I'm not sure there's a single geography that we would highlight outside of the US maybe more broadly Europe would have been the most significant contributor but without getting more specific than that. I'd probably leave it there.\nJohn Dunn: Got you. And maybe just to touch on real estate? Can you talk about where you think we are as far as demand for your real estate strategies where are you seeing the most and the least demand? \nScott Hart: Yeah. Well, look I think the good news is where we're seeing the most demand is for our flagship real estate special situations secondaries strategy. Jeff Giller, our Head of Real Estate has spent quite a bit of time talking about that strategy during our Investor Day just a couple of months ago. That is a strategy that is in demand and that we think is very well positioned for the coming investment environment. It has not been activated yet as deal volumes are still somewhat subdued today. And as Jeff talked about during our Investor Day, he thinks that it's the coming wave of refinancing activity that will ultimately catalyze the investment opportunity for us there today. So that's I'd say the area that we're seeing the most significant demand on the real estate side.\nJohn Dunn: Thanks very much.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand over to Scott Hart. Please continue. \nScott Hart: Great. Well, thanks everyone for your time and attention today. We look forward to updating you in future quarters. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
