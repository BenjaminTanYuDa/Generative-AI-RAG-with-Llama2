All participants will be in a listen-only mode and the question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. This conference call is being recorded today, Thursday, February 8, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Ananth Krishnan, Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy. Please go ahead.\nAnanth Krishnan: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On the line with me are Miguel Martin, CEO; and Glen Ibbott, CFO. This morning, Aurora issued a news release announcing our fiscal 2024 third quarter financial results, and a separate news release announcing the acquisition of MedReleaf Australia. These separate news releases and our fiscal Q3 2024 financial statements and MD&A are available on our IR website and can also be accessed by SEDAR+ and EDGAR. In addition, you will find a supplemental information deck on our IR website. Listeners are reminded that certain matters on today's conference call could constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our future financial or business performance. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The risk factors that may affect actual results are detailed in our annual information form and other periodic filings and registration statements. These documents may similarly be accessed via SEDAR+ and EDGAR. Following prepared remarks by Miguel and Glen, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering analysts. With that, I will turn the call over now to Miguel. Please go ahead.\nMiguel Martin: Thank you, Ananth. Our quarterly performance demonstrated not only the strength of Aurora's business model, built primarily upon global leadership and high margin medical cannabis, but also our financial discipline. Our highlights include: first, strong revenue of over $64 million, up several percentage points inclusive of 41% growth in our international medical cannabis segment. Second, industry leading adjusted gross margin of 50%, also up from the year ago period. Third, a record adjusted EBITDA, representing our fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Fourth, recall that we have also one of the strongest balance sheets of any Canadian LP and our global cannabis business will be debt free later this month. All of these items move us closer towards our goal of generating positive free cash flow in calendar 2024. But before delving into Q3 into greater detail, I first want to review our announcement today regarding the acquisition of the remaining 90% equity interest in MedReleaf Australia that award does not currently own. They are a leading distributor of medical cannabis products in Australia. The company was acquired at a total enterprise value of $44 million, of which $8.3 million was paid in cash and the remainder is satisfied by the issuance of Aurora shares. This transaction was thoughtfully structured to preserve the strength of Aurora's balance sheet and represents a strategic milestone in Aurora's global cannabis leadership, as we have now become the largest platform in the nationally legal cannabis industry in the world. Acquiring MedReleaf Australia positions us to deliver double-digit increases to the profitability of our Australian business model through higher revenue contributions and higher gross margins. It further aligns this business with our other key profitable international markets, most notably Germany, Poland and the U.K. It is immediately accretive to our adjusted EBITDA and accelerates our path to positive free cash flow generation before the end of the calendar year. We first partnered with MedReleaf Australia back in 2017. And since that time, we've been an active contributor to its growth by leveraging our pharmaceutical grade cultivation and science driven approach to product innovation. Like Germany, the Australian market is characterized by clinician-led traditional pharma like product distribution model that closely aligns with Aurora's operational success. The high regulatory standards of the Therapeutic Goods Authority makes Australia a challenging market for new entrants, while providing advantage to companies like Aurora, who are able to meet them. MedReleaf Australia already holds the number two position in medical cannabis in Australia, having already invested in clinician education, while leveraging Aurora's comprehensive product portfolio to provide best-in-class medicine and support for this rapidly growing patient base. We are extremely excited about our opportunity within the rapidly growing AUD400 million market. This would make it the largest medical market in the world outside of North America. We welcome MedReleaf Australia fully into the Aurora fold and know that we'll be able to do great things together. Now let's look more deeply into our business. In Canada, we maintained our number one position in the medical market and continue to grow our market share through a broad and attractive product assortment, positive sales mix and most importantly, product innovation. Amid a continuous disruption in this market, we know that our commitment to launching a steady stream of exciting new products is critical to hold and growing our domestic medical share. Our next generation cultivars can and often are made available across Europe and Australia, providing patients with some of the highest potency and most appealing offerings in these international markets. Of course, our ability to offer pharma grade products to global patients is only made possible by our competitive advantage of having built a production network of indoor EU GMP certified facilities that are managed by teams who have deep experience in pharmaceutical production. As we already discussed Australia earlier, which now delve into our European operations as we generated sales in a record seven European countries; Germany, Poland, the U.K., France, Switzerland, Malta and the Czech Republic. In Germany, our largest European market, where we've been operating since 2017, we are one of only three companies with the domestic production facility. We have the number two market share for flowers according to latest data and the number one market share for self-payers, we also had three of the top 10 cultivars in the country by volume sales. We are supportive of the legislative process that is moving towards the de-scheduling of medical cannabis and the potential wider legalization of adult use cannabis. We are very supportive of this effort and uniquely well positioned to benefit as the number one supplier of flower to patients outside the public insurance system. In Poland, our second largest European market, Aurora earned the number two cultivar and the number two market position by volume. We are excited about the opportunities that this growing market presents. In the U.K., patients are responding favorably to the launches of our next generation cultivars, which has led to a significant increase in sales in Q3 compared to Q2. In Switzerland, we are building on a successful launch in Q2, becoming the trusted favorite for patients and are currently widening distribution channels in the country. All-in-all, medical cannabis adjusted gross margin remained strong at 62%, as we benefit from sustainable cost reductions and improved efficiency in production operations. Turning back to Canada. Our decision is to strategically allocate product, the higher margin medical markets resulted in a modest and expected year-over-year revenue decline in the consumer cannabis systems. Still our adjusted gross margin improved substantially versus the year ago period because of our higher efficiency in production operations and a more favorable product mix. Finally, we exhibited the inherent benefits of a diversified model as we are expanding our reach in the controlled environment agricultural industry through VIVO. Their team is currently leveraging our cannabis facilities to move into the profitable cultivated orchards market, while their current vegetable and plant propagation business already generates a steady, predictable financial performance, albeit on a seasonal cadence. In the upcoming two to three years, we think that our shareholders are benefiting the value creation coming from this segment, as we expect the acceleration of Vivo's business plan to continue to drive revenue and EBITDA growth. All of our strategic progress over the past few years will move us towards our goal of positive free cash flow in calendar 2024. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Glen for a detailed financial overview.\nGlen Ibbott: Thank you, Miguel, and good morning, everyone. Q3 is representative of our success in executing our business transformation and the tangible and positive results it has brought to our company. Our cash balance was over $200 million at the quarter close. And later this month, we will repay the remaining convertible senior notes with cash for approximately $7.3 million. And that completes the repayment of nearly $540 million of debt over the last three years, and we'll leave our cannabis business debt-free. Now looking to Q3, big picture, we delivered revenue growth of 5.5% over the comparable year ago period, including a significant increase in sales from our high margin global medical cannabis segment. On profitability, consolidated adjusted gross margin rose to 50%, and adjusted EBITDA rose to a record $4.3 million, reflecting a $1.4 million improvement from last year and our highest quarterly result for adjusted EBITDA. Q3 also marked our fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Now let's go into greater depth on our results. In Q3, net revenue rose to $64.4 million, up $3.3 million from $61.1 million in the year ago period. Overall, medical cannabis generated $45.1 million of net revenue, up $6.2 million compared to last year. By segment, international medical revenue was $19.3 million, up 41% from last year, and Canadian medical cannabis was $25.8 million, up 2.3% year-over-year. Our performance in our medical channels was largely due to the positive market reaction to our Canadian growing high potency cultivars in key European markets and to the continued rapid growth of the Australian medical market. Adjusted gross margin for medical cannabis was 62% in Q3, down 1% versus the year ago period. The consistently high margin as the result of sustainable cost reductions and improved efficiency in our production operations. With our shift to supply in Europe from Canada as the impact of closing our Nordic production facility begins to flow through our financials. As usual, driven by our focus on leadership in global medical markets, medical cannabis represented about 90% of our total cannabis adjusted gross profit dollars, and increased 15% to $28 million in Q3 compared to $24.4 million in the year ago period. Consumer cannabis net revenue was $11.6 million, down from $14.6 million a year ago. The change was the expected result of our decision to reallocate product to the higher margin markets. Adjusted gross margin for consumer cannabis was 26% compared to 20% in the prior year period. This significant increase in margins is coming from higher cultivar yields and continued efficiency improvements in production that are driving lower unit costs. In plant propagation, revenue of $7.3 million grew 10% from $6.6 million in the year ago period. You will recall that the seasonality of this business delivers higher revenue in the late winter and spring months, which should result in about 65% to 75% of revenue and up to 80% of EBITDA in the first half of a calendar year, so our fiscal Q4 and Q1 periods. Plant propagation adjusted gross margins were 18%, up from 15% in the year ago period. The increase was due to product mix between vegetable and ornamental plant sales. Our consolidated adjusted SG&A was well controlled at approximately $27.5 million and continues to reflect our ongoing commitment to keeping SG&A below $30 million in the current business. Turning now to cash flow. We made significant progress in Q3 towards our goal of positive free cash flow in calendar year 2024, and remain firmly on track to achieve that goal as our operations used only $5.3 million in the quarter, inclusive of working capital investment, this is down sequentially from $30.9 million and considerably down from the $60.6 million used in the year ago period. As planned, our target of $40 million in annualized expense reductions is being realized mainly in Q3 and Q4. This is driven by the continued operational efficiency initiatives including the shutdown of our Nordic production site and the sale of our Dutch assets, with the remaining expense reductions flowing through in Q4. As we manage working capital during the company's shift forward into growth opportunities, we have been successful in balancing the working capital needs of both investing in growth and executing disciplined financial management. For CapEx, we invested approximately $2.8 million this quarter, split evenly between maintenance and growth initiatives. Now looking forward to our next quarter, fiscal Q4 2024. Canadian medical and consumer segments are expected to be steady quarter-over-quarter, while Europe and Australia should both provide growth in their regions. The acquisition of MedReleaf Australia should provide both incremental revenue for each gram of cannabis sold and delivered the commensurate improvement in gross margins in that region. By Q1 of our next fiscal year, we expect all three of our global medical regions, Canada, Europe and Australia to be delivering adjusted gross margins that exceed our target of 60%. For plant propagation, we expect to see seasonally higher revenues and gross profit that would be in line with historical performance in the comparable prior year period. So revenue growth, combined with ongoing cost control are expected to result in continued positive adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2024. To wrap up, our strengthened financial condition is due entirely to the commitment to operational excellence and strategic focus of our team. We are positioning our diversified global cannabis business to deliver dependable revenue growth over the long term. Thanks very much for your interest. I'll now turn the call back to Miguel.\nMiguel Martin: Thanks, Glen. If there's one takeaway for our investors, it would be that strategically and financially, we are in the best shape ever. This is all thanks to our team accomplishing what we set out for them to do. We fully intend to make good on our commitments for top line growth and continued and sustainable adjusted EBITDA generation, $200 million of cash on hand, we're in a strong position as we work towards our goal of generating positive free cash flow this calendar year. Operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Frederico Gomes from ATB Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nFrederico Gomes: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. My first question is on your acquisition in Australia. You mentioned it's a market worth about AUD400 million and that is rapidly growing. So can you just give us an idea of how fast that market is growing? What are the drivers there behind that growth. as well as what sort of assets you have in place there with that acquisition, and the opportunity Australia represents? Thank you.\nMiguel Martin: You got it. Well, good morning, Fred. Yeah. Listen, we are incredibly excited about this acquisition, as I said in my comments, this is a business that we've been partnering with since 2017. We own 10% of it, great operators, ex-pharmacists, wonderful piece of business there. So first and foremost, the AUD400 million a year of Australian revenue market sizing is coming from a report published by the Penington Institute. And they really leveraged the number of units sold represented by reported by the TGA, which is the key regulatory unit and then they multiply that by an average selling price per unit. So listen, it's not Nielsen or IRI, but that's the key piece of it. The TGA is the primary regulatory body in Australia, and they're the ones who publish the units sold on a six month basis. So just in terms of growth, if you look back to 2022, the market size was estimated to be at about AUD234 million, and that grew in the first-six months and we've seen steady growth. The number of approvals which is a key indicator on prescriptions, also continues to grow. In the first half of 2023, we saw close to 320,000 new approvals and this represents a significant increase since July of say, 2016. When you compare that to, say, Canada, where we've seen some improvement is a significant growth. So that's that piece, the company that we're buying is number two in the market, and that market data comes from a different data source, which is called Noster data, which is Australia's leading pharmacy data partner. It is important to know that it's a representative sample and not all pharmacies are signed up for it. But we've had great success in this market on multiple brands and we're really excited about it. And as I mentioned, the TGA has done a wonderful job being regulatory forward and science based. And so, we think this is a market that clearly advantages regulatory forward, TGA approved suppliers of which we are. And so, we're thrilled about having a foothold and having such a great acquisition that will be margin accretive day one in that key market.\nFrederico Gomes: Thank you for that color. My second question here just about Germany. We have done the vote there expected to have been soon. I'm just curious, how do you think that -- deal that if it passes, how do you think that could impact the medical market and the opportunities there in Germany? Thank you.\nMiguel Martin: Yeah. Appreciate that. So Germany is obviously a key market for us is, as I said, we're one of three companies that have domestic production, which is a significant advantage. We're hopeful that we're going to hear something in late spring, particularly around the de-scheduling or the removal of cannabis with a narcotic designation, that in itself will have a massive impact to that market because it will allow both the pharmacists that prescribe it as well as the patients that have greater access to that product. Now the actual timing and how this is going to manifest itself, we'll have to see in the regulations. We are very supportive, though, of these actions and have found that the German regulators whether it's been the approval process, the testing process, the certification process have all done a really good job with this, and these things take time. But we think that, that legislation is going to have a really significant impact for those companies like us that participate in the medical portion of that. And obviously, we'll have a tag along impact as we see other markets around them, such as Poland, Czech Republic, France and others, look. So momentum builds momentum, particularly in that part of the world, and we're thrilled about that progress and looking forward to seeing the regulations when they come out.\nFrederico Gomes: Thank you very much.\nMiguel Martin: You’re welcome, Fred. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Bottomley from Canaccord. Please proceed.\nMatt Bottomley: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the color so far. Just wanted to pivot back to more domestically in the Canadian medical side of things, not something that gets talked about a lot in general, just given that it's a pretty immaterial portion of most other LPs strategy at this point. So it seems like it's been at this $25 million a quarter, $100 million revenue business for some time. And I'm just wondering if you can maybe explain or give some of the more color on the dynamics of, is the overall market TAM of medical slowly shrinking given that retail is not hard to find, particularly in provinces like Ontario and then just strategies, maybe in order to increase that share, whether it's through other LPs kind of closing up shop or other strategic initiatives in order to get increased registrations into Aurora?\nMiguel Martin: Well, Matt. Good morning, and listen, it's a great question. I think there's two part to that question. So let me take the question as you laid it out and then add a little bit to it. So yes, we believe that the roughly $400 million a year of Canadian revenue is declining slightly. We've been able to offset that by growing our market share. That being said, we do think there's opportunities to grow that pie. Now the impacts initially due to the growth of the REC (ph) business and the availability of REC products did have an impact, but because of the reimbursement aspect that you wouldn't get in a recreational environment, we see those patients that are in that system, particularly, the veteran patients, getting great value and great service that they would not get in the REC business, mostly because of the reimbursed model and so there's that. Secondly, we do see an opportunity for that Canadian medical business to grow. We are seeing interest in unions and other sort of entities looking at cannabis as a benefit getting bigger. And I will mention that we're now starting to see more and more clinical trials and the traditional medical establishment doing work on cannabinoids that would open up. Today, it was only 1% of the Canadian adult population that is in aiming the medical cannabis system. So there is plenty of opportunity. Now the medical cannabis business is the highest margin portion of all cannabis globally. So it's an incredibly compelling piece. The other thing that's very important to understand is that having excellence in Canada, which is such a critical federal legal medical cannabis market allows you to learn and become adept at navigating other federally legal cannabis markets of which we're now the largest, and so our leadership that we have in Germany, in Poland, in other of these key markets comes directly from what we've learned in Canada and we are able to leverage similar products and similar executions because of the world class production in Canada and shipping those EU GMP products around the world. So listen, we are thrilled about our leadership in the Canadian market and being a Canadian medical cannabis company. But clearly, we get great advantages out of leveraging that exact same system all around the world.\nMatt Bottomley: Great. Appreciate all that. Just one more for me on general sort of philosophy or strategy when you kind of look at a number of these international market. I'm just wondering in terms of the timing of allocation and deployment of capital or M&A dollars into certain markets, particularly in Europe. What are some of the key things that maybe you look at? You had one of your U.S. counterparts earlier this week, announced the deal into Poland. I know Poland's a market you guys have talked about a little bit. I think they had mentioned there's a huge amount of investment in lag time into getting products registered, which if you get in the market now, obviously, can be a benefit in terms of first mover, but are there other things you look at it? Is it the scarcity of licenses, just overall regulatory landscape with respect to how things are written up versus timing of when you expect maybe markets to launch. It's something that gets talked about a lot in this sector, but I think a lot of investors have been more or less have seen the can get kicked down the road with when markets outside of the U.S. and Canada actually have really started to gain acceleration.\nMiguel Martin: Yeah. It's a great question. And I think it's one that we spend a lot of time on, and I would argue that we're one of the best at. So we have pretty significant modeling work that's done on each of these markets. We also spend a significant amount of money in the local markets, having people in the local markets, particularly on the GR/GA side. So I would tell you, when you boil it down, the calculations really are based on three core segments. The first is our assessment of the regulatory environment. Is it going to be science-based? Is it going to be EU GMP, what is the testing system going to be? What is the registration system going to be, that you just mentioned? And what we found is that there are some markets like Germany, like Poland, like a lot of the markets that we're in, that are very rigorous in these processes. Their science based, they do their own testing, it's very formal. Now in some cases, it takes longer than people would like, but usually, they do not go backwards. And so you can have predictability in terms of those investments. The second aspect would be size of the opportunity? Is it going to be self-payer or is it going to be reimbursed? What's the size of the population? What are the overall economics that allow us to make a thoughtful investment thesis about where we're going to go. And then third is, how are we going to play that market. And we've demonstrated great flexibility, whereas in some markets, we are both the manufacturer and the wholesaler and the sales organization. And in other markets, we will just be the manufacturer and partner with world-class wholesalers and sales organizations. And so in all of that, I think we've done an excellent job. And as I mentioned, one of the benefits is, you're seeing the same companies and particularly Aurora, being successful in all of these markets. And unlike, say, Canada, usually the top five companies will account for two-thirds or three-quarters of the overall business in these European markets, whereas in Canada, it might take you 20 or 30 companies, so the benefits are there. And as I said, the same execution and the same infrastructure, EU-GMP products, GR registration, all of the work that we do on the science side allows us to sell the same products in Poland, in Germany, in the U.K. and develop great efficiencies for us, so it's difficult. It's something that we spend a lot of time on, but it's definitely paid dividends for us as you see from our results.\nMatt Bottomley: Okay. Great. I'll get back in queue, and I appreciate all the details on that, Miguel.\nMiguel Martin: You got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tamy Chen from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nTamy Chen: Great. Thanks. First question is going back to Australia. So Miguel, you talked about how the number of approvals continues to grow, a significant increase compared to 2016. I just wanted to revisit this part, like, what has really caused the Australian market to experience such rapid growth, like, we see some other medical markets that legalize, but the growth just isn't as significant. Like, has there been some further regulatory changes over these last few years that have really increased or yeah, increased the acceptance of medical cannabis amongst physicians there. Just curious what is driving this quite rapid growth.\nMiguel Martin: Yeah, Tamy. It's a great question. I think I would tell you there's probably three key aspects to this. First is that the TGA, which is the primary regulatory agency has done an exceptional job at rolling out regulations and having it be easier for all steps of the process. And so what do I mean by that? The process in which physicians or clinicians can sign up to be a prescribing physician, the ease in which pharmacies can be registered and be allowed to service the patients, the patient's ability to register through. As I mentioned, it is a very large reimbursed market, so the economics works well. They have a compassionate care program for those that are economically challenged to have access this to medical cannabis through that, so that would be the first part. The second part is, they've also been very thoughtful at the local level. So there's -- sometimes there's tension between the federal legalization and what happens at the state level, we have not seen that in Australia. And so you've seen a very specific sort of cadence and move forward. And then, I think third, culturally cannabis has been accepted in this market. And I think that those companies that have operated there have done a really good job, which is why we've seen such consolidation in market share, the largest market share company in that market, has over a 30 share. We're number two in the low 20s, and then there's one right below us. So all of that, I think, has come together. They have to be. Now unlike some other markets, we've seen -- because the TGA is being so rigorous with their authorizations and their review of acceptable products, we don't -- we think this will continue to be a market that advantages those companies that have that type of rigor to their production, to their certification, and this is all happening in the absence of other formats that we see being larger in other markets, particularly ingestibles and vapor products. And so those will be coming online and can only grow this overall market. So we're excited about it. It's a part of the world that this is sort of an important piece, and we're really, really excited about this acquisition.\nTamy Chen: Great. That's helpful. Sticking with that, I was curious to understand why now for timing of acquiring the rest of the stake in MedReleaf Australia? Is it just you've seen the market experience tremendous growth and it felt like now was the right time? And lastly, did you say that this business, Middle East Australia has a higher gross margin than your current international business? Thanks.\nMiguel Martin: Yeah. So let me take the second one first, and then I'll take the first one. So currently, we are the supplier, we are the manufacturer for MedReleaf Australia. They have their own sales organization. They have their own clinic connection organization. And so our margins were lower. So my statement was that upon acquisition, it would be similar from a margin standpoint to other markets that we have, say, in Western Europe or Eastern Europe, which are some of the highest margins you see in cannabis globally as those margins today are in the low 60s. In terms of why now, I would say, there are a couple of things. One is, as I talked to you about earlier, I mentioned earlier about our analysis about regulations, market size, and our ability to sort of leverage that and we felt that we are in an inflection point because of the size of the market, because of where the regulations were and because of our ability to leverage innovation in some of these new formats coming on. Clearly, the other side, the owners of the business also had to be aligned that this was the right time. And I can only say great things about what they've done to build this business. Like I said, the founder is an ex-pharmacist and that team has done just a superb job in building this business, and we collectively thought this was the right time to take the next step. And with the products that we have online to be able to leverage in Australia with the cash position that we have and everything else going on, the collectively, both Aurora management as well as the ownership of MedReleaf Australia felt this was exactly the right time for us to think this deal happen.\nTamy Chen: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nMiguel Martin: You’re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Miehm from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nDouglas Miehm: Yeah. Good morning. My question just has to do with capital allocation. When you look at the Australian acquisition and the amount of cash used versus shares issued. Can you walk through the decision making process there? And why you decided you needed so much dilution relative to the $10 million or so of $8 million that you paid out, especially given that your balance sheet is so much better now and you're on the cusp of turning free cash flow positive. Thank you.\nMiguel Martin: Sure. Well, Dough, I'll make a couple of comments and then I'll low Glen to get there. I think we are -- we've worked incredibly hard to take out almost $0.5 billion in the convertible debt and really want to demonstrate that the company is being incredibly thoughtful with the financial decisions that we make. Now that's not going to come at the expense of growth. And so, it was our opinion that, that was the right allocation to use that amount of stock versus the amount of cash in order to retain maximum flexibility with that cash position. And I think, I understand your point about dilution. But I think from a shareholder standpoint, if you look at that valuation and you look at the trailing 12-month revenue as of December 31, was about AUD40 million. And the fact that it's accretive day one, we believe that was the right allocation for this deal going forward. But listen, I understand the question, but all-in-all, if you look at where we are now, free cash flow positive by the end of the year, roughly $200 million in cash on hand, no debt on the cannabis business, and now with this piece coming online, which may be as large as Canada, which would make it the largest federally legal medical cannibals market in the world, we feel really good about it, and that was the structure of the deal. But Glen anything you want to add to the allocation there?\nGlen Ibbott: It's pretty thorough, Miguel. Doug, I will note, we've been very consistent in our messaging over the last couple of years that the share issuance, we've really tried to refocus that on incremental accretive new business. So it's a strategic focus as opposed to back a number of years ago, a number of cannabis companies used to fund operations. So this is not about funding operations. This is about adding that incremental revenue and margin that Miguel talked about, very accretive. The value of this is quite compelling. So all the strategic reasons that Miguel laid out. But we see shares as a valuable tool when we are looking at it strategically. So that was part of the thinking on this as well, consistent with what we've full view in the market over the last couple of years of what we reserve our shares for.\nDouglas Miehm: Okay. That's helpful. And then just maybe as a follow-up there, given that this group is going to be a reasonable sized shareholder of the company, would you expect them to be long term shareholders of the company?\nMiguel Martin: I don't know. I mean that's going to be up to the shareholders of it. We would hope everybody would be long-term shareholders of this company. But that's their decision, and I think is not -- doesn't have any bearing in terms of how we run the company of the deal or anything going forward.\nDouglas Miehm: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nMiguel Martin: You got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pablo Zuanic from Zuanic Associates. Please proceed.\nPablo Zuanic: Good morning, everyone. Miguel, just thinking about the potential acquisitions you need to make in Germany following what you did in Australia. Maybe explain the difference of your on-the-ground business model. In the case of Australia, you were shipping from Canada, right, and pretty much MedReleaf Australia was taking care of everything else. In the case of Germany, it seems to me that you have more assets on the ground, more feet on the ground, but once we have the change in the narcotics law and other changes, do you think you will need to make acquisitions in Germany or pretty much is about investing on what you have already? Thanks.\nMiguel Martin: Got it. I mean, Pablo, I think, for Australia, we found such a great partner that we were comfortable with not going all the way through. And obviously, it impacted the margin when you're just a manufacturer thus the trigger to buy the rest of it so that we could experience the same margins that we see in other parts of the world. Germany was different. And obviously, that you've been covering this for us. We, very early on, again, to go back to those three criteria. We got very comfortable with the regulators and the regulatory process. We got very comfortable with the size of the market and the fact that it was going to be a reimbursed market with also a large self-payer. And we also got comfortable with the unique proposition that they offered there to have in-country manufacturing and be aligned with the government and first mover status. It was for that reason that you're right that we have quite a significant amount of headcount and infrastructure both in Berlin where we have sales, marketing, finance, back office and very importantly, government relations work there, as well as the production team that we have at [indiscernible] and I think that shows our flexibility. And if you go east and you look at a country like Poland, we've got sales and marketing in Poland, but we don't do any production in Poland because we can bring product in at a very efficient way with our new genetics coming in from Canada. If you look at, say, a market like the Czech Republic, we work with partners. Same thing we do in Switzerland and with Austria. And so I think you have to be flexible. But at the core, you have to have the products that patients and clinicians want, and we're able to do that incredibly efficiently, out of Canada. But as markets get there, we're going to continue to make investments, and we're thrilled to have that opportunity now to be completely integrated in Australia, which will look a lot like we have in Germany.\nPablo Zuanic: Right. And just a quick follow-up in the use of Australia. So they don't have production there. Your -- the company you acquired, is that something you would look at down the road, especially when you see the case of Israel with dumping claims and the market in Israel shutting down every now and then. Is that a risk in Australia? Would you need to have local production there? And if you can expand on the argument you made about various trend in Australia to other players? Thanks.\nMiguel Martin: Sure. I’d be happy to. Just on Israel, we haven't shipped Israel in a year. But we are not -- we've had production, as you well know, in other parts of the world. And what we have found, which is really important is that in all of these environments, they allow for the importation registered or certified product. In most cases, that's EU GMP. In Australia, they've been very thoughtful. They have their own registration process and certification process, and we've worked with them on that. And so because the economics and the efficiencies of being able to do that in a centralized place like Canada, which is such an incredible place for us to grow, we can leverage the same genetics, the same process at very low energy costs and production costs and ship it around the world, that's a significant advantage for us. And we've not heard anything in Australia or none of those markets that would restrict the ability of Canadian grown, EU GMP or TGA authorized flower to come into those markets. Now if we found something locally, in any market, we've got a long history of managing a variety of different facilities. And so we definitely could do that, but we have not seen that in Australia. Now in terms of your point about restrictions, the TGA, the primary regulatory authority in Australia is incredibly rigorous in what they allow. So first and foremost, the registration process is very rigorous and their requirements are consistent with what we see in Europe, but take anywhere between eight months and 12 months for every new product to be brought in, and they review that. They do their own testing which they're reviewing the actual COAs or certificates of assurance for all of these key products, so you have to have vigilance and precision in your production. They review every aspect of the labeling and the packaging, as well as have certification for wholesale delivery and the pharmacies. It's a high bar, which is why you see concentration, and I don't think you're going to see actions in Australia that maybe you've seen in other markets. And for that reason, you see good margins. And so, we’re excited about that. We love working with the TGA. And like I said, people can get a little frustrated about the pace sometimes of progress. But when you have great markets like Australia or Germany or others, they don’t go backwards. And that’s very important from an asset allocation. And I think that’s why we’re so excited about it, and I think why we do so well there.\nPablo Zuanic: Right. Thank you.\nMiguel Martin: You’re very welcome, Pablo.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Miguel Martin for closing comments.\nMiguel Martin: Well, first and foremost, we thank everybody for your interest in Aurora. We are so excited about where we are. And as I said earlier, we've never been in better shape. Today, it was a great day to announce the progress that we've made in the core business., but as importantly, announced the acquisition of a great asset in one of the fastest-growing and largest medical cannabis markets in the world. We continue to believe medical cannabis is the best place to be in cannabis globally, and we’ve demonstrated our leadership there. So we thank everybody again, and we look forward to speaking with you soon. All the best. Bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Ananth Krishnan. Please go ahead.\nAnanth Krishnan: Thank you, Chris. We appreciate you all joining us this afternoon. On the line with me today are CEO, Miguel Martin; and CFO, Glen Ibbott. After the market closed, Aurora issued a news release announcing our fiscal 2024 second quarter financial results. This news release, accompanying financial statements and MD&A are available on our IR website and can also be accessed via SEDAR and EDGAR. In addition, you will find the supplemental information deck on our IR website. Listeners are reminded that certain matters discussed on today’s conference call could constitute forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties related to our future financial or business performance. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. The risk factors that may affect actual results are detailed in our annual information form and other periodic filings and registration statements. These documents may similarly be accessed via SEDAR and EDGAR. Following prepared remarks by Miguel and Glen, we will conduct a question-and-answer session with our covering analysts. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and then return to the queue. With that, I will turn the call over to Miguel. Please go ahead.\nMiguel Martin: Thank you, Ananth. Glen and I are hosting this call today from the Sky facility in Edmonton, Alberta, the home province of Aurora and where our story began. We are very pleased to be here at this 800,000 square foot facility that is being repurposed by Bevo Farms for orchid cultivation as part of their expansion plans. More importantly, we’re here today to discuss our quarterly results, which demonstrate the strength of Aurora’s business model. This quarter, we achieved strong revenue growth, record positive adjusted EBITDA and maintained our leadership in key markets, all of which will help us achieve our target of positive free cash flow in calendar 2024. Starting with the topline, we grew total net revenue by 30% in Q2, but the real story was the 42% growth in our medical cannabis segment, which included 122% growth in medical cannabis outside of Canada. Adjusted gross margin was 51% and increased across three of our four business segments, while adjusted EBITDA grew to $3.4 million, a $9.6 million improvement year-over-year, and our highest result on record. Q2 also marked our fourth consecutive quarter generating positive adjusted EBITDA. Our balance sheet is similarly in great shape and one of the strongest of Canadian LPs, with a cash position of over $200 million. Our convertible senior notes are down to about US$5.3 million and will be settled at maturity in February 2024. Following this repayment, Aurora’s only remaining debt will be approximately $40 million of non-recourse financing at Bevo. This healthy balance sheet is going to allow us to play offense going forward, without the weight of a heavy debt load. It is truly an exciting time for Aurora, our shareholders and our employees. Let’s now take a deeper dive into our business. In Canada, where Aurora already has the number one position in the market, we grew our medical cannabis net revenue compared to the year ago quarter through a broad and attractive product assortment, positive sales mix and innovation. With our leadership position in medical, we believe we can find opportunities for growth due to the ongoing disruption in the Canadian marketplace. We view investment in innovation as critical to our long-term success, which is why we are committing to launching a steady stream of exciting new products to the Canadian market. Innovation in Canada provides a roadmap for new product launches in our international markets. We have seen great success launching cultivars in Europe and Australia that first found success in Canada. Next generation cultivars launched in Canada in spring 2022 are now available to patients globally. In Europe and Australia, these strains provide patients with some of the highest potency and most appealing offerings in those markets. Domestically, our latest launches are now available in our medical channel and set to launch in the Canadian consumer channel in the coming quarters. Aurora made a conscious decision to focus our production network on indoor EU GMP certified facilities managed by teams who have deep experience in pharmaceutical production. We view ourselves as a medical company providing a pharma-grade product to our global patients. This focus on pharma-grade EU GMP production is a clear competitive advantage in the highly regulated medical markets evolving across the globe. In September, we introduced Honour, a new cannabis cultivar designed for veteran Aurora medical patients by veterans as part of our Strain for Heroes portfolio, 5% of net profits from the sale of Strain for Heroes products support veteran organizations across Canada. Internationally, through recent enhancements to our supply chain, we have been able to meet the increased patient demand for our pharma-grade medical cannabis across Europe and Australia while driving our per gram and per unit costs lower. In Germany, we’ve been operating since 2017 and are one of only three companies with a German production facility. This is our largest European market and we are gratified that the country is moving in the right direction with the potential for de-scheduling of cannabis from the narcotics list in the near future. We are very supportive of this effort and believe that with its passage, the German medical market could expand significantly. In Poland, our second largest European market, our regulatory expertise sets us apart, allowing us to benefit from high barriers to entry and regulatory challenges to serve our patients. Aurora held the number one market position by volume in Poland in Q2 and we are confident in our ability to meet increasing demand in the country. In Australia, which we believe is becoming the largest medical market in the world outside of the U.S., we are encouraged by our significantly higher sales volumes, as our local partner is invested in clinician education and is leveraging Aurora’s vast product portfolio to provide best-in-class medicine and support for this rapidly growing patient base. Aurora’s model -- Australia’s model, led primarily by clinician engagement, represents a more traditional pharmaceutical approach to new medication rollouts with clinicians and one we expect will be exported to other new medical cannabis markets globally. Turning back briefly to Canada, and more specifically Canadian adult use, we are benefiting from our historical investment in efficient cultivation and manufacturing and see opportunities for our Canadian adult use business to move to profitability as other market participants exit. During Q2, we introduced a bold new brand, Tasty’s, designed to deliver on taste, potency and price to the Canadian adult market. Tasty’s launched in two primary formats, vapes and infused pre-rolls, which is now ranked second behind the flower category and expected to deliver further growth. Early interest from cannabis retailers across Canada has been strong and Tasty’s represents a format with crossover appeal between channels. Leveraging an omnichannel global innovation portfolio with appeal to multiple end user groups is yet another way Aurora’s model is expected to drive profitability in the cannabis segment. Finally, our business model is starting to show the financial benefits of diversification as Bevo’s vegetable and plant propagation business continues to generate steady, predictable revenue and earnings, albeit on a seasonal cadence. By leveraging purpose-built but underutilized cannabis facilities, Bevo’s team of cultivation experts is undertaking a transformational product line extension, moving into the profitable cultivated orchids market, while continuing to grow the geographic reach of their base business. By expanding our reach in the controlled environment agricultural industry, Aurora’s shareholders can expect to benefit from the compelling long-term value creation attributes of this sector. Over the next two years to three years, we expect the acceleration of Bevo’s business plan to potentially double their current revenue and EBITDA. In short, our business model focused on global medical cannabis is succeeding across multiple categories and geographies, and we’re just getting started. I’m very proud of our team and what we are accomplishing and look forward to fulfilling our commitments with respects to topline growth, cost savings, EBITDA generation, convertible debt retirement, and importantly, positive free cash flow. And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Glen for a detailed financial overview.\nGlen Ibbott: Thank you, Miguel, and good afternoon, everyone. We’re obviously very pleased with our Q2 performance and gratified that the substantial progress we have made in executing our business transformation continues to yield tangible results for our company. Our mission to further improve our financial condition is well on track, as highlighted by our commitment to deliver $40 million in annualized savings by the end of this fiscal year. Today, our total cash balance sits at over $200 million in cash and equivalents, which is more than sufficient to reach positive free cash flow in calendar 2024. And I’ll also highlight our progress in cleaning out debt. During Q2, we repurchased approximately $41 million of our convertible senior notes through the issuance of approximately 54 million common shares. Subsequent to Q2, we repurchased a further approximately $23 million of our convertible senior notes and that was with cash. Before the end of fiscal Q4, we’ll pay off the final US$53 million of these convertible senior notes. This is a monumental improvement to our balance sheet, where we have reduced debt by approximately $531 million over the last three years. That’s an achievement that we are very proud of. Now, looking to our Q2 revenue line, we delivered growth of 30% over the comparable year ago period. Specifically, we generated a sharp increase in sales from our higher margin global medical cannabis segment, which coupled with a larger contribution from plant propagation more than offset a slight decrease in consumer cannabis. On profitability, consolidated adjusted gross margin held steady at 51% and adjusted EBITDA rose to $3.4 million, reflecting a $9.6 million improvement from last year and our highest quarterly result in adjusted EBITDA to-date. Let’s now go into our Q2 results in greater depth. Net revenue rose to $63.4 million, up solidly compared to $48 million in the year ago period. Overall, medical cannabis generated $43.8 million in net revenue, up 42% from last year. By segment, International Medical revenue was $18.4 million, up 126% from last year. And Canadian medical cannabis was $25.4 million, up 11% year-over-year. The performance of our high margin medical channels was largely due to the positive market reaction to the launch of our new Canadian-grown high-potency cultivars in our key European markets and to the continued growth of the Australian medical market. Adjusted gross margin for medical cannabis was 63%, compared to 61% sequentially and 68% in the year ago quarter. The change from last year is a result of higher revenue from our exports to Australia, where we sell in bulk to our distributor partner, as opposed to Europe, where we own the sales and distribution chain and pick up that margin as well. As usual, driven by our focus and leadership in global medical markets, medical cannabis represented about 85% of our total cannabis adjusted gross profit, an increase of 31% at $27.4 million in Q2, compared to $20.9 million in the year ago period. Consumer net -- consumer cannabis net revenue was $12 million, down 8% from a year ago. The change is partially due to our exit from the U.S. CBD business, but predominantly driven by the timing of new innovation launches. Adjusted gross margin for consumer cannabis was 27%, compared to 25% in the prior year period, with the increasing margin due to higher cultivar yields and continued efficiency improvements in production that are driving unit costs lower. In plant propagation, you may recall from our last earnings call that the revenue in Q2 and Q3 would decrease relative to Q1, due to the seasonality of this business. Normally, Bevo earns about 25% to 35% of annual revenues in the second half of a calendar year. So, with this in mind, net revenue for Bevo in Q2 is $7.2 million. That’s up from $3.3 million last year at this time. But note that the year ago period is not a perfect comparison, as we acquired Bevo in August 2022, so it did not capture a quarter of revenue last year. But Bevo performed as we expected in Q2. Plant propagation adjusted gross margins were 22%, up from 16% last year. The increase was due to product mix between vegetable and ornamental plant sales. Our consolidated adjusted SG&A was well controlled at approximately $27.7 million, down from $29.8 million in the year ago period and reflecting our ongoing commitment to keeping SG&A below $30 million. So, taken together, the solid Q2 revenue performance and well-controlled costs combined to deliver an adjusted EBITDA of $3.4 million. That’s a record for Aurora and is our fourth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Turning now to cash flow, we made progress in fiscal Q2 towards our goal of positive free cash flow. As our operations, excluding changes in working capital, used a net $13 million. This is down modestly sequentially and well down from the $37.3 million used in the year ago period. Fiscal Q2 met our expectations and keeps us on track to achieving the goal of generating positive free cash flow in calendar 2024. This is an important topic, so let me dive in a bit deeper. In our fiscal Q1 results, we explained that our target of $40 million in annualized expense reductions is expected to be realized mainly in fiscal Q3 and Q4. The efficiency initiatives and operations, including the shutdown of our Nordic production site and the sale of our Dutch assets, are now complete, and we expect to see these actions benefit us in fiscal Q3. In SG&A, we’ve already achieved some initial reductions year-to-date and many actions affecting corporate costs, which we’ve already taken, are expected to be fully realized in the second half of this fiscal year. We remain firmly on track to achieve the cost savings we’ve committed to and that support our drive to positive free cash flow. We are focused on balancing the working capital needs of both investing and growth, and executing disciplined financial management. We had a net working capital investment in fiscal Q2, due mainly to our payment of a number of annual and one-time cash items. In the quarter, annual payments totaled over $10 million for Health Canada fees, insurance expenses and employee incentive bonuses. We also paid one-time costs of approximately $3.4 million for severance and restructuring activities. Inventory and biological assets are quite stable, with demand and supply aligned and they contributed a net $2.5 million in fiscal Q2. Accounts receivable are in very good shape, but in line with the strong growth we’re seeing in international markets, we made the decision to invest about $7 million in Q2 accounts receivable. Looking forward, we expect working capital investment to improve significantly compared to fiscal Q2, as inventory remains in check, AR investment is thoughtful and annualized payments are normalized. For CapEx, we invested approximately $4 million this quarter, split evenly between maintenance and growth initiatives. Looking forward to our next quarter, fiscal Q3 2024, we expect cannabis net revenue to be similar to fiscal Q2, with the geographic mix slightly further toward the International Medical segment. For plant propagation, we expect to see seasonally reduced revenues and gross profit in Q3 that will be consistent with Q2 and in line with historical performance. To conclude my remarks, Aurora’s strong financial condition is directly related to all the hard work this team has done over the past several years and we’re pleased that our efforts are bearing fruit. We are leveraging our diversified global cannabis business with a plan to deliver dependable revenue growth and leading gross profit. We stand to benefit from a burgeoning plant propagation business and we remain committed to well-controlled SG&A. Even as we pursue M&A opportunities, we will thoroughly protect our balance sheet and continue to work towards our target of delivering positive free cash flow. Thanks very much for your interest. I’ll now turn the call back to Miguel.\nMiguel Martin: Thanks, Glen. Looking back over the last three years, Aurora has delivered $400 million in cost efficiencies, executed on our key priority of positive adjusted EBITDA and withstood the challenges and headwinds that have faced our industry. Our world-class diversified company is on a stronger footing than ever before. We are on track to deliver positive free cash flow and we will build on this foundation over the coming quarters and year to come. Operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Vivien Azer of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nVivien Azer: Hi. Thank you. Good evening.\nMiguel Martin: Good evening, Vivien.\nVivien Azer: So, Miguel, since you and Glen are at the Sky facility, I figured it’d be appropriate to ask a Bevo question. Good to hear you reiterate the target to double revenue and cash flow from that business. Last quarter, you said two years to three years, given that you are on site and the conversion is clearly underway. Any opportunity to kind of refine that timing or talk about kind of the cadence to get to that aspiration of a double? Thank you.\nMiguel Martin: Yeah. Well, thank you. I think we’re not going to give any forward looking guidance on this, but having been here and having seen this planned conversion and where it’s at for this 800,000 square foot facility, we definitely think that Bevo can expand that. Early conversations with customers and large bid box customers that you’re well familiar with have been encouraging and the market size and pricing is also encouraging. And the percentage of orchids that this facility could put online and the pricing that we’re seeing in North America versus traditional Southeast Asia all give us a lot of confidence. What I’d like to do is have a couple more months of the early read of these products in the market and see what those early selling is. Once we have that, I think we’ll provide some more guidance. I don’t want to get over my skis in terms of what this may mean, but we’re very booked on it. And if you look at other outcomes for the Sky facility particularly, this is really a good one. So, I’d ask you to wait a little bit as we try not to overpromise on what this is. But once we have clarity on it, we definitely will provide it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good evening.\nMiguel Martin: Good evening, Michael.\nMichael Lavery: Just wanted to unpack the Tasty’s launch a little bit more and I forget the exact wording, but you characterized it as I think a value to the consumer. It’s clearly medical is your focus, the higher margin and some of the other attractive elements of that. But can you explain how this fits strategically just a little bit more of why the launch and kind of what you expect going forward?\nMiguel Martin: Yeah. I mean, it’s a great question. As a company that is innately focused on medical and unapologetically is what we’re leaning into, we are seeing a lot of benefits of having both systems be healthy. And in my prepared remarks I talked about our focus on EU GMP flower, which is an incredibly important resource if you look globally, whether that’s product going into Europe or going to Australia. So, the question then becomes on rec, where we have roughly about a 1.7 share, what assets do we have that can not only help with the fixed cost of the medical system, but also give us insight and be relevant to the consumer and be able to find spots where we can make some money. So, instead of focusing on premium GMP flower in the very challenged margins of the rec business, we focused on high potency infused pre-rolls that leverage our genetics, our science, our execution and our extraction capabilities and allow us to put a product in the market that doesn’t take any resources away from those significantly higher margin businesses. The other aspect of Tasty’s is on the vape side, which obviously we have a lot of experience with and we have found what we believe to be a nice niche on vapor. And again, the resources to make those products and to achieve those margins doesn’t take anything away from what we’re doing. So, we’re trying to learn how to maximize all the fixed infrastructure that we have and produce the best company-wide margins, while allowing products to live between both segments, which is really where we maximize our overall profitability. So, we haven’t given up on rec. I mean, rec is a challenge in Canada right now, particularly in certain geographies, but there definitely are spots and pre-rolls are the fastest growing segment once again, second behind only flower at this point. And so, where we can find those spots, we will. And in a lot of cases, as those rec consumers see value in it, we can also bring some of those products to the medical channel as well.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from John Zamparo of CIBC. Please go ahead.\nJohn Zamparo: Thanks. Good evening. I wonder if you could go across the Atlantic and I wonder what brought about the exit in the Netherlands and can you give us an update on the France market, please?\nMiguel Martin: Sure. I’d be happy to. So, the Netherlands, as many of these markets are, you have to make some early bets on what is the regulatory framework going to be. I think one of the most important developments that we’ve seen is consistently international markets are allowing to import EU GMP flower. Now, it’s very challenging in many times because you test in their labs, you have to have a lot of precision. But first and foremost, from a production standpoint, when you compare the production costs and the leverage and efficiencies we have in ramping up Canadian production versus production in that marketplace, it just didn’t make sense from a production standpoint. Secondarily, the evolution of what was going to be this pilot test in that market really has not transpired. And so, given the incredible strength that we’re seeing in other markets, not only ones we talk a lot about, say, Germany and Poland, but also Australia and the U.K., with limited resources, it made sense to focus there. In terms of France, it’s a very topical question. We’ve just recently learned a little bit more about their pilot. So, we’ve been in it from the beginning. There were nine tenders, so to speak, of different products. Three of them were flower. We had all of those. And recently, what they’ve announced, importantly, is an extension of that system for about five years and we expect that that’s going to dovetail into the medical cannabis regime. They have said no inhalables, as they define as both flower and vape. And so, the other formats will take the lead. We have pivoted off of flower. We’ll be doing extracts there. Now, listen, as with all regs, things evolve and that doesn’t mean forever no on inhalables. But that’s the current situation. But it’s a big market with a lot of adjacent population. It’s obviously very close to great markets, such as the U.K. and Germany. So, we’ll see how it evolves. But right now, that’s sort of the latest on it, John.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Doug Miehm of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nDoug Miehm: Hey. Good evening. My question has to do with the international side of things as well. One of the things that you mentioned, Miguel, is just that, you anticipated outside of the U.S. that Australia could become the largest medical cannabis market. Could you maybe add a little bit of detail as to why you think that’s going to be the case, especially given the size of the German population relative to Australia?\nMiguel Martin: Yeah. It’s a great question. So, first and foremost, syndicated data and the modelling of these markets is in its infancy. And so, I would tell you, the caveat to much of this is based on the data that we have and nothing that we see today in cannabis, possible exception of some aspects of Canada, will replicate the modelling that you would see in, say, Nielsen or IRI or the other data systems that you’re used to. So, as it pertains to Australia, that market is very nascent. There is a data set there called NostraData. And NostraData works with pharmacies that have signed up and it’s a retail takeaway data. And they model the dollar size of that market and market share. They do it both from a total standpoint and an SKU and you can get directionally what that looks like. Secondarily, the lead regulatory agency in that market, which is the TGA, has a market size projection based on the number of prescriptions and prescribers, and we’d be happy to provide that if anyone wants to take a look on it. That is public from the TGA. It looks like directionally that Australia is roughly, you know, around C$400 million and C$450 million a year and growing rapidly and what that percentage is, I wouldn’t say. And that is at or a little bit bigger than the Canadian medical system and is bigger than the German system. Now, just the other sort of points of how you triangulate that given the size of the German population, we believe that the percentage of adults in the German medical system is 0.1% and in Canada, it’s 1%. Now, I don’t have those percentage usage numbers for Australia. But that, I think, directionally is a good way to get to how do you get the size of market?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Tamy Chen of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nEmily Larsen: Hi. Good evening. This is Emily for Tami. So just sticking with the German market, there seems to be some progress in the German parliament towards rec legalization. So how are you thinking about their medical program platform and the rec opportunity over there at this point?\nMiguel Martin: Emily, thanks for the question. So, I would tell you, we have a quite a bit of infrastructure and people in the German market. As I mentioned, we have one of three production facilities. We have an office in Berlin. We have what we believe to be a really strong GRGA organization there. So our read on Germany we think is quite strong and we are optimistic about the plan legislation to de-schedule cannabis in Germany and that will have a significant impact on patients, clinicians, and importantly, pharmacies accessing medical cannabis. And we’ve seen significant changes in markets when that de-scheduling happens and you’ve seen that in other places. We’re monitoring it closely. There are some important votes coming up in the legislature in December and January. And I think importantly, we believe this will expand the overall medical component of it. Now, as I mentioned, that 0.1% of the adult population in the system versus 1% of Canada, there’s a lot of upside. The other part that, maybe gets lost a little bit is, how difficult it is to be successful in Germany and how few companies are doing that. You have less than 10 companies in Germany that account for roughly 90% of medical sales. If you were to look at Canada, say just rec as an example, you’d have to get probably the 90 companies to get to the same percentage. Now, as it pertains to your question on rec, we believe this is further off and I know there was a lot of optimism about what that may look like, but the reality is that that has to work through the EU system and that’s going to take a little bit longer. There’s been some discussion about initial steps about social clubs, homegrowing, possession limits that would sort of expand it. But I would tell you that it’s our belief that most of the progress that you’ll see in Germany will be on the medical side. The other part of Germany is it has a lot of influence on Poland, which is very quickly becoming a significant market on that. We’re comforted by the fact that, while not every country is going to have the same regulations, there is a coalescing around commonalities in testing, labeling, manufacturing standards. And as I mentioned before, on the medical side, there’s been no prohibition of importing EU GMP products out of Canada as an example. I know you can have EU GMP in other countries, but that creates a lot of efficiencies and really makes the list of winners in a market like Germany be a short one. We won’t be the only one, but we’ll definitely be one of them.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Eric Livshits of ATB Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nEric Livshits: Hi. This is Eric Livshits for Frederico Gomes. So I’m just wondering, you’ve seen quite a nice improvement in gross margins this quarter. Is that largely a function of just the higher medical mix or are there kind of other efficiencies at play here? Thank you.\nGlen Ibbott: Yeah. Thanks for the question. So I’ll take that up and then Miguel can add if needed. We’ve got kind of all the levers of our company moving in the right direction. We have invested significantly in centralization and efficiencies in the production assets in Canada. As you know, over the last two years, three years, we’ve gone through a significant transformation, but a big part of that was to gain the efficiencies to scale in production and really focus on those, on driving costs out of the systems, unit costs in particular. Same time, we’ve been realizing the benefits of the investment in science and genetics and so the yields coming out of the system right now on the flower side, continue to impress at producing quality flower with desirable attributes, whether it’s high potency or interesting terpene profiles and doing that with the yields increasing at point 60% or better over some of our legacy cultivars means we get much more out of a facility and a unit cost again going down. So that fundamentally underpins an improvement in our margins. Of course, you’re right. As we get more and more into medical sales and become a bigger and bigger part of our business, they will definitely -- the high average selling prices definitely contribute to the increasing margin. So we do expect to see that continue to move in that right direction. As we said, we finished the Nordic closure and that’s a big piece of bringing that production back to Canada and supplying Europe from Canada. We think we’ll see our margins in Europe continue to improve over the next while as well. Miguel?\nMiguel Martin: Yeah. I guess the other thing is, we focus on the margins, and so, as we’ve stated, our goal is to be free cash flow positive and then continue to grow that. You can’t do that just on the topline growth. We’ve seen that be attempted. You really have to make money in what you do. So we walk away from unprofitable categories, we walk away from unprofitable geographies and we focus on those geographies where we can make money. The other aspect of medical cannabis is those margins are, no pun intended, are very sticky. Because the taxes and the economics for the wholesaler and the pharmacy come off that wholesale list price and much of this business is in a reimbursed model, there is not the compression that you would see, say, in traditional rec businesses. And so we’ve seen very steady margins throughout that overall system and if you look at traditional pharmaceutical businesses, while we like a 62% or 65% margin, that’s quite low there. So I think it takes a lot of work. It’s somewhere we’re focused on. And we think it’s a key cornerstone that differentiates Aurora from our competitors is that focus on profitable high margin business.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I would like to turn the call back to Miguel Martin for closing remarks.\nMiguel Martin: Well, I want to thank everybody for their time and their interest in Aurora. This has been an incredible three years to get us where we are. We’re nowhere near where we think we can get. And so we’re proud of what we’ve done this quarter, we know it’s just one of many quarters to go and we look forward to sharing that story with all of you. Hope everybody has a safe and good evening. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you very much, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."
