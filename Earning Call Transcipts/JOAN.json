I'd like to remind everyone that comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These safe speak as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events, new information or future circumstances, please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the company's earnings press release and the recent filings with the SEC.  During the call today, management may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the company's earnings press release, which was filed today with the SEC and posted to the Investor Relations section of JOANN's website at investors.joann.com. On the call today from JOANN are the co-leaders of the Interim Office of the CEO; Chris DiTullio, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer; and Scott Sekella, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the question-and-answer portion of the call, we will also be joined by Rob Will, Executive Vice President and Chief Merchant for JOANN.  I will now turn the call over to Chris for his prepared remarks. Please go ahead. \nChristopher DiTullio : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. To start, we are pleased with our third quarter results and importantly, have increased our top line full year outlook. Our third quarter appeared to focus on operational retail fundamentals with an agile, data-driven approach helping us to win in our core categories, while over-delivering on the implementation and execution of our Focus, Simplify and Grow cost-savings initiative. This has enabled us to stabilize the overall business right-size our expense structure and capitalize on trending growth areas. With continued progress in another quarter of strong execution against our strategic priorities, we were able to deliver these results despite what remains a dynamic and challenging consumer and discretionary retail environment. We remain focused on controlling what we can control, while maximizing our opportunities in this market and delivering a great customer experience, both in-store and digitally.  Also during the quarter, supported by the use of advanced data analytics and in conjunction with our sequentially improving average unit costs, we actioned a strategy to selectively pulse promotions on a close to real-time basis to drive shopper conversion and maximize gross profit dollars. With this nimble approach, we are making great progress on delivering the right pricing strategies to drive shopper conversion and have a high degree of confidence that we will continue to further optimize average unit retails as our AUCs are expected to be flat to slightly down in Q4 before turning -- fully turning to a tailwind in fiscal 2025. In fact, our average unit costs turned favorable in October and are significantly improved on a new -- on our new inventory purchases. Our e-commerce performance was a quarter standout, driving double-digit improvement year-over-year. Anchored on our region react business approach, we identified customer experience and site performance opportunities and swiftly implemented enhancements that resulted in an immediate uptick in shopper conversion.  We have also made great progress on delivering a better and faster overall online experience setting the stage for continued growth in this important channel. As we look to continue to grow our e-commerce business, we are also working on a number of initiatives to drive gross profit dollars, including further work we are doing to optimize operations and utilization of our West Jefferson, Ohio Omnichannel Fulfillment Center. The expanded use of the omnichannel fulfillment center will not only lower order fulfillment costs, but will also lead to an overall improved customer experience. We are fast tracking these efforts and look forward to updating you on our progress on future calls. And finally, we continue to successfully engage with our core customers, registering increases in our customer counts. In fact, we saw more of our known customers shop in the quarter versus last year, resulting in positive transaction growth from this customer cohort, signaling strength in our enthusiast base.  While we are pleased with this increased engagement, as you have heard from other retailers, we are also experiencing some basket pressure by way of fewer items per transaction and are seeing customers shopping closer to their project needs versus stocking up and adding to their stash as in years prior. That said, and importantly, these customers are shopping with us frequently and converting well, validating that the JOANN brand positioning is strong, and our assortments are resonating. Although there is much work ahead of us, and we remain cautious due to continued uncertainty in the broader retail environment, the strategic shifts we have implemented this year, combined with our ongoing cost reduction strategies and the strong engagement over Black Friday week, give us confidence to increase our full year top line outlook while maintaining our bottom line outlook. Now I'll briefly review the highlights of our third quarter performance. Total sales were $539.8 million, down 4.1% versus the prior year period, which includes a 70 basis point headwind from the strategic pull forward of our Halloween assortment we discussed in the second quarter while also providing a margin benefit in the period.  Importantly, normalized for the Halloween shift, third quarter total sales were essentially in line with second quarter trend when you adjust for the category pull forward in both quarters. With that in mind, we see this as a clear signal the business is stabilizing. For the full season, our largely owned brand Halloween assortment performance was strong, registering double-digit year-over-year growth with higher realized margins, validating the success of our Read and React business approach. Notwithstanding the continued strong category performance, we see opportunity to grow this business even further next year. Expanding on our category performance for the quarter, we are winning in our core categories, which have a strong correlation to our broader business. For example, we saw a notable double-digit strength across needle arts, fleece and sewing technology.  In needle arts, we saw broad demand across both our yarn and stitch categories, fueled by our strategic decision to balance our best-in-class national brand assortment while also offering a great value with broad selection of our owned private brands.  With regards to fleece, our strong performance was buoyed by the social media trend of tie-knot blankets, which emerged in early Q3. While this is typically one of our highest volume fabric categories in the fall and winter months with our core customer, we are seeing great engagement from new and younger shoppers coming to JOANN for their fleece tie blanket supplies. To capitalize on this trend, we went live in November with a new and disruptive social media campaign, #GETTINGKNOTTY, K-N-O-T-T-Y on TikTok and Instagram. This campaign targets the under 35 demo and focuses on friends, couples and families, gathering together and making tie knot blankets for special occasions in their lives. We are encouraged with our initial results and engagement from our social media followers and are seeing a positive impact both in stores and online.  In sewing technology, we saw the greatest gains in purchases of sub-$500 machines from new sales entering the market, a strong indication we are attracting younger sales to JOANN.  As the category leader in sewing and fabric, we see this positive trend is a great indicator of overall health and strength across all generations of the sewing industry. With regards to headwinds in the quarter, as expected, due to our strategic pullback of non-Halloween seasonal merchandise, such as traditional autumn and fall-related decor and floral, we experienced a total seasonal merchandise headwind of approximately 150 basis points in the quarter. We also continue to experience persistent headwinds in our craft technology business, which for the quarter was worth approximately 100 basis points. It's important to highlight that as a result of our strategic pullback of non-Halloween seasonal inventory receipts, we saw exceptionally high sell-through rates with meaningfully improved profitability over the prior year, including contributing to reduced clearance inventory. As I mentioned earlier, our e-commerce performance was a standout in the quarter, we registered strong e-commerce growth of 11.5% over last year, a significant acceleration from our trend in the second quarter with growth of 3%.  Our e-commerce sales accounted for 13.1% of total company sales in the period, reflecting penetration expansion of 180 basis points. More specifically, to change our prior trends, we executed improvements to our site by enhancing our cart and checkout experience, resolving issues that provided the most friction to the customer purchase journey substantially improving performance speed of the site and beginning an intensive focus and edit of our product assortments, all leading to improvements in experience and shopper conversion. We also saw broad-based improved traffic with more effective marketing spend and SCO benefits from the work we've done on our core site. We continue to prioritize and identify new opportunities to improve the online experience and drive shopper conversion.  And finally, as I also mentioned, we are over-delivering on the implementation and execution of our Focus, Simplify and Grow initiative, which Scott will go into further detail on. Our focus throughout all of this work is to realign our costs to our current revenue base, which has stabilized at pre-pandemic levels.  As part of this work, during the quarter, we made the difficult decision to right-size our corporate overhead aligned to that principle and are confident in how we are allocating resources to both support and drive the business forward. Additionally, we are pleased with the results from our recently rolled out store labor initiative. We remain focused on operating as effectively and efficiently as possible, including allocating store labor to better serve customers during peak traffic periods in reducing non-value-added tasks. Our store teams are doing a great job of navigating this holiday season with new team structures and ways of working and are delivering the friendly clever ally customer experience we promised to fulfill. With that said, I would like to take this opportunity to extend my gratitude and appreciation to our entire JOANN team. Throughout a year of great change, their unwavering dedication to helping every customer find their creative happy place is what makes JOANN truly unique and drives my confidence and excitement in our future.  Turning on to inventory. We entered the fourth quarter with very clean inventory quality with less than 5% of our total inventory in our clearance bucket. Our exposure on fashion and seasonal inventory is relatively low with basic inventory compromising approximately 60% of our total, an increase of 400 basis points to last year. Additionally, with the success of our retail pricing initiative, combined with our focus on driving core categories and our read and react business approach, unit sales velocity has accelerated nicely and allowed us to invest back into additional basic inventory to meet the increasing demand. To provide a bit of color on the current quarter, although we have many important selling days ahead of us for the holiday season, we are pleased with our trends thus far. As we all know, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are no longer single day events. And like many others in retail, we extended our Black Friday event to a full week in Cyber Monday ran for multiple days.  We are pleased with how we competed in this dynamic retail climate. Our customer is increasingly shopping us across both physical and digital channels, and we are seeing mobile shopping increase at higher levels than before. Our holiday floral and holiday decor assortments are resonating, and we are tracking to achieve our plans in these important categories. Broadly, the categories we saw success with in Q3 have continued to be strong in the early stages of Q4. While we continue to see pressure from the shopper on items per transaction, which does provide a headwind to the total basket, we are pleased with the transaction velocity and traffic we're driving to our stores in joann.com.  Before turning to outlook, I wanted to take a moment to mention our recent corporate responsibility impact report that we published in November, which outlines JOANN's corporate responsibility results for 2023. In the report, we highlight our impact across our evergreen strategic pillars, which we take very seriously and implement across the business every day. These include creating an environment where our team members can be their authentic selves and contributed at the highest level, minimizing carbon footprint by taking action throughout JOANN and supplier operations, powering reusability and customers to tie environmental responsibility to a greater purpose and appealing to inspiring, supporting our diverse customer base and communities. I encourage you to review the report which you can access at investors.com.  On to outlook. As we look to the final quarter of the year, we are encouraged by the progress we're seeing in the business, which is a direct result of the many strategic actions we've taken and continue to execute on. As I mentioned, we are increasing our full year top line outlook and maintaining our bottom line guidance, which Scott will elaborate on shortly. We remain keenly focused on winning in our core categories, further utilizing enhanced data-driven read and react capabilities and continued implementation and expansion of our Focus, Simplify and Grow cost reduction initiatives.  In conclusion, I am proud of what we've accomplished over the past few quarters and recognize there is more to do. We have made great progress to right-size our expense structure. We have strengthened our already profitable store base, with over 95% of our stores generating positive 4-wall cash flow. We have made tremendous strides in our e-commerce business to improve the performance and experience with the results speaking for themselves. And we are attracting and capturing younger customers at an increasing rate through social media and the growth of our sewing technology business while continuing to engage our core. We will continue to work tirelessly on the many initiatives we discussed to fuel sales growth, improved profitability and drive shareholder value.  With that, I hand it over to Scott to review our Q3 results and outlook in more detail. Scott? \nScott Sekella : Thanks, Chris. As Chris mentioned, we continue to execute our proactive actions to enhance our read and react capabilities in the third quarter. More specifically, our advanced data analytics and progress of our strategic initiatives continue to drive our results. As we close out the year, we remain cautious given the continued challenging retail environment, However, our consistent execution of our growth priorities and prudent management of the business gives us confidence to increase our top line full year outlook and maintain our bottom line view.  Now let me turn to the third quarter results. In the third quarter, net sales totaled $539.8 million, a decline of 4.1% compared to last year with total comp sales also decreasing by 4.1%. As Chris mentioned, utilizing our read and react business approach, the strategic pull forward of our Halloween assortment in the second quarter, which was a season's success impacted our third quarter sales by approximately 70 basis points.  Read and react approach also allowed us to win in our core categories and capitalize on other marketplace opportunities. And as Chris mentioned, from a category perspective, we saw notable strength in the quarter in needle arts, fleece and sewing technology. This performance is again a direct result of our data-driven approach to make sure we provide the right products prices and choices for our customers and our core customers are continuing to engage in this space in a meaningful way. The success of our strategy to selectively pulse promotions on a week-in and week-out basis, to best drive shopper conversion and maximize gross profit dollars is another great example of how we are utilizing data analytics to stay close to our consumers as we drive towards improved overall performance. Our non-Halloween seasonal category was a 150 basis point headwind to comp sales in the third quarter due to our strategic inventory reduction.  In addition, Craft Technology continued to underperform and represented a headwind of 100 basis points in the quarter. Our gross profit in the third quarter was $282.1 million, an increase of 0.4 point from the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year increase was driven largely by continued improvement in import freight costs, which had a 450 basis point positive impact on our gross margin. On a cash basis, in the third quarter, we realized $16.8 million of cash benefit from lower ocean freight rates. Our gross margin was 52.3% in the third quarter, an increase of 240 basis points from the third quarter of last year. The year-over-year 240 basis point improvement was primarily driven by the previously described 450 basis point impact from continued improvement in import freight costs, a 60 basis point favorable product category mix impact driven by momentum in our core sewing categories a 55 basis point benefit from improved domestic carrier freight rates and associated surcharges and a 40 basis point tailwind due to improved clearance activity.  This was all partially offset by a 210 basis point decline due to the flow-through of inflationary product cost increases, a 100 basis point decline from lower overall pricing driven by actions taken to optimize average unit retail levels, a 40 basis point decline due to increased shipping costs associated with growth in our e-commerce business and a 15 basis point decline from lower vendor allowances. Drilling down, our average unit costs were up 2.4% to the third quarter of last year, which is an improvement from what we saw in the second quarter of this year. We continue to anticipate our average unit cost comparisons to sequentially improve throughout the course of the year as we cycle these inflationary increases and, as Chris also mentioned, we expect Q4 AUCs to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. Average unit retails declined 1.2% relative to the same period last year.  Turning to expenses. Our third quarter fiscal 2024 SG&A expenses increased by 1.6% from the third quarter of last year. The primary drivers of the year-over-year SG&A increase include: severance and other upfront costs to implement our cost reduction initiatives, asset impairment and disposal expenses, inflationary pressures on labor and other costs, and we lapped a favorable general insurance reserve reduction in the prior year period. These increases were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies, including savings generated through our new store labor operating model as well as optimized corporate headcount. Favorable incentive and stock-based compensation activity and lower store preopening and closing costs. Our net loss in the third quarter was $21.6 million compared to a net loss of $17.5 million in the same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter was $37.5 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $40.2 million in the third quarter of last year.  Moving on to our balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents were $28.3 million at the end of the third quarter. As of October 28, 2023, we had $72.1 million of availability on our revolving credit facility. Our face value of debt, net of cash at the end of the third quarter was $1.14 billion. This reflects an increase of $90 million from the same period last year and a leverage ratio of 5.7x as measured by net debt and finance lease obligations relative to credit facility adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis. Our inventory at the end of the third quarter was down 9% compared to the same period last year due to the optimization of inventory receipts and the reduction in excess import freight costs. We continue to maintain low clearance inventory of less than 5% of total, leaving us well positioned to leverage our read and react capabilities to further drive the top line. During the quarter, we continued to execute against our focused Simplify and Grow cost reduction initiative.  As you are aware, we have previously identified $200 million of cost savings across supply chain product and SG&A expenses. As we implement these cost savings initiatives, we are driving meaningful cash flow improvement in fiscal year 2024 that will continue beyond this year. I am pleased to share that based on our execution to date, we are increasing this $200 million target to $225 million, with the majority of the over delivery coming in SG&A and supply chain. Drilling down, as mentioned last quarter, we finalized new agreements with our ocean freight carriers that have put us in a position to continue to experience tailwinds and will have us over-deliver on the targeted $100 million of supply chain cost reductions. We also continue to execute our broad-based initiative to reduce product costs across our business. A significant number of our domestic and import vendors have already agreed to price concessions, and we continue to expand the work into all of our product categories giving us confidence we can deliver the target of $60 million of product cost reductions.  Additionally, in the third quarter, we made meaningful progress on implementing SG&A reductions and building efficiencies across our organization. First, we are very pleased with the rollout of our store labor initiative that was implemented at the beginning of Q3. Similar to what we experienced during the pilot of this initiative, in addition to reduced costs, we are confident we are enhancing the in-store selling experience as we have converted more labor hours to customer-facing sales activities. And critically important during the peak holiday selling period, we have rightsized labor hours to more effectively staff our stores during the busiest selling hours of the day. Also, as Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we made a difficult decision to right-size our corporate expense structure back to pre-pandemic levels now that revenue has returned to pre-pandemic levels. Cross-functionally, we continue to focus on deploying our resources in new ways to drive better, more efficient and more effective ways of running the business while staying true to our strategic priority of providing high-quality in-store online experiences for our customers.  Finally, during the quarter, we closed on the sale-leaseback of our corporate facility in Hudson, Ohio, for a price of $34.5 million. We intend to use the proceeds to invest in the business. Now, let's turn to our fiscal 2024 full year outlook. We are continuing to utilize our read and ran capabilities through advanced data analytics to capitalize on new opportunities as they arise and focus on the controllables. Our inventory position is in great shape, and we remain diligent on prudently managing all expense aspects of the business while over-delivering on our Focus, Simplify and Grow initiative. We are cautiously optimistic for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and believe our strategic initiatives, combined with our third quarter top line performance and the ongoing implementation of our cost reduction initiatives, leave us well positioned to deliver on our updated full year fiscal 2024 outlook.  In terms of our top line, based on our year-to-date performance and line of sight for the remainder of fiscal year 2024, we are increasing our full year outlook and now expect net sales relative to fiscal year 2023 to be down between 1% and 2% compared to our prior outlook of down between 1% and 3%. We as we outlined last quarter. This range is inclusive of a 53rd fiscal week in fiscal year 2024, which is worth approximately 2%. Based in large part on the cash benefit of the implementation of our Focus, Simplify and growth cost reduction initiative and working capital and capital expenditure optimization actions we believe we will continue to deliver a significant year-over-year improvement in free cash flow. However, given our decision to buy into some inventory positions in core categories in Q4, we now expect that we will see a year-over-year improvement in free cash flow for fiscal 2024 to be between $115 million and $135 million versus previous expectations of $150 million and $170 million.  With this, we expect to end the year with inventory down low to mid-single digits. Also, our full year outlook for capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions, is still expected to be between $35 million and $40 million. It is important to remember that much of the work we are doing related to our Focus, Simplify and Grow initiatives will result in a significant cash benefit in fiscal 2024, while we expect that much of the annualized P&L benefit will be realized in fiscal 2025 due to the time it takes for inventory and related costs to cycle through our balance sheet. That said, we are reiterating our full year outlook for adjusted EBITDA between $85 million and $95 million.  In conclusion, we're pleased with our third quarter performance and are ready to deliver the fourth quarter and holiday season with a continued focus on our enhanced data-driven read and react capabilities, bringing in our core categories, and the continued implementation of our Focus, Simplify and Grow cost reduction initiatives. We're very proud of our team and their continued execution against our strategic initiatives in the quarter, which in turn further strengthens our competitive positioning. We're confident in the future and believe that we are well positioned to deliver on our outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year and capitalize on any market opportunities for JOANN.  With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Laura Champine with Loop Capital. \nLaura Champine : Now that the sales guide is just for that effectively for Q4, can you give us more information on what you expect in terms of store count year-on-year or any changes in the store base sequentially? And what kind of a comp range that would imply to hit your full year guide? \nScott Sekella : Laura, it's Scott. Nice to talk to you. In terms of store count, nothing has really materially changed the couple of years we've gone down. I think it was 15 last year. It will probably be some similar this year. As we do open new stores and do a lot of two for ones and those sorts of things. So there's not a material change to the path we've been on with our store count. \nLaura Champine : Got it. And then on comp, would that imply a sequential improvement in the same-store sales trend? \nScott Sekella : It basically implies the trend we've been on this year is what I would say from a comp perspective. \nOperator: The next question is from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler. \nPeter Keith : On the comp headwinds that you've been calling out with some of the craft technology and strategic inventory reductions. Maybe just to give some visibility in the out quarters, but when might we think about lapping those and no longer see them as headwinds. \nChristopher DiTullio : Peter, it's Chris. So what we've really been able to do this year is reset that baseline in a lot of those seasonal businesses. So strategically pulling back early in the year on spring and summer decor categories, investing in Halloween, strategically pulling back in autumn and fall, we really see that reset being the new baseline that we start from. So on the seasonal into 2025. So on the seasonal side, I would say we'll be a lot more comp to opportunistic next year. On the craft technology headwind side, we continue to read and react to the business. You heard us say for the full year before, we thought it would be still a headwind, and it was a little more of a headwind than we thought it would be in the third quarter. So we continue to evaluate that and adjust as we can. \nScott Sekella : We are looking to see how we can reassort if need be, if the headwinds persist within craft technology as well. \nPeter Keith : Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess, with the update to the sales guide and the EBITDA guy holding, I think what it's implying is quite a bit of gross margin improvement year-on-year. Now we've been kind of using the adjusted gross margin. We were stripping out those excess freight costs that you guys had boxed out in prior quarters. So my thinking is right with Q4, is there a notable swing factor from Q3 to Q4 in terms of year-on-year gross margin change? And if so, what are the factors to that? \nScott Sekella : Yes, Peter, it's Scott. I think the biggest change in Q4 is sort of what we called out with the AUCs turning from a headwind to a tailwind. We expect them to be flat to slightly down in Q4 and then that trend we do expect to continue into 2025. But I will say that does give us some of the fuel to react to the pricing for our customers because our approach is really to maximize gross profit dollars. And so we're going to be opportunistic where we see opportunities to win. \nPeter Keith : And so the AUC declines are intriguing, and it sounds like something that could actually increase as a benefit next year. Could you help us unpack that a little bit and understand I guess the mechanism to get to lower cost? \nScott Sekella : Yes, a lot of it is coming from our Focus, Simplify Grow initiative where we've been negotiating all year, lower product costs. And so keep in mind, with our long term, call it, a 9-month on average, it takes a while for those units to come in and then start to sell through. So we're getting to that inflection point in Q4, and that's what we've been talking about where we're going to see a much bigger P&L benefit next year because of that versus this year. \nOperator: The next question is from Cristina Fernández with Telsey Advisory Group. \nCristina Fernández : I wanted to follow up on Peter's question around the implied fourth quarter profitability. Because on the EBITDA margin, it looks like it's going to expand pretty meaningful to double digits. So is it primarily on the gross margin? And what can we expect from the SG&A? I guess how much of a benefit is having the 53rd week as well? \nScott Sekella : Yes, I can touch on that, Cristina. The -- in terms of -- I'll build off the margin piece. So SG&A will also be providing a bunch of that benefit in Q4 is now -- we've talked about some of our store labor structure changes that we made. We talked about the corporate structure changes that we made. So those will all be providing benefits in Q4 as we go forward. So we have both the margin benefit we talked and then the SG&A tailwinds from all of that as well. In the 53rd week, while we haven't disclosed exactly, it is a tailwind for adjusted EBITDA in the quarter as well. \nCristina Fernández : And then the second question I had was around the decision to invest in inventory. Can you give more details about what categories or product lines, it is and it's mostly inventory to be sold through in the first half of next year. \nRobert Will : Cristina, it's Rob. I'll take that one. So we have been talking for a few quarters now about the strength in our textiles business, in particular, certain categories across the fabric business. And as we mentioned on this call, needle arts, that's where the majority of our incremental spend is making sure that we're in stock. We've also been talking about our basics business. And as we have seen some strength in those core categories, the basic side of the business that go on with those projects, things sell in construction or film and fiber. We are increasing our in stocks to make sure that we are ready for the full project as our customers come in. \nCristina Fernández : And the last question I had -- any update on the competitive environment? Do you see anything different in the third quarter and through the Black Friday period? \nChristopher DiTullio : Cristina, it's Chris. I would say the competitive environment continues to be really pretty rational overall. I mean as we all know, the discretionary retail environment is tough, and we are being thoughtful in using our data to find the best we can for our customer. That said, we haven't seen anything that gives us pause on the promotional front with competitors. And we're pretty confident in how we're navigating the current period. \nOperator: The next question is from David Lantz with Wells Fargo. \nDavid Lantz : So I was just curious if you could talk about the sales trajectory a little bit in a little bit more detail. I think you had mentioned that Q3-to-date trends were tracking in line with Q2, but you ended the quarter down 4.1%. So I was just curious if you could provide any additional color there. \nChristopher DiTullio : It's Chris. Yes, the way we looked at the quarter is when you normalize for the Halloween pull forward that we experienced, which was a meaningful impact positively to Q2. But the negative result was it took some sales out of Q3. So when you pull that impact out, the business was really very consistent between Q2 and Q3. And what we're really seeing is some of the categories that Rob called out and that I talked about in the earlier portion of the call, we're seeing really good strength in fleece, in needle arts and sewing technology, which gives us a lot of confidence as we head into the fourth quarter. \nDavid Lantz : Got it. That's helpful. And then can you provide an update on how you're thinking about interest expense and potential debt pay down in the coming quarters? \nScott Sekella : David, it's Scott. Right now, we're getting the benefit kicking in of our interest rate swaps, so that definitely helps. But the main thing we're focused on is getting this business back to the historical profit levels that it's been and generating cash so that we can handle that debt as it comes due in 2026 and 2028. \nOperator: The next question is from Steven Forbes with Guggenheim. \nSteven Forbes : I wanted to follow up on working capital, and you gave some nice color on inventory for the year-end. But payables as a percentage of inventory has fluctuated pretty dramatically over the years here. So any sort of framework to think about where payables as a percentage of inventory ends the year? \nChristopher DiTullio : So if you're really asking about how does that inventory composition breakdown. So I think I said on the call, inventory is going to be down low to mid-single digits. What I would tell you is the unit piece is actually going to be up slightly and the cost will be down. So that's -- getting back to how Rob gave some color around the categories we're buying into and seeing that. That's how the composition is going to work, especially as our AUCs continue to become tailwinds. \nSteven Forbes : And then maybe just a quick follow-up, focusing on free cash flow, right, given the change in the guidance for the year, I'm not sure if you can maybe help us frame sort of how you see the evolution of free cash flow next year in a particular scenario, whether that's sort of a flat sales scenario just given what's happening with AUC? Is there sort of a -- is there a path to flat? Or is there any sort of framework you can provide us to help think through sort of the free cash flow outflow of the business as these benefits start flowing through? \nChristopher DiTullio : Yes. I mean we're still working through the exact plans for next year. But when you see the momentum that we have with the cost savings and then on the product cost side as well, I see a path to positive free cash flow next year, not just back to even in a sort of flat sales scenario. So we're really excited about the momentum we have on the cost savings side, and none of that is contingent on any sort of top line growth. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session, and the conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jason Wood, Vice President of Strategy and Corporate Responsibility. Please go ahead.\nJason Wood: Thank you, and good afternoon. I'd like to remind everyone that comments made today may include forward looking statements which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These statements speak as of today and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events, new information or future circumstances. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the company's earnings press release and the recent filings with the SEC. During the call today, management may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the company's earnings press release which was filed today with the SEC and posted to the Investor Relations section of JOANN's website at investors. joann.com. On the call today from JOANN are the co-leaders of the Interim Office of the CEO, Chris DiTullio, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer, and Scott Sekella, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the question-and-answer portion of the call, we will also be joined by Rob Will, Executive Vice President and Chief Merchant for JOANN. I will now turn the call over to Chris for his prepared comments.\nChris DiTullio: Thank you, Jason. To those of you joining us today, good afternoon, and welcome to JOANN's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. In what remains the dynamic consumer environment, we were pleased with our second quarter results, highlighted by continued progress and strong execution against our strategic priorities, which enabled us to deliver sequential top-line improvement, gross margin improvement and registered solid operating performance. Although we remain cautious due to continued uncertainty in the broader retail environment, the strategic shifts we implemented in the second quarter, combined with our ongoing cost reduction strategies, give us confidence we are on track to deliver on our full year outlook. These strategic shifts were focused on building a new foundation for how we operate to better deliver short-term wins, mitigate potential risks and set-up JOANN for long-term growth. This foundational approach is anchored on a read-and-react system for the business to respond quickly and action opportunities or challenges as they evolve using advanced data analytics to shape and support our decision making process. This coincided with a return to operational retail fundamentals, our continued focus on winning in our core categories, while leveraging and capitalizing on the unique opportunities for JOANN in the consumer marketplace. In the second quarter, these opportunities translated into improved results through the deliberate pull forward of our Halloween seasonal product offering, the strategic execution of our Make Room campaign and continued investment in our assortment, breadth, and depth, particularly in our textiles related categories. Through these strategic actions we delivered innovative assortments and more targeted promotions that resonated with a broad range of consumers. These efforts, coupled with our focus on delivering a great experience for customers whether they shop in our stores or online and identifying ways to operate our business as effectively and efficiently as possible sets the stage for continued progress ahead. We saw signs of this progress in the second quarter with continued sequential improvement, not only on top line sales, but also on our gross margin. Importantly, our comparable sales performance during the quarter ended on a high note with July representing our strongest monthly comparable sales results in over two years. While we remain cautious and monitor the ever-evolving consumer environment, we believe this momentum and the ongoing implementation of our strategic actions leave us in a good position to seize on opportunities and adapt to challenges moving forward. As an example of how we are already leveraging this approach, we utilized our data driven read and react capabilities to deliberately pull forward our seasonal Halloween seasonal product assortment. This pull forward was enabled by our strategic approach to optimize our seasonal assortments through directing investment into the seasons where we win across a number of our product categories. Halloween is a season where few in retail can offer a more complete solution. From decorating the inside and outside of your home, crafts for kids and the materials needed to make custom costumes and seasonally themed textile projects, we appeal to customers of all ages and interests. As we planned for this year, we read the market trends on Halloween and strategically invested and pulled it forward in a way that was disruptive. This meant pulling back on spring and summer seasonal buys, which allowed our inventory position to be cleaner. and enabled us to free up the space and get more Halloween product, most of which comes from our own brands in stores and on the selling floor up to four weeks earlier. Customers responded immediately to the shift and are making purchases with less promotional activity and at a variety of price points, including our eight-foot animated skeleton with a manufacturer's adjusted retail price at $499, resulting in higher margin sell-through for the entire category. Additionally, as we look to leverage the unique opportunities that JOANN has, we distorted our inventory and merchandise and presentation to capitalize on the changing consumer marketplace and launched our Make Room campaign. Make Room is our uniquely curated collection of many of the products students need to decorate their dorm room or apartment as they return to college. Our Make Room campaign was a valuable strategic play for multiple reasons. First, it allowed us to market a broad assortment of our basic products, including textiles, in a new way and without deep discounts, creating a low risk, high reward touch point that appealed to current and new customers alike. Additionally, Make Room leaned into social media trends where students across the country found creative ways to design their own physical happy place as they head back to campus and then post and share their creativity with their followers. By leaning into these trends, we were able to establish JOANN as a destination for these important products, expose them to a broader assortment of our offerings, and increase the relevance of JOANN to younger customers. We are excited by the success of this event as we saw unit lifts across multiple categories of basic products included in our Make Room set. Moving forward to our e-commerce business. We continue to see growth and an increase in profitability from our digital channels. In the quarter, e-commerce sales outpaced store walk-in sales and the company overall, growing at a rate of 3% compared to last year, accounting for 12.1% of revenue in the second quarter, a 60 basis point increase in penetration rate over the same period last year. This growth is being fueled by multiple factors. First, we continue to refine and expand our online product offerings and are particularly encouraged by the growth in our textiles related online businesses. Second, through data analytics, we updated our paid media allocation strategy and increased our investment approach, which drove additional traffic to our digital channels with corresponding increased site conversion. Lastly, we made technology improvements to our website and mobile shopping experience which produced immediate benefits. As we go into the back half of the year, we will continue to emphasize a shop-your-way seamless and engaging digital experience, focusing efforts on improving the customer journey and driving additional growth. To conclude, we are encouraged by the top line sales results, gross margin improvement and the progress on the ongoing implementation of our focus, simplify and grow initiative, which Scott will discuss in detail momentarily. Based on the dynamic consumer retail environment, we remain laser focused on continuing to use the strategic foundation we are building to capitalize on growth opportunities and mitigate risk. This includes continuing to use our read and react capabilities to drive quick business decisions, leveraging advanced data analytics, getting back to running the business using sound fundamental practices, and focusing on winning in our core business categories while capitalizing on the unique opportunities JOANN has in the broader competitive marketplace. As I wrap up, I would like to take a moment to recognize our team members. The positive results we delivered in the second quarter, including the forward shift of Halloween, the development and implementation of our Make Room event, and the ongoing execution of our strategic priorities would not have been possible without their hard work. With these new initiatives and strategic priorities, we challenged our team members who work in our stores, distribution centers, omni-fulfillment center and across our corporate offices to deliver new approaches to drive value position the company for long term growth. They responded with creativity, commitment, and agility that our team members are known for and I could not be prouder of the dedicated professionals who work across this company. As we look to build on the positive results and weather any challenges presented by the uncertain retail environment we face, we will need them to continue to step up and have absolute confidence they will. With that, I will turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Sekella, to give a more detailed rundown of our second quarter financial results and our year-to-date performance before wrapping with answering your questions.\nScott Sekella: Thank you, Chris. As Chris discussed in his remarks, during the second quarter, we proactively took action to drive both near-term and long-term success by enhancing our read-and-react capabilities through advanced data analytics. With a renewed focus on operational retail fundamentals, we were able to deliver improved performance in the second quarter, including building momentum in both top-line sales and gross margin. While we remain cautious about the back half of the year, we believe this momentum, combined with leveraging our read-and-react approach, and our focus on operational excellence, leaves us well positioned to deliver on our full year outlook. With that, let me turn to the second quarter results. In the second quarter, net sales totaled $453.8 million, a decline of 2.1% compared to last year, with total comparable sales decreasing by 2%. This represents our third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in comparable sales, and our best quarterly year-over-year performance since the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. Within the quarter, sales improved sequentially as well. While some softness from the first quarter persisted into the beginning of second quarter, we saw a month-over-month improvement in June and July. As we reached the back half of the second quarter, we saw positive comp sales in five of the last six weeks and July comp sales were positive, representing our best month of comp sales in 28 months. This improvement was due, as Chris mentioned, in large part to our utilization of advanced data analytics to drive a read-and-react approach, which fueled our ability to win in our core textile related categories and capitalize on some marketplace opportunities that were unique to JOANN. The positive impact from this approach was acutely apparent in the strategic pull forward of our Halloween assortment, which had a 90 basis point positive impact on comparable sales in the quarter. In addition to the top line sales momentum, we continue to see healthy consumer engagement in our core textiles related sewing and craft businesses. This strength includes positive performance in our sewing technology category, which serves as a leading and underlying indicator for other core categories moving forward. This performance is a direct result of our data driven approach to make sure we provide the right products and choices for our customers and our core customers are continuing to reengage in this space in a meaningful way. As expected, our non-Halloween seasonal category was a significant 180 basis point headwind to comparable sales in the second quarter due to our strategic inventory reduction. Additionally, we continue to see craft technology as a headwind to comparable sales. While we have been strategically managing this risk and performance is down across the marketplace, craft technology continued to account for a decline in comp sales of 140 basis points in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and we anticipate it will continue to serve as a dissipating headwind as we move deeper into the fiscal year. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit in the second quarter was $232 million, an increase of 8% from the second quarter of last year. This year-over-year increase was driven largely by continuing improvement in import freight costs, which had a 580 basis point positive impact on our gross margin. We recognized $300,000 of excess import freight costs in the second quarter, a decrease of $26.8 million compared to the same period last year. These excess import freight costs have now fully cycled out of our inventory and will not continue going forward. On a cash basis, in the second quarter, we realized $28.9 million of cash benefit from lower ocean freight rates. Our gross margin on a GAAP basis was 51.1% in the second quarter, an increase of 470 basis points from the second quarter of last year. This represents the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in GAAP basis gross margin comparisons. The year-over-year 470 basis point improvement was driven by the previously described 580 basis point continuing improvement in ocean freight, and a 50 basis point increase due to improved domestic carrier freight rates and associated surcharges, partially offset by the timing of cycling of capitalized domestic freight costs. This was all partially offset by a 95 basis point decline in our merchandizing margin and a 65 basis point decline due to the timing of clearance activity. To provide additional color on our second quarter merchandising margin, the decline of 95 basis points compared to the same period last year can be attributed to the continued lapping of some of the inflationary cost increases we experienced during the prior year. Our average unit costs were up 2.6% to the second quarter of last year, which is an improvement from what we saw in the first quarter of this year. As we mentioned on our first quarter call, we anticipate our average unit cost comparisons to sequentially improve throughout the course of the year as we cycle these inflationary increases. Average unit retail increased 0.5 points relative to the same period last year. Turning to expenses. Our second quarter fiscal 2024 SG&A expenses increased by 4.4% from the second quarter of last year. The primary drivers of the year-over-year SG&A increases include, severance and other upfront costs to implement our cost reduction initiatives, the reinstitution of our incentive compensation programs, and general insurance and asset impairment expenses. These increases were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies, including the strategic management of labor hours in our stores, which more than offset inflationary pressures on labor, particularly at our store locations and other costs, the continued optimization of advertising spend and lower store pre-opening and closing costs. Our net loss in the second quarter was $73.3 million, compared to a net loss of $56.9 million in the same period last year. Our loss in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter was $21.9 million compared to a loss of $8.9 million in the second quarter of last year. Moving on to our balance sheet, our cash and cash equivalents were $19.1 million at the end of the second quarter. As of July 29, 2023, we had $58.4 million of availability on our revolving credit facility which is tied to a lower borrowing base due to our inventory optimization efforts, including cycling higher excess import freight costs and our actions to strategically lower inventory receipts. Our face value of debt, net of cash, at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.096 billion. This reflects an increase of $90 million from the same period last year and a leverage ratio of 5.0x as measured by net debt and finance lease obligations relative to the credit facility adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis. Our inventory at the end of the second quarter was down 14.4% compared to the same period last year due to the optimization of inventory receipts and the reduction in excess import freight costs. We continue to maintain a low clearance inventory of less than 6% of total, leaving us well positioned to leverage our read and react capabilities to further drive growth. In conjunction with all of this work, we continue to drive our Focus, Simplify and Grow cost reduction initiative. On our last call, we shared that we had fully identified the targeted $200 million of cost savings across supply chain, product and SG&A expenses. We are actively executing on these identified savings to drive meaningful cash flow improvement in fiscal year 2024 and beyond. With the success of this initiative, we have challenged ourself go deeper and we can now share that we have line of sight to over-deliver on the original $200 million target. As part of these annualized cost savings, we have now finalized new agreements with our ocean freight vendors that will put us in a strong position to over-deliver on the targeted $100 million of supply chain cost reductions. Additionally, we initiated a broad-based initiative to reduce product costs across our business. This effort will yield significant product cost savings. A wide assortment of our domestic and import vendors have already agreed to price concessions and we continue to expand this work into all of our product categories, giving us giving us confidence we can over-deliver the targeted $60 million product cost reduction. Also in the second quarter, we saw significant positive movement in the implementation of our SG&A reductions including costs related to store labor and information technology. These savings are focused on finding new ways to work that represent a better, more efficient and more effective way to deploy our resources while staying true to our strategic priority of providing a high quality in-store and online experience to our customers. To this end, during the second quarter, we rolled out a pilot program designed to align our in-store labor pattern to better support where and how our customer is shopping with us. Through our evaluation of the results, we saw that not only did the pilot reduce cost, it also enhanced the in-store selling experience by converting more labor hours to customer-facing sales activities and rightsizing these labor hours to more effectively staff stores during the busiest selling hours. At the beginning of third quarter, we expanded this pilot to the entire fleet and are already generating meaningful savings. In addition to these enhancements to our in-store labor pattern, we created new ways of working from an information technology standpoint in the second quarter. This included taking action to execute on savings to reduce organizational and third-party labor expenses, eliminate redundant systems and processes and improve infrastructure performance. We believe these new ways of working help us likely exceed our $40 million SG&A cost reduction target. Across the entirety of our Focus, Simplify and Grow initiative, we continue to leave no stone unturned as we look for additional potential savings and as mentioned earlier, we now have line of sight to over-delivering on the initial $200 million target. Now, let’s turn to our fiscal 2024 full-year outlook. While we were pleased with our second quarter performance, we are approaching the back half of fiscal 2024 cautiously because of the continued inflationary pressures and persistent uncertainty in the broader retail environment. We are using our read-and-react capabilities to control what we can control and capitalize on new opportunities as they arise. We believe that this approach, combined with our second quarter top line performance and the ongoing implementation of our cost reduction initiatives, leave us in a position to deliver on our full fiscal year 2024 outlook. In terms of our top-line performance, based on our year-to-date performance and line of sight for the remainder of fiscal year 2024, we are updating our full year outlook to be more precise and anticipating that net sales relative to fiscal year 2023, will be down between 1% and 3% instead of down between 1% and 4% as we outlined in the first quarter. This range is inclusive of a 53rd fiscal week and fiscal year 2024, which is worth approximately 2%. Driving meaningful cash improvement remains on of our key focuses for fiscal year 2024. Based in large part on the cash benefit of the implementation of our Focus, Simplify and Grow cost reduction initiative and working capital and capital expenditure and optimization actions, we believe we will deliver a significant year-over-year improvement in free cash flow and are reiterating our outlook that over the full fiscal year 2024, we will see a year-over-year improvement in free cash flow between $150 million and $170 million. To support this, we are lowering our full year outlook for capital expenditures, net of landlord contributions, by $5 million, to be between $35 million and $40 million. As described earlier, the cash benefit of our Focus, Simplify and Grow initiatives will be felt heavily in fiscal year 2024 and the mostly annualized P&L benefit will not be realized until fiscal year 2025 due to the time it takes for inventory and related costs to cycle through our balance sheet. With that being said, we are reiterating our full year outlook for adjusted EBITDA between $85 million and $95 million. Note that the fiscal 2024 includes a headwind from reinstituting our incentive compensation program which is partially offset by the benefit of the 53rd fiscal week. In conclusion, we remain focused on delivering value for shareholders. As we move through fiscal year 2024, we are focused on strengthening our top line in an uncertain consumer environment and delivering significant cash flow improvements by emphasizing the fundamentals that have historically driven our success. Based on the factors we have discussed today, including our enhanced data driven read-and-react capabilities, the continuing focus of winning in our core categories and leveraging the market opportunities that we are uniquely positioned to address, the continued implementation of our Focus, Simplify and Grow cost reduction initiatives and the dedicated team members working on our stores, distribution centers and corporate offices, we believe we are well positioned to deliver value to our shareholders and hit our full fiscal year 2024 outlook. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from David Lance with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nDavid Lance: Hey, guys, thanks for taking our question. So the fiscal ‘24 outlook embeds a pretty sharp improvement in adjusted EBITDA in the second half. So curious if you can talk about how you're thinking about the moving pieces in Q3 and Q4 as well as just at the gross margin and SG&A lines?\nScott Sekella: Yeah. Hey, David, it's Scott. I can take that one. So yeah, I mean, traditionally, keep in mind, our profit is at its peak in the back half of Q3 and in Q4. So the way we see the top line stabilizing in the back half as well as more importantly, our cost reduction initiatives really starting to take hold, that's what gives us confidence that we're going to be able to hit that EBITDA outlook given where we are year-to-date.\nDavid Lance: Got it. That's helpful. And then just on the commentary around comps being positive in July, curious how things are trending quarter-to-date as I'm just trying to square that versus now that top line being down 3% to down 1% for the rest of the year?\nChris DiTullio: Hi, David. It's Chris. Yeah, as we enter -- excuse me, as we enter the third quarter, I would say here in August, we're seeing the trends really comparable to the second quarter overall. We talked on in the script about Halloween kind of pulling forward and that did help July by, I think, 90 basis points. So we know that we had some of that pull forward in July, but in the second quarter, we're seeing pretty -- in the third quarter, we're seeing consistent performance to the second.\nDavid Lance: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nLaura Champine: Thanks for taking our question. Can you just remind us on the balance sheet management? I heard your call out that this $58 million in liquidity. But is there a cleanup provision that would impact you if you don't have the fourth quarter that you expect? And then it looks like you were careful to control accounts payable. Is that likely to be a source of cash as we move through the year along with inventories?\nScott Sekella: Hey, Laura, it's Scott. I can tackle that. So, keep in mind, as we move into our peak season now and I've touched on how our availability is tied to the borrowing base, which is tied to inventory. We move into a peak season. We'll have the full amount of our ABL available to us. So that will increase through the balance of the year -- through the balance of the calendar year. So that will continue to increase availability as we go. And there's [nothing really tied to] (ph) if we hit this EBITDA level. In terms of the working capital, working capital has been a significant tailwind for us year-to-date. I anticipate that'll be a little bit worse in the back half, but we will still for the full year have a working capital tailwind, but it'll dissipate from this point on as we've got a lot -- as we start to lap our strategic inventory reductions that started occurring in the back half of last year and we've already realized a lot of that in the beginning part of this year.\nLaura Champine: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nCristina Fernandez: Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to see if you can provide more color on the SG&A outlook for the back half this quarter, at least based on my calculation without some of the one-time items, SG&A expenses were still up. So should we think about the back half improvement being primarily gross margin or will SG&A be up -- sort of be a sort of leverage as well as we move through the year?\nScott Sekella: Yeah. Hey, Christine, it's Scott. I can tackle that. SG&A as we go, a lot of our cost reduction efforts, as I mentioned, are being implemented now and we'll continue to get in executed through the balance of the year. So I just -- I do anticipate SG&A to start to improve. There are some items that we have called out like our incentive compensation program that will continue to be a headwind to the extent that we continue to deliver because there was no incentive compensation last year. And this year, it's pretty steady. So, we won’t get the benefit of that. We will still have the ongoing sort of headwind from the incentive compensation program.\nCristina Fernandez: And then, I wanted to understand better the -- your approach to seasonal -- it seems like you're taking some sort of targeted investments as you mentioned in Halloween. I guess, how are you thinking about the back half the holiday assortment, in particular, are you leaning into that this year and where should we expect inventory to end the year?\nRob Will: Hi, it's Rob. Yeah, so we talked on the last quarter call about spring and summer and the fact that we had pulled back in that, opened up room for Halloween, which is, Chris had mentioned is a great differentiator for us. We also love Halloween because we drive incremental footsteps into the box. We will be pulling forward our holiday sets as well this year to again capitalize on that traffic. We see the back half across our seasonal businesses, we expect to be slightly positive year-over-year as we get into the holiday season, again, focused more on decorating and creating craftable projects for the holiday season, which is a differentiator for us.\nScott Sekella: Hey, Christine, it's Scott. To follow-up on your inventory piece, as I noted, we were down 14% in Q2. As we leverage our read-and-react capabilities, we do see some additional inventory purchases coming in the categories where we're winning. So I still expect inventory to be down year-over-year at year-end, but to a lesser degree, probably in the mid-single digit range.\nCristina Fernandez: Thank you, and good luck this quarter.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jason Wood, Vice President Strategy and Corporate Responsibility. Please go ahead.\nJason Wood: Thank you and good afternoon. I'd like to remind everyone that the comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. These statements speak as of today, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events, new information or future circumstances. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in the company's earnings press release and the recent filings with the SEC. During the call today, management may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures can be found in the company's earnings press release, which was filed today with the SEC and posted to our Investor Relations section JOANN’s website at investors.joann.com. On the call today from JOANN are the co-leaders of the Interim Office of the CEO, Chris DiTullio, Executive Vice President And Chief Customer Officer; and Scott Sekella, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the question-and-answer portion of the call, we will also be joined by Rob Will, Executive Vice President And Chief Merchant for JOANN. I will now turn the call over to Chris for his prepared comments.\nChris DiTullio: Thank you, Jason. Good afternoon, and welcome to JOANN’s first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. I want to start today by acknowledging the recent retirement of Wade Miquelon as JOANN’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Wade spent seven years at JOANN serving as CFO before becoming President and Chief Executive Officer in 2019. During his time as CEO, Wade helped JOANN navigate periods of growth and challenge, including our initial public offering and our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On behalf of JOANN, I would like to thank Wade for his leadership during this time here and wish him the best as he moves on to his next chapter. Our Board of Directors has commenced a search to find a permanent replacement and that effort is well underway. While that search is ongoing, Scott Sekella, our Chief Financial Officer and I have been appointed to lead the interim office of Chief Executive Officer. In our role leading this office, we remain focused on delivering value for our shareholders. To do this, our focus in fiscal year 2024 is to deliver significant cash flow improvement and strengthen our top line by emphasizing the fundamentals that have made JOANN the nation's category leader in fabric and sewing and a strong competitor in the arts and crafts space. This approach represents a back to basics mindset in which we are strengthening our focus on winning in our core sewing and crafting categories [indiscernible] high-quality in-store and online experience with emphasis on driving operational excellence and efficiency. To support this approach, we are leaning in on delivering innovative assortments with a strategic mix of owned, national and partner brands. A significant piece of this strategy is a continued investment in our owned brands. By building our portfolio of owned brands, we can customize our product assortment using a customer first lens, improve margins through direct sourcing and value engineering, all while exercising greater control over product quality and supply chain efficiency. Our investment over the past few years in owned brands such as Place & Time, Big Twist, Top Notch and Pop! is already delivering value. Owned brand sales, which represent nearly half of our total outperformed the total company sales in the first quarter by nearly 500 basis points, with gross margin impact between 400 basis points to 600 basis points higher than the balance of our products. Owned brand penetration also increased 2% in the first quarter and we expect this trend to build in the back half of fiscal year 2024. As we move forward, we believe our continued investment in owned brands combined with strategic national brand partnerships will enhance our innovative assortment of products and strengthen our position in both our core selling and craft categories. As we look next at how we provide a differentiated in-store experience, we are focused on developing creative approaches to driving store productivity. This involves the holistic look at our stores to identify opportunities where a new or relocated location makes sense or where store refresh can help improve brand and customer experience, including better utilizing space for our core selling and craft categories. That said, we recognize that physical space is only one part of a great in-store experience. As a result, we continue to look for ways to make it easier for our team members to deliver great service and truly be friendly clever allies to everyone who shops in our stores. This includes looking at ways to optimize our store labor hours to the key selling periods, delivering training support and simplifying the execution of our visual merchandising tactics so that our team members are ready and available to engage with our customers and drive sales. Recognizing that the way people shop our assortments also continues to evolve, our broader strategic priorities in fiscal 2024 also include working to make the JOANN brand ubiquitous through seamless and engaging digital touch points and compelling omni-channel offerings. We are committed to reducing friction across all customer touch points which includes working to optimize customer fulfillment by leveraging our network of stores and distribution centers more efficiently to maximize our e-commerce fill rates and accelerate delivery time to customer. Additionally, our customer continues to love our buy online and pick up in store or curbside options as we enable the Shop Your Way service model. Our customer is responding and is evidenced by increasing engagement and shopping through our mobile app, which has over 15 million downloads and provides a fully omni-channel effectively. Underlying this strategic focus is our continued effort to operate as effetely and efficiently as possible. This starts with our focus, simplify and grow initiative. Launched in the back half of fiscal year 2023, this initiative is a critical tool as we look to reduce costs and drive cash flow improvements. When combined with other ongoing operational efficiency efforts, such as our continued emphasis on and utilization of a data driven decision making infrastructure, focused simplifying growth is an important driver of our ability to build for the future by reinvesting in our core strengths and growth strategies. Our focus, simplify and grow initiative targets, as a reminder, approximately $200 million of annualized cost savings in three general buckets, including approximately $100 million in supply chain costs, $60 million in our cost of goods sold and another $40 in SG&A costs. Initially, we had planned for the identification of these cost savings to be completed by early fiscal year 2025. While Scott will speak to the specifics in greater detail, we have begun capturing significant supply chain cost savings through decreased domestic and international freight and through our vendor negotiations have clawed back some inflationary increases in our cost of goods with more to come. Additionally, our investment in owned brands continues to help reduce product costs as well. Through this work and our ongoing efforts to reduce SG&A expenses, we now have full line of sight to the $200 million total and are leaving no stone unturned as we look for further cost reductions. As anticipated, these cost savings have supported significant improvement of $89 million in year-over-year free cash flow improvement in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and will help move our adjusted EBITDA back towards historical levels in fiscal year 2025. We believe that by delivering on these foundational strategic priorities, creating a differentiated in-store experience making the JOANN brand ubiquitous across customer channels and continuing to drive operational efficiency and effeteness. JOANN will be well positioned to create value in the near term and reinvest in the things that will drive long term growth. Before getting into more detail about our first quarter performance, I do want to take a moment to recognize our team members. I could not be prouder the dedicated professionals who work across all aspects of our company. The team members in our stores, distribution centers, omni fulfillment center and across our corporate offices truly are our greatest asset. As we move forward through fiscal year 2024 implementing our strategic priorities will require our more than 20,000 team members to display a passion, commitment and flexibility they are known for as we work to inspire creativity in our customers and ourselves and help everyone find their happy place with JOANN. With this approach as a foundation, I will now provide some highlights from our first quarter fiscal year 2024 performance. For the first quarter, we delivered net sales of $478.1 million, decline of 4% compared to the same period last year. Gross margin on a GAAP basis was 52.1%, an increase of 380 basis points compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Top line sales started strong in the quarter in February and early March. However, like many other retailers we saw a decrease as we moved into and through April. This deceleration coincided with the decline in consumer confidence driven by continuing inflationary pressures, rising interest rates and the accompanying concerns over potential recession. We will obviously continue to monitor consumer sentiment and the pressure it is putting on the discretionary portion of the economy and we will strategically adjust as necessary. That said, we remain optimistic. We will be able to deliver on our full year outlook, which Scott will walk through in a few minutes, due to healthy customer engagement in our core sewing and craft categories and our strategic focus on baseline cost reductions. Our merchandise category performance across the quarter was mixed. On the positive side, our core sewing and craft businesses performed well during the first quarter. We are seeing strength in our textiles related sewing and craft businesses, along with the supplies that support those activities. This is critically important as it illustrates the effectiveness of our strategic focus on winning in our core categories and demonstrates that our core customer is also reengaged in the space. It was also supported by the launch of DITTO in the first quarter. DITTO, to remind everyone, is our 50-50 joint venture with SINGER, Viking, PFAFF. This innovative product which brings the pattern business into the digital age is in its early stages of rollout at both JOANN and Singer, Viking gallery locations and is gaining attention with sewing enthusiasts across the country. On the merchandise headwind side, we do continue to see craft technology as our primary challenge to positive comparable sales. While our data indicates we're outperforming the industry, sales pressure from craft technology was significant in the quarter, accounting for a decline in comparable sales of 150 basis points. We expect this headwind to continue as we move deeper into fiscal year 2024. Additionally, we have also made strategic pullbacks in higher risk seasonal categories and while currently a headwind to the top line is supporting higher overall gross margin and company profitability. We also continue to see strength in our e-commerce business. In terms of performance in the first quarter, our year-over-year change in e-commerce sales outpaced walk-in sales and the company overall, declining at a more moderate rate of 1% compared to last year. Overall, e-commerce sales accounted for 11.8% of revenue in the first quarter, a 30 basis point increase in the penetration rate over the same period last year. Much like the overall business, we saw positive sales growth in our core sewing and craft categories across the quarter, while craft technology, a business that is highly penetrated online was our primary headwind accounting for 390 basis point decline in comparable e-commerce sales. With all of this in mind, we recognize there is work to be done. While we can't control macroeconomic uncertainty, we will remain focused on driving value for our shareholders. Through executing on the strategic priorities I've outlined today, including the execution of our focus, simplify and grow initiative, along with our first quarter performance gives us clear line of sight to not only delivering significant full year-over-year cash flow improvement, but also to hitting our fiscal year 2024 outlook. With the great capabilities, commitment and passion of our team members, I'm confident we can build on our first quarter results and position JOANN for long term success moving forward. With that, I will turn it over to our CFO, Scott Sekella to give a more detailed rundown of our first quarter financial results and a forward look at fiscal 2024 before we wrap up with answer your questions.\nScott Sekella: Thank you, Chris. As Chris discussed in his remarks, our strategic priorities in fiscal year 2024 remains centered on winning in our core sewing and craft categories, providing a great customer experience in our stores and online and continuing to find new ways to operate as efficiently as possible. By emphasizing these fundamentals, which help make JOANN the nation's category leader in sewing, we believe that over the course of fiscal 2024, we will be able to meaningfully improve cash flow, strengthen our top line, and begin expanding adjusted EBITDA towards more historical levels. With that in mind, today I'll provide a deeper recap of our first quarter results and provide details about our full year outlook for fiscal 2024. In the first quarter, net sales totaled $478.1 million, a decline of 4% compared to last year with total comparable sales also decreasing by 4%. Through the quarter, sales were strong in February and March but decelerated in April. While this coincided with declining consumer confidence, we remain optimistic about our fiscal 2024 sales outlook due to healthy customer engagement in our core sewing and crafting businesses, our increased emphasis on our strategic priorities which Chris discussed and the ability to optimize our promotional cadence to meet customer demand in the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment. On a GAAP basis, our gross profit in the first quarter was $249 million, an increase of 3.4% from the first quarter of last year. This year-over-year increase was driven largely by continuing improvement in import freight cost which had a 500 basis point positive impact on our gross margin. We recognized $3.9 million of excess import freight costs during the first quarter. This figure reflects a $25 million decrease to the same period last year as we continue to benefit from the improving conditions in the spot market. On a cash basis, in Q1 we realized $21.7 million of cash benefit from lower ocean freight rates. This was one of the drivers of our $89 million year-over-year free cash flow improvement in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, for the full fiscal year 2024, we anticipate excess import freight costs, which are treated as an add back for non-GAAP measures to be approximately $90 million less than last year and fully cycle out by the end of the second quarter. Our gross margin on a GAAP basis was 52.1% in the first quarter, an increase of 380 basis points from the first quarter of last year. This continued the trend of sequential improvement in our year-over-year GAAP basis gross margin comparisons. As described a moment ago, we continue to benefit from cycling the extremely high ocean freight costs that we faced last year. The year-over-year 380 basis point improvement was driven by the 500 basis point increase from continuing improvement in ocean freight costs and a 40 basis point increase from improved clearance activity. These increases were partially offset by a 100 basis point decline in our merchandising margin, a 40 basis point decline due to the timing and cycling of capitalized domestic freight costs, partially offset by improved carrier rates and a 20 basis points of higher shrink, primarily in our stores, which has sequentially improved from the previous quarter. To provide additional color on our first quarter merchandising margin, the decline of 100 basis points compared to the same period last year can be attributed to the continued lapping of some of the inflationary cost increases we experienced during the prior year. Our average unit costs were up 5.1% compared to the prior year period. We do expect our average unit cost comparisons to sequentially improve throughout the course of the year as we cycle these inflationary increases and begin to reap the benefits of the reduction and cost of goods sold negotiated with our vendors as part of the focus, simplify and grow initiative. Average unit retail increased 2.7% relative to the same period last year. Turning to expenses. Our first quarter fiscal 2024 SG&A expenses increased by 1.5% from the first quarter of last year. This increase was driven by incremental costs related to incentive and stock based compensation as well as inflationary pressures on labor, particularly at our store locations and other costs. With that being said, we were pleased with our ability to manage SG&A expenses despite these pressures through actions such as the strategic management of labor hours in our stores and our continued optimization of advertising spend as we shift to more digital channels as well as lower medical benefit costs. We continue to assess for opportunities to optimize our SG&A expenses as part of our focus, simplify and growth cost reduction initiative, and I will give more color on that shortly. Our net loss in the first quarter was $54.2 million compared to a net loss of $35.1 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $3.5 million compared to $18.6 million in the first quarter of last year. Moving on to our balance sheet. Our cash and cash equivalents were $19.7 million at the end of the first quarter. As of April 29, 2023, we had $61.3 million of availability on our revolving credit facility, which is tied to a lower borrowing base due to our inventory optimization efforts, including cycling higher excess import freight costs and our actions to strategically lower inventory receipts. Our face value of debt net of cash at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.033 billion. This reflects an increase of $109.4 million from the same period last year and a leverage ratio of 4.8 times as measured by net debt and finance lease obligations relative to credit facility adjusted EBITDA on a trailing 12 month basis. Our inventory at the end of the first quarter was down 13% compared to the same period last year. This decline was driven by a $32.3 million year-over-year reduction in capitalized excess import freight costs, as well as our plan to strategically lower inventory receipts. This approach allowed us to de risk in the right areas, primarily our seasonal categories so that we can lean in on receipts to support our emphasis on winning in our core sewing and crafting businesses. Fueled in part by the strategic inventory receipt reduction, we continue to maintain a low clearance inventory of less than 5% of total. Our inventory position remains clean leading us well positioned to capitalize in the evolving demand environment as we leverage test, read and react capabilities. In conjunction with all this work, we remain laser focused on meaningful cash improvement in fiscal year 2024. We have initiated multiple actions to support this focus and these efforts have supported a significant $89 million year-over-year improvement in our first quarter free cash flow. This includes our focus, simplify and growth cost reduction initiative, which, as Chris mentioned, targets $200 million of annual cost reductions in three broad categories across all areas of our business, including approximately $100 million of supply chain costs, approximately $60 million of product costs and another approximately $40 million of SG&A. Since launching this effort late in fiscal year 2023, we have worked diligently to identify cost reductions in all three buckets. We can safely say that we have identified the full targeted $200 million of annual cost reductions and we are now focusing on implementing and executing these initiatives. This implementation includes taking proactive steps to solidify and as possible, build on the significant positive impact of reduced ocean freight costs. We are finalizing new agreements with our ocean freight vendors that include favorable contract rate, putting us in a strong position to continue to benefit from these savings and potentially over deliver our $100 million supply chain cost target. Additionally, we continue to identify product cost savings. Many of our RFPs are still in process, but we are confident about our ability to claw the inflationary increases we saw last year. In terms of SG&A, we are identifying ways to more efficiently deploy our resources to support value creation and drive top line activity. This includes optimizing store labor through four wall work simplifications, optimizing our labor mix and reducing administrative hours. As well as driving greater efficiency in our information technology spend. As we take this approach, we are staying grounded in our strategic priority of delivering a differentiated in-store experience by looking at identifying efficiency gains that not only lower costs, but make it easier for our in-store team members to deliver the quality service our customers expect. While we have already identified the targeted $200 million of annual cost reductions and are now implementing these initiatives. As Chris said, we are leaving no stone unturned as we look for additional potential savings. With these identified cost reductions, a significant first quarter year-over-year improvement in free cash flow and the operational results we saw in the first quarter, we believe we have a clear line of sight to delivering on our full fiscal year 2024 outlook. In terms of our top line performance, we anticipate that net sales relative to fiscal year 2023 will be down between 1% and 4%. This range is inclusive of a 53rd fiscal week in fiscal year 2024, which is worth approximately 2%. We believe the healthy customer engagement we are seeing in our core sewing and craft categories will aid in providing a buffer to our top line in light of the challenging and uncertain macroeconomic environment our customers continue to face. As we previously mentioned, driving meaningful cash improvement is one of our key focuses for fiscal year 2024. In the first quarter, we delivered a significant year-over-year improvement in free cash flow, and we anticipate additional improvement as we move through the full fiscal year. We are projecting that over the full fiscal year 2024, we will see a year-over-year improvement in free cash flow between $150 million $170 million. The significant drivers of this forecasted improvement include the continued implementation of our focus, simplify and growth cost reduction initiative, as well as working capital and capital expenditure optimization actions. For fiscal year 2024 we are projecting capital expenditures net of landlord contributions between $40 million $45 million. While the cash benefit of focus, simplify and grow initiative will be felt heavily in fiscal year 2024, the mostly annualized P&L benefit will be realized until fiscal year 2025 due to the time it takes for inventory and related costs to cycle through our balance sheet. With that being said, we do anticipate adjusted EBITDA between $85 million $95 million. Note that, fiscal 2024 includes a headwind from reinstituting our incentive compensation program which is partially offset by the benefit of the 53rd fiscal week. In conclusion, we remain focused on delivering value for our shareholders. As we move through fiscal year 2024, we are focused on delivering significant cash flow improvements and strengthening our top line by emphasizing the fundamentals that have made JOANN the nation's category leader in fabric and sewing with one of the largest assortments of arts and crafts products. While still facing an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we are executing on a series of strategic priorities that will help us deliver that value. Based on the factors we have discussed today, including the significant year-over-year improvement in our free cash flow, the continued implementation of our focus, simplify and grow cost reduction initiative and our operational performance in the first quarter, we believe we have a clear line of sight to delivering on our full fiscal year 2024 outlook. With that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and- session. [Operator Instructions] [ Technical Difficulty] I believe David's line is muted. I still can't hear him. Can I move on to the next question.\nChris DiTullio: Yes. Please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [indiscernible] with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant: Good afternoon. This is [Ray Marin] (ph) on for Steve Forbes. I wanted to focus on the 2 million reactivated customers during 2022. Curious if you can discuss any incremental learnings from this cohort year-to-date? What strategies are in place to keep this consumer engaged for the remainder of the year?\nChris DiTullio: Hi. This is Chris. I can take that answer. We're seeing really good engagement across our known customer database, including those reactivated last year, but also those that have been year-over-year. That -- our known customer database is the strongest portion of the response we're seeing right now. Transactions, sales and customer counts are up across the board within our various known customer database segments.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. And for my follow-up, I wanted to touch on the DITTO launch. Can you provide some additional color on the feedback you are getting from your dealer network and customers? We understand this is early in the stages, but perhaps you can discuss how this initiative is performing versus internal expectations? Are new customers engaging with DITTO as much as your core customer? Any additional color would be helpful. Thank you.\nRobert Will: Hi. This is Rob. I want to be careful a little bit as this is a joint venture with Singer, but I'm happy to report that in the early days, we've now launched DITTO in just over 300 of our JOANN stores, including 180 Viking galleries that are lease owned within our stores by Singer. We have been very happy with the results so far on the customer engagement. We're seeing really great results with downloads of individual patterns as well as the subscription service, and we're averaging about 4.5 to 4.8 stars on our reviews of the DITTO across both sites. The dealer network is starting to pick up. We have about 100 dealers that have picked up DITTO as well. But again, that's just launched in stores about 1.5 months ago.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Keith with Piper Sandler.\nPeter Keith: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. I appreciate you guys putting out some context for guidance. So I was going to ask a question around that. I guess just thinking about the rest of the year, it looks like the sort of implied same-store sales is kind of [indiscernible] maybe a little bit worse than Q1. But at least in our model to get to the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance, you really need to start seeing that EBITDA margin run kind of even year-on-year or even up year-on-year. So I was hoping if you could just kind of shape that dynamic for us as the year progresses. And help us understand the key drivers of the improvement. I think it's going to be freight in the merchandise margin, but I want to make sure we're catching everything.\nScott Sekella: Hi, Peter, it's Scott. Yes, I think it's coming from a number of places. One, a little bit on the top line is where we saw sequential improvement in Q1, and we're confident that it's going to continue there, potentially be a little bit better as we go forward. But on top of that, to your point, freight is going to continue to be a tailwind. I do think merchandising margin is going to get a little bit better as the year goes. But then the real big pieces that I'm excited about is on the SG&A side that as we touched on with the focus, simplify and grow initiative, that's where in the back half, we're really going to start to see some of the SG&A savings as we implement these ideas. And it's also the biggest area in the last 90 days from when we talked to you before that we've gotten the most traction on some of those initiatives. So really excited with what that's going to deliver to -- deliver our full year adjusted EBITDA outlook.\nPeter Keith: Okay. Thank you. And then just looking at that dynamic of cost inflation versus I guess -- I think you said a little over 2% in average unit retail, 2.7% to be specific. So your costs have been up about 5%, but you've only taken up the prices by about 2.7%. And I guess your point is, as the year progresses the cost will kind of smooth out and that will no longer be a headwind?\nScott Sekella: Yes. So keep in mind, when the costs first started increasing with our vendor base, we took the price up. So you saw the average unit retail increase first last year. Now we're cycling through those increases. We sell the product now, the higher cost that we started absorbing last year. But as the year goes, this is going to get sequentially better as we start lapping that. So our average unit cost increases will be a lot less in the back half than what we just saw in Q1.\nPeter Keith: Okay. Great. And then maybe just lastly on that. So at what point does your AUR, in effect, sort of smooth out from the inflationary pressures during the year?\nScott Sekella: I think you're going to continue to see it smooth out through the balance of the year. So there's -- there haven't been really any new AUR sort of price increases. It's a little bit of just mix movement. So you'll start to see it smooth out for the balance of the year.\nPeter Keith: Okay. Very good. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nLaura Champine: Thank for taking my question. If we look at the guide for comp to be down this year or sales to be down this year, are the factor is more macro? Is it category related? Is it competition? Like at this stage, kind of three years into the decline, so what's driving that this year?\nChris DiTullio: Hi, Laura, it's Chris. We're really seeing that the craft tech component of our business is the primary headwind right now. I think we talked about that in the last quarter as well. And so, that's going to continue to be a headwind. It was 150 basis points in the first quarter. We believe it will be upwards of 100 basis points for the balance of the year. So that's one factor. And then we are seeing great strength, improving strength in our core sewing and craft categories. So that's really driving us to lean in there, which are the categories that we know the best and have the best history in. So that's really what we're seeing in the market competitively. Really pretty rational environment, I would say, but really driving to our core customer and our core sewing and craft businesses.\nLaura Champine: Got it. So to summarize, it doesn't seem as if there's a deterioration in the macro. And I think that's -- is that fair to say given the sequential improvement that you called out?\nChris DiTullio: Yes, I would say that's right.\nLaura Champine: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nCristina Fernandez: Hi. Good afternoon. So I wanted to follow up on Laura's question. I mean, you mentioned that the core categories are strong, and it seems like they were positive and then the negative 150 basis points from consumer tech. So there's still a gap. Is that just a seasonal being down? Or I guess what else are you seeing? Like what else is the bigger source of the headwind on the reported comp?\nChris DiTullio: Yes. The seasonal business, we strategically pulled back our purchases there because that is inventory that has the most risk historically to margin and sell-through. So we did strategically pull back. That is a current headwind, but we believe it's one that won't be as significant later in this fiscal year. The good news is, with those receipt reductions that we've made in seasonal, we now have the ability to be -- play more offense in terms of those core sewing and craft categories that are working well for us.\nCristina Fernandez: That makes sense. And then a second question is on the -- with the consumer seemingly being more value-oriented, how are you thinking about pricing for your goods? Do you feel competitive? And is there opportunity to lower prices as the year goes on?\nRobert Will: Sure. It's Rob. I'll take that one. So as we had mentioned, we're continuing to see success across our owned or private brands. And that is part of the work that we've been doing on COGS with our focus, simplify and grow initiative as well. So we are seeing the cost of those products coming down, which will allow us to price some of that in as much of the assortment is focused on the good and better side of what we bring to market in those core categories.\nChris DiTullio: The one other thing I would just add in is, bear in mind that our average unit retail is roughly $5 as well. So we really do believe that we provide a very competitive option in the retail environment for customers regardless of the income tier or where they stand within the economy.\nScott Sekella: Cristina, it's Scott. I would just add, we've set up some processes here internally to really be able to read and react how the consumer's behaving and so that we can meet them where they're looking for at the right price point. So we're trying to stay very nimble in this environment to be able to read and react.\nCristina Fernandez: Thanks. And then last question is, I appreciate the financial guidance for this year. Any comment on where you expect to end the year as far as your debt balance? And if the interest rate -- or the interest expense assumption of $100 million that you gave on the last call, still a good number for this year?\nScott Sekella: Yes. From an interest expense standpoint, that's right around where we are. We kind of still think interest rates are going to tick up and that takes that into account and then maybe start to hopefully come back a little later in the year. In terms of net debt, not really giving any guidance, but I don't really see a meaningful change this year as we work to really improve our year-over-year cash flow and then really start to get positive cash flow in the out years.\nCristina Fernandez: Thanks again. Best of luck this quarter.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and- session, and the conference is also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may all now disconnect."
