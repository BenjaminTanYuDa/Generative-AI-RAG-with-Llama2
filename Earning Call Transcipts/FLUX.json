[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the call over to Maria Rico, Marketing Manager. Maria?\nMaria Rico: Thank you, operator. Your host today, Ron Dutt, Chief Executive Officer and Chuck Scheiwe, Chief Financial Officer, will present results of operations for the fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2023.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Flux Power’s Chief Executive Officer, Ron Dutt.\nRon Dutt: Thank you, Maria and good afternoon everyone. I am pleased to welcome you to today’s fiscal second quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Firstly, please note that on Slide 3, if you are following the deck, for those of you new to our story, there is a short reminder of what we do. We are powering your transition to sustainable lithium-ion battery technology. We are powering material handling, airport ground support, solar energy storage, port authority equipment and other applications with new and clean technology. Our products and services are focused on the growing demand for large nationwide fleets that are pursuing a better return on investment and a positive environmental impact compared to lead acid batteries. We are the leading supplier to large material handling fleets who require the best, both now and with future deliveries in product, technology, service and ease of doing business. Our reputation and brand are critical as we target top-tier customer and OEM names, which I’ll point out shortly. We must have a strong reputation and solid track record to reliably satisfy these large fleets that have hundreds of facilities and need their batteries for new equipment and existing equipment delivered on time without difficulty. Fortune 100 companies demand suppliers that are transparent, experienced and trustworthy as they transition their fleets to new and clean technologies, which puts us in a very strong position in the clean energy market. And we have the trend of on average, adding two large new customers per quarter and at the same time without losing any of our installed base of customers. Our business priority this past year focused on progress to cash flow breakeven while continuing to capture market share for the increasing demand for lithium batteries. We continue to be highly encouraged by our momentum toward cash flow breakeven and profitability given the underlying demand of our products. We have made progress on a number of our growth initiatives that have near-term and long-term impacts. Our new series of heavy-duty models will be added to most of our product segments and along with that, a new top 5 forklift OEM private label program, both of which will address the strong market demand beginning in early 2024 calendar year. And our automated assembly of cell modules is tracking well. We plan to launch the first, the industry’s first integrated telematics fleet-wide program for the Fortune 100 customer later in 2024 this year that combines the telemetry data of both the forklift and the battery. We believe that our leadership in telematics will serve as a continuing platform to introduce new features for operating performance and asset management that are highly desired by our customers. Also, we are exploring with partners opportunities for fast charging technology and international sales opportunities. The second fiscal quarter 2024 also saw ongoing momentum to both the top and bottom lines as we continue to move steadily towards profitability. While reaching record quarter revenue of $18.3 million during the quarter, we do continue to see lumpiness due to the timing of deliveries of customer new forklift orders and higher interest rate impacts. We improved gross profit up 38% in the second quarter to $5.7 million and gross margin expansion of 700 basis points to 31% compared to the year ago period and also up from our fiscal first quarter of $4.3 million and 29% respectively. With ongoing initiatives focused on strategic supply chain and profitability improvement, lower costs and higher volume purchasing, we are targeting gross margin improvement to continue towards 35% in the short-term. We are highly focused on achieving cash flow breakeven during this fiscal year 2024. We made good progress during the second fiscal quarter, delivering positive adjusted EBITDA of $300,000, an improvement of $1.2 million from an adjusted EBITDA loss of $900,000 in the second fiscal quarter of 2023 and sequential improvement from a loss of $1.2 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2024. Key drivers of the improvement include gross margin expansion and steady operating leverage from modest growth in operating expenses over the year. Our cost and pricing initiatives contributed to gross margin improvements that I just mentioned to 31% in Q2 ‘24. Also, our inventory balances have been stable, reflecting better management of supply chain sourcing and higher inventory turns from improved operational processes and lean manufacturing implementation. Taken together, we are executing operational efficiencies on our strategy for cash flow breakeven beginning in this fiscal year 2024 and increasing profitability beyond as we continue to drive expansion of our product lineup, operational efficiencies and service network. In the longer term, our strategy revolves around building scale to sell our products to large fleets, building on our momentum in revenue, gross margin and operating leverage. Currently, we are growing organically within our capital resources, but have begun to explore and develop strategies, including those already mentioned, to build partnerships that can leverage our revenue growth, our technology and our profitability and achieve our goal of building scale to meet the needs of our top tier customers. Our efforts on increasing revenue and margin improvement, specifically for adjusted EBITDA are shown on Slide 7, reflecting the upward trend over the past 2 fiscal years and our momentum towards sustained breakeven. The increase in Q2 fiscal ‘24 is directly attributed to the improved gross margin – gross profit, sorry, from gross margin expansion and revenue growth. We believe our trajectory to profitability is built on a strong foundation of lean implementation and ISO 9001 processes. Additional enablers include expansion of high demand models and continued operational and volume-related supply chain cost reductions. Our current and potential pipeline of customers continues to expand with 4 new customers this past quarter and 8 new customers in the calendar year 2023. Our full product line caters to large fleets who seek an ongoing long-term relationship partner to meet current and future needs, not just a one-time transactional purchase engagement. These customers represent well-known household names, having large fleets who require high-performing suppliers. While the forklift growth rate has historically been single-digit, the adoption of lithium-ion batteries is growing at a much higher rate, driven by the compelling value proposition of lithium compared to lead acid, especially for the larger multi-shift operations. The material handling sector is not unaffected by economic downturns, but it is critical to transport goods and provide services throughout the business cycle. Our strategy has included adjacent verticals such as airport ground support equipment. And we continue to assess other possible adjacencies to leverage our core competencies and capabilities. The trajectories of our revenue and gross margin on Slide 9 speak for themselves. We have taken actions to restore our gross margin trajectory that was interrupted by the pandemic and our highest priority now of achieving sustained profitability this fiscal year. Our ongoing improvement initiatives include a number of actions that are now impacting gross margin and will continue to do so. First, price increases to offset commodity [Technical Difficulty] increased pack volumes, more competitive shipping costs, lower cost, more reliable and secondary suppliers of key components, expanded manufacturing capacity and production process. And finally, transition of product lines to a new modular platform, which has more efficient design for assembly and service. All these initiatives are part of our plan to accelerate gross margins as our target is to reach a gross margin at 40%. Slide 10 highlights our backlog and inventory level trends, which are reflecting a more predictable pattern in recent periods, reflecting the growth of the business. As of February 1, our backlog was $30 million [Technical Difficulty] new customers during the quarter, including a winery that is the largest wine producer in the world. Our run-rate of backlog does vary at any point in time that has a pattern of running from $20 million to $38 million depending on the time of the orders received. Beyond our backlog of open orders, we’re working on a pipeline of high probability orders well over $100 million, which does stretch beyond our current fiscal year ending June 30. We monitor the multibillion-dollar addressable material handling market for economic trends, new entrants and customer demand trends, and we believe this market to provide a very positive growth environment for a strong, stable undercurrent especially given the recognized double-digit growth of lithium-ion solutions in the sector. Our strategic initiatives also include improving sourcing actions to mitigate part shortages, supply chain efficiencies and increasing inventory turns. With that, I will now turn it over to Chuck Scheiwe, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Chuck?\nChuck Scheiwe: Thanks, Ron. Now, turning to review our financial results in the quarter ended December 31, 2023, s Ron mentioned, revenue for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 increased by 7% to $18.3 million compared to $17.2 million in the fiscal second quarter of 2023. This was due to a higher number of packs sold during the quarter, as well as price increases for certain packs sold. Gross profit for fiscal Q2 of 2024 increased to $5.7 million compared to a gross profit of $4.1 million in fiscal Q2 of 2023. Gross margin was 30.9% in fiscal Q2 of 2024 as compared to 23.9% in fiscal Q2 of 2023. So this was reflected higher gross profit and lower cost of sales as a result of the gross margin improvement initiatives we’ve talked about, and this will help us achieve our profitability. Selling and administrative expenses were at $4.6 million in fiscal Q2 of 2024. This is up slightly from $4.3 million in the previous year quarter. This is primarily attributable to staff-related expenses, some higher professional service fees and stock-based comp. This was also partially offset by decreases in outbound shipping costs, recruiting costs and consulting fees. Research and development expenses increased slightly to $4.3 million in fiscal Q2 of 2024. This is compared to $1.2 million in fiscal Q2 of 2023. This is primarily due to additional engineering projects to support our new products. Adjusted EBITDA improved to a positive $300,000 in fiscal Q2 of 2024 from a loss of $900,000 in fiscal Q2 of 2023, and this is mostly driven by the improved gross margins. Our continued initiatives, business growth, operating leverage all contribute to drive this trajectory. Net loss for fiscal Q2 of 2024 was $800,000 compared to a net loss of $1.7 million in fiscal Q2 of 2023. The improvement principally reflected increased gross profit, and that was offset by increased operating expenses and interest expense. Cash was $1.6 million at December 31, 2023, as compared to $2.4 million at June 30, 2023, and this is mostly based on just timing of utilizing our credit line and when we borrow. Net cash used in operating activities decreased by $2.1 million to $1 million in the 3 months ended December 31, 2023, which is compared to $3.1 million in the 3 months ended September 30, 2023. And available working capital includes our line of credit as of January 31, 2024. That’s under our $16 million credit facility from Gibraltar Business Capital. That is the remaining available balance of $6 million. And we also have our $2 million available under the subordinated line of credit with Cleveland Capital. Our credit line with Gibraltar provides for expansion for up to $20 million. Now I’d like to pass it back to Ron to offer some closing remarks.\nRon Dutt: Thanks, Chuck. Looking at the positive momentum of our existing customer base and new customer acquisitions, we are confident that we are on a trajectory toward reaching sustained profitability during the current fiscal year. Our steady ongoing gross margin improvement reflects our goal to reach 40% gross margin, leveraging our operating and pricing – operational and pricing initiatives. As we establish consistent and increasing profitability this year, we look to implement revenue growth initiatives that we are currently exploring and developing. Our strategy continues to focus on the strong demand in the market for sustainable energy, especially in our industrial sector where we do not rely on government incentives, but only a compelling value proposition and ROI. We believe the combination of existing customer orders and the acquisition of new customers who want the benefits of lithium-ion technology can drive continued revenue growth. We are seeing strong progress with our growth strategy, including the introduction of new heavy-duty models to be launched this year and a second private label program expected to launch with a major forklift OEM. We also have a – we are exploring a partnership with a fast charging proprietary technology firm, and we look to additional revenue potential from establishing the industry’s first telematics integration for an entire nationwide fleet with a Fortune 100 company. And our current production facility should support annual revenue up to $150 million, given our facility footprint, a second shift build-out and full implementation of lean manufacturing. As I mentioned previously, we have an improved capital structure that includes increased working capital line of credit of $16 million with Gibraltar Business Capital to support planned growth with provisions to increase to $20 million and a new $2 million subordinated credit facility with Cleveland Capital that has an extended maturity to August 15, 2025. In summary, we are well-positioned to execute our growth strategy as we offer customers deep experience as first movers in the sector and validation by Fortune 100 customers who entrust migration of their fleets to lithium-ion solutions. I look forward to providing our shareholders with further updates in the near-term as we strengthen our leadership position in lithium-ion technology solutions with our growing list of new and diverse large customers. I thank you all for attending. And now I would like to hand the call over to the operator to begin our question-and-answer session. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Brown: Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on the strong quarter.\nRon Dutt: Yes, thanks, Rob.\nRob Brown: I guess, first question here is on the order environment. There were very strong orders in the quarter. I know the business can be a bit lumpy, but what are you seeing in terms of customer activity? And how do you see the order environment over the next couple of quarters?\nRon Dutt: Yes, Rob, that’s really a good question. We spend a lot of time looking at that. Particularly our salespeople are working with our end-customers and the OEMs on that. The industry has largely recovered from the pandemic. But there is still some lumpiness out there in orders. We have not seen any backing off or reduction of orders from any of our customers, but we have seen some deferral out toward the end of the year and in some cases beyond as they just manage the timing of the replacing of their forklifts. And there must be some effect on high interest rates because we see that happening a lot in other sectors. And we haven’t lost any customers. So we see no back off in the managing of our installed base and adding new customers, but we are dealing with that lumpiness. The lead times in normal stable times could be 2 months or so, and you can kind of see that reflected somewhat in our open sales orders, but there are a couple of lines with one of our largest OEM customers of forklift delays. So since a large percentage of our business, over 90% is for put on new forklifts, although the growing business on replacing lead acid batteries at the end of life is certainly beginning to grow, that can affect our timing. So we have an ongoing strategy as a growth company and talk about it all the time and the initiatives to accelerate growth. There currently is a strongness in our part to produce the concentration in our biggest customers and as a public company, so we can have a more predictable trajectory on our orders. I’d just add though that like a lot of companies, I think a lot of customers are going after look at how deep and broad have you gone with some of these Fortune 50 and 100 customers because that really does provide the validation to others that are looking at this adoption and migration. So in your response to the orders, that’s going around the wagons pretty well. Does that help?\nRob Brown: Excellent. Yes. Thank you. That was a great overview and answered some of my other questions along the way. So that’s fantastic. And then on the margin trends, so good progress there. How much further to go is there in terms of some of these initiatives you put in place? Are there initiatives in place that really are set to show through in the numbers? I think you mentioned a 35% gross margin, that’s a near-term target, but a sense of how confident you are in achieving the margin improvement that you’ve worked on.\nRon Dutt: Yes. You hit another on another hot topic here, we work with on a constant basis. For the last well, 3 or 4 years when we had negative margins in large part because of low volumes. But we have established an infrastructure, a cadence, a war room mentality on margins of going after them in all of the high-potential areas, supply chain, sourcing, getting better pricing from higher volumes, on the design side, improving our designs for quality and reducing warranty. And then also from the pandemic, with the price increases we had to catch up on pricing because we had to honor long lead purchase orders with some of these customers. So the benefit of the aggravation of that supply chain was it forced us to really build a stronger, robust infrastructure to reduce costs, make all of our processes more efficient and also be taking a hard look at products we have and making sure the pricing is right. I mean, after all, we and the dozen or so others that are in this sector are really buying new ground and learning more all the time about that. So I think those areas have initiatives that have momentum with them. So when we target cash flow breakeven, a big part of that is margin. It’s helped by growing volume, but the efforts on those are ongoing. Our goal is not just to break even. Our goal is to achieve the margin that a manufacturing company like us should achieve, which we talked about. And we have a lot of confidence that we have in place what I could loosely call the infrastructure to continue that momentum.\nRob Brown: Okay. Great. And then my last question is around kind of the working capital cash flows. Do you have some seasonality there? And do you expect the working capital kind of, I guess, use of cash flow to diminish?\nChuck Scheiwe: Yes. Well, a lot of the changes right now since you’re right on that edge of zero adjusted EBITDA going close to that level, a lot of the changes in capital is just – it’s working capital. It’s inventory purchases and customer payments. So for us, it can bounce around a lot when you have $1 million payments coming in, whether they come in this week or the next week, you’re going to see that bounce around a little bit. So I think our focus really on the cash side is holding inventory down and utilizing the balance sheet to keep us close to zero.\nRob Brown: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I will turn it over.\nRon Dutt: Yes, thanks, Rob.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Joshi with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your question. \nSameer Joshi: Thanks. Ron, Chuck, congratulations on the positive adjusted EBITDA.\nRon Dutt: Yes. Thanks, Sameer.\nSameer Joshi: Yes. On the heavy-duty models that are expected to be launched later this year, have you received the UL listing for that? And part two of that question is, have you already sort of scoped prospective customers? And is there a pipeline behind that, those models?\nRon Dutt: Our heavy-duty models that we have planned to roll out all have UL certification achieved. And the material handling sector is one, our customers almost always want that UL listing. It’s the top-tier customers. They know it’s there and they want it. In this platform we’ve been rolling out though we do have ground support equipment that customers who don’t require the UL listing, so we have sent some of those 80-volt packs out to them. But what we are working on right now is getting the top-tier OEMs to approve these new packs in their trucks. And the scenario has shifted over the past few years from them doing the approval themselves, which can be a fairly quick turnaround to having third parties do that, which is a longer turnaround. And so that’s why the rollout of our sales of our heavy-duty models have taken a little bit longer than expected. We have a project in now with our largest OEM partner, and it will be forthcoming through approval in the coming several months. So our salespeople are certainly eager for these packs to be able to sell because for some time we’ve seen – we’ve learned and come across much more – many more applications where the heavy-duty pack is just the right answer. It does matter whether we offer the 24, 36, 48 and 80 volts, it does matter whether you’re moving potato chips or engine blocks as well. So we want to cater to that entire line.\nSameer Joshi: Understood. Thanks for that color. On the integrated telematics, I know you said you will launch it later again in this – later in calendar 2024. Do we know what kind of revenues or cash flows we can expect from that? And do you expect several of your customers to adopt it or just a few?\nRon Dutt: Well, the telematics, we’ve offered telematics for several years, and it’s – I would characterize it as a first generation, it’s really borne out of our engineers, having a tool to assess the state of health, troubleshoot our models. And we start selling that to selected customers about over the past year or 2. And what we found is that many of the operations in both material handling and GSE had operated for many, many years without telematics on their battery and just didn’t think – they didn’t understand the real benefit of it for asset management, state of health, managing their packs, and what they found as they pilot and try these, they are very, very excited. So we’re – I think we’re going to see a continuing more rapid growth and rollout of this. Now, we charge an amount to install the telematics, and we are also recently beginning to charge a monthly fee to provide services to support those people with customized reports and our other support services. So, we have got the initial fixed fee and the monthly fee. And we see that evolving to the point of being a huge leverage point to offer new features and capability for these – for our customers to manage their fleets. They have locations all over the country. They have lots of forklifts, lots of battery packs, of course, with that, and managing the life, forklifts do different jobs with telemetry. They can swap the batteries to extend the life. Everyone is into extending asset life because that’s dollars and cents. The other thing, and probably the more important there into is reducing downtime. So, with telemetry, which is channeled through the cloud to the customers and us, we can provide downloads and repair packs, alert local techs to do repair work where a hands-on approach is needed, all of which can reduce the amount of downtime, which is critical for these high-performance operations. And what we are seeing is we have introduced these into the plants, and it has been very, very well-received. Lastly, I would say, look, this is software, and it’s kind of like our iPhones. I don’t know about you, but I get downloads all the time, improving this and new versions and iPhone 14, 15 and so forth. And that’s the path I see for this telemetry. And we are very, very excited about it because it’s a source not only of some income, but I think it’s even larger than that. It’s a source of new business and a differentiation for our company. We are a first mover in this. There are others doing it. But it represents a source for us to get new business. It’s also beneficial for pricing. Now, simply put, it’s value creation, the value we see that the customer wants, not something that our engineers think is slick and clever, it’s what the customers want. So, it’s very exciting.\nSameer Joshi: Yes. No. Certainly, it is a high gross margin revenue stream as well. So, yes, we are looking forward to progress on that. My last question is just – I know you mentioned the $150 million capacity. But in terms of – on the operating side, with current operating expense levels, how much revenue can be supported or should we see some scaling of sales expenses as revenues increase?\nRon Dutt: Well, if I understand the question right, our capacity at this site is to be able to increase our production line to ship out of here $150 million of lithium battery packs per year. And the operating infrastructure is set to do that. We are not capital-intensive. As we double the size of that revenue, we expect a modest amount of additional tools and some testing equipment, a few more people. But we are very confident of that rollout. And particularly because we have two great enablers, we have ISO 9000 processes embedded here for the last 4 years, and we are very close to wrapping up lean manufacturing with this to make this efficient from the standpoint of expenses to support it, given the low capital expense that’s required for that, our expertise in that we can – we believe we have good line of sight on that. And sowing out a second shift, I mean a real functional second shift as well, all give us a lot of positive understanding of it.\nChuck Scheiwe: Yes. We do have a lot of operating leverage here that we can capitalize on because a lot of the bodies we would add are production-based, which is already in the COGS line forecast going forward. So, those bodies are already part of the cost of goods sold in terms of production. And we can definitely have a lot of leverage there to grow the business without adding a lot of OpEx.\nSameer Joshi: Right. So, cash flows and net margins are not only going to be improved as gross margin improve, but you will find this operating leverage as well and further improvement?\nChuck Scheiwe: Correct. It’s going to kick in from here on very well from what I am seeing.\nSameer Joshi: Alright. Thanks for taking my questions.\nRon Dutt: Yes. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Craig Irwin with ROTH. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Irwin: Good evening gentlemen and congratulations on the nice growth and progress of your margin.\nRon Dutt: Thanks Craig.\nCraig Irwin: So, Ron, can you maybe comment for us or give us some color on your competitiveness in the airport ground equipment market? And with the environmental commitments of the airlines, looking to reduce their carbon footprints and commit to these advanced technologies, how active do you expect that market to potentially be this year?\nRon Dutt: It’s certainly come back to life, in the pandemic, as you know, when the – particularly the top five airlines just really shutdown everything, battened down the hatches. And so for the past year, we have seen really a very strong revenue growth. I would say our largest customer, Delta Air Lines, is known as a technology leader in the sector. And our distributor that we have, Avrist [ph], is a very long-term seasoned supplier of batteries to the airlines. So, we have a great leverage, great enabler there with the airline. So, we see them, some other airlines, we brought on top five, including – and then also Air Canada. We have others piling the packs, and we see the growing interest. And I think part of it is, yes, it’s interesting. I mean as I was referencing before, they are looking at lithium and going, well, with lead acid or diesel, we didn’t have telemetry. What are the real leverage points and benefits of this, and I think when you see somebody like Delta, who has brought this on and others with the very positive experiences they have and what they are getting out of it for cost management, emissions, I think it’s just my opinion, I think that’s going to continue to grow. Credibility is everything and the current players are giving credibility. We claim leadership, particularly in the U.S. on supplying GSE. And the market of course is not nearly as big as the material handling market in North America, but it’s very sizable. It represents a market where our core competencies can be exploited for them. And we are seeing that. We are very excited about that and working with them because all their equipment, virtually all their equipment uses 80-volt battery packs. And what we are seeing is that having spent time with that has allowed the basis for continued expansion of products in GSE and also the adoption of 80-volt lithium batteries for the very heavy-duty forklifts. So, there is that tangential benefit to the GSE market you – the GSE market you mentioned, now you mentioned the competitiveness. There are other competitors out there. But I think we offered some of the reputation with some of these large customers and the airlines top five, as you know, are very large themselves and what we are finding it resonating with them is that we are somebody that can handle operations with many sites and meet their quality and service needs. Does that help, answer that?\nCraig Irwin: No, that’s just excellent. That’s really helpful. My next question is about tax certifications this year and spending on new product development. Can you maybe update us on any planned certification this year that we should look at in the financial model? How would you discuss the expenses for these packs? And R&D, do you have any specific new initiatives that will alter the trajectory from where you have been? I mean I know you guys have been really tight on the spending side, but you are smart about where you spend your money. So, if you could maybe just give us a little granularity.\nRon Dutt: Yes. The UL certification is one where historically or the past 7 years, 8 years, really requires money and time to go through that. And we will continue to incur that. The current heavy-duty models have UL. But as we add more models, we are working on a 96-volt model. We believe that all those models going into ground support equipment, at some point will likely require UL certification. And we use that – we view that UL certification really as a good thing, even though it’s time and money, used to be an aggravation, but it’s also a point of differentiation. It’s also a point of building confidence with our customers. And you take the airlines, if they have anything go wrong, any thermal event or something, they get extremely nervous, send their safety officers immediately to wherever they are going. So, they are particularly excited as are other customers on that UL certification. So, we will continue that. The good news is that given our many years with UL, we are able to do all the testing here. We used to have to send it out to expensive third-party groups that took time and money, and we can do it now with the UL oversight either virtually or in person depending on the test that they think is important. So, that’s a – that’s been an important leverage point in mitigating that expense. The other thing is there is some testing there that we – honestly, we need to do anyway. I mean they are covering safety and ruggedness tests, which of course we will want to do as well. The other piece of certification, Craig, is getting the OEMs, whether they are forklifts, particularly, we are putting a battery in their forklift. If you put a car engine in a car, it’s integrated and it’s very important for warranty. When the customer has problems, they just go to probably the forklift dealers. So, they are very keenly aware of that. And there is a process, as I have mentioned earlier, and that does cost us some money, packs. It’s not a major expense, but it’s an expense. And actually, the real pain point is this time for them to get it done. There is some other testing, self-certification for transport of lithium batteries. We do all that here, self-certification. Occasionally, we might ship something out for some reason.\nChuck Scheiwe: And I think this over the next 6 months to 12 months, we are going to spend a lot more money on telemetry in terms of – that’s a key product here. So, we are going to spend some money on the GUI for the users’ look, how that looks. We are going to create an app for phones, spend some money on that because I think it’s a big point that we need to start pressing as well. And that’s lot of R&D development there.\nCraig Irwin: Understood. Thank you for that color and congratulations on the progress, guys.\nRon Dutt: Thanks Craig.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Galinko: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. You might have covered this already, but I was hoping you could talk, I guess, A, a little bit more about the $100 million pipeline you referenced that extends beyond this fiscal year. I guess any changes to the composition of that pipeline in the last quarter, or any changes in confidence level of capturing a portion of that pipeline?\nRon Dutt: It’s our Head of Sales and those guys who are all over that. There is a number. The lead time on a lot of these sales orders is quite some time – quite long, particularly for a new company. The other, again kind of going back to the same old message you may be tired of hearing, but the timing of the new forklifts going out is moving around as well. The forecasting on their side of when forklifts are going out is the big question mark. Once we know that, we are fine. But the $100 million covers quite a few customers through our network, through the national account sales reps of the large OEMs and covers out – covers up to several years. We have reason to believe they are high confidence, they are not guaranteed, they are not contractual. But what it does represent is this growing build-out of fleets that we have over their schedule and also the new customers.\nMatthew Galinko: Good. Terrific. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I would like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nRon Dutt: Thank you, operator. I would like to thank each of you on the call for joining our financial results conference call today and look forward to updating you on our ongoing progress and growth. If we were unable to answer any of your questions, please reach out to our IR firm, MZ Group, who would be more than happy to assist. This concludes our update for this past quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."

At this time, I will turn the call over to Flux Power Chief Executive Officer, Ron Dutt.\nRon Dutt: Thank you, Maria, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to welcome you to today's fiscal first quarter 2024 financial results conference call. Firstly, please note on Slide 3, if you're following the deck, for those of you new to our story, here's a short reminder of what we do in electrifying commerce. We are powering material handling, airport ground support, solar energy storage, port authority equipment and other applications with new and clean technology. Our products and services are focused on the growing demand from large nationwide fleets that are pursuing a better return on investment in a positive environmental impact compared to lead acid batteries. We are the leading lithium-ion supplier providing full service to the nationwide large fleets who require the best, both now and with future deliveries in product, technology, service, and ease of doing business. Our reputation in brand are critical as we target household names, which I'll point out shortly. We must have a strong reputation and solid track record to reliably satisfy these large fleets that have hundreds of facilities and need their batteries for new equipment or existing equipment delivered on time without difficulty. Fortune 100 companies demand suppliers that are transparent, experienced, and accountable as they transition their fleets to new and clean technologies, which puts us in a very strong position in the electrification market. And we have a trend of on average adding two large new customers per quarter and without losing any of our installed base customers. Now on to our first quarter results. Our business priority this past fiscal year focused on progress to cash flow break even, while continuing to capture increasing demand for lithium-ion batteries. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and including this past October, we remained encouraged by the underlying growth during the entire year, past year, of our products and also by the momentum toward cash flow breakeven and profitability. Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 decreased 17% to $14.8 million compared to $17.8 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. Due to fewer units of lithium-ion packs sold during the current quarter as a result of ongoing shipment deferrals related to [Oak] (ph) OEM forklift delivery delays along with some seasonal reduction in orders. We continue to improve gross profit, which increased 9% to $4.3 million compared to a gross profit of $3.9 million in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. Gross margin improvement initiatives contributed to a 700 basis point increase in the first quarter to 29%, up from 22% in the prior year quarter. This very notable increase reflects the operational efficiencies we have been achieving in sourcing, design costs, lean manufacturing and improved pricing. Adjusted EBITDA loss improved to $1.2 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, as compared to a loss of $1.5 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2023, driven by the improved gross margins and holding operating expenses in check. For the first quarter, our customer order backlog declined from $28.5 million at June 30th to $21.8 million as of September 30th, 2023, reflecting timing delays in receiving purchase orders. As of November 2, though, backlog had increased to $31 million, reflecting continued and expanded ordering from the airport GSE market and some additional pickup in forklift delivery timing. We've made progress on a number of our growth initiatives that will have near-term and long-term impacts. Our new series of heavy duty models will be added to most of our product segments, and along with a new OEM private label program, will both address strong market demand and launched beginning in early 2024 calendar year. And our automated assembly of cell modules is tracking similarly in timing. We plan to launch the industry's first integrated telematics fleet-wide program with a Fortune 100 customer later in 2024 calendar year. We believe that our leadership in telematics will serve as a continuing platform to introduce new features for operating performance and asset management that are highly desired by our customers. Also, we're exploring with partners, opportunities on fast charging technology and internal international sales opportunities. We are highly focused on achieving cash flow breakeven during this fiscal year 2024. Key drivers of the improvement include gross margin expansion and supported by steady operating leverage from slow growth of operating expense over the year. Our cost and price initiatives mentioned earlier contributed to gross margin improvements to 29% in Q1 2024 compared to 27% in Q4 2023. Also, our inventory balances have been stable, reflecting higher inventory returns from improved operational processes and lean manufacturing implementation. Taken together for those two, we are executing operational efficiencies on our strategy for cash flow breakeven and sustained profitability as we continue to drive expansion of our product lineup and service network. And we estimate our manufacturing capacity in our current facility could support a doubling of our current annual revenue. In the long term, our strategy revolves around building scale to sell our products to large fleets, building on our momentum in revenue, gross margin and operating leverage. Concurrently -- currently, we are growing organically within our capital resources, but have begun to explore and develop strategies, including those already mentioned, to build partnerships that can leverage revenue and growth, technology and profitability, and achieve our goal building scale to meet the needs of our top tier customers. Our efforts on increasing revenue and margin improvement, specifically for adjusted EBITDA are reflected on Slide 7. Showing the upward trend over the past fiscal year and momentum toward breakeven. That decline in Q1 2024 is directly attributed to the quarterly revenue decline tied to seasonality, historically in that quarter, and along with shipment deferrals. We believe our historical trajectory to profitability is continuing, given our installed base of customers and consistent acquisition of new customers. Additional enablers include expansion of high demand models and continued operational and volume related supply chain cost reductions. Our current and potential pipeline of customers continues to expand with two new customers this past quarter and six new customers total in the calendar year 2023 year-to-date. Our full product line caters to large fleets who seek an ongoing relationship partnership to meet current and future needs, not just one-time transactional purchases. These customers represent well-known household names having large fleets who require high-performing suppliers. While the forklift growth rate has historically been single digit, the adoption of lithium-ion reflects a double digit rate. Goods and materials need to be transported in all economic conditions. And this speaks nothing of opportunities in adjacent product sectors. The trajectories of our revenue and gross margin on Slide 9 speak for themselves. We have taken actions to restore our gross margin trajectory that was interrupted by the pandemic. Our highest priority now of achieving sustained profitability this fiscal year. Our ongoing improvement initiatives include a number of actions that are now impacting gross margin. They are price increases to offset commodity increases, increased pack volumes, more competitive shipping costs, lower costs, more reliable and secondary suppliers of key components, expanded manufacturing capacity and production processes, and transition of product lines to a new modular platform which has more efficient design for both assembly and service. All these initiatives are part of our plan to accelerate gross margins as our target is to reach 40% gross margin. Slide 10 highlights our backlog and inventory level trends, which are reflecting a more predictable pattern in recent periods, especially compared to the strong upward revenue trend of our revenue and gross margin mentioned earlier. As of November 2, our backlog increased to $31 million, as I mentioned, with two new customers contributing to this increase. Our run rate of backlog does vary at any point in time, but as a pattern, running ranging from $20 million to $38 million, depending on timing of orders. Beyond our backlog of open orders, we're working on a pipeline of high probability orders of well over $100 million, which does stretch beyond the current fiscal year ending June 30th. We monitor the multi-billion addressable market -- material handling market for economic trends, new entrants, and customer demand trends. And we believe this market to provide a very positive growth environment with a strong, stable undercurrent, especially given the recognized double digit growth of lithium-ion solutions in the sector. Our strategic initiatives also include sourcing actions to mitigate part shortages, accelerating backlog conversion to shipments, and increasing inventory returns. With that, I will turn it over to Chuck Scheiwe, our Chief Financial Officer, to review the financial results for the quarter ended September 30th, 2023. Chuck?\nChuck Scheiwe: Thanks, Ron. Now, turning to review our financial results in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. As Ron mentioned, revenue for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 decreased by 17% to $14.8 million compared to $17.8 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2023. This is due to fewer units of storage packs sold during the current quarter, and this was a result of ongoing deferrals related to OEM forklift timing delays and some seasonal reduction with certain customers. Gross profit for fiscal Q1 of 2024 increased to $4.3 million compared to a gross profit of $3.9 million in fiscal Q1 of 2023. Gross margin was 29% in fiscal Q1 of 2024, as compared to 22% in fiscal Q1 of 2023. This is reflecting greater gross profit and lower cost of sales as a result of the gross margin improvement initiatives that will help us achieve profitability. This was also partially offset by lower number of units sold. Selling and administrative expenses were at $4.7 million in fiscal Q1 of 2024, up slightly from $4.5 million in the previous year quarter. And this is showing the contributions to operating leverage we see. Research and development expenses increased slightly to $1.3 million in fiscal Q1 of 2024 compared to $1.2 million in fiscal Q1 of 2023 and this was primarily due to staff related expenses. Adjusted EBITDA loss improved to $1.2 million in fiscal Q1 of 2024 from $1.5 million in fiscal Q1 of 2023. And as we talked, this was mostly driven by the improved gross margins we're seeing. Our continued initiatives, business growth, and operating leverage all contribute to drive this trajectory. Net loss for fiscal Q1 of 2024 was $2.1 million, very similar to a net loss of $2.1 million in the fiscal Q1 of 2023. The nominal improvement was principally reflected increased gross profit, offset by increased operating expenses and interest expense. Cash on the balance sheet was $1.1 million at September 30, 2023, as compared to $2.4 million at June 30, 2023. Please note that the cash balance will vary depending on timing of payables, receivables, and our borrowing on the working capital line. Net cash used in operating activities increased to $3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $600,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2022. And this is primarily due to growing the business, the timing of receivables, and other working capital timing. We recently announced a new $15 million credit facility from Gibraltar Business Capital. This is to fund working capital and to refinance our existing credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank. This facility is intended to help meet our anticipated working capital needs to fund plan operations to meet the demands of our growth trajectory for the foreseeable future. The facility is structured to expand to $20 million if needed for additional growth. Our available funds include our line of credit as of November 2, 2023 under the $15 million credit facility from Gibraltar Business Capital as a remaining available balance of $2.9 million and that has the additional $5 million if needed under the expandable provision. We also have the $2 million available under the new subordinated line of credit. Now I'd like to pass it back to Ron to offer some closing remarks.\nRon Dutt: Thanks, Chuck. Looking at the positive momentum of our existing customer base and new customer acquisitions, we're confident that we're on a strong trajectory toward reaching sustainable profitability during this current fiscal year. Our steady ongoing gross margin improvement reflects our goal to reach 40% gross margin, leveraging our cost, operational, and pricing initiatives. Our long-term plans include to focus on the strong demand of the market for sustainable energy, especially in our industrial sector, where there's no reliance on incentives, but only on ROI. We believe the combination of existing customer orders and the acquisition of new customers who want the benefits of lithium-ion technology can drive continued revenue growth. We're seeing strong progress with our growth strategy including the introduction of new heavy-duty models to be launched in 2024, a new private label program to be launched with a major forklift OEM, and a potential partnership on fast charging proprietary technology, along with the automation of battery cells into modules. Partnering with a Fortune 100 company on the industry's first telematics integration for an entire fleet, and lastly, developing partnerships for international sales channels. And our current production facility should support annual revenues up to $150 million given our facility footprint, second ship buildout, and full lean manufacturing implementation. As I mentioned previously, we announced recently an improved capital structure that includes a working capital line of credit of $15 million with Gibraltar Business Capital to support current and planned growth with provisions to increase to $20 million. And a new $2 million subordinated credit facility with Cleveland Capital with an extended maturity to August 15th, 2025. In summary, we are well positioned to execute our strategy of electrifying commerce as we offer customers deep experience as first movers in this sector and validation by Fortune 100 customers to entrust their migration to lithium solutions to us. I look forward to providing our shareholders with further updates in the near future as we strengthen our leadership position in lithium-ion technology solutions with our growing list of new and diverse large customers. I thank all of you for attending. And now, I'd like to hand the call over to the operator to begin our question-and-answer session. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Brown: Good afternoon.\nRon Dutt: Hi Rob.\nChuck Scheiwe: Hi Rob.\nRob Brown: I just want to talk a little bit about the orders. Sounds like the run rate picked up after quarter end, how is that kind of looking going into the next quarter here? And what's sort of the dynamics in the market at this point?\nRon Dutt: The shorter answer is, it looks good. You can see some of the lumpiness. I mean in the Q1 and most -- except for last year, was always a slow season due to some of our bigger customers who are busy in the summer with their operations and not ordering or installing new equipment or thinking about new orders. So we do experience that. We're seeing discontinued underlying demand in the market. There are two model lines that have some extended -- forklifts that have extended timing that has caused some of these delays for us, for our competitors, and for the OEMs, frankly. But we see that's more than offset by the growing demand that we have. And then the near-term initiatives we have in terms of new product lines that we couldn't offer before are going to start impacting this in the spring as we proceed them.\nRob Brown: Great, thank you. And then, could you elaborate on the new private label program? Kind of what -- who's that -- how's that working and how's it incremental for what you've been doing?\nRon Dutt: Yeah, sure. We've had one private label program in place for a number of years, the top five OEM. And it's proven to be very successful. It's in that Class 3 space. Those forklifts are the smaller forklifts and lower price. But that Class 3 space, the equipment, which is called a [indiscernible], but they're the most numerous by unit volume of any of the product lines, number one. So they're lower priced, but there's a lot of them. Number two, these large Fortune 500 fleets we go after that have tens and hundreds of offices across the country, most of them use these. And these large fleets like to buy packs from a variety of product line models. So the private label one is one for that smaller class. It's viewed a little differently than the large forklifts. And we're seeing that a private label where the OEM is out there selling and distributing it through their equipment dealerships across the country is an effective way to go to market with that particular line. And it also, with car dealers, they'll sell the small cars, but the customers come in and buy the SUVs and large cars as well. There's a little bit of that going on as well. So it's a way to efficiently cover the market, help us build scale.\nChuck Scheiwe: Yes, Robin, I'll add to Ron's comment that, that product in the white label we currently have that's been there for quite a while, is very predictable in terms of month by month ordering, which is really nice for us and t's something -- one of the areas we can latch onto is very consistent ordering quarter-to-quarter, which is great.\nRob Brown: Great. Thanks for the color. I'll turn it over.\nRon Dutt: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Galinko with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Galinko: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Ron, I think you might have mentioned two new customers in the quarter. Did I understand that correctly?\nRon Dutt: Yes, yes you did. We've got actually a few more than that. We try to -- when we talk about this, our target market are very large customers that have many locations across the country. And the other -- there's a couple elements to this. Even the larger customers will start out with one or two locations and then feed their other locations to the point that we now have a couple of our largest customers, which are household names, at the point where they're comfortable to completely migrate their entire fleet to lithium. So we're always glad to bring on new customers. Our customers typically resist us and anybody else in the industry mentioning their names. But if you look at our -- we track -- Chuck's got a list in front of me of what we've done this past year and into this quarter. And there's quite a few names, more than the two per quarter. But we do that to really message this impact that they have. And they come from all different parts of the country as well, and different sectors. So does that help you, Matt?\nMatthew Galinko: It does. That's terrific. I guess my follow-up is on the fast charging partnership that you referenced, is that coming from demand from existing customers or is that something that could be -- just talk about what the incentive is there to move in that direction?\nRon Dutt: Yeah, sure. I think all of us when we think of fast charging we think of -- you think of your Tesla and other electric cars and you want them to charge fast. It's the holy grail in the automotive sector. It's not so much the holy grail in the industrial sector, aside from the Amazon and Walmart and a few plants that are these massive plants. And they actually use fuel cell. Those fuel cell charges in 5 minutes and they run three shifts, hot swap drivers and don't have an hour or two or more to charge. But the rest of the industry isn't necessarily keen on that. But fast charging does have its place. It represents operational efficiency. It does have a distinct advantage in any very cold weather situation, given the nature of its thermal management. The fast charging also is a way to provide the kilowatts of energy, given that if you can charge a lot during the breaks and the lunch, you can get by with a pack for the whole day with less lithium in it. So there's some advantages we're looking at. There are many technology innovations in the market, as you know. You can't pick up any literature without reading solid state, sodium, and so on and so forth. I would say just to reiterate one of our points, we're agnostic with that. We apply the latest technology. We're exploring this one. It's a proprietary technology and I think if there's some applications there that could make sense from a business case, we will jump on it. We continually look at ways to provide leading technology to our large customers because they demand it. When they choose a supplier, they want to know you have as good or better technology anybody else and for the future. Otherwise, you lose confidence in a long-term relationship. So, that element of our business is very important from that context. But we'll keep you apprised on this as it develops as well, Matt.\nMatthew Galinko: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Jeff [Gramp] (ph) with Alliance Global Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good afternoon, guys. The PR mentioned some high confidence orders totaling, I think, it was over $100 million, obviously well in excess of any backlog that you guys have had. Are you guys seeing a change in terms of buyer behavior whereby they maybe feel the pressure to place larger orders ahead of time? Or is this just kind of more of an indication you guys want to give to the market that these are kind of recurring orders that kind of present themselves in the backlog on a periodic basis? Just trying to, I guess, understand how we should interpret that figure a little bit more clearly.\nRon Dutt: Yeah. There had been some of that, particularly related to the supply chain shortage of some of our big customers gave us letters of intent. I think if you recall, we mentioned that before. This is different. It's related to that. It goes to what I just said a minute ago. Actually, it was a nice setup, Jeff, for this question. We've got some of our largest customers, our Fortune 50 type customers, 50 and 100, who are getting comfortable enough with the whole lithium experience because it's just not, hey, well, the battery, well, the battery drives the equipment in my operation. It's the entire end-to-end ordering them, delivering, are you training our people? Is there service? What happens at end of life? What happens all along the way? Can you -- are you reliable? Are you going to be around? What's the delivery experience and can -- is there ease of business doing with it? These companies run very complex operations. And what we're seeing now, this $100 million is referring to one of our largest customers who are looking to convert their entire fleet in a shorter amount of time. These companies have 30,000, 40,000 forklifts across the North America. So -- and they implement, they buy new forklifts over time. They don't do it all at once. It would be too disruptive to the operation. So it's over a period of a number of months to do this kind of thing. So this $100 million really reflects that beginning in the March quarter, we believe we will start to see that. It's still a little premature. I'm not going to give out numbers, but they're very intent on it. The timing of the scale of that, as you could imagine, requires a good deal of settling down on their scheduling and plans. But we're delighted. We're delighted to hear this kind of thing and it's been part of our vision and we see it with this one big customer and we see that, we see this as the kind of thing that can happen with many more customers.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That's really exciting. Thank you for that. And my other question is on this telematics integration with the Fortune 100. I know you guys in the past have talked about some different kind of recurring revenue opportunities as it relates to BMS and Telematics and things of that nature. Is that kind of progressing towards that type of opportunity with this specific application or is this just more of a kind of value add to engender better repeat business and things of that nature?\nRon Dutt: Well, it's really everything you mentioned. I'd say the big driver on -- we talked about -- we introduced telematics on -- in this material handling sector, I don't know, three or four years ago. And the sector was used to telematics for their equipment, and it was all around planned maintenance. And so we've had to go up the curve of these customers getting familiar with it. Are they really going to use it? There's a lot of things been sold to these people in forklift that they don't ever use, include some of that telematics on equipment. And they had to see the real impactful value of this. So our sales of telematics have been, I would say, slowly building. But we're seeing that accelerate now. And we have one of our largest customers here that finally got to the point that we believe is resonating, but they want to put it on all their packs. There's always some reason to know the health of it, is there a problem coming. If you can tell a problem's coming, either we monitoring it or the customer monitoring it, they can go in and address a service issue before a pack goes down. Remember the biggest single sensitive point in this world is downtime of equipment. So this telematics is really providing the intelligence to address those issues. It's really the fundamental tool to improve asset management, to provide product support, and we see the opportunity to integrate real artificial intelligence in this because we have the sensors, we have the data to direct very timely response to issues with their equipment. So this one customer we're talking about is finally all over this. They're believers and we're excited about it. Again, this is a similar comment to before. We're now seeing the kind of traction that was always part of our vision.\nChuck Scheiwe: Jeff, just to add to that, as you were kind of leading to everything we're doing with telemetry right now to new customers does include a monthly service fee of some sort. That's how we're approaching it as well. So just so you're aware of that. That's definitely on all new offerings.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Understood. All right. Thank you guys for the details and the time.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Dutt for his closing remarks. Thank you.\nRon Dutt: Thank you, operator. I would like to thank each of you for joining our financial results conference call today and look forward to continuing to update you on our ongoing progress and growth. If we were unable to answer any of your questions, please reach out to our IR firm, MZ Group, who will be more than happy to assist you. This concludes our call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
