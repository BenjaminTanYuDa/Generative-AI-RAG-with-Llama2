Please be advised, today's conference call is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Paul Huckfeldt, the floor is yours. \nPaul Huckfeldt: Thank you, Lisa. Good morning and welcome to our quarterly conference call to review our financial results for the fiscal 2024 third quarter, which began July 31 and ended October 29, 2023. Joining me this morning is Jeremy Hoff, our Chief Executive Officer. We appreciate your participation.  During our call, we may make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. A discussion of factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's expectations is contained in our press release and SEC filing announcing our fiscal 2024 third quarter results.  Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today's call. This morning, we reported consolidated net sales for our fiscal 2024 third quarter of 116.8 million, a decrease of 35 million or about 23% compared to last year's third quarter, driven by continued soft demand for home furnishings as well as our exit from Accentrics Home product line.  Despite the sales decline, operating income and margin both increased due to decreased product costs at Hooker Branded and improved margin at Home Meridian due to the exit from unprofitable categories. Consolidated net income was $7 million or $0.65 per diluted share for the quarter, compared to 4.8 million or $0.42 per diluted share in the prior year period. For fiscal 2024, 9 month period, consolidated net sales decreased by 115 million or 25% to 336 million as compared to last year at the same period. Consolidated net income was 9.3 million or $0.85 per diluted share compared to 13.6 million or a $1.14 per diluted share in the prior period.  Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeremy to comment on our fiscal 2024 third quarter results. \nJeremy Hoff: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. On our call today, we'll discuss third quarter and first 9 months results and how our strategy to reposition the Home Meridian segment from a volatile high risk model with unpredictable revenue and profitability to a low risk, more sustainable profit model that is yielding tangible results. While the housing market slow down, high interest rates and a shift in consumer discretionary spending away from home furnishings continue to challenge, we're encouraged by positive indicators like the normalization of ocean freight rates, eased supply chain constraints, more stable raw material cost, and increased labor availability.  As we have forecasted for some time now, profitability improves significantly as we moved into the second half of the year. The Home Meridian segment achieved a quarterly operating income for the first time since calendar year 2021, contributing 900,000 to income in the current year third quarter compared to 3.2 million loss in the prior year third quarter.  Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment for the home furnishings industry, we're proud of our team for persevering through some difficult decisions and short-term pain to create a more sustainable and profitable business model for the segment. After spending the last couple of years repositioning HMI to focus on its core products and businesses, it is encouraging to see HMI report a quarterly profit for the first time in two years and contribute to our overall profitability. HMI inventory levels decreased by 15 million as compared to the year-end and 46 million compared to the prior year third quarter.  In addition, we have realigned our inventory mix to reflect our current business plan and reduced our footprint in the Georgia warehouse by 200,000 square feet in the second quarter, and entered into an agreement in the third quarter to reduce another 200,000 square feet by early next year. Liquidating excess inventories, right sizing our overhead and exiting unprofitable businesses has put us in a much stronger overall position. Our main focus continues to be execution of our strategic growth initiatives and the drivers we can control.  Demand has decreased versus prior quarters, but consolidated orders are still up 12.7 million or 15.7% for the third quarter. For the first 9 months, consolidated orders increased by 75.8 million or 33.5%. Most of the consolidated increase is driven by Home Meridian segment orders, which were unusually low in the prior year period. We've continued this quarter to bolster our financial position, generating about 49 million in cash from operations in the first 9 months of the fiscal year.  At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents were at 40 million, an increase of 21 million from the prior year end. Inventory levels decreased by 32 million from the year end, and 69 million from this time a year ago. The recent fall high point market was positive by all measurables across the company. Increased visibility is one of our major strategic objectives, adding 2 smaller showrooms in Las Vegas and Atlanta while moving our largest high point showroom has created an exponentially larger audience for our products on the legacy side of our business, as well as Sunset West.  HMI also had a good market as they focus on strengthening the product assortment for Pulaski, Samuel Lawrence Furniture and PRI. The efforts by our team at HMI to re-energize and reposition the product offerings for growth, received a lot of positive retail feedback in new placements from our major customers.  As reported before, the collective impact of our new showrooms in High Point, Atlanta and Las Vegas has increased our customer contacts from about 3000 to around 14,000 annually, more than quadrupling the number of existing and potential customers. In this first half -- in the first half, we opened 1000 new accounts, as visibility and engagement increased. This quarter, that pace continued as we added 150 new customers on average per month. The furniture industry as a whole continues to experience softer business conditions. However, we feel very good about all of our controllables. We're in a healthy inventory and overhead position. Most of our cost reductions other than warehousing are behind us and we do not expect more personnel reductions.  Now I want to turn the discussion over to Paul, who will discuss highlights in each of our segments. \nPaul Huckfeldt: Thanks, Jeremy. Beginning with Hooker Branded, Soft Home Furnishings demand and short-term delays with an impact of about 3 million related to the implementation of our new ERP system over the Labor Day weekend, drove a net sales decrease in the segment of about 17 million or 31%. Without the ERP related delays, we believe sales would've been about 26% below the prior year. Despite the sales decline, Hooker Branded reported a solid operating income of 7.3 million and an operating margin of 18.6%, an improvement compared to the 5.9 million and 10.3% in the prior year quarter.  For fiscal 2024 9-month period, net sales decreased by 35 million or 23% due to decreased unit volume. Sales decreases underscore the softer demand for home furnishings. Gross profit and margin both increased for the fiscal 2024 third quarter despite the decline in net sales, these favorable outcomes attributed to significantly decreased product costs driven by lower ocean freight rates. In addition, warehousing costs were lower due to lower demurrage and drainage expenses, as well as lower labor and compensation expenses due to the reduced shipping activities.  The higher-than-average gross profit margin of 45.6% for the quarter is expected to be temporary and as a result of the timing of reduced freight and product costs and recent price reductions across the segment. While price decreases and promotions were implemented in August, the majority of inventory sold in the quarter still carry higher selling prices, which were implemented in the prior years to address massive freight cost increases, which resulted in unusually high gross margins. We expect Hooker Branded margins to normalize the historical levels in the coming quarters.  Incoming orders increased by 7% compared to the prior year's third quarter, and this year's second quarter. Although quarter end order backlog was lower than the prior year quarter end, it increased from this year's second quarter and remained nearly 70% higher than pre pandemic levels at the end of the fiscal 2020 third quarter.  At Home Meridian, Home Meridian segment net sales decreased by 6.9 million or 13% compared to the prior year third quarter, but increased compared to the first and second quarters of the current year. Sales decreases in the e-Commerce channel previously served by Accentrics Home accounted for over 40% of the overall decrease in the segment due to our exit from that line. The remaining decreases in the segment were driven by sales decreases at Samuel Lawrence Furniture, PRI and Pulaski, all divisions observe independent furniture stores and major retail chains. These decreases were partially offset by strong sales at Samuel Lawrence Hospitality, which reported sales increases of 152% and 46% for the third quarter and 9 months respectively.  Despite the net sales decrease, HMI gross profit and margin increased by 940 basis points or $3.4 million in the fiscal 2024 third quarter. This increase was attributed to improved margin as we exited from unprofitable sales channels and product lines. Decreased product costs and increased profitability in our hospitality division also helped. Furthermore, decreased costs in the Georgia warehouse and decreased wage expenses due to organizational and personnel changes all contributed to the increase in gross profit margin. For the fiscal 2024 9 month period, gross profits slightly decreased driven by sales decreases while gross margin increased by 530 basis points due to the factors I've just mentioned. As well as the absence of the warehouse transition and startup costs incurred in the prior year first quarter.  Home Meridian recorded a quarterly operating income of $900,000 compared to a $3.2 million operating loss in the prior year third quarter. The liquidation of inventories that were written down at in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 were essentially completed during the quarter and we had an immaterial impact on gross profit.  Incoming orders were 19% higher than the prior year third quarter, but lower than the first and second quarter orders as our retail customers are matching their inventories and orders to current soft demand for home furnishings. The quarter end backlog was lower than the same period a year ago. At domestic upholstery after 2 years of sales growth, domestic upholstery net sales decreased by 11 million or 25% in the fiscal 2024 third quarter due to lower demand. All four divisions reported sales decreases for the quarter and the 9 month period. Gross profit and margin both decreased in the fiscal 2024, third quarter and 9 month period driven by net sales decreases.  Direct material costs were below prior year periods due to more stable raw material costs. However, these decreases were more than offset by under absorbed indirect costs, which were higher compared to the prior year third quarter and 9 month period, primarily due to indirect labor costs. Incoming orders increased by 39% in comparison to the third quarter of the prior year as Bradington-Young, HF Custom and Shenandoah all recorded increased orders. Sunset orders remained flat as compared to the prior year third quarter.  Quarter end backlog for the segment slightly decreased from the second quarter end. As Bradington-Young's backlog was 2.5 times that of pre-pandemic levels. While backlogs at HF Custom and Shenandoah decreased to levels comparable to the fiscal 2020 year end.  One of our core values at Hooker Furnishings, is maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial position. As Jeremy mentioned earlier, we generated 49 million in cash from operations during the first 9 months. That cash funded $12 million of share repurchases, $7 million of cash dividends to our shareholders, 5.7 million of capital expenditures, including the investments in our new showrooms, 3.8 million for the development of our cloud-based ERP system and 2.4 million to acquire BOBO Intriguing Objects in the second quarter.  On Tuesday, we announced our quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share, a 4.5% increase over the previous dividend, which will result in annual dividend yield just under 5%. This increase represents the 8th consecutive year in which we increased our dividend, reflecting our confidence in our business model and our commitment to providing a return to our shareholders. Also relating to shareholder value, during the third quarter, we completed the share repurchase program which began in the second quarter of last year. Over that time, we spent a total of $25 million in a little over a year to purchase and retire 1.4 million shares of our common stock.  With that, I'll turn the discussion back to Jeremy for his outlook. \nJeremy Hoff: While economic indicators remain mixed and furniture retail traffic is down about 15% from January through October 2023, the long-term outlook has improved. Reduced housing activity, high mortgage and interest rates are still challenging, but several positives have emerged since last quarter. Core inflation is at its -- at the lowest level since 2021, the US economy grew nearly at 5% last quarter. Unemployment remains at record lows and the risk of recession appears to be moderating.  As we look to the next quarter, we see flat sales for our Hooker legacy brands, but a continued short-term reduction for HMI sales until the new retail placements begin to generate more sales sometime in the first quarter next year. Early indications in the fourth quarter signal that incoming order activity is returning to better levels, we experienced most of this year. We believe our growth initiatives will continue to gain traction in the first half of 2024. Our focus on reducing cost, keeping our balance sheet strong and judiciously deploying capital along with our investments to promote higher visibility and future growth, continue to put us in the strongest possible position to leverage your return of furniture demand to more typical levels.  This ends the formal part of our discussion. And at this time, I will turn the call back over to our operator, Lisa, for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today will be coming from Anthony Lebiedzinski of Sidoti. \nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Nice to see the bottom-line out performance and certainly a stronger balance sheet from a year ago. So, as far -- so I guess, HMI certainly big improvement of profitability versus a year ago, the gross margin there was about 20%. So is this how we should think about segment gross margins going forward, or was there anything unusual in the quarter that maybe this pace of gross margin expansion is not sustainable? \nPaul Huckfeldt: That's close to our targets. There's a little bit of fixed cost in there with our warehousing costs, but so that could dip with sales decline a little bit, but that's the ballpark in a normalized environment, I think that is what you should be thinking about. \nAnthony Lebiedzinski : Okay. So that's certainly better than it used to be historically. So that's encouraging. \nJeremy Hoff : Well, the gross margin historically been getting covered up by the bad businesses that we exited. \nAnthony Lebiedzinski : Correct. Right. Okay. And then, the gross margin at the Hooker branded was unusually strung on, as you pointed out. Do you think you'll see any sort of benefits from the higher priced products in the fourth quarter, or do you think you've pretty much flushed out the, all of that in the third quarter? \nJeremy Hoff : We believe that, we flush -- we have flushed a lot of that out, but we still think there may be some benefit left partially in the fourth quarter. \nPaul Huckfeldt : Should normalize customer. \nJeremy Hoff : Yes. \nAnthony Lebiedzinski : Got it. And in terms of your outlook, so for the fourth quarter, you gave us some quantifiable numbers for the hooker branded. You think sales will be kind of flat, down at HMI, there was no mention really about domestic upholstery, so I guess, with the orders coming in 16% higher, which is encouraging, but the talk of software demand. So in total, how should we think about the fourth quarter revenue? I guess if we put all the pieces together? \nJeremy Hoff: So, I'll speak to that somewhat generally, but and then Paul can fill in the blanks, but have to remember the backlogs that we were coming out of from last year versus this year and our order, so they were extremely high. And so, the order rate was extremely low against a lot of those businesses. So these high percentages of order rates up are just really filling the backlogs back up for probably closer to a normalized business level versus the increases it looks like in the order rate. Does that make sense? \nAnthony Lebiedzinski : Yep. Sounds good. And then lastly, before I pass the call to others, so as far as the buyback you completed the repurchase authorization, what is your appetite for doing another share buyback, or would you say your preference would be to pay off whatever debt you have given the higher interest rate environment? \nJeremy Hoff: I think right now our objective is to make sure that we're right about the economy and maybe keep it, maintain the strong balance sheet and fund organic growth. I mean, if you've looked at our investor presentation, we've got a lot of pretty aggressive growth targets. We've got some specific strategies, and I think our primary objective now is to fund those organic growth strategies. We've got Bobo and we've got Sunset West that we're expect to grow pretty significantly. So I think for the short term, those are our higher priorities than another share buyback. And of course, maintain our dividend we're very proud of the dividend and we just increased the dividend again for the eighth consecutive year. So, I think those are all higher priorities than another share repurchases. \nOperator: Our next question will be coming from David Storms of Stonegate. \nDavid Storms : So just wanted to start with some of the normalization and demand and kind of how you think about productivity and capacity specifically in like the home Meridian segment? I noticed that orders were up, but backlog was down. Is this just efficiency is going way up or is there more capacity that you could get out of that segment? \nJeremy Hoff: Really, the timing of the order rate increasing on the HMI side didn't happen until later in the third quarter, which created a lower backlog situation as you mentioned. And that is why we're saying a lot of the placements we have out there, we have a lot of good indicators that those are working and we're starting to get significantly increased orders on the HMI business, and that's why we believe the backlog will spend its time getting larger during the fourth quarter. And that's also why we believe the first quarter will be significantly better for HMI in the first quarter. \nDavid Storms : We have the Lunar New Year will change some of the shipping patterns too. \nJeremy Hoff: Right. But as it relates to backlog and as it relates to orders, it's really the timing of when those orders really improved on the HMI side. Is that helpful? \nDavid Storms : Yes, it does. Thank you. And then just when we're thinking about the increased visibility you have going forward as you open up your new showrooms and such, what kind of runway do you think there is for that to improve demand and then ultimately turn into new orders? \nJeremy Hoff: So, as it relates to the visibility, which is really when we're talking about the Hooker Legacy side of our business, that increased visibility is as we mentioned, also allowing us to be able to try and sell a lot more of a customer base than we've had previously. Selling that customer base and the particular types of customers we're talking about takes some time to really get into their wheelhouse of what they're doing from a project level, whether it be the interior designers and, you know, the things we're trying to work on. So step one is the visibility. Step two is opening the account. Step three is the engagement level that we're able to achieve with those additional accounts, which takes some time, but we, but from our history of doing this with thousands of accounts before we somewhat know that it will eventually kick in and we believe it's a significant growth opportunity for us. \nDavid Storms : Okay. And then just one follow up on that, what kind of timeline do you expect around, you know, going from making contacts to opening accounts to that turning into sales? \nJeremy Hoff: I would say from when we started the higher visibility, I would say, I believe that, you know, it's a from now another 12 to 18 month timeline to really see significant boost on that legacy side due to the visibility exercise. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Budd Bugatch of Water Tower Research. \nBudd Bugatch: Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Paul. And congratulations on the profit performance in the quarter. And then that, that's notable. Hard to do that with down sales. \nJeremy Hoff: Yes. I really appreciate it. Thank you. \nBudd Bugatch: You talk about getting back to normalized margins, gross margins in the Hooker Legacy business. What are those now, after having gone through covid and supply chain and inflation and disinflation and what are those normalized margins today? \nJeremy Hoff: Okay. On the Hooker Branded, yes. I mean, it's been a long time since we've seen normalized margins, but I think, you know, in that low 30% high 20, low 30 is a more normal margin. You know, obviously there are a lot of dynamics that could still affect it, but that would be sort of a, once we get through this last round of mismatched prices and costs, which right now working in our favor, it should be back in that low 30% range for Hooker Branded. The other part of our Hooker Legacy business is the domestic upholstery business, and that's a mid to low twenties margin. Itâ€™s a manufacturing business, it's a different dynamic. \nPaul Huckfeldt : You know, but our goal was never to increase our Hooker Branded margins and to increase our prices because, you know, we wanted more margin. Our goal was to keep our margins historically where they were while we went through the incredible fluctuations and cost of freight and ocean freight and demurrage, I mean, you name it. And any furniture people on the call know exactly what I'm talking about too, but it was pretty crazy the gyrations we had to go through as a business. So we also protected our backlog for our customers that had orders for customers going into that, all of that chaos, which we took hits on the other side of that negatively, which impacted us. But it was the right, we believe it was the right thing to do. Because we've said publicly, we believe in our relationships and our customers, and that's a big part of what we do and who we -- what we believe we are. So we did that on the front end, on the back end, we're getting some cost reductions that are helping us temporarily, but we have -- as we promised, all of our customers, we have reduced our prices to what we believe they were close to where they were from a value proposition standpoint previous to all the crazy freight rates and everything that we had going on. \nBudd Bugatch: As a former retailer, I can tell you that, I remember the angst that was created when the price prevailing phrase was bandied around the industry through a previous inflation or time period. And you do too. I'm sure \nJeremy Hoff: I do. Absolutely. I do. You're right. \nBudd Bugatch: So my question is, how long does it take to get back to those normalized margins? That sounds like that mix is somewhere at the low 20s high -- low 30s, high 20s kind of range. And that's a notable time -- notable delta. How long does it take to get back to that normalized gross margin? \nPaul Huckfeldt : We expect that it'll be first quarter. We'll be back to what we said normalized margins. \nBudd Bugatch: Okay. That's encouraging. And the next question is, I'm confused a little bit about the 14,000 contact number. Those are not unique accounts. That's if you see your same account multiple times inside that number andâ€¦\nJeremy Hoff : No those are unique. We don't -- and we don't count individuals. We count accounts. And in fact, we had two significant entertainment evenings in high point. One was a celebration of our opening showroom. And we do it kind of once a market. We don't count those numbers when the attendance boost. Because we believe those are kind of the same people candidly coming back multiple times to enter -- to have some fun. So we try to make it as -- we really want the real picture for ourselves, not just for you. We want to understand what's actually going on so we can anticipate what will happen.  So we were somewhat -- we knew it would be better than what we were on the 10th floor of commerce before versus where we are now. We also thought it would improve from our Las Vegas showroom and our Atlanta showroom. We had no idea we would more than quadruple. So this is -- we're pretty excited about it. And we think that this is really set us up for a very good future for our company, for growth and really across the board. But the legacy in particular from those showroom removes. \nBudd Bugatch: So help me out here. Hooker's always been known to have a wide, be very widely distributed with a lot of accounts. I mean, so those are notable numbers. And maybe just give this a comparison of high point. How much did the moving to showplace from the 10th floor increase that those contacts or those interactions? \nJeremy Hoff : The increase in high point in April was around 92%. And the increase in October, and I'm just doing April from April previous showroom and October increase was in the 80s. I believe it was around 84%. \nPaul Huckfeldt : I think it was 88%. \nJeremy Hoff : Paul believes 88%. The point is we've almost doubled our attendance in that showroom versus our old showroom. And the answer, the first part of your question, yes, we sell a lot of brick-and-mortar, a lot of retailers. There's only so many retailers at the point you were making, but there's a lot more designers. We used to not let designers in our showroom period. And a lot of our industry was the same way. So, obviously that changed years ago, but we continued to drive that strategy and for us it's a very significant part of our growth strategy. \nBudd Bugatch: So that's exactly where I was going to go next. Because I mean, that seems to be the growth, the Delta, is there a level of volume for even some of the small designers that make it an unprofitable account to handle? Do you have to -- how do you manage the profitability of an account? \nJeremy Hoff: Well, you'll remember this, there's so much digital now. You don't have all the catalog costs, you don't have all of the sending out a price list. You don't have -- there's a lot of things that have changed the dynamics of what it costs to sell an account. So with those dynamics, along with some other things we're doing -- we've managed to figure out how to make that work financially. \nBudd Bugatch: It's fascinating. And of the 14,000, can you separate for us maybe the retailers versus the designer or the different type of, the alternative type of distribution? \nJeremy Hoff: No, I really can't right now, but I'm sorry. \nBudd Bugatch: That's okay. I understand that that's competitive and it's certainly fair for you to tell me, but that's our job is to ask and -- \nJeremy Hoff: No, I appreciate the question. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the Q&A session for today. I would like to turn the call back over to Jeremy Hoff for closing remarks. Please go ahead. \nJeremy Hoff: Thank you, Lisa. I would like to thank everyone on the call for their interest in Hooker Furnishings and wish you all a happy holiday season. We look forward to sharing our fiscal 2024 full year results in April next year. Take care. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Paul Huckfeldt, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nPaul Huckfeldt: Thanks, Catherine. Good morning and welcome to our quarterly conference call to review our financial results for the fiscal 2024 second quarter, which began May 1st, and ended on July 30th, 2023. Joining me this morning is Jeremy Hoff, our Chief Executive Officer. We certainly appreciate your participation today. During our call, we may make forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. A discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's expectations is contained in our press release and SEC filing announcing our fiscal 2024 second quarter results. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today's call. This morning, we reported consolidated net sales for the fiscal 2024 second quarter of $97.8 million, a decrease of $55 million or 36%, as compared to last year's second quarter, driven by industry-wide weak demand for home furnishings and the planned exit of unprofitable operations within our Home Meridian segment. Net sales decreased by $30 million in the Home Meridian segment and $18 million in our Hooker Branded Segment, as well as $7.4 million in the domestic upholstery segment. Consolidated net income was $785,000 or $0.07 per diluted share for the quarter, compared to $5.5 million or $0.46 per diluted share in the prior year period. For the fiscal 2024 first-half consolidated net sales were $219 million, down $80 million or 26.8%, compared to last yearâ€™s first-half. Consolidated net income was $2.2 million or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to $8.7 million or $0.73 per diluted share in the prior year six month period. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeremy to comment on our fiscal 2024 second quarter results.\nJeremy Hoff: Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. On our call today, we'll discuss second quarter and first-half results. In addition, we will report on our progress in strengthening our financial position in this challenging environment and strategically deploying capital and other resources to invest in future growth and higher visibility with potential customers. We believe the current industry-wide softer demand is driven by retailers continuing to sell through over inventory positions and a glut of heavily discounted home furnishings in the market. In addition, the year-over-year comparisons reflect our exit from the higher risk non-profitable operations in the Home Meridian segment. We are encouraged that incoming orders have trended higher each month through the summer, compared to prior year, and consolidated orders are up by double-digits versus a year ago. During the quarter, we bolstered our financial position generating over $51 million in cash from operations and ending the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $50 million. Additionally, we reduced inventory levels by $70 million from a year ago and completed most of our targeted liquidation sales at the Home Meridian segment's discontinued inventories. The quality of our inventories is much better than it was at the end of last year and is aligned with expected demand. In addition, our investments focused on building a larger customer base are working. For example, the collective impact of our new showrooms in High Point Atlanta and Las Vegas increased our customer contacts from about 3,000 to around 14,000 annually, quadrupling our interactions with existing and potential customers. While we expect that the full impact of this investment will be mostly longer term, we've already opened 1,000 new accounts in the first-half of the year as visibility and engagement have increased. The transformation of the Home Meridian segment to a sustainably profitable business model is well underway. Most of the excess inventories connected to the business unit closures at the end of the last fiscal year have been sold and the related cost reduction efforts are paying off. In addition, we reduced our Georgia warehouse footprint by 200,000 square feet during the quarter and expect to reduce another 100,000 to 200,000 square feet in early calendar â€˜24. Rightsizing our footprint to align with our current demand when we no longer stock significant volumes of inventory for Accentrics Home will not only reduce cost, it will improve liquidity and working capital levels. HMI recorded a small operating income in fiscal July, and while we continue to expect some short-term volatility in sales and earnings, we expected to achieve profitability in the second-half of this fiscal year. The hard work and difficult decisions we've made over the past 18-months are beginning to show benefits. We have reduced our overhead run rate from a high of over $40 million to about $32 million now and expect to be below $30 million by year's end coupled with improvements in contribution margin, we believe we will have lowered Home Meridian's breakeven point by over $150 million and we'll be able to focus on building stable, profitable volume for the segment. During the quarter, we were pleased to have completed the acquisition of Atlanta-based decorative accessories specialist BOBO Intriguing Objects. This acquisition broadens our product diversity to include lighting, decor, textiles and wall art. Adding BOBO to our brand portfolio positions us as an even more valuable and comprehensive partner for our customer base. Like last year's Sunset West acquisition, we intend to scale BOBO using our existing sales, marketing and operations teams to make it a material part of our consolidated sales in the medium to longer term. Now I want to turn the discussion over to Paul, who will discuss highlights in each of our segments.\nPaul Huckfeldt: Thanks, Jeremy. Beginning with Hooker branded. Net sales in the segment decreased by $18 million or 34% in the fiscal 2024 second quarter, due to decreased unit volume. Furthermore, discounting was 240 basis points higher than the prior year quarter, which was unusually low. For the fiscal 2024 first-half, Hooker branded sales decreased by $18.5 million or 19%, compared to the prior year six month period. Sales decreases in both periods underscore the softer demand for home furnishings. Despite a decrease in net sales, gross margin increased due primarily to favorable product costs from lower freight rates and to a lesser extent decreased warehousing costs. The segment reported operating income of $3.2 million and an operating margin of 9.3%, compared to $6.1 million and a 11.5% in the prior year's second quarter. While the order backlog was lower than the prior year quarter end, it remains 40% higher than pre-pandemic levels at the end of the fiscal 2020 second quarter. Incoming orders increased by almost 19% compared to the prior year quarter, a significant portion of Hooker brandedâ€™s backlog consists of orders from new products received late last year and earlier this year, which are expected to ship in the second-half of this year and position the segment positively for upcoming quarters. Turning to Home Meridian, net sales decreased by $30 million or 51% in the fiscal 2024 second quarter, due to reduced demand for Home Furnishings and the absence of sales from exited higher risk, unprofitable operations. Sales decreases in the major furniture chains accounted for about 70% of the decline and the e-commerce channel accounted for about 15% of the decrease. Gross profit and margin both decreased in the 2024 second quarter, resulting from the net sales decline and under absorbed operating costs. Product costs decreased as a percentage of net sales, due to lower freight costs, but fixed costs due to warehousing rent and labor expenses adversely impacted the gross margin, due to significant lower net sales. For the six month period, Home Meridian sales decreased due to these same factors. As Jeremy mentioned earlier, we reduced our Georgia warehouse footprint by 200,000 square feet during the quarter and expect to further reduce that in the future, bringing total square footage to around 500,000 square feet in early calendar 2024 versus a 1 million square feet a year ago. This rightsizing will reduce costs and improve liquidity and working capital. Due to the significant sales decline under absorbed operating costs, Home Meridian reported a $3.3 million operating loss for the quarter. However, its first-half operating loss was consistent with management's expectations. Quarter end backlog was lower than the previous year's quarter, and fiscal 2020 second quarter. This decline is attributed to the absence of orders from the exited operations, as well as a reduction in incoming orders from our retail customer, who are still carrying excess inventories ordered during the previous year. In domestic upholstery, net sales decreased by $7.4 million or 19% in the second quarter, due to sales decreases Shenandoah and HF Custom formally known as Sam Moore, partially offset by a 10% increase at Sunset West. Bradington-Young net sales were about the same as the prior year second quarter. Despite the sales decrease, gross margin was 200 basis points higher than the prior year, due to decreased direct costs, including more stable raw material costs and lower direct labor costs, due to reduced production at HF Custom in Shenandoah, partially offset by under absorbed indirect costs. For the fiscal 2024 first-half, net sales decreased at HF Custom, Shenandoah, and some Sunset West. Bradington-Young reported a small sales increase in the six month period. Incoming orders increased by 36%, compared to the prior year quarter. However, orders in the prior year period were relatively low due to higher backlogs and longer lead times. Quarter end backlog for Bradington-Young remained 3 times that of pre-pandemic levels at the fiscal 2020 second quarter. While the backlog at HF Custom and Shenandoah decreased to levels similar to fiscal 2020. All other net sales increased in both the second quarter and first-half, driven by higher sales at H Contract as the senior living industry continues to recover after the COVID pandemic and to a lesser extent, the addition of BOBO net sales. Gross profit and margin also increased in the [Indiscernible] On the balance sheet, we made considerable progress in our cash and inventory position and in strategic capital investments. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $50 million at the fiscal 2024 quarter end, an increase of $31 million from the prior year. Inventory levels decreased by $35 million from year-end $70 million from a year ago. During the six month period $51 million of cash generated from operating activities, funded $8.7 million in share repurchases; $4.9 million in cash dividends; $4 million in capital expenditures, including investments in our new showrooms; $2.6 million for the development of our cloud based ERP system as well as $2.4 million for the BOBO acquisition. Since the share repurchase program began in the second quarter of last year, we spent approximately $22 million purchase and retire 1.3 million shares of our common stock as of the end of this quarter. In addition to cash balances an aggregate $27 million was available under our existing revolver at quarter end. For the remainder of the year, we plan to continue to strengthen our balance sheet, continue our share repurchase program as appropriate and continue to invest in organic growth opportunities, which we believe will position us favorably as business continues to improve. Now I'll turn the discussion back to Jeremy for his outlook.\nJeremy Hoff: We believe there are mixed signals in the economy, a housing shortage and the over 20-year high on fixed mortgage rates has slowed down housing activity. The continued rise in interest rates has suppressed customer -- consumer confidence. However, overall retail spending and activity in the manufacturing sector and new business startups is healthy, while the unemployment rate remains near a 30-year low. As we anticipated, the first-half of the year was difficult as the industry worked through bloated inventories and changing consumer spending habits, we expect demand and business to pick up in the second-half for several reasons. First, consolidated orders are up in the mid-double-digits over this time a year ago, with orders trending up in each segment for the past few months. Secondly, a significant portion of Hooker Branded's backlog consists of orders for new products launched at the High Point market and are expected to ship in the second-half of this year. Thirdly, in the second-half, Home Meridian expects to ship over 1,000 retail floors, what we believe to be the largest number of new product placements in its history. We believe all the right pieces are in place to return Home Meridian to profitability in the second half of the year. While we are focused on reducing overhead cost, keeping our balance sheet strong and judiciously deploying capital, we have continued to invest significantly in initiatives that promote higher visibility with potential customers and ensure future growth and believe these things will put us in the strongest position as demand continues to improve. This ends the formal part of our discussion. And at this time, I will turn the call back over to our operator, Catherine, for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Anthony Lebiedzinski from Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions.\nJeremy Hoff: Good morning, Anthony.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Alright, so first -- hi good morning. So first, just curious about the cadence of sales from May through July, if you could comment on that. And then can you give us an early read on Q3? And I'm curious to hear your thoughts as far as how -- what are you hearing from your retail customers about Labor Day, which is an important holiday for the furniture industry?\nJeremy Hoff: Sure. When you say cadence of sales, you mean shipments or orders?\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: The shipments.\nJeremy Hoff: Okay. Just making sure we're on the same page. So as far as shipments, obviously, our backlogs got to a level that wasn't really great for sustainable shipments throughout the quarter is how I would summarize it. As the quarter progressed, orders increased, as we mentioned, and our backlogs are improving, but that debt the timing issue on all of that definitely affected us for the quarter. Our feedback from Labor Day has been really positive. I would say, in almost every area that we've checked, the reports back were either they were above last year or they were just barely -- they were either at it or just below last year, which last year was really big. So we think that's really a positive sign for us overall.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: That's good to hear, Jeremy. And then so nice job with your own balance sheet improvements with lower inventories and improved cash position. So do you think you can make further progress with inventories? Or do you think that as quarters pick up further that you're kind of -- this is maybe the low point of inventories. Just maybe if you could just help us understand like where do we -- where do you think inventories go from here?\nJeremy Hoff: We think inventories are going to stabilize from here. We believe we -- this is as healthy of an inventory position that we've been in since I started, particularly with the ACH that we've gone through the Accentrics Home and everything that's been public. But from our standpoint, what I would really say is I feel the best about all of our controllables as an overall company as I have since I started. So -- and it has a lot to do with the balance sheet. It has a lot to do with the inventories. We're in a great position from a demand standpoint as it relates to our inventories and our order rates are significantly up. So all the things we believe we can actually affect, I feel really good about.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got you. Okay. And then so as order rates improve, as you talked about double-digit order increases that you've seen, does that imply that you'll see shipment and sales increases in the back half of the year? Or do you think there will still be somewhat of a disconnect there? And my question is on a year-over-year basis, by the way.\nJeremy Hoff: I would say year-over-year, we're going to compete pretty well in the second-half versus what we did in the first-half. I'm not ready to say that we'll beat the second-half last year, because it was a pretty substantial shipping half, because we were still somewhat inflated from sales from pandemic. But I do feel like it's going to be a little bit a tale of two-halves for us, and we're going to have a lot more positive shipping and order rate throughout the second-half.\nPaul Huckfeldt: And we've reduced the operating costs.\nJeremy Hoff: Yes, right. So we're really going against a whole different denominator throughout that half as well.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Understood. Okay. Got you. Yes, I know it looks like you're making further progress with Home Meridian overhead and in their warehousing space. So it looks like Sunset West was one of the key highlights in the quarter here. What's driving that? And do you think that growth is sustainable?\nJeremy Hoff: We do. It's actually one of our larger growth initiatives with that throughout the whole company. And we see it as on several levels, a big opportunity. One is when we bought the company, they're very West Coast centric. So our ability to expand their distribution throughout the U.S. with our sales team throughout our territories, as you know whether you're talking Florida, South Carolina, Texas, anywhere throughout the U.S., we definitely have more representation and stronger relationships than what they had before we bought them. Number two, being able to position Savannah with Sunset West also doing some cuts so cushion stuff and things we need to do out of our HF Custom facility in Bedford, we've created the supply chain really on both sides of the U.S., which is going to really feed growth in the eastern half of the United States, due to the cost savings of freight and really just the visibility, again, before we bought them, they didn't have a high point showroom. Now they're in, of course, our show place. They were in Chicago for the casual show there. Now they're in Atlanta. Their visibility has gone up exponentially and their ability to ship from both sides of the country. So all those factors are going to contribute in a pretty major way to their growth.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: That's good to hear. And then -- so you made a small acquisition in the quarter. Just curious about your appetite for additional acquisitions?\nJeremy Hoff: We're always open-minded in what comes along. We're pretty candidly, we're pretty particular at this point. It has to really be a white space. We don't want anything that will cannibalize what we currently are focused on within our -- throughout our portfolio. However, in this instance, for example, BOBO, our number one question when our customers look at Hooker case goods is who did this lighting, can I buy the lighting? And the number one reason we bought BOBO is so that we can change the note to a yes on that question.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: That makes a lot of sense. Okay, I guess -- and then my last question as far as the buyback. So you guys have certainly done a good job of having a well-balanced, I think, capital allocation between dividends and buybacks. So do you guys have much left on the buyback? Or have you exhausted the repurchase authorization? If you can give us an update on that, that would be very helpful.\nPaul Huckfeldt: We have -- as of the end of the quarter, I think we had about $2 million -- $2 million, $2.5 million left. It's -- since then, yes, since then, we purchased another $1 million or so. So it's -- we have just a fairly small amount left on that repurchase, which will continue -- we'll continue to execute that in a 10 (d) 5-1 plan. I think it's worked really well. But we have to balance that with bolstering the balance sheet. The economy is still a little bit uncertain. So we're trying to balance that -- our capital allocation strategy along with maintaining a strong balance sheet.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Understood. Well, thank you very much and best of luck.\nJeremy Hoff: Thank you, Anthony.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Dave Storms with Stonegate. Your line is open.\nDave Storms: Good morning.\nJeremy Hoff: Good morning.\nPaul Huckfeldt: Good morning, Dave.\nDave Storms: Appreciate just taking my call. Just wanted to start towards the top of the balance sheet. It looks like gross profit margin is up about 350, 355 basis points or so. Can you just talk about what the drivers are of that on a year-over-year basis?\nPaul Huckfeldt: Right now, we're benefiting from lower costs. We -- well, as mentioned on the call, our Upholstery margins are up because costs have stabilized, and we've been able to balance our labor better. On the imported product side, we're benefiting from somewhat reduced factory cost, but mostly from the benefit of freight costs and increased the last of our higher prices, as we've had -- we've reduced prices in corresponding with these freight decreases. But the last of the higher-priced inventories are -- less the higher costs are now rolling out. So all those combined with exiting some difficult businesses. This time last year, we were burdened with the upside down cost structure of the ACH business, which is why we chose to exit it. So I think these margins are probably -- the gross margins are probably a little bit high, compared to what we'll see going forward, but more normal than they were this time last year.\nDave Storms: Would it be fair to say that it's more a factor of pricing as opposed to volumes at this point?\nPaul Huckfeldt: Yes.\nDave Storms: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just looking downstream, you've mentioned that orders are really starting to increase, but downstream suppliers are still working through some of their inventory. Are you seeing that come to some sort of turning point just with the orders increasing? Or do you expect destocking to continue going forward?\nJeremy Hoff: Yes. We're actually seeing some of that loosening up, but it definitely has been a factor, and it's continued to be a factor. And that situation seems to be a little different with each retailer. So it's not really a -- it's hard to give a blanket answer, you know, one retailer is dealing with this and another retailer may have bought differently during that time. And -- so -- but overall, we definitely are feeling now a little bit looser environment with regards to inventory for sure. And I think the strong Labor Day sales are going to help us, although I can't say that to this point because we're -- we'll see that in the next few weeks.\nDave Storms: Very helpful. Thank you. And then just going back to -- Paul, I think you mentioned about maintaining a strong balance sheet and how that's very important for you guys. Can you just talk about your comfortability with your current debt position and the revolver availability that you have?\nPaul Huckfeldt: Well, this company has always managed the balance sheet pretty conservatively. And I think it served us very well over the almost 100-year history in the company. And so that's -- it's a core value to try to maintain a strong balance sheet. We have, at this point, $27 million of availability on our revolver, we've got $7 million tied up above that, we've got a $35 million revolver, $7 million is tied up in letters of credit. But we've got $27 million available there. We've got $22 million in debt. So it's a pretty low level of debt. I know this industry is pretty debt of course, but I think still fairly comfortable with that level of debt. We've got $50 million in cash. So I think that's a pretty comfortable level. And -- that's a pretty comfortable level. So -- but we'd like to -- as we see the economy develop over this next year -- the rest of this year, I think we're going to try to manage things cautiously and then make our capital allocation decisions for next year as we -- as we see what happens in the remainder of this year.\nJeremy Hoff: And we always mentioned we have an over 50-year history of paying our dividend as well.\nPaul Huckfeldt: Right. Right, which dividend yield is just under 4%.\nJeremy Hoff: Right, right.\nPaul Huckfeldt: We think that's important for me...\nJeremy Hoff: That's the priority.\nPaul Huckfeldt: Yes.\nDave Storms: Understood. One more for me, if I could. Just from a modeling perspective, CapEx budgets running around $4 million to $5 million a quarter. Is that fair to extrapolate for the foreseeable -- excuse me, for the remainder of 2023?\nPaul Huckfeldt: CapEx for the remainder of this year is probably $1 million-ish. In a normal year, our CapEx is probably $5 million or $6 million. This one -- this year has been a little bit bigger with new showrooms with our ERP project -- so if you're modeling going forward, I would probably put $6 million a year just for CapEx.\nDave Storms: Thatâ€™s all, very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.\nJeremy Hoff: Yes, youâ€™re welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Budd Bugatch from Water Tower Research. Your line is open.\nBudd Bugatch: Thank you very much and thank you for taking my questions as well. Congratulations. I want to echo the congratulations on the way you've maintained your balance sheet and your financial condition and what's got to have been I think the most volatile time we've ever seen in the industry and maybe in society.\nJeremy Hoff: We appreciate that. Thank you.\nBudd Bugatch: You're welcome, and well deserve. When I think about Hooker, Hooker has the widest diversity of customers in terms of geography, number of customers and type of business model. And I was wondering, Jeremy, if you could give us maybe a read on what you're hearing from various levels of customers and maybe delve down? I know the majors, who had a big -- or seemed to have had a big problem with the order book in HMI. So what are you seeing as you look around the country and hearing from the retailers, what's their -- what are they talking about?\nJeremy Hoff: So it's interesting, Budd. It's a really good question. So what I've observed and what I've -- things I've heard is, it seems like the type of model that each customer is really flowing their inventories through has a lot to do with what position they've been in from an inventory standpoint. So the larger customers, of course, they're bringing in containers. They're bringing in larger positions of inventory. So those are more difficult to just turn around quickly. So the model of container and case goods, I would say, has been the toughest model across our industry. As you get into domestically inventory position by manufacturers where they can buy anything kind of 1 at a time, that model has been less disruptive because you could fit -- you could actually get some orders into some places that didn't have the situation I just described, which was typically probably more of a medium to smaller customer, also interior designers and of course, e-commerce. Then if you get into another segment, which is domestically made upholstery, that again, that was probably, in my opinion, the most advantaged place to be throughout the situation we've all been in, for all the reasons I just stated from an inventory position. It's -- a lot of it's custom order. A lot of it's 1 at a time. So really, the different models, kind of, in my opinion, determined what type of position each retailer was in.\nBudd Bugatch: And going -- digging down on that in Labor Day, which you may have heard, and I realize it's only anecdotal at this time. What are you -- are you hearing any differences in how the demand is coming back to these retailers and to the various classes of retailers and the health of the inventories you mentioned, I think that the inventory seems to be -- do you think you've seen the end of destocking. So how are inventories at retail and among the majors, obviously, because the smaller guys would offer, as you said, order one by one. So when weâ€¦\nJeremy Hoff: We believe they're getting in a much better position, but I think Labor Day, we're going to find out if that really put them over the -- over that line of feeling better about ordering more products. I think a lot of that has affected producers overseas. Of course, it's been slow. And in my opinion, and it's just strictly my opinion, I think that there will be some maybe overreaction in letting inventories get possibly too low. And then there might be, okay, how do I get things quick enough and we may be in a little bit of a bottleneck towards the end of the year? I don't know this, by the way, I'm just telling you what I think may happen.\nBudd Bugatch: Oh, well, we've seen it before in the industry. That's happened before...\nJeremy Hoff: Right, right. Exactly.\nBudd Bugatch: When you look at sales on a comparable basis, I realize we've got the ACH discontinuation. We've got some other things. How does it look on a same kind of same location basis segment by segment or overall company?\nJeremy Hoff: So I want to make sure I understand your question. Are you are you asking how we'll look across the different businesses now that ACH and the clubs business and whatnot are gone?\nBudd Bugatch: Well, I'm not looking at the future, looking at the quarter or at year-to-date, how was it on that basis with taking out the discontinued operations or the things that you -- the initiatives that you are paring back. So I'm sure you look at it on a kind of a comparable basis, as well as an overall consolidated basis.\nJeremy Hoff: Yes. So ACH would have been $8 million to $10 million of that picture. I don't have the exact number you're looking for, but we'd be happy to jump on a call and figure that number out and give it to you later.\nBudd Bugatch: That would be great. And when you look at -- you've talked about the destocking with the majors and the way you flow goods. You've got probably maybe the largest -- 1 of the larger import businesses as well. So what are you seeing -- you talked about, I think, before you're going to try and move away from your sourcing from China. And obviously, that's a big issue in society in the country. What are you seeing -- what's your progress on that? And what's the health of your suppliers in the Pacific rim?\nJeremy Hoff: We feel really good about the health of our suppliers overseas. We're less than 10% now in China. We were as much as, I believe, I think we're around 35% at 1 point in China. So we've made a significant reduction in that. Also, a major improvement for us that we haven't talked about is the number of factories we used to deal with when we had the clubs business when we had Accentrics Home when we had we had RTA, I mean, just to give you an idea, just Accentrics Home at over 60 factories. So when you think about the people we have overseas, which is a really pretty substantial team, but them being able to focus on the number of factors we have now, which is we feel the correct number for our business, and it's not spreading out our team because we have quality and other individuals that have to be in those factories. So as you do that, you lose sight and focus on the things that actually matter, which is a big benefit to what we've done as well.\nBudd Bugatch: So Vietnam now the largest of your supply countries?\nJeremy Hoff: Yes.\nBudd Bugatch: Okay. And last for me would be HMI. Any other actions you're contemplating here that you can talk about? Obviously, if you've got some that may affect people, you probably can't talk about it, but -- any other things strategically that you see do you think they need to do with Home Meridian?\nJeremy Hoff: No our -- the nice thing about Home Meridian at this point is it's just we need to grow, and we're focused on growing Pulaski, growing Samuel Lawrence, PRI and also our hospitality division. And we have a lot of things, as we mentioned, over 1,000 store placements going out between -- right before this call and after which is going to, we believe, feed a lot of future revenues for HMI. And because as we mentioned, the overhead -- the breakeven point for HMI is such a different place now -- that's why we feel so confident about how we're going to do within that business for the future.\nBudd Bugatch: And I would have thought hospitality would have been a real strong point during the quarter with what's going on in the country. Is that true?\nJeremy Hoff: Budd, I missed the first part of your question, I'm sorry.\nBudd Bugatch: I would say hospitality should have been -- I would think, would have been very strong during the quarter.\nJeremy Hoff: Yes, definitely bright spot. It was definitely a bright spot for us. Also the H Contract, which is focused on senior living was another bright spot for us throughout the quarter.\nBudd Bugatch: Thank you very much. Iâ€™m sorry [Indiscernible]\nPaul Huckfeldt: I'm sorry Budd the remaining cost reductions of those warehouse reductions that we've got planned, we don't have any personnel related actively say we don't have any personal relatedâ€¦\nJeremy Hoff: No, we feel really good about our overhead position and also the cost -- the next cost reductions all have to do with more space in Savannah, getting out of more space in Savannah to get to the $500,000 we talked about. And also, we believe there's labor efficiency that will save us down there as well. So -- but most of our cost reductions have been taken care of. And our plan moving forward is just run a solid, sustainable business that is actually predictable and we don't have the surprises we've had to report in the past.\nBudd Bugatch: Okay. Paul, I would have thought one thing you did say is that the higher freight costs is that out of the inventory now, has impacted inventory it had to flow in there. Do you think all those excess of container rate costs are gone?\nPaul Huckfeldt: Yes. I think through the summer, we worked our way out of it by the end of the summer. I think most of the excess costs were gone.\nBudd Bugatch: Thank you. Well, congratulations, good luck on the next part of the year.\nJeremy Hoff: Thank you, Budd. We appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Barry Haimes with Sage Asset Management. Your line is open.\nBarry Haimes: Thanks very much. I had a couple of questions. First is -- could you give the backlog number at the end of the quarter and then what the comparison was both a quarter ago and a year ago?\nPaul Huckfeldt: End of July, the backlog was $88 million versus $201 million a year ago.\nBarry Haimes: And what was it at the end of the first quarter?\nPaul Huckfeldt: End of the first quarter, it was $87 million versus $282 million in the prior year.\nBarry Haimes: Got it. Thank you so much. That's very helpful. And then just on BOBO, it seems like the acquisition certainly makes sense. But could you give us -- is it already closed? And if so, what was the closing date? And could you give us the price that you paid for it? Thanks.\nPaul Huckfeldt: It was mid-June, June 12, and we paid $2.4 million. It was a small acquisition.\nBarry Haimes: Got it. Thanks so much, appreciate it.\nJeremy Hoff: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question comes from John Deysher with Pinnacle Value Fund. Your line is open.\nJohn Deysher: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just back to BOBO for a second. Can you share with us what the revenue run rate was when you bought it?\nPaul Huckfeldt: When we bought it, the revenue run rate was around $5 million. It's been inâ€¦\nJeremy Hoff: Yes.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. And obviously, you have growth expectations for it. How soon before that product line is integrated in terms of your sales force and distribution capabilities. When will that be accomplished?\nJeremy Hoff: So it will be fully integrated with our sales force and distribution as of the October market coming up.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. What is that -- at the end of October?\nJeremy Hoff: I believe...\nPaul Huckfeldt: Mid-October.\nJeremy Hoff: It's second or third week of October.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. All right. Good. And what do you think that business is capable of? I mean what is fully integrated -- what would the dream be in terms of revenue for that business?\nJeremy Hoff: We believe it will be a smaller brand for us on the top line. So $15-ish million is what we believe it can do fairly in a couple of years, 2 to 3 years. But the bottom line, the margins and whatnot in those categories are different from kind of anything we do now. So it is it's somewhat impactful for us even at that volume level.\nPaul Huckfeldt: And it's supporting our sales, our brand.\nJeremy Hoff: Right. It helps us complete a more whole home picture, and we can sell really the entire room in many ways.\nJohn Deysher: Yes. No, I mean, it makes total sense. So you would say the margin profile is better than the core business?\nJeremy Hoff: Correct.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. Fair enough. Good, then one final minor question. What were the orders for the quarter?\nPaul Huckfeldt: $96 million.\nJohn Deysher: Okay, great. Thanks very much and good luck.\nJeremy Hoff: Okay, thank you.\nPaul Huckfeldt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeremy Hoff for closing remarks.\nJeremy Hoff: I would like to thank everyone on the call for their interest in Hooker Furnishings. We look forward to sharing our fiscal '24 third quarter results in December. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

This morning we reported consolidated net sales for the fiscal 2024 first quarter of $121.8 million, a decrease of $25.5 million or 17% compared to last year's first quarter. The revenue decline was driven by $20 million sales decrease in the Home Meridian segment due to lower sales of major furniture chains and mass merchants and to a lesser extent, a 15% decrease in domestic upholstery after two years of sales growth in this segment. Net sales in the Hooker branded segment remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. Consolidated net income was $1.5 million or $0.13 per diluted share this quarter compared to $3.2 million or $0.26 per diluted share in the prior year period. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeremy to comment on our fiscal 2024 first quarter results.\nJeremy Hoff: Thank you, Paul and good morning everyone. On our call today, we'll discuss our quarterly results and several of our long-term strategic initiatives which are positioned to begin delivering organic growth considering the softer retail environment, economic uncertainties, and our recent exit from the Accentrics Home line, we're pleased to have exceeded external expectations for sales and earnings during the quarter. Our liquidation of ACH inventories and other obsolete inventories at HMI is about 80% complete, which is helping us reduce our domestic warehousing footprint and make progress towards getting profitability back on track at HMI. This quarter, we were able to strengthen our balance sheet. We generated about $22 million in cash from operating activities, which contributed to a $12 million increase in our cash position for the quarter and funded $4.3 million share repurchases along with our typical cash requirements. As we moved into May and now June, we are continuing to build cash and further reduce inventories. As of yesterday, we have generated almost $16 million more in cash since the end of our first quarter, bringing our cash balance to $46 million. Inventory levels decreased by $23 million during the quarter, well on our way towards our goal of reducing inventories by $30 million before fiscal year end. Our new Hooker Legacy Showroom grand opening in its April High Point Market met our expectations as we nearly doubled our attendance from a year ago, attracting new customers and providing a much more meaningful presentation of our legacy brands and the launch of our new brand M. Many of our strategic organic growth initiatives that will enable us to increase our share of total addressable market and visibility are tied to the new showroom and Hooker Legacy brands. One of those strategic growth initiatives, the High Point Market launch of M domestically produced upholstery and imported occasional furniture brand surpassed our expectations. This new brand combining the unique capabilities of HF Custom Shenandoah, Bradington-Young, and Hooker Casegoods will enable us to compete in a modern lifestyle aesthetic without disrupting any of those core businesses. Retailers affirm to us that the new M brand is very much on point with the up and coming casual modern lifestyle that today's younger consumer is gravitating towards. The rebranding of Sam Moore to HF Custom at the Spring High Point Market came at an ideal time as the timing allowed us elevate the look of the product with new covered treatments in silhouettes and unveil the brand within a highly updated presentation in Showplace. Just prior to the April High Point Market, we completed the transition to a new ERP system for our outdoor furnishings line Sunset West. In addition, we completed our positioning of the brand for East Coast distribution by stocking the line both in its current West Coast warehouse and now adding Sunset West inventory to our East Coast Savannah warehouse. At the Spring High Point Market, Sunset West debuted its first comprehensive display in our industry's major East Coast market. We believe that Sunset West's expansion to a national distribution offers a double-digit organic growth opportunity over multiple years. Also in April, we announced Hooker Furnishing and leading lifestyle and entertainment company, Scott Brothers Global have renewed the multiyear licensing agreement, which HMI's Pulaski and Samuel Lawrence Furniture divisions serve as the exclusive bedroom, dining, and occasional furniture suppliers for the Drew and Jonathan Home brand. At the High Point Market, HMI introduced a 26-piece Drew and Jonathan collection in a California Casual to further expand the product line. After initial delay due to the pandemic, the Drew and Jonathan Home line now has the retail placements and demand momentum benefiting shipments in the short and long-term. Our transition to a new leaner business model of HMI will continue into this year as we move away from higher risk businesses that focus on our core strength and businesses; Pulaski Furniture, Samuel Lawrence Furniture, Samuel Lawrence Hospitality, and Primary Resources International, we believe are still on track to achieve profitability in segment by the end of the fiscal year. Importantly, the HMI team is focused on our core competencies as we direct our support and resources behind our key businesses, while reducing cost. Now, I want to turn the discussion over to Paul, who will discuss highlights in each of our segments.\nPaul Huckfeldt: Thanks Jeremy. Beginning with our Hooker Branded segment, net sales remained relatively unchanged, decreasing by -- slightly by 0.8% or $339,000 compared to the prior year first quarter. Gross profit and gross margin remained relatively flat as well. Net sales were negatively impacted by higher discounting compared to abnormally low levels of discounting in prior year period. While we benefited from price increases implemented in the prior year to mitigate product cost inflation, discounting increased by 230 basis points from the prior year due to somewhat softer demand in the current quarter. Higher demurrage and drayage expenses, which heavily impacted the gross margin in previous quarters, were still higher than prior year first quarter, but are trending down. At the end of the first quarter, Hooker Branded inventory levels decreased by $14 million compared to the fiscal 2023 year end. Inventories are still elevated at quarter end and are higher than pre-pandemic levels in calendar 2019. So, we continue to work to align our inventory levels with current demand. We're pleased that our inventory management process is working well, so we're in stock on most best-selling items and inventory obsolescence has not been an issue. Quarter end backlog for Hooker Branded was lower than the prior year first quarter end, but remained 50% higher than pre-pandemic lows. Incoming orders decreased by about 16% compared to the prior year quarter and approach levels similar to fiscal 2020 first quarter, reflecting more normalized post-pandemic demand. Turning to the Home Meridian segment, as Jeremy noted, the sales decrease was better than our expectations and the operating loss of $2.1 million was a $1 million improvement compared to the prior year first quarter. Net sales at HMI decreased by $20 million or 32% compared to the prior year first quarter, driven by sales decreases with some major furniture change in mass merchants in a slower retail environment for home furnishing. Other factors contributing to the lower sale include delayed orders from retail customers as they continue to reduce their inventory and the absence of the clause at ACH sales businesses since we've exited those divisions. Inventories decreased $9 million from the end of fiscal 2023 due to the liquidation of obsolete inventories and our efforts to align inventory levels with current demand. On an encouraging note SLH, our hospitality division's net sales more than doubled compared to the prior year first quarter, indicating a strong recovery in the hospitality industry after the COVID pandemic. Additionally, freight costs have improved due to stabilization of ocean freight rates. Incoming orders and quarter end backlog at HMI were lower than the prior year quarter and fiscal 2020 first quarter due to the absence of orders from the Clubs channel, which HMI exited during fiscal 2022 and the ACH business as well as decreased incoming orders from retail customers. In the domestic upholstery segment, we experienced the first quarterly sales decline in over two years after 10 consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales increases. Sales decreased by $6 million or about 15% compared to prior -- to last year's first quarter. Sales reductions at HF Custom, Sunset West, and Shenandoah were partially offset by increased net sales at Bradington-Young. Sales decreases at Sunset West are attributed to non-recurring factors, including slowed shipments in February and March caused by the December conversion to our new ERP system and as well as the expansion of the outdoor brands to our East Coast warehouse, which involved transition costs and start-up delays at the Georgia distribution center. These issues were largely resolved by the end of the quarter. We believe that much of the domestic inventory sales dip was driven by the fact that we worked through our large backlogs in these divisions and then experienced somewhat softer demand, which we don't think is a long-term situation. Despite the sales decline and disruption, Domestic Upholstery segment reported operating income of $1.3 million and an operating margin of 3.8%. Quarter end backlog for Bradington-Young remained three times higher than pre-pandemic levels at the fiscal 2020 first quarter year end. While backlogs at HF Customs in Shenandoah decreased to levels similar to fiscal 2020. Incoming orders at Bradington-Young and Shenandoah were at similar levels to fiscal 2020, while HF Custom experienced lower orders compared to that period. And while it represents a smaller part of our overall business, all other, which includes our H Contract Senior Living Furniture division, contributed $1.1 million sales increase. Turning now to cash, debt, inventory, and capital allocation. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $31 million at the end of the fiscal 2024 first quarter, an increase of $12 million from the prior year end. As Jeremy reported earlier, we generated $22 million of cash from operations in the quarter, which we used to fund $4.3 million of share repurchases, $4.5 million of capital expenditures including investments in our new showroom and our new ERP system, and $2.4 million in cash dividend to our shareholders, which helped -- and also helped bolster our cash position. We're pleased with the progress we've made reducing inventories, which was a large part of the cash we generated during the quarter. Since the repurchase programs announcement around this time last year, we've generated approximately -- we returned approximately $20 million to our shareholders and retired just under 1.2 million shares. And earlier this week, our Board approved an additional $5 million authorization as part of our capital allocation plan for the year. In addition to continuing to execute with the share repurchase plan, our capital allocation priorities for the year included building cash reserves, funding the organic growth initiatives as Jeremy noted earlier, continuing our streak of -- 54-year streak of paying of dividends and funding our typical capital expenditure requirements. In addition to our cash balance, we have an aggregate $27.2 million available under our existing revolver at year end to fund other working capital needs should that become necessary. We believe that our liquidity and capital requirements will be further improved through the liquidation sales of the remaining excess HMI inventory. Now, I'll turn the discussion back to Jeremy for his outlook.\nJeremy Hoff: Thank you, Paul. While retail conditions remain mixed along with some economic uncertainties, we have begun to see more positive trends for consolidated incoming orders in May and that is holding up so far in June. We believe the industry is getting through some of the elevated inventory challenges and we may be seeing some breakthrough in that area. Following our successful new showroom grand opening at spring High Point Market, Hooker Furnishings will continue initiatives to enhance visibility and addressable market reach this summer, debuting a new showroom at Atlanta market for Hooker Legacy brands. In addition to opening the new showroom for Legacy brands, Sunset West also will debut a new showroom at the Atlanta market, which the new sponsor of the casual market for outdoor furniture relocating from Chicago. Hooker Legacy brands will show at its fourth Las Vegas market this summer as well. At HMI, we expect the previously announced inventory liquidations to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2024 second quarter. While we expect some short-term volatility in sales and earnings at HMI, we continue to expect the segment to achieve quarterly profitability by the end of the 2024 fiscal year. The Hooker Furnishings team continues to focus on organic growth opportunities through expanded visibility, strategic product development, operational improvements, and cost reductions. By focusing on these controllables, we will be in the strongest position possible as the demand environment continues to improve. This ends the formal part of our discussion and at this time, I will turn the call back over to our operator, Lydia for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski with Sidoti. Your line is open.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the questions. So, first, just a couple of questions on the quarter then on your outlook. So, as far as for the quarter, I know you'll have some of this information in your 10-Q, but can you just first comment on unit volumes versus pricing? I know you guys talked about discounting, so just wondering about just volumes in general versus pricing.\nPaul Huckfeldt: I'm going to pull up the -- I'm going to pull up our draft of the Q if you if you want to continue another question. Let's go back to that instead of-- here we are.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Sure. Yes. No problem. Okay. And then, -- you got it? Okay.\nPaul Huckfeldt: Okay. So, for Hooker, unit volume is down about 6%, but ASP is up about 8%. For HMI, unit volume is down 10% -- unit volume is down about 25% ASP is up 13%.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got you. Okay.\nPaul Huckfeldt: So, we are -- increase overall, but, I donâ€™t have a lot..\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got it. Okay. And then just it was nice to see overall gross margin increase of nearly three percentage points on a consolidated basis. I know you guys talked about the discounting as well as higher demurrage costs, but obviously, we have lower ocean freight costs as well. So, kind of, -- can you just talk about the various puts and takes as to what drove the gross margin increase?\nJeremy Hoff: Good morning, Anthony. Really we're starting to experience cost just continually starting to come down versus what we were experiencing during the pandemic. As far as the discounting line, we're really getting back to a little more normalized discount line. We went to an unusual very low or almost zero discount line during the pandemic for obvious reasons with all the supply chain challenges and everything thatâ€™s going on. And the demand at the level that we saw, there wasn't -- it changed our entire approach and I think the industry's approach from a discount standpoint. Paul, do you want to add to some of the other?\nPaul Huckfeldt: So, Domestic Upholstery, despite the sales decline, Domestic Upholstery was more efficient. We've seen price increases have taken effect, for -- during the pandemic, we didn't -- even as prices were going, we're increasing pretty dramatically. We didn't raise prices on backlog. So, our new price list have come into effect, and that's all helped. I think the strategic decision was made not to raise prices on existing backlog and so it took a long time to cycle through because the backlog was so big.\nJeremy Hoff: And lastly, we've eliminated a lot of surprises we were experiencing on HMI side of our businesses, which obviously affected our overall gross margin negatively when we were going through that.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got you. Okay, all right. So, it's good to see some better predictability with HMI. So, as far as HMI, so I know you guys talked about reducing the warehousing footprint. Where are you guys with that as of today and kind of where do you think that you'll be by the end of the fiscal year with that initiative?\nJeremy Hoff: So, on Savannah, as we continue to -- like we said, we're 80% of the way through getting out of the products we're trying to get out of. As we do that, the requirement for the footprint in Savannah goes to much less than we needed before. So, we've already made arrangements to hand over 200,000 of the 1 million square feet that will happen July 1st this year -- this fiscal year. We're working on some other plans that our goal would be to get that down to 500,000. We're hoping by fiscal year end, if it's not, then it would be shortly after. But that's our focus and all the other cost reduction activities that we talked about are on track for this fiscal year to again return HMI to profitable -- quarterly profitability by the end of fiscal year.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got it. Yes. Thanks Jeremy. And then do you guys have the consolidated backlog number by any chance handy?\nPaul Huckfeldt: Yes. Consolidated backlog right now was -- at the end of the quarter was at $87 million.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got it. Okay. And then I know you touched on this a little bit on your last call in April, but as far as Sunset West, that was impacted by the ERP system rollout. I believe you had said it was a couple of million dollars, but just correct me if I'm wrong? And then, overall, where do you stand with the ERP rollout? And if it's -- I know it's work in progress, but could there be potential other issues with other brands as you go through this process?\nJeremy Hoff: So first, your number was close on the Sunset West, what we referred to as far as the disruption. They are pretty much through that at this point and they're through a lot of the transition of creating the East Coast distribution for them as well. So, there -- it's going really well. We're optimistic about Sunset West for the rest of the year. Regarding the ERP for the rest of the company, we will have -- we have a go-live date in early July for our Hooker Legacy portion of our business. We feel very good about it. One reason we candidly did Sunset West first is we wanted to make sure a lot of those systems that we were needing to work for the rest of the company would work the way we thought they would work. So, we did a test on one of our smaller parts of our company, which we saw the issues and we're able to fix them, but we're aware of those going in the larger go-lives. So, we feel confident and feel good about where we're headed with our ERP system.\nPaul Huckfeldt: And if we don't--\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got it. Okay.\nJeremy Hoff: Yes, that's another good point. We track it weekly where we are with any issues and there's a lot of visibility and we will not go live if we see a disruption that's going to be negative for our company.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: That's great to hear. And then can you also share some more details about the higher incoming orders that you saw in the month of May? And just curious as to what you the see -- heard from retailers about the important Memorial Day weekend?\nJeremy Hoff: Yes. So, it's actually really encouraging I think really for our industry, the order rates have consistently been better and -- as the second quarter has for us -- excuse me, as the second quarter has started, we've seen really good order trends. And really, if you look at throughout our brands, it's somewhat across the Board. If you look at HMI, their order rate has been up. If you look at the Hooker Legacy brands, their order rate has been up and then Sunset has seen the same thing. So, Memorial Day, feedback from a lot of our partners was positive. So, if you think back to pre-pandemic, many times, our industry was not that happy before Memorial Day from an order rate standpoint. And I think all of us kind of saw a similar trend recently and then Memorial Day hits. And so we seem to be in a more normalized cycle from what we used to be in.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got it. That's great to hear. Well, thank you very much and best of luck.\nJeremy Hoff: Thank you, Anthony.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question coming from the line of Barry Haimes with Sage Asset Management. Your line is open.\nBarry Haimes: Thanks so much and good quarter. I had a question, one on Sunset West, as you go to the national distribution, did they have an inventory build that would either help your overhead absorption or your revenue either this quarter or next quarter? So, just a little help on how that works? And how seasonal are their orders? Are we kind of past the season there for them and the bigger benefit would be next year? Or maybe just a little feel for the seasonality on their business? And then last question, you just mentioned orders being better. I presume that's sequentially and is it still down year-over-year or are we talking better year-over-year as well? Thanks.\nJeremy Hoff: Good morning. I'll start with -- I'm going to start with the cyclical nature of outdoor that's become less and less the case in that category. It's more of a year round than it's ever been before. But really, you asked about the inventory build, I mean, we obviously had a little -- some build on the East Coast to be able to supply those customers. And our -- we do see a big opportunity for growth at Sunset because all of a sudden the distribution that we're gaining East versus just being more of a West Coast-centric company, gives us a lot of opportunity really in pretty major, major revenue portions of our -- of the country that we can take advantage of. So, -- and then the other part of your question, Paul, do you want to answer that on the orders?\nPaul Huckfeldt: Orders that's a year -- the improvement is year-over-year.\nBarry Haimes: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nJeremy Hoff: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of John Deysher with Pinnacle Value. Your line is open.\nJohn Deysher: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On the inventory reduction, I would guess that was sold at a loss, I think. Could you put a number on that? In other words, without the inventory reduction, how much higher would the gross profit have been for the quarter?\nPaul Huckfeldt: We took that big charge at the end of Q4 last -- at the end of last fiscal year, that 24 [Indiscernible] charge. So, the impact of actually selling that stuff off is nominal. We reserved against it and then we took the reserves back. So, there was not much impact to that.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. So, no impact. What were the orders for the first quarter?\nPaul Huckfeldt: Orders were $111 million.\nJohn Deysher: Sorry. $111 million?\nPaul Huckfeldt: $111 million compared to $81 million last year.\nJohn Deysher: Okay. Good, that's going the right direction. And finally, what would be the CapEx budget for this fiscal year?\nPaul Huckfeldt: About $6 million.\nJohn Deysher: $6 million for the year. Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nJeremy Hoff: Thank you.\nPaul Huckfeldt: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm not showing any further questions in the queue. At this time, I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jeremy Hoff.\nJeremy Hoff: I would like to thank everyone on the call for their interest in Hooker Furnishings. We look forward to sharing our fiscal 2024 second quarter results in September. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that doesn't conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
