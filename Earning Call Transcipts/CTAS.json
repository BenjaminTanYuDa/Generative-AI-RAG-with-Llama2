        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Cintas Corporation Announces Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President and Treasurer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will discuss our fiscal 2024 third quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. Due to the outstanding dedication and execution of our employees, whom we call partners, we delivered very strong results for our third quarter. Total revenue for the third quarter grew 9.9% to $2.41 billion. The revenue dollars represent record quarterly revenue. We are pleased with the performance of each of our businesses. Our revenue growth remains robust and we have good momentum in the business. New business remains strong. Our sales team continues to operate at a high level. We are seeing broad success across the many verticals, particularly within our focus verticals, as well as our cross-selling efforts and penetration of new products and services within our existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels. Our strong revenue growth flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the third quarter increased 220 basis points to a record 49.4%, an increase of 14.9%. Operating income was a record 21.6%, an increase of 16.6%. Diluted EPS grew a robust 22.3% to $3.84. Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the third quarter grew 32.8% over the prior year. In the third quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses through capital expenditures of $107 million. During the third quarter, we made acquisition purchases of $111 million. On March 15th, we paid shareholders $137.6 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous March. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital and through three quarters, we have deployed over $1.4 billion of capital across our priorities of capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and buybacks. I would like to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our third-quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion to a range of $9.57 billion to $9.6 billion, a total growth rate of 8.6% to 8.9%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.35 to $14.65, to a range of $14.80 to $15, a growth rate of 13.9% to 15.5%. Mike?\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue was $2.41 billion, compared to $2.19 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and a difference in the number of workdays was 7.7%. Total growth was positively impacted by 170 basis points due to the extra workday. We remind you, as you update your models for next fiscal year that there will be two less workdays compared to this current fiscal year. Each quarter next year will have 65 workdays, which means, the first and the fourth quarters will each have one less workday than this fiscal year. Organic growth by business was 7.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 11.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 13.9% for Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale was down 3.9%. Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.19 billion, compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 14.9%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 49.4% for the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47.2% last year, an increase of 220 basis points. Strong volume growth, technology improvements, and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.8% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 56.3% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 41.1% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 170 basis points from last year. Energy was a tailwind of 40 basis points. In addition, we continue to leverage our strong revenue growth, our technology investments and extract inefficiencies out of the business through our Six Sigma and engineering teams. Our technology investments have allowed us to improve garment sharing among our plants, which improves material cost. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide route densities to our existing routes, which positively impacts truck purchasing, labor, and energy. Our Six Sigma and engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our plant equipment, labor, and energy. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 470 basis points from last year. Strong revenue growth continues to help expand our margins in this segment. Strong revenue performance in some of our high-margin recurring revenue products like AED Rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak continues to provide a healthy revenue mix. Our technology investment in SmartTruck continues to provide route optimization and improved efficiencies. And our First Aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributed to improved gross margins. Selling and administrative expenses increased 90 basis points from last year. The increase was driven by investments in selling resources, technology and our management trainee program, as well as costs associated with an agreement in principle to settle the purported class action contract dispute brought by plaintiffs City of Laurel. We determined that settling the claim is in the best interest of Cintas. The total monetary payment agreed to in the proposed settlement, including the 60 basis points recognized in this quarter is $45 million. We expect that the settlement costs will not impact our financials in future periods. As Todd mentioned earlier, we generated strong cash flow. For the year, our free cash flow increased 31.6%. This has allowed us to invest back into the business, which has resulted in capital expenditures of 4.3% for the year. Our investments include technology to grow the top line and expand margins, automation to improve efficiencies in our plants and additional processing capacity where needed. We expect capital expenditures to finish around 4.25% of revenue for the year. Operating income of $520.8 million compared to $446.8 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.6% in the third quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.4% in last year's third quarter, an increase of 120 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 19.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the third quarter was $397.6 million compared to $325.8 million last year. This year's third-quarter diluted EPS of $3.84 compared to $3.14 last year, an increase of 22.3%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $99 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 20.6%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23. Our guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. As I mentioned earlier, we expect that the proposed settlement will not impact our financials in future periods and accordingly, there is no impact on our guidance. Guidance includes $17.4 million of acquired revenue for the fourth quarter. This revenue includes the impact of the recently announced acquisitions during the third quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, Manav.\nRonan Kennedy: Hi, good morning. This is Ronan Kennedy on for Manav. Thank you for taking my questions. Can I just ask, with regards to the strong margin performance, can you kind of assess or characterize the contributions from, whether it's the SmartTruck, the Six Sigma, the engineering extracting of inefficiencies? But also how we should think about those as drivers in the context of the sustainability of the margins, if you could elaborate on that, please?\nTodd Schneider: Thank you for your question, Ronan. It's -- when you think about the gross margin, it really starts with our culture, how we run our business, the expectations we have, the intensity of which we run it, and the focus. That being said, there's many, many inputs to those numbers. Certainly, our investments that we are making are paying off. The investments in SmartTruck, the investments in our Six Sigma team, the investment in our engineering team, the investment in our supply chain organization are all helping us to improve those results. So I can't give you an exact number with, hey, SmartTruck gave us X basis points, what have you. It's -- there's many inputs, and we're pleased with the investments that we've made, and we're pleased with the leadership and the culture of the organization, where they're focused on driving those results, providing a better experience for our customers and providing a better experience for our employee-partners.\nRonan Kennedy: That's helpful. Thank you. And then with regards to obviously, strong performance on the top line as well, can you just talk about the contributions from new business and penetration versus expectations, how pricing is trending, and also retention, please?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, good question. So when we think about our growth, again, there's many contributing factors. We really like where we are from a growth standpoint, the internal growth, certainly we like the acquisitions that we've made. They're really good businesses. But when we think about the components of it, certainly pricing is a component, but it is not the majority. The majority of our growth is from volume growth. And that's really pleasing to us because we want to be able to grow our business in that manner. Pricing is -- has moderated and it's much closer to historical, and that's exactly what we had planned throughout the year. Where we're really benefiting is from our new business. Our team is performing at a high level. Our service organization is -- the retention levels are very attractive. And then we are cross-selling appropriately. We have a great breadth of products and services that we want to make sure that our customers and our prospects are aware of. And so we're benefiting kind of across all, not kind of, we are benefiting across all of those areas, and they're all big contributing factors, but we like where we are and we like how we're growing the business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua.\nJoshua Chan: Hi. Good morning, Todd and Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. Could you talk about the -- I guess, piggybacking on the prior question, could you talk about the sustainability of growth that you're seeing now that the pricing has moderated to a historical level? Do you see the current run rate staining based on what you're seeing out there, talking to customers and retention rate dynamics, and all that?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Josh, good morning. Again, we like where we are from a growth standpoint. The exciting thing is there's -- we service a little over a million customers. There's 16 million businesses in North America, so we're -- we think there's an incredible runway for us. So we're selling to -- about 60% of our new accounts come from no programmers, and that is continuing. So we're seeing great results from talking to prospects and showing them a better way to do it than they are today. Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that, that is new spend. They might be spending that money somehow. It's just we're redirecting it to do it better, smarter, faster, in some cases, even less expensive than the way they're doing it. So we think the runway is very attractive because of the number of prospects that are out there and our business -- or, excuse me, our buying proposition resonating with prospects and customers. So, we expect that we like where we are from a growth standpoint. As I mentioned, we like how we're growing and we want to continue in that manner.\nJoshua Chan: That's great color. Thank you. And for my follow-up, you talked about incremental margins being in the 20% to 30% range historically, and now you're sort of at the higher end of that in recent years. Is this the right level of incremental margins going forward on revenue growth that comes ahead?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. So we're -- we recognize the math of 20% to 30% incremental margins. We need to be the higher end of that in order to continue to improve our margins and we're focused on doing that. We're doing so by extracting out those inefficiencies, getting really good leverage on our revenue growth, so many ways. But running a business is not linear. And so, we know there's going to be some puts and takes and some quarters will be higher and some won't be as high. But generally speaking, we like that range. And I prefer the higher end than the lower end, that's for sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could just talk about the M&A you did this quarter and what attracted you to the assets. And then an update on how to think about M&A going forward.\nTodd Schneider: I'm certainly happy to start, Mike. Regarding -- Heather, good morning. And regarding M&A, so it's an important component for us. You certainly cannot pace M&A. So they kind of come as they do, and it takes two to dance. And -- but I can tell you the two that we announced this past quarter are great businesses first off, really good operators, really attractive businesses. In the case of the one in Kentucky, it provided us with some needed capacity in that region of the country. In addition to the added capacity, we were able to absorb that volume into seven of our facilities. So some really nice synergies allows us to, as we're closer to the customers, to spend more time with the customer and less time driving. So that's important to us. In the case of the acquisition in the M&A in Pennsylvania, we did not acquire any additional capacity. But in that case, we were able to absorb it into 16 of our facilities. So again, attractive synergies, more time with the customer, less time driving. And in those cases, we also then get to talk to our new customers about the broader breadth of products and services that we have. So we think it's -- overall it's very attractive. As I mentioned, it takes two to dance. You can't pace it. But in this case, these were two really attractive businesses, great operators that really made sense for us.\nMike Hansen: Maybe a couple added points. As Todd said, these are great acquisitions, and we've had a handful of them this fiscal year. Each of the two that Todd talked about is less than $20 million in annual revenue. The $17.4 million that we gave you in our prepared remarks includes the impact of those. But keeping in mind, we've made acquisitions all year long, and so that fourth quarter impact would include all of the acquisitions we've made throughout the last 12 months. Just something to keep in mind as you're thinking about our fourth quarter.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann from RW Baird. Please go ahead, Andy. Hello, Andy. Is your line muted?\nAndy Wittmann: I'm sorry about that. Mike, I just want to build on that last question where you were commenting on the M&A contribution. Is there any -- in your fourth quarter guidance, is there a change in your fundamental outlook for the company, recognizing that it is up now somewhat on these two -- somewhat larger acquisitions that you did? And then as an addendum to that, was this 60 basis points or $45 million legal settlement that you just talked about, was that included and considered in your initial guidance? Or are you absorbing that and still able to raise your guidance here?\nMike Hansen: Yeah. So, Andy, I already forgot your first part of the question. What was your first part?\nAndy Wittmann: First question is, does your fundamental outlook for the business unchanged?\nMike Hansen: Yeah, yeah.\nAndy Wittmann: Is your fundamental outlook unchanged for 4Q or is there a change…\nMike Hansen: Yeah. I apologize. No, as Todd talked about, our market remains very large, the momentum in the business remains good, the adoption remains good, and the guide for the fourth quarter is right where we want to be in terms of sort of the stated profile of growth that we want to have. And so, all of that put together with not really any change in customer behavior would mean, no, continued performance like we've seen, and we continue to like the momentum of the business. As it relates to your second question, the 60 basis points, that was not contemplated in the initial guide from the beginning of the year and that was simply absorbed through -- well, in this third quarter, the 60 basis points simply absorbed.\nAndy Wittmann: Okay, thank you. That's all my questions for today.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.\nGeorge Tong: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Can you provide an update on the external selling environment, including how client budgets and sales cycles are performing?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, I'm certainly happy to start. George, good morning. We haven't really seen much of a change in sales cycle as far as our -- the interest in our products and services remains good. We're always continuing -- we're continuing to invest in new products and services. Tweaks, I guess, certainly to them to make it as attractive to the prospects and the customers as possible. But we're not seeing a change. Momentum continues to be good. Outsourcing still resonates and we're seeing, as I mentioned earlier, the no program market is still really, really large. And we've become pretty darn proficient at presenting to those prospects to help them run a better business. And we help them with all the products and services we provide. And as I mentioned, it's not always new money. Usually they're spending something. It's just redirecting it to us to do it better, faster, smarter, cheaper type thing.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And then separately, can you talk a little bit about your focus verticals, including healthcare, how much additional runway is there for these focus verticals to serve as a tailwind to organic revenue growth?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. So, George, so it's in our internal growth. So it is helping us -- that focus is helping us to organize around the customer and provide the products and services that they want. And that has been a good strategy for us over the past number of years. So we like all the verticals we're in. We find them very attractive. Whether it's healthcare, hospitality, education, state, local government, business, it's all attractive and we're organized around it and our value proposition is resonating with them.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.\nLuke McFadden: Hi, good morning. This is Luke McFadden on for Tim Mulrooney. Thanks for taking our questions today. So I wanted to ask, too, just on first date, I'll start with the first one and then move on to the second one after. But First Aid and Safety has been growing at a double digit rate for quite a few quarters in a row now. I know there's a penetration story here with your established base of uniform customers, but I'm also curious if new product introductions are an important driver of this growth. How much of your growth in that segment is from new product introductions?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Luke. We really like the First Aid business. Part of our culture is continued innovation. So we're always looking at improving our -- improving our processes, improving our products, improving our services, so it's always a component. I cannot give you a number of, hey, it was X basis points of growth due to a product rollout or what have you, but I can tell you this. The value proposition in the First Aid business and all of our businesses, but in First Aid, as you asked about, it's really resonating. And the mix of business that we have there is really good. And we're able to be better sourcers, better providers of products with our investment and our distribution center. So when you have a robust supply chain that allows us to get products to the customers in a really timely fashion, it puts us in a great spot to be successful. And so yeah, cross-sell, we're absolutely, we want all of our customers, whether they're uniform or fire or direct sale customer, we want them all to know about our First Aid business. And we try to make sure that that occurs in many different conduits, but it's, yeah, we're benefiting from that cross-sell.\nLuke McFadden: Understood, really helpful, and maybe just sticking on first aid and safety here. As you think about that segment of your business, does it feel like you've essentially built out the full suite of products and services there, or at some point should we expect that potentially you're more about other product introductions as you continue to build out the portfolio? Because the room here for more is essentially what I'm curious to know.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Luke, yeah, again, I'll go back to our culture. Our culture is such that we are constantly innovating and pushing ourselves to be the -- to provide the best products and services. And so you'll see more of that to come. We're constantly innovating to put our partners in the best position, our employee partners in the best position to provide the most value for our customers.\nMike Hansen: And maybe one added comment Luke, when we think about this business, you may have heard us speak to umbrellas of image, safety, cleanliness and compliance and when we think about this business, safety is a fairly large umbrella and when our first aid and safety people are speaking with customers and thinking about that innovation that Todd talked about, we're thinking quite broadly about how do we keep our customers, how do we help our customers keep their employees safe. And that can mean opportunities into the future. And that's the way we look at it from a broad perspective.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JP Morgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. In the quarter, when you look at your rentals and facility services segment, how much of the growth is actually coming from uniforms versus ancillary services directionally? Like, is there good growth in both? And also if you can make a comment about ad stops within uniforms.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Andrew. As you know, we don't give out those specific numbers, but directionally to your question, yeah, we're seeing growth across them at all. It's -- there's good demand for our uniform business and our facility services business, frankly for all of our business products and services. So, nothing to point out to one particular area there. As far as ad stops, we haven't really seen a change to our customer behavior there. So, it’s -- I'll call it kind of business as usual. There's many inputs to that number, but nevertheless, I'd say it's kind of business as usual.\nAndrew Steinerman: Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Yes, sir.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper.\nJasper Bibb: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to follow up on the earlier discussion on first aid. The gross margin there was really impressive at 56% this quarter, but you also had SG&A at 25% from the prior year. So, could you provide just maybe a bit of color on the investments you're making in that business? And when do you think the first aid segment should start to deliver a bit more margin leverage over that G&A base?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Jasper, good morning. As I mentioned, we really like the business and it's performing really well and we're investing appropriately. The amount of prospects out there are massive. And to Mike's point earlier, the value proposition is resonating. We talk about the mantra in that business is what's more important to a business than the health and safety of their employees and their customers. So that is resonating. We're in a great position to invest to provide those products and services. So we're doing just that. And so we're investing in selling resources, we're investing in marketing resources, because we really like where we are and it makes sense to invest. And I think you're seeing it show up in the operating margin and the gross margin.\nMike Hansen: Yeah, we've -- each quarter this year has been 22% or higher, which is quite a big improvement from a year ago. And so, as Todd said, these -- and we want to continue to invest in the long-term growth of all of our businesses. And you can really see those investments playing out, particularly in the gross margin line of first aid and safety. But we love the margins. They're up quite a bit over the last few years. And we'll continue to invest as we see appropriate.\nJasper Bibb: Thanks, that makes sense. And then just was hoping to get an update on what you're seeing for expense growth on labor and fleet related costs in the quarter?\nTodd Schneider: Jasper, good question. Certainly, labor is an important component. We want to make sure that we're providing attractive wages, competitive wages. And we've spoken on previous calls that we were not flat-footed when it came to the wage inflation that I'd say North America has seen over the past few years. So we've been in a good position and we like where we are from that perspective. And here's what's really exciting, is we have, I mentioned earlier, our Six Sigma teams, our engineering teams, they're helping us to automate certain items to bring transformation technology to portions of our business, whether it's SmartTruck or plant efficiencies, that allows us to mitigate that subject as best as possible. And so we're investing and have invested for years in those organizations and it's paying off in -- and what we're seeing with our total labor costs as we manage through and make sure we're still in a really good spot to be a competitive and attract the very best people.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to focus on the Google partnership. I was wondering if you can provide an update on that front. I believe you've already migrated your SAP onto the GCP. And how should we think about those benefits that you may have seen in the quarter, but also benefits as we go forward? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Good question, Ashish. I would characterize -- well, first off, we have a great relationship with Google. You're correct, we did migrate to the Google Cloud platform and I would characterize it as we're in the early innings there. And so we certainly hope to maximize our relationship and put our employee partners in a position to provide more value and to be as successful as possible. Because we believe there's tools that will be available to us to provide more value to the customers and to put our people in a better position to provide that value which makes them more successful. So early innings, but we're optimistic about where that can go.\nAshish Sabadra: That's a very helpful color. And if I can ask a quick accounting clarifying question. So in the balance sheet, the uniform and other rental items and service that's moderated sequentially quarter to quarter, I was just wondering if you can provide any color on what's driving that, is that better efficiency or any color on that front? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Yes. Todd talked a little bit about how we are working on all pieces of the business, but certainly one of those is inventory, and he touched on a little bit of garment sharing. So you can think about when we improve garment sharing, for example, we don't need to inject as many new garments into that in-service inventory. So the more sharing means better utilization of our existing in-service inventory, and it means we don't have to add as much into the in-service inventory from new purchases. That's one of the areas. Certainly, though, there are others like improved sourcing as well. Volume growth, as Todd said, remains really strong, and so what we're seeing is some nice offsetting of the volume growth with some of these initiatives.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to continue the discussion on the pretty impressive margin front for the quarter. I appreciate the color in terms of kind of discussing the route optimization, the merchandise management, Six Sigma, the likes. But maybe if you could provide a little bit of color of your major initiatives, which ones you think are kind of still in the early innings, or we could kind of continue to see some more improvement or accelerated improvement? And then maybe taking it a step further, what is next for you guys, in terms of other areas of opportunity that haven't been as major focused yet? Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Stephanie. From our strategic initiatives that we're focused on how can we impact our business in total, certainly our material costs, our energy, our labor. And Mike referred to earlier, our energy spend is down 40 basis points. That's not all just price. That is, those initiatives that we referred to earlier, the material cost is -- our two largest costs are material costs and labor. So we're very focused on driving efficiencies in all those areas, because to Mike's earlier point, we love the volume growth, but we don't want to sacrifice margin because the volume growth is so robust that we've got these strategic initiatives to extract these inefficiencies out of our business. And I wouldn't speak to any one in particular that it's in the earlier innings or the others. We've got a nice runway forward for doing that. A little bit of that is our culture, is that we're constantly trying to innovate and push ourselves to be better. So I think you'll see that continued. As far as acceleration, it's built in. We're constantly doing it. So I think we're focused on those incremental margins and this is an important component of making sure that we can hit those numbers.\nMike Hansen: Yeah, the only thing I might add is we're certainly in the very early innings of technology and we believe there's a nice runway there. Todd talked about just the recent migration to the Google Cloud and that creates a foundation for us to do some interesting things moving forward.\nStephanie Moore: Great. Well, thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning, it's [Daniel] (ph) on for Scott. Thanks for taking our question. Could you please speak to the outlook for uniform direct sales and fire protection as well as some perspective on the margins for all others going forward please? Thank you.\nTodd Schneider: I'll start on the outlook and, Mike, if you want to speak to the margins. The uniform direct sale business is strategic business for us. We have some really large strategic accounts, whether it's national accounts or in the hospitality, gaming area of our business. And so strategic meaning that those customers spend a lot more money with us not just with garment direct sale but also outside of that. So that's important. That being said, that business certainly can be a little lumpy due to the nature of it with rollouts and purchases. But we like where we're positioned there. We like the value proposition that we're -- where we are there. So we think the outlook's very positive there. As far as the fire business, it's been a great business for us. The results over the last several years, we've seen great revenue growth, we've seen great margin improvement, and it's the only business we're in where you legally have to have those products and services. So we think it’s -- the outlook is really positive because of the prospects that are out there and the runway we see for opportunity. So, Mike, if you want to comment on margin.\nMike Hansen: Sure. So as Todd said, the fire business in particular, the margins have increased quite a bit in the last handful of years, and we've seen a lot of the same initiatives and other initiatives specific to that business really take off like we've seen in our other businesses. The one thing I might point out there, we did see some increase in SG&A and the fire business year-over-year, and we're starting to get into that SAP implementation for the fire business. So we might see a little bit of pressure as we move into fiscal ‘25 on the fire margins, the overall margins because of that investment and that move. But as you've seen with our rental and first aid and safety businesses, once we understand how to use that and get proficient at it, it can create some really nice opportunities. So maybe a little bit of -- we've seen some great improvement, maybe a little bit of next year and the following year pressure on SG&A because of that implementation, but we certainly expect those margins to continue to improve in the longer term. From a uniform direct sale margin perspective, as Todd said, that business is going to go up and down. It's going to be a little bit bumpy from quarter to quarter. And because of that, the margins will be as well. So I don't think there's anything specific to call out other than it isn't quite as consistent of a business as the other three that we have.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead Shlomo.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Hey, Todd, can you talk a little bit about the macro environment with regard to employment? And specifically if you could touch up on some of the areas where they're looking for more automation to reduce the employment due to raises in minimum wage in areas like California, are you -- how exposed are you to those kind of verticals? And then after that, I have a follow up.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Shlomo. Yeah, from a macro environment, as I mentioned, we haven't seen much change in our customer behavior. Certainly there is always some puts and takes. And as you mentioned, our employer is under pressure to figure out ways to automate things because wage inflation, that has occurred and will continue to occur, it's occurred for many, many years. Now there's also some -- the infrastructure bills that are out there, the on-shoring. I can't speak to specifics of, oh, boy, we're benefiting from this or this is a headwind here. But generally, we like the spot we're in. And we think it's, the macro environment where it's been reasonably stable and that's -- we find that attractive and we can be really successful in that environment.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay, thank you. Just for a follow-up, you have a competitor there that was spun out, say, six months ago. And I was just wondering, has there been any change in the environment with them competitively in terms, either positively or negatively? I mean, have you seen any changes in the way that they bid? Are you taking more business from them? Maybe you could just comment in general.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Shlomo, I would characterize it as, it's pretty well business as usual. They're a very good competitor, always have been, I'm sure they always will be, and we have a great deal of respect for them. And it's a very competitive environment, always has been as far as -- as long as I've been with the company, it has been, and I'm sure it will be in the future and -- but we're focused on putting our employee partners in the best position to be successful in providing our customers the best value proposition. So really none of that has changed.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead, Kartik.\nKartik Mehta: Yeah, thank you. Hey, good morning. Todd, you have been able to execute extremely well this year, beat guidance. And as you look at the business, is that the result of maybe metrics like non-programmers being a little bit better than you thought? Is it sales being better than you thought? Maybe you're just more cautious about the economy than actually happened. If you look at why you have been able to do better, what would you point to?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Kartik, it starts with our culture and our expectations of our employee partners and the pace and the intensity of which they run. But that being said, we’ve -- our value proposition is really resonating in each of the businesses we're in. The first aid business we spoke about, it's very good. Outsourcing is resonating nicely. Maybe it has to do with, it's not as easy to hire people as it has been in the past, so if you want someone to outsource it, it's that much more attractive. Yeah, we like the spot we're in, and it’s -- and we have exceeded our internal expectations, and we're pleased with that. But there's so many inputs to it, because we're trying to focus on providing better products, better services, better technologies to make our people more successful and to make our customers that much happier. So a lot of inputs but we like where we're positioned and we're continuing to invest for the future.\nKartik Mehta: And just one follow-up, you obviously discussed M&A a lot. I'm wondering, and I know some of these acquisitions can take years to come to fruition. But as you look at the market today, are you seeing any change in the pricing environment, maybe what expectations are from sellers, or has it remained about the same?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Kartik, good question. I wouldn't speak to any change there. It's more about -- certain events might cause them, whether it's an owner's age or succession or -- there's many different life events that would cause them to make a move. And it's more about that to your point. It's in certain cases, these are decades in the making. And you can't really pace them, but when they are ready, we're ready. And we're highly acquisitive, very interested in M&A from all shapes and sizes, big, little, medium, everything in between, we think it’s -- we're very interested.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. I wanted to ask a question on the focus verticals. Are you able to share sort of the growth between focus verticals versus non-focus ones? And how do you assess whether to add a new vertical into that sort of focus designation? Is there a different go-to-market strategy for focus verticals as well? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, good morning, Toni. Well, I'll say this about our focus verticals. I certainly expect them to grow faster than the business in general. And when you have an organized approach and you're organized around a customer base, you certainly expect that. And we've chosen what we think are really good verticals that are very attractive. So yeah, I can't give you a specific of -- boy, it's adding X amount of basis points to our total growth, but we think we've chosen well. And we're always analyzing what's -- should we have another one or should we not? And what's the best way? And it really gets down to what puts our employee partners in the best position to be successful and what creates the most value for the customer base. So we're looking, we're evaluating, always doing that, but we like where our investment is at this point.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. I wanted to also ask about your marketing budget and whether you've increased that year-over-year. I recently heard some Cintas commercials on Bloomberg Radio for example, just wondering if that's coincidence or if there's been a greater push towards more marketing? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Toni, first off, thank you. I'm glad to hear that. The algorithm is working and it's hitting our target audience. So I wouldn't say there's been a step change there. It's just trying to be -- make sure our investment is well-placed. And we're trying to leverage analytics and technology to make sure that the investment is deriving the very best ROI as possible. So it's just a matter of tweaks versus a step change in investment.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Thanks a lot.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared for closing remarks.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our fourth quarter of fiscal ‘24 financial results in July. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

I will now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our second quarter results and are excited about the future. Second quarter total revenue grew 9.3% to $2.38 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. Our momentum in the business is good and volume remains robust. We can grow in a number of different ways. Contribution to our growth from new business remained strong and comes from companies that either outsource their program today or they are managing it themselves. We continue to have great success cross-selling to existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels, and our value proposition of image, safety, cleanliness, and compliance continues to resonate across businesses of all sizes and in all verticals. We continue to be pleased with the results from our focus on prospects within the verticals of healthcare, hospitality, education, and state and local government. We recently announced the opening of two cleanroom facilities, one in North Carolina and the other in Wisconsin. These facilities will provide additional capacity in these regions in order to expand our efforts in this area of attractive growth from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the second quarter grew 11.6% and operating income grew 12.3%. Diluted EPS grew 15.7% to $3.61. Cash flow remained strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter grew 17.8% over the prior year. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital. In the second quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses. We also acquired several smaller businesses. On December 15th, we paid shareholders $137.5 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid the previous December. During the second quarter, we also purchased $320.3 million of Cintas common stock under our buyback program. I would like to thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders, and each other. Now, before turning the call over to Mike to provide details of our second quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.40 billion to $9.52 billion to a range of $9.48 billion to $9.56 billion, a total growth rate of 7.5% to 8.4%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14.00 to $14.45 to a range of $14.35 to $14.65, a growth rate of 10.5% to 12.8%. Mike?\nMike Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 second quarter revenue was $2.38 billion compared to $2.1 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 9%. Organic growth by business was 7.9% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 12.7% for First Aid and Safety Services, 17.8% for Fire Protection Services, and 4.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.02 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 48% for the second quarter of fiscal ‘24 compared to 47% last year, an increase of 100 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin. Gross margin percentage by business was 47.4% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 54.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.6% for Fire Protection Services, and 40.9% for Uniform Direct Sale. Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 40 basis points from last year. We continue to leverage our strong revenue growth and extract inefficiencies out of the business in order to expand margins. Our year-over-year improvements are no accident. Our Six Sigma and Engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant that allow us to maximize the utilization of our equipment, labor, and energy. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide density to our existing routes. While energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas, and electricity were a tailwind of 40 basis points from last year, please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies just mentioned. As an example, our rental revenue grew organically at 7.9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure since last year. Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 400 basis points from last year. Our revenue growth is strong and value -- our value proposition continues to resonate in this segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. Our mix of revenues continues to be healthy, including growing high margin recurring revenue products like AED rentals, eyewash stations, and WaterBreak. We continue to use technology like SmartTruck to optimize our routes and improve efficiencies. And our first aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contributes to our improved margins. Selling and administrative expenses grew $64.4 million or 11.1% over last year. Strong revenue growth creates leverage, which allows us to invest in the business. We continue to invest in our people, adding selling resources, investing in our management trainee program to develop future leaders, and expanding our talent acquisition efforts. Operating income of $499.7 million compared to $444.9 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 21% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 20.5% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the second quarter was $374.6 million compared to $324.3 million last year. This year's second quarter diluted EPS of $3.61 compared to $3.12 last year, an increase of 15.7%. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following. Fiscal ‘24 interest expense is expected to be $100 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal ‘23, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt. Our fiscal ‘24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal ‘23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal ‘24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks and guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal ‘23 compared to fiscal -- I'm sorry, fiscal ‘24 compared to fiscal ‘23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. I'll turn it back to Jared.\nJared Mattingley: Thanks, Mike. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now, we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow-up, if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC. Please go ahead, Ashish.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. Just on the four verticals that you highlighted as areas of strength in particular. I was wondering if you can quantify how big the combined revenues are from those verticals and how does the growth profile there compare to the company average? Any color? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Ashish. This is Todd. Thanks for the question. We don't -- I don't have any specific number for you as far as that exact number, but I can tell you that our verticals are performing quite well. We're having really good success. Our focus around not just selling but organizing around those is really paying off for us. And I've just got a couple of wins I can share with you regarding the verticals. In healthcare, in the acute space, we're having good success and non-acute as well. We’ve got a scrub rental program to a big hospital network in South Carolina that is benefiting from a new consistent image but also identification. The customer told us that they were interested in being able to -- pardon me, identify their people, understanding who was supposed to be in what area and this new scrub program did that. We had a really similar experience with a nursing home in Virginia. Same thing. They were buying their own and they -- but the leadership wanted to be able to identify and have a consistent image with their people. We had a -- on the acute side, again a hospital in Florida that we rolled out a new microfiber program because they were struggling with inventory control and product quality, which led to cleanliness concerns. And our program offered some great products, technology to control the inventory, which allow them to focus more on their patients, instead of having a full run with trying to manage the microfiber. Excuse me. And then I've got a couple of other examples I thought might be helpful for the group. In our government sector, we have -- we just recently rolled out a first aid and AED rental program to a public library system in California, which is -- you wouldn't think of a public library system as being a great prospect for us, but it is. They realized that the value would bring to their employees and being prepared with the AEDs in case it was needed because the publics in their locations. And then lastly, I'll just share with you a little bit on education. A variety of wins there. We had a chemistry department at a nice-sized university in Virginia. They put all their educators and students in a lab tour program. The maintenance department at a University in California put all of their people in Carhartt uniforms, a rental program from us, they love the Carhartt. And then the last item would be there was a dining facility at a university in Arizona where they put all their culinary people in Chef Works, which is a big win for those folks. The branded programs with Carhartt and Chef Works were big wins. So, I don't want to belabor it, but I thought I would just share a few wins because I know verticals are of interest to yourself, Ashish, but also plenty of other folks on the call.\nMike Hansen: Yeah. The only other thing I might add is, as Todd just talked about, we have so many ways to win, and clearly, those verticals are growing faster than the average. So we still are seeing really good momentum in each of those.\nAshish Sabadra: That's great color and thanks for sharing those events. It does provide a lot more clarity on those verticals. And if I can ask a quick follow-up. I was just wondering if there is -- if you could share any update on your technology, the SmartTruck program, and particularly the partnership with Google, Verizon, and SAP, any updates on that front? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Certainly. I think how -- one of the things we have around here is we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop. And -- so we're -- or the way Mike described it, in total for our company, we grew revenues over 9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure in total. So that means we're spending more time with the customer, less time driving, which is better for our customers, better for our partners, and better for Cintas. So we're pleased with that. Our technology and we still have plenty of room to go there. We're focused on bringing those efficiencies, extracting out the inefficiencies in our business. We sent out a note -- a press release regarding our migration this quarter to the Google Cloud, that has been very successful for us. There's a number of benefits that we get from moving from a server farm to the Google Cloud. The first one is it's more secure, so very important to us. Second item is, over time, we believe we will -- that'll be more cost-effective for us. And the third is it gives us access to Google's AI platform. So certainly in the very early innings, we just migrated, but we think that that will be able to help us longer term in making it more attractive, making it easier to do business with Cintas, making sure that we are positioning our people to be successful, to point them in the right direction and leverage that type of -- those types of tools.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead, Manav.\nManav Patnaik: Thank you. Todd, just to follow up on all the wins and contracts you talked about, maybe, I guess the question is more around the competitive environment versus is this just first time outsourcers? Any trends, any changes you're seeing from that front, the new business percentage you've called out before, but whether that's more market share or just first time outsourcing?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Manav. Great question. As Mike said, we win in many ways. We have been selling no programmers since the inception of my career, I can tell you that, and we continue to. And I'll just remind you, there is -- we service a little over a million businesses, but there's 16 million businesses in the US and Canada, so there's plenty of opportunity there. And we like both. We certainly win some from the competitors. We like growing the pie. And then the examples I was giving, it's a mix. But in large part, it is -- they were either doing it in house, meaning they were processing microfibers in house, or they were telling their employees to go buy product. So there's different variations of no programmers, meaning some are just -- were buying products and providing to their people and telling them to wear them. Some of them, they were just telling them to show up to work and look good. But nevertheless, we bring so much better consistent program identification, cleanliness, all these and compliance are big drivers for our customers.\nManav Patnaik: Got it. And then just on the capital allocation front, I mean, the buyback number one of the bigger quarters for a while now. I mean, is that any indication of the M&A market slowing down or just how we should think about that balance there?\nMike Hansen: Manav, we -- no change in what we're seeing in M&A. Still we're working the pipeline as best we can. We've made some nice acquisitions this year. From a buyback perspective, you've heard us speak to it being an opportunistic execution. And that's what you saw this quarter. As we think back about our first quarter results, and we thought they were pretty good, the stock reacted a little bit negatively, and we saw that as a nice opportunity and we took advantage of it. So that is a -- it was a good example during the quarter of an opportunistic execution of that buyback program. And the beauty, Manav, as we speak about our capital allocation, we don't always have to choose right in the quarter or maybe let's call it for the year. We've invested in the business as we've talked about. Our CapEx is up, which is important to us as a part of that investment. M&A is up from last year. Dividends are up 17% from last year, and we've been able to execute on the buyback program. So when you hear us talk about the sort of the four levers of capital allocation, we've done them all, I think, nicely this year. And again, the beauty of our cash flow and our balance sheet is we don't really have to choose.\nTodd Schneider: Mike, I would just add that we think we're being really good fiduciaries of our shareholders' investments. Mike mentioned all the levers. And the net-net of that is we still have great dry powder, which allows us to take on M&A of all shapes and sizes and we're interested in that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS. Please go ahead, Joshua.\nJoshua Chan: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, Todd, you mentioned the opening of the cleanrooms. I was just wondering if you can kind of frame for us what you see as the attractive parts of this business. How is it attractive? And what kind of opportunity does it mean for Cintas going forward in the cleanrooms?\nTodd Schneider: Thanks for the question, Josh. Yeah, the cleanroom business is, it's an attractive sector for us. I mentioned pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and there's -- it seems like there's more and more every year that need that level of cleaning, that level of cleanliness. So, that is -- we think that bodes well for that business in the future. And there has been -- you've seen some momentum onshoring in that area. And we want to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity to serve our current customers and that we're prepared for the future as well. So, we like the trends in that business, and we like the business.\nJoshua Chan: Great. Thank you for the color there, Todd. And, in fact, if I can follow up with the margin question, I guess, if in the future, the energy favorability were to lessen, could you talk to the opportunities that you still have to drive margin expansion and the targeted incremental margins going forward without as much energy tailwind?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. Great question. Yeah. So, we recognize that energy prices go up, they go down. But one thing that's going to be consistent is, we're going to be focused on extracting out inefficiencies in our route structure and in our production facilities. So, that will be really important to us. And we think there is certainly ample opportunity there still to go. We've talked about the SmartTruck technology, that's been impactful to us in many ways. But what's also impactful is, as Mike mentioned, our Six Sigma team of professionals, our Engineering professionals, and then layering in with that technology allows us to have a centralized visibility into our operations at a level that we've never had before in the history of the company this technology allows us. So -- and it allows us to maximize our labor, our equipment, ultimately our energy spend. So -- and we're focused on extracting out those inefficiencies, so that we can manage it moving forward. We love when energy goes -- costs go down, but we recognize those markets will move, but we're going to be focused on extracting out those inefficiencies.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Heather.\nHeather Balsky: Hi. Sorry about that. Thank you for taking my question. And first question with regards to the programmers and non-programmers, as we're further and further out from the COVID period, are you still seeing the shift in demand in terms of more non-programmers looking to outsource, or do you think it's starting to normalize back to pre-COVID trends?\nTodd Schneider: Well, Heather, it's a great question. I'll start. Mike, feel free to chime in. We're -- there's various reasons why a prospect would turn into a customer. Going from a no programmer to a customer. One of them is, hey, where we'd like to outsource it, because we're not very good at it or we're not -- we don't have -- we're struggling to staff and we're struggling to find people to manage this. So, that still continues. But there's other reasons. It might be, we don't like the image that we're portraying. We don't like the lack of identification. We don't like the lack of compliance. You can provide them, and we know that they're hygienically clean. So, there's many different motives. One of it might be, hey, we can't staff, and we need help. And we still see that, frankly. And it allows our customers to focus on what's most important to them, taking care of their customers, their patients, their guests, whatever it is, instead of having to manage through these various programs.\nMike Hansen: Heather, the no programmers is still -- we get -- more than 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. Your reference to the pandemic might be, we did certainly, in the early days of the pandemic, see an increase in personal protective equipment and things like hand sanitizer. Those have normalized back to what we would call normal and ongoing levels, so that might be the only change that we had, and back to normal.\nHeather Balsky: Thank you. And then, on the margin front, we're just kind of curious, when you think about -- you talked earlier about opportunities for efficiencies and further route productivities, when you think about the source of those savings, how much are just organic Six Sigma efforts, how much is coming from your SAP, and are there still G&K synergy or opportunities that you're kind of benefiting from? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Heather, it's a good question. We don't really discern the difference between our Six Sigma team, our Engineering team and our Technologies. They all have to work, be orchestrated appropriately to get the efficiencies, so -- and that's exactly what we're doing. So, everybody has to be involved. And that's what produces the great results. As for G&K, yeah, we're -- we now -- we’re I think about six and a half years since we acquired, if my math is correct. So, yeah, I wouldn't say that there's anything left on the bone there.\nOperator: And your next question comes from Andy Wittmann from RW Baird. Please go ahead, Andy.\nAndy Wittmann: Yeah, great. Thanks. Good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. I guess, I just wanted to ask on the outlook a little bit here, Mike. The second half total revenue guidance is in the 7% range at the midpoint against an organic 9% quarter here. So, a degree of deceleration. I guess that was implicit in your previous guidance as well. But just thought maybe give you a chance to elaborate a little bit more on that, talk about what you're seeing in the macro, if that's just you guys being kind of your normal prudent approach, or if there's something that we should be considering?\nMike Hansen: Andy, I'd lead with it's our normal prudent approach. And when you think about where we are, we've talked a little bit already about growth is still good, momentum is good, and so we like where the business is going. The range for the back half of the year does -- certainly does imply a little bit over 7% at the midpoint, a little over 8% at the high point. We like that range. The cadence is good for us, as you know. But, look, as we look into calendar ‘24, there certainly is a little bit of uncertainty as to what the new economy may bring, what the Fed movements may bring, and so we think it is wise to be prudent as we look out.\nAndy Wittmann: Great. That's my only question for today. Have a Merry Christmas, guys.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Andy.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, George.\nGeorge Tong: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Earlier you mentioned that business momentum was good. Volumes were robust in the quarter. Can you provide more color on overall customer budget trends and customer sentiment, and any changes that you might be seeing in the sales cycle?\nTodd Schneider: George, we -- good morning, George. We -- forward-looking, as Mike said, there's always -- we're not trying to prognosticate exactly how our customers will react to the turning of the calendar year, but we're not seeing any change in sales cycles, and we haven't seen a change in our customer base and they're -- how they're reacting to what's going on in the marketplace. So, it's kind of business has been consistent, and it's more what Mike referred to the turn of the calendar year. And we'll see how businesses react coming out of the holidays.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. That's helpful. And also you mentioned cross selling was good in the quarter. Can you elaborate more on cross selling trends that you're seeing, in which areas you're seeing most amount of bundling or upsell, cross sell from?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, George. Cross sell is -- it's an important component of our growth, and the nature of it is we're having good success across all of our areas of our business. We're blessed to be in a position where our customers, fortunately, they really like us. They like our relationships. We have people in their businesses on a really frequent basis, mostly on a weekly basis. So they -- and we have -- so that means we have eyes, ears, and minds in their business and we can help. And it doesn't matter to us what a customer might lead with, whatever they're interested in, but then we will quickly pivot and we can help them in many ways. So -- but just the nature of the size of the rental division is such that because there is -- are so many customers there, there's plenty of opportunity for our First Aid and Fire business to cross onto that just because of the numbers there. But nevertheless, it's working quite well across all of our organization. We share leads, we share thoughts, and we make sure that the customer is well taken care of.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair. Please go ahead, Tim.\nTim Mulrooney: Yeah, good morning. I just wanted to ask one question. Pricing now normalized back to the 2% range. That means your organic growth was comprised of approximately seven points of volume. I was just hoping you could dig into that a little bit more as it was a little stronger than I think most of us were expecting. Did you see an uptick in retention? Did you have a strong quarter with that cross sell? Or maybe new account growth and any details would be helpful.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, good morning Tim. So our new business is robust. As I mentioned, retention levels are very good and our cross-sell is very good. And the pricing is still, it's lower than last year. It is higher than historical, but it's certainly getting much closer to historical. So -- but when you -- so when you think about that, it is -- our various inputs to growth are all performing well, and we expect that to continue.\nMike Hansen: And as we talk, we win in a lot of ways. And the momentum in the rental business is still really good. But we also saw in the quarter some really nice acceleration in First Aid and Safety from 11% in the first quarter to 12.7% organically in the second quarter. And we saw some nice improvement in Fire where we went from a little over 14% in the first quarter to 17.8% in the second quarter. So we just see some really good momentum in all of our businesses. And particularly those two had some really nice performance in the second quarter.\nTim Mulrooney: Yeah, I did notice that re-acceleration across both those businesses. That's helpful color. Thanks, guys. Happy holidays.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Tim. You as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities. Please go ahead, Andrew.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. Could you just mention if your ad stops directionally and the uniform rental business was up, down, or flat recently?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Andrew. Our ad stop metrics are -- have been pretty consistent. We haven't seen much of a change in our customer base. And so I'd say that's how I would describe it. We see still positive trends in our ad stop metrics, but that's pretty consistent as it has been for the last six to twelve months.\nAndrew Steinerman: Okay, thank you very much.\nTodd Schneider: Yes sir, thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities. Please go ahead, Jasper.\nJasper Bibb: Hey, good morning guys. You mentioned year-on-year tailwind from energy. But was just hoping to get some additional color on other cost inputs, I guess specifically, labor and materials.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, I'll start, Jasper. Good morning. Our -- we're seeing -- just like you're seeing with inflation in total, we're seeing that come down. It's never coming down as fast as we like, but we are seeing it. Cotton is stabilized. We're seeing freight come down and that's important to us. And the labor market is easier. It's still not easy, but it is easier. So I think that probably the right way to think about it would be as the labor market eases, and that will lessen pressure on wage growth as well.\nJasper Bibb: Thanks. And then I wanted to follow up on first aid. Operating margins there were really strong in the first half. Should we think about these like low 20% levels as sustainable going forward? And would you say there's anything that's changed there that's unlocked another leg of operating margin expansion here today?\nMike Hansen: Sure. Jasper, we have seen some nice performance in that business and I spoke to a few of them where from a margin perspective, first of all, the value that we sell with, nothing is more important than the health and safety of your employees is really still resonating well. And so our growth has been really good in that business. We talked a little bit in the opening comments about sort of the recurring revenue streams of AED rentals, our eyewash stations and our WaterBreak. And these have been great businesses for us. The growth has been really good and the margins are great for us. Many times these are add-on products to existing customers. But in all three of them, we install, and then we have a recurring service program that goes on after that. And again, it leads to really nice stickiness and also nice margins. The other thing that I'll point out is we opened a first aid and safety distribution center a couple years ago and that allows us to source more. It allows us to centralize some of our sourcing, and those kind of things lead to a better product cost, and that again drives down the material cost in our first aid and safety business. So the combination of really good sales mix, really good growth in the business, good sourcing, the one I didn't mention was SmartTruck technology that is also having a benefit there. All of those things are contributing. And so this is not a case of six months of sort of unusual items. This is a little bit of a lot of hard work and execution by our first aid and safety partners to really get this margin going.\nJasper Bibb: Very helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank Securities. Please go ahead, Faiza.\nFaiza Alwy: Yes, hi, thank you, Todd. So I wanted to follow up on both the first aid business and the fire business. You touched on the first aid a little bit, but curious on what's driving the acceleration, if you could expand on that, both on first aid and fire. And then as we think about your outlook, do you expect this level of growth to sustain looking ahead? And, I know in fire, you talked about an SAP implementation that was happening in this fiscal year. So maybe is that helping the top line? Has that happened? How should we think about margins going forward in that business?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Faiza. Thanks for the question. We really like the fire business. It's the only business we're in where you legally have to have it. So there is, I'll call it double negative, no program market. Everyone is a programmer. But we are able to cross-sell very well into that market. We're using various technologies that Mike referenced to make sure that we're positioning our partners to be more successful, meaning we use SmartTruck technology in all of our businesses, and that helps us. But we're getting leverage from our growth. And the growth is attractive. And we think it's – there’s certainly -- running a business isn't linear. So there will be ebbs and flows, but we like the long-term outlook for the fire business. That being said, as you mentioned, we are going through an SAP implementation. We certainly -- we haven't even implemented at this point, so we haven't seen any benefits just yet, but we're optimistic about how that can help our business over the coming years.\nMike Hansen: Maybe I'll add two things to the fire, and a little bit of first aid too. The market opportunity in those businesses is really large and our expectation as we've talked about is that those businesses will continue into the future near that double digit type of a place. Again, the market opportunity is really large. One last comment on the SAP, we've not started it. And so as we get into that, which is likely going to be more about next fiscal year, we may see a little bit of pressure in the fire segment because as you can imagine, when you turn -- when you start to go into an SAP conversion, you don't get benefits overnight. It takes a little bit of time. So we'll have some additional costs in ‘25 and certainly then setting up really nice benefits into the future for that business.\nFaiza Alwy: Great, thank you. And then if I could just follow up on the macro environment, you made some comments in response to a previous question around just you’re being prudent and there is some uncertainty. Just given sort of how well you are doing [with no programmers] (ph) and the momentum you are seeing in sort of these other businesses, I'm curious if you can give us a framework in terms of how we should think about the impact of macro on your business.\nTodd Schneider: Well, I'll start, Faiza, with, our history has been we grow certainly in multiples of GDP and employment growth and you hit it. We are able to sell into no programmers. Even when they're not, let's say, adding people, we can take pressure off of them by managing programs for them. So our new business effort is always really good. But certainly, if we see turns in the economy, we've got to adjust potentially. If we see our customers start to reduce their number of people, we've got to adjust. And so it is prudent for us to sort of think about that as we look into our guidance and into the future of the business.\nFaiza Alwy: Understood, thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, Seth.\nSeth Weber: Hey, good morning and happy holidays, guys. I wanted to just go back to the clean room discussion for a minute. If there's any way to frame how we should be thinking about that, new facility openings, and are those facilities higher CapEx relative to a traditional facility? Is there any way to combine facilities or I'm just trying to get a better understanding of this opportunity and what the investment might be for Cintas going forward? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Seth, thank you for the question. As you know, that's a segment of the uniform market. As I mentioned earlier, it does seem more companies over the last decade or so have higher cleaning quality requirements, so we think there's a tailwind there. As far as the CapEx required for a facility like that, you can think of it as very similar to a uniform facility. The only difference I think that you may want to think about is, it serves usually a larger geographic area than we would with a traditional facility. And the reason being is we only have so many of them and they have to cover the customer base. So as a result of that, we do cover a larger geographic area for -- out of each of those facilities.\nSeth Weber: Okay, that's helpful. Is there any way for us to think about how many of these facilities you might be opening over the next couple of years relative -- I mean I saw the press release for the Wisconsin facility, but is this order of magnitude ones and twos or could this be much bigger going forward?\nTodd Schneider: Yeah, Seth, I wouldn't -- you're not going to see ones and twos coming out every quarter or every year based upon the size of the market. So it certainly won't be anywhere near that pace. But it will be paced based upon the demand from the marketplace. If there's more and more customers that are interested in it, then we'll be prepared to meet that demand.\nSeth Weber: Okay, that's helpful, thanks. And then maybe just a quick follow up on the direct, it's nice to see the direct sales business turn positive again in the quarter. Is there any color on whether that's coming more from the service side of your customer base, more of the manufacturing side, and any just detail there or is it just kind of across the board?\nTodd Schneider: Good question, Seth. The design collective business, the direct sale portion of it, we've spoken in the past, it's certainly lumpier. And so as far as where that growth is coming from, it's really more national accounts, where we would get it, hospitality, lodging. And when they have rollouts or new allotment programs, you tend to get spikes. And then -- so we love the spikes and then the, what comes after the spike isn't as good, but I wouldn't think about it as a big growth engine for us.\nMike Hansen: Yeah, we typically would say in the low to mid-single-digit growth. So this quarter is sort of in line with that expectation.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Stephanie.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch a bit on maybe the cross-sell opportunity over time. I think you've provided -- you continue to execute very well on your investments, particularly on the technology front and called out this enhanced visibility that you have. So maybe you can talk about, given some of these investments, what this might mean for cross-selling, meaning the opportunity to add those additional products and kind of continue to further penetrate each existing customer. So kind of how are you balancing the incremental products that you can offer over time? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Stephanie. Well, you can think about it -- we call it cross-sell. There's -- cross-sell is really division to division. There's also upsell which would be, we have products that our customers don't use all of our products, even within the rental division, or the first aid division, and what have you. So, those are all components of growth for us, and we see a significant, massive, frankly, runway in all those areas. So we're trying to position our employee partners to make sure that they're in the right spot and have the right information to help the customer. And then we're also continually, it's part of our corporate culture, is to invest in new products and new services. We're always working on that. And we get those ideas from those customers and then we test them and then we launch them and we're always working on that. It's always been a component of our growth and always will be.\nStephanie Moore: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, Scott.\nScott Schneeberger: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Happy holidays. I -- my first one, I'm going to delve into the SG&A running low double digits growth, something you did last year as well. And you cited investment in selling resources, management training program, tech, and also some talent acquisition efforts. Just curious, and you guys have said on this call, labor is getting better but still a little tough. Could you elaborate on the labor aspect and kind of what you guys are doing pushing the selling? And then also curious about the tech aspect. Maybe you've already covered it in the call if that's what you meant, but just wondering if there's anything extra there? Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: Yeah. Good morning, Scott. We’re -- the items that you mentioned, they're all really important to us. We are -- there's not one that I would call out, but I would think about it this way. We think the future's really bright and we want to invest for the future. We know we need the talent acquisition team to be attracting the very best talent. The management trainee programs are leaders of the future, and we think they are a critical pipeline, and we're going to need those leaders. And then the selling resources are, we see the -- it looks, we think the future's bright with our, how many customers we have, what the size of the market is. I mentioned 1 million customers, about 16 million businesses. So that's all great. And then you kind of wrap it all with technology, because technology will, we want to make it easier to do business with us, and we want to leverage technology to make our partners more successful. Point them in the right direction, give them the right tools in their toolbox to spend their time in the right spots, but also to make it easier for the customer to buy, easier to do business with in totality.\nScott Schneeberger: Great, thanks, appreciate that. And then, not a lot of acquisition activity in the quarter, but there was some, and there was a good amount in the first quarter. I remember you saying it was across all businesses, but we didn't hit it up too much last quarter. Could you talk about what it is that you're acquiring and clearly across segments, but what the strategies have been there? Thanks.\nMike Hansen: Sure, not a lot of change in the strategy, Scott, and that is we love rental tuck-in opportunities and we've made a number of those this year. And as you can imagine, when we do that in a marketplace, we add immediate capacity utilization improvement, route density, and so those things really help us in the rental business. So we've made some of those. We certainly have made some first aid acquisitions, and we've made fire acquisitions. Again, the dynamic is similar in all three of these. These are really nice tuck-in opportunities that just strengthen our business in the local markets in which we acquire them, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as best we can.\nTodd Schneider: One thing I might add is, to Mike's point, we get synergies. It helps us with density, helps us with capacity utilization, allows us to spend more time with the customers. So all that's valuable, but in each of the businesses, depending upon the business we acquire. But normally when we make an acquisition in rental, first aid, or fire, we're able to provide an offering to that customer base that's broader than what they had in the past. So the rental waiver broader offering than most companies out there, certainly in the first aid we do as well. And depending upon the [fire] (ph) acquisition, that's very consistent. Separate from, then we can cross sell. So it adds nice value.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel. Please go ahead, Shlomo. Shlomo, is you line muted?\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Sorry, my line was muted. This is a question basically for Mike, just a little bit going through some of the technical items in the quarter. Receivables days were up two days sequentially. I was wondering if there was a lot of business that came in at the end of the quarter. Are you seeing any changing patterns in what clients are paying or any other factors in that because the last time we saw 48 days was during COVID.\nMike Hansen: Shlomo, when our quarters end on a holiday and it seems like too many of them do, it does create a little bit of disruption in terms of the ability to collect the mail, the application. We have seen maybe just a touch of slowing in the AR, but we've not seen any, I'll say deterioration from the standpoint of additional write-offs. But we did see a little bit of slowing, and the Thanksgiving holiday can usually contribute to that.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Okay. Then in the OPM, the operating margin, the other unit was up very nicely sequentially, even though there's one less day sequentially in the quarter. Could you just give us some of the mechanics or tell us just what's going on on the ground over there? It's increasing the margin very nicely and is that something that we should expect to continue at kind of that 16% level?\nMike Hansen: Well we -- certainly the revenue growth is powerful in all of our businesses and when we see some really nice revenue growth, that's important. The other thing that I would say is you know the uniform direct sale business went from a negative 2.7% in terms of revenue growth to 4.7%. And that is important for operating margins too. So we did see some nice improvement there in the direct sale. Nothing I would say that is noteworthy other than, again, some nice acceleration in the revenue.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Leo Carrington from Citigroup. Please go ahead, Leo.\nLeo Carrington: Thank you, and good morning. If I could ask a follow up on that point around the one-off or the cost that you called out in Q2 around current acquisition, training, technology. Were you calling them out to any of these one-off increases in nature or more to highlight where the spend is? And then in terms of the underlying margins and drop through in Q2 on your organic growth, do you see that as sustainable when you factor in the additional investment this quarter?\nMike Hansen: Well, Leo, I’ll start with, we call them out because we think it's important to make sure that our investors understand that we are looking at the long term and we want to continue to invest in the business. And those investments are really important and they set up, let's say, more penetration opportunities, more cross-sell opportunities, but also productivity improvements, capacity utilization opportunities. In these cases, we wanted to call them out to show that, look, we're focused on the long-term and we're going to continue in the business. As Todd said a couple times, the future is bright for us and we want to make sure that we take advantage of that bright future by investing in the business and the call outs were really more about that. The future is bright. In the quarter, we had incremental margins of 27%. Look, our expectation is that we're going to be in the 20% to 30% range going forward. We recognize that when we're sitting at 21%, they need to be in the higher level of that range. And we think that’s -- that we can continue to do that. And when we talk about things like SAP and technology and other investments, and by the way, we're able to get 27% even when we're investing in the business. But we give those to say we're setting up those future margin and revenue opportunities. It's important for us to, I think, communicate that.\nLeo Carrington: Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Toni.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. You mentioned the success that you've had with the branded products earlier, particularly with Carhartt and Chef Works. Could you just remind us if these are exclusive relationships and how long the relationships are for and then are there any other areas that could benefit from branded products or equipment that you could offer as well?\nTodd Schneider: Good morning, Toni, thank you for the question. So we've had a long standing relationship with Carhartt and Chef Works, and we are the exclusive licensees for those folks, for those companies on the rental programs. And so we work with them to design products that the end users want, want to wear, and -- but also that goes very well through our processing systems. So that's all very important to us. As far as, we don't get into contractual arrangements with them, but I can tell you this. We love products that our end users are, that get excited about wearing them. And Carhartt and Chef Works are two great examples of that, in great companies, great brands, great products. And as far as are there other opportunities, we're constantly looking for that. And we spend a lot of time with our customers and with our working partners to talk about that and to see where those opportunities do come from. But those are two great relationships, long-standing relationships that are really important to us.\nToni Kaplan: Yep, terrific. And maybe if you could just give us your latest thoughts on potential international expansion, that'd be great. Thanks.\nTodd Schneider: I'd say, similar to products, we're always looking at those types of opportunities. We certainly know, stay in contact with the people that are running those businesses. But the great news is we don't have to do that to -- in order to be really, really successful in the future. We look at it and say there's, again, we're servicing about 1 million businesses. There's 16 million businesses in US and Canada. Here's what's really exciting is by the time we get to 2 million customers, there will be more than 16 million businesses in the US and Canada. So that's kind of a bummer if you're running a race but it's really exciting if you're running a business because once we get to the 2 mile mark, the race is going to be extended. So that's separate from -- we're going to have more products and services over the coming year. So all that being said is, we continue to watch it, we evaluate it, we look for the right opportunity, and if that opportunity presents itself, then we will seize it, but it's certainly not -- it's not required in order for us to be successful in the future.\nOperator: And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley to close out the call.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal ‘24 financial results in March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Jared Mattingley, Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us. With me is Todd Schneider, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Hansen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will discuss our fiscal 2024 first quarter results. After our commentary, we will open the call to questions from analysts.  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor from civil litigation for forward-looking statements. This conference call contains forward-looking statements that reflect the company's current views as to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those we may discuss. I refer you to the discussion on these points contained in our most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. I'll now turn the call over to Todd.\nTodd Schneider: Thank you, Jared. We are pleased with our start to fiscal year 2024. First quarter total revenue grew 8.1% to $2.34 billion. Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flow through to our bottom line. Operating income margin increased 110 basis points to an all-time high of 21.4%, and diluted EPS grew 9.1% to $3.70.  I thank our employees, whom we call partners, for their continued focus on our customers, our shareholders and each other. Uniform Rental and Facility Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.83 billion compared to $1.7 billion last year. Their organic revenue growth rate was 7.6%. While price increases moved near historical levels, revenue growth continues to be driven mostly from increased volume. Our sales force continues to add new customers and penetrate and cross-sell our existing customer base. Businesses prioritize all we provide, including image, safety, cleanliness and compliance. Our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment revenue for the first quarter was $260.7 million compared to $234.2 million last year. The organic revenue growth rate was 11%. Our value proposition continues to resonate in our First Aid and Safety Services operating segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind.  We provide businesses with access to quick and effective products and services that promote health and well-being in the workplace. Our Fire Protection Services and Uniform Direct Sale businesses are reported in the All Other segment. All Other revenue was $254.8 million compared to $234.5 million last year.  The Fire business revenue was $174.3 million, and their organic revenue growth rate was 14.2%. The Uniform Direct Sale business revenue was $80.5 million which was down 2.7% organically compared to last year. Now before I turn the call over to Mike to provide details of our first quarter results, I'll provide our updated financial expectations for our fiscal year. We are increasing our financial guidance. We are raising our annual revenue expectations from a range of $9.35 billion to $9.5 billion to a range of $9.4 billion to $9.52 billion, a total growth rate of 6.6% to 8%. Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $13.85 to $14.35 to a range of $14 to $14.45, a growth rate of 7.8% to 11.2%. Mike?\nMichael Hansen: Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 first quarter revenue was $2.34 billion compared to $2.17 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate, adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 8.1%. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.03 billion last year, an increase of 11%.  Gross margin as a percent of revenue was an all-time high of 48.7% for the first quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 47.5% last year, an increase of 120 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this record gross margin. Energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind, decreasing 50 basis points from last year.  Please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies we've created with our proprietary SmartTruck technology. Certainly, we've also seen a benefit from a drop in prices at the pump compared to a year ago. Gross margin percentage by business was 48.1% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services, 55.9% for First Aid and Safety Services, 49% for Fire Protection Services and 38.7% for Uniform Direct Sale. Operating income of $500.6 million compared to $440.1 million last year. Operating income as a percentage of revenue was 21.4% in the first quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.3% in last year's first quarter, an increase of 110 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 19.2% compared to 14.8% last year.  The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the first quarter was $385.1 million compared to $351.7 million last year. This year's first quarter diluted EPS of $3.70 compared to $3.39 last year, an increase of 9.1%.  Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first quarter grew 13% over the prior year. On September 15, we paid shareholders $138.3 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.8% from the amount paid the previous September. Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $98 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of lower variable rate debt; our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23.  The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points. Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. Guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter. Jared?\nJared Mattingley: That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just one question and a single follow up if needed. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.\nFaiza Alwy: I wanted to see if you could provide a bit more color on the new business environment. And if you've noticed any change in terms of the macro environment. Certainly, you guys are talking to your customers every day. So just a bit more perspective around what you're seeing out there in the marketplace.\nTodd Schneider: Great. Yes, our new business pipeline is quite good. We love the state of our sales organization, the focus that they have, the scope. And so new business is quite good, and that's a big driver of our growth that you're seeing and we see that continuing. As far as macro environment, it is -- we haven't seen any real change in our customers' behavior, I would say, since we reported last.  So it's pretty consistent with what we have seen over the past few quarters. And we are watching it very, very closely and monitoring it as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.\nManav Patnaik: I just wanted to see if you could give us a little more color, I think, in terms of the pricing strategy and then also the strong volume growth. So I think you said pricing is back to historical levels. So I'm guessing that's down in that low single-digit camp versus almost every other company talking about still, I guess, pricing higher than above and average. So it just maybe the first question is just how do we think about your pricing strategy here?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, it is certainly closer to historical levels, and we like that. That's, we think, appropriate based upon our cost inputs. But we're very proud of the fact that we're growing our business attractively, and we think we can continue this based upon new business being robust and our customer retention levels, being very good as well.  And we're seeing that in our customer satisfaction scores as well. And then the status of our customers is -- they're continuing on in the operating environment as they have in the past. So we like where we're positioned. We like the momentum in our business, and we like how we're growing it as well, and we think it's -- it bodes well for the future.\nMichael Hansen: Manav, I might just add -- Manav, I might just add to that, you asked about our pricing strategy. And as we've talked in the past, our goal is operating margin improvement, right? And pricing can be a lever within that, but we have other levers. It's not the only way for us to improve margins.  And so as we think about the operating margin strategy of increasing, we've got a lot of good things going on. And this is a great quarter that shows where pricing is sort of returning back to that historical level. We still increased margins quite nicely even to record levels. And again, it's just that pricing is a part of that strategy.\nManav Patnaik: Yes, that make sense. That's quite impressive. And then maybe just on the strong volume growth. Could you just help provide some color on how much of that is new business, cross-selling, maybe share gains? Any color around that?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Good question, Manav. I mean, it's everything. As I mentioned, our new is quite good. Our retention levels, we're very happy with, and we're cross-selling. And we've -- we're continuing to make good progress there. We're never satisfied. But our value proposition is resonating with our customers, and we're trying to make it easier to do business with us through various technologies. And I think it's showing up in our results, and we're again bullish.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Chan from UBS.\nJoshua Chan: I guess could I ask about inflation and what you're seeing across your different cost buckets, labor, energy, material? And how you expect that to kind of transpire over the coming quarters as well?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, I'll start, and Mike wants to chime in as well. Yes, so what we're seeing from an input cost standpoint, labor is still higher than historical. But to Mike's point earlier, we're finding ways to improve operating margin in that environment still. And part of it is because productivity is quite attractive.  And we're trying to position our employee partners so that they can be more successful in the marketplace, which is good for them and it's good for ourselves. And obviously, with that retention levels of our employee partners being much back -- very close to historical levels. That's good for our customers as well.  Other input costs, you saw where energy was down year over prior. That is really a Q1 subject because if you recall last year, the price at the pump was very high. And so we got a little bit of a tailwind there. But we think that will be pretty muted through the balance of the fiscal year.  And then last, material costs. Our global supply chain team is doing one heck of a job in trying to make sure that we're well positioned to have very competitive prices and access to all that product. And we've spoken in the past about how a very small percentage of our products are single sourced. So that positions us well as far as having access to product, but also being giving them at very competitive rates.\nJoshua Chan: And I guess for my follow-up, could you talk about what your CapEx expectations are this year and kind of the types of projects that you're investing in?\nMichael Hansen: Sure. We did see a little bit of an increase in CapEx in Q1. We are -- as we've talked, we are in the midst of implementing SAP for our Fire Protection business and that adds a little bit of CapEx. In the first quarter, we also saw -- over the last couple of years, supply chains, our vendors have had some disruption in their ability to deliver trucks being the best example.  And in the first quarter, we saw a little bit of a catch-up in terms of us receiving more of those trucks. And so we saw a bit of an increase there too in the first quarter. I expect for the year that we're going to likely be right around 4%. Longer term, we still believe 3.5% to 4%. But because of SAP and sort of that catch-up might be a little closer to 4% this year.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America.\nHeather Balsky: I was hoping, first, you could talk about your exposure to the auto sector and any exposure you may have to, I guess, some of the current disruption? And then two, if you could talk about through the end markets, are there any areas where just in this macro, you're seeing softness and areas where you're seeing strength would be great?\nTodd Schneider: Heather. Yes, we're certainly watching what's going on with the auto worker strike, but it is not affecting us in any material way whatsoever. We have a very broad-based customer base. And as a result of that, it's not affecting us to any material degree whatsoever.  And keeping in mind that we have no one customer that's greater than 1% of our revenue and no even sector that's greater than 10% for 3-digit NAICS codes. So that helps us and insulates us a bit from all that. As far as the macro environment, it really -- it varies based upon the sector, geography, whether they're goods producing or services providing. But the labor market is a little easier, but still not easy.  And you see that through the -- what we've -- what we're reading with the job openings, still 9.5 million job openings. And that affects our customer base from a standpoint of them trying to attract and retain people. We would love to see those jobs filled because we think that would be really good for our customers and for the economy in general.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Justin Hauke from RW Baird.\nJustin Hauke: I wanted to ask about the First Aid margins because it kind of sustainably been higher than they have been historically and really more comparable to the Uniform Rental and the Facility Services segment. And I guess the question is, I mean, for years, that was kind of a scale business where you were building it out and it had lower margins. Are you at the point now where like that business has reached a point where it has very comparable margin sustainably to the Uniform Rental business?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, we really like the First Aid business. I mean it's -- that it resonates with our customer base. They -- a strong value proposition is helping our revenue growth. The mix has returned closer to historical with First Aid and Safety. And Justin, just like our other businesses, we're using various technologies to extract inefficiencies out of our business.  And there's certainly no exception to that. I mentioned that our global supply chain team has done -- doing a great job in sourcing product, and we're benefiting from sourcing there. But yes, we see -- certainly, there is -- running a business is not linear. But that being said, we certainly think that gross margins in excess of 50 are sustainable in that business.\nJustin Hauke: Okay. Great. And then I guess the last one is kind of more procedural, I guess. But you did -- it looks like on the cash flow about $56 million spending on acquisitions in the quarter, which is a little bit higher than what you guys typically do. Do you have any comments on kind of where that was, where we should see the revenue flow from it?\nTodd Schneider: Well, I'll start, and Mike can chime in. The -- Justin, as you know, we love leveraging our balance sheet for M&A. And we think it's a great use of cash, and we're very happy with the fact that we were able to deploy some of the cash to leverage that opportunity. And we are acquisitive in all 3 of our operating segments that are route-based. And we made acquisitions in all 3, so -- in Q1. So we're pleased with that, and we think that will -- is a great opportunity for us to bring those customers into the fold, those partners, those employee partners into the fold and provide more value and cross-sell to those customers that are now part of Cintas.\nOperator: And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.\nGeorge Tong: In the past, you've talked about strong demand from the health care, education and government verticals in driving Uniform Rental's growth. Can you discuss the latest trends you're seeing in these end markets and what's fueling the growth?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, those are 3 great verticals for us. I mean, they're 3 great segments of the North American economy. And so, yes, we're still seeing outsized growth in those markets. And as we've chatted about in the past, it's more than just a sales effort. We've organized around them. We've got products for them. We've got technologies for them.  And that is resonating with that customer base. So we think we've chosen them quite well, and there's plenty of runway in all of them. So we're, again, quite bullish on the future of those segments.\nGeorge Tong: Got it. And then with respect to margins, your gross margins expanded 60 bps year-over-year in your Uniform segment. Most of that appears to be driven by lower energy costs. Can you discuss puts and takes around Uniform gross margins in the quarter and opportunities for additional margin expansion over the remainder of this year that comes above and beyond tailwinds you're seeing from lower energy costs?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. George, we're -- the nature of the math around our businesses, the Rental business is obviously a large percentage of it. And we're guiding towards margin expansion for the year. And we do not see energy being a tailwind for the balance of the year.  So we expect margin expansion based upon certainly leverage on revenue growth, that's going to be helpful. But we're extracting those inefficiencies out of our business. And as Mike mentioned earlier, we're proud of the fact that pricing is returning back to historical levels, but we're still able to grow operating margin -- gross margin and operating margin at very attractive levels and to levels that are all-time highs. So that's part of our plan. And our team is actually treating at a very high level, and we expect that, that will continue.\nMichael Hansen: George, I might just reiterate what I mentioned in the prepared remarks that keeping in mind that the energy benefit that we are getting is partly because we are working really hard at things like our SmartTruck initiative. So in other words, as we continue to grow really nicely with volumes, we don't need to add as many routes and trucks as we have in the past, and that creates then better fuel efficiency, if you will, throughout our network. And so that's a -- it is a proactive initiative to get energy down. And one of those proactive ways is through that SmartTruck technology.\nTodd Schneider: And Mike, I might add that when we extract those inefficiencies out, that's better for our customers because we're able to spend more time in front of them instead of on the road. It's certainly better for our partners, our employee partners because it makes them that much more productive, and that's good for them and our organization.  And it's really good for the environment. So we think -- let's say there's a lot of boxes checked there, and we've worked hard on that technology over the years, and it's showing up. And it's benefiting not just the P&L in a more simplistic fashion, but in many ways.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair.\nSamuel Kusswurm: This is Sam Kusswurm on for Tim. I guess I want to start with another health care question here. But as it relates to your health care clients, you've talked a lot about the opportunity here, especially as more no programmers convert. But I guess I'd like to know for those health care operators who already use a service partner, what do you think your penetration rate is? And how might that compare to some of your other customer verticals?\nTodd Schneider: Sam, that's a good question. I don't have that in front of me. But we know this. We're in the early innings with health care. And we're coming up with more products and services that they find attractive. And that's part of our culture. We will enter into a business. But then we get out from behind our desk and we go spend time with our customers.  And when we find that we find the answers to what they are most interested in by speaking to them, and our customers and our employee partners. And we're hearing from them on various areas where we can help them, and we're taking action there. So again, a very long runway in that vertical, and that's again part of our culture and will be part of how we go to market moving forward.\nSamuel Kusswurm: Got you. Appreciate it. Maybe just another quick one on the margins. I see SG&A as a percentage of sales picked up again in the quarter compared to last year. I guess I'm wondering if there was any variable costs like your insurance expenses? Or if it was mainly some of the selling and branding investments you've talked about previously? Maybe you could just help break that out for us a little more.\nMichael Hansen: Nothing unusual in the quarter. We did see the -- we talked in the fourth quarter about some claims getting higher, but not structural. We saw those come back down to something more normal. But as it relates to the quarter, just some puts and takes, nothing of any significance. Our goal is to continue to leverage particularly the G&A piece of that, and we're going to continue to work at that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities.\nAndrew Steinerman: I wanted to talk to you about incremental margins, which were super strong in the quarter and last quarter on a year-over-year basis. I surely know, Cintas historically has targeted 20% to 30% as a range for incremental margins. But kind of given where we are right now, it definitely feels like that kind of low end of the range, the 20%, might not be as appropriate. And so my question is, has your medium-term range for incremental margins been creeping up?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. 20% to 30% is our target. We -- Q1 was a very attractive incremental margins. And there's always puts and takes in every quarter as I mentioned. Running a business is not linear. But we will expect that we will be in that 20% to 30% range. I certainly like higher in the range than lower. And we are -- and I think our guide speaks to where attractive margin improvement for the year as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo.\nSeth Weber: I wanted to ask just about the small tick down in Uniform Direct Sales organic growth here in the quarter. It's the first, I think, decline that we've seen there in a while. I know the comp was hard. Is there anything else that you'd call out there for that business?\nTodd Schneider: Certainly, what we have seen outstanding performance from that business over the past really 2 years. And -- but it is -- as we've spoken about in the past, the Uniform Direct Sale business tends to be a little bit lumpier based upon rollouts of large programs, whether it's hospitality or a Fortune 1000-type customer. So nothing more than that. We still are bullish on the future of that business and for the year and moving forward.\nSeth Weber: Do you think, Todd, do you think that business could be up for the year? Or do you think that's kind of flattish or down?\nTodd Schneider: I would suspect -- well, we expect all of our businesses to grow. So I would suspect that we would see that up. But just the comps are set with the level of what we dealt with hospitality in that vertical, in Fortune 1000, the level of where employees came back so strongly. I wouldn't suspect that you'll see anywhere near the level of growth that we've seen in the last couple of years, but we expect it to grow.\nMichael Hansen: Seth, I might point out that the last 2 years have -- they have been a significant recapture of what we sort of lost in that pandemic period of time. In our fiscal '22, that business grew organically over 50%; in fiscal '23, it was almost 30%. So there was a lot of recapture going on, but keep in mind that our longer-term goal for that business, Todd expects it to grow, but it's probably more of a low single-digit to mid-single-digit grower in our portfolio.\nSeth Weber: Right. Okay. Understood. And then maybe just on the First Aid and Safety business, given the margin strength that you're seeing there, can you talk about are you seeing any incremental competition in that space? Are you seeing any bigger players trying to get into that space or just smaller regional players getting more active?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Good question, Seth. Certainly, it's a very competitive marketplace and First Aid products, Safety products, there is hundreds of competitors out there. There's many, many ways to procure those products, whether it be van delivered or e-commerce, you name it, we see it there.  But as a result of that, it's a very competitive market. And we've talked about the health and safety of employees being the #1 item that businesses are focused on. And when that occurs, there's certainly -- it attracts plenty of people into the marketplace because the value proposition of taking great care of employees is resonating with folks. And so yes, it's a very competitive environment, and I'm sure it will continue to be.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.\nStephanie Moore: Actually, maybe continuing on that last question there. Could you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the competitive landscape and your more core Uniform ancillary product segment? As you continue to win new business, where are you seeing the majority of that new business coming from? Is it nonprogrammers, some of the regional players, larger players? Any color there would be helpful.\nTodd Schneider: So I've been in the Uniform Rental and Facility Services business my entire career, 34 years. It's been highly competitive my entire career, and I'm sure it will continue to be that way. But we haven't seen a change in the landscape. It's always really competitive. So that being said, we -- our sales organization is highly skilled. And what we know is, there is a massive opportunity with the no program market.  And for years, our organization has been focused on expanding the pie, and they are continuing to do exactly that. And when we talk about expanding the pie, they are -- those employees at a no programmer mean -- they're wearing garments, right? It's -- but they are -- they may be buying it themselves. They may be buying it through a catalog, it might be a centralized program for the company, but they're purchasing them.  And then we provide more value to them with the products and services that we offer, whether they're unique products like Carhartt or Chef Works or Landau, great branded programs. But the no-program market is really attractive for us, and we find that market sees really good value in what we're offering. So we're focused on expanding that high, and that will continue.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. And just a follow-up, if I may. You noted that retention level continue to be really high. I'm just curious, in this current environment, what do you think is resonating the most with your customers that your sales force kind of goes in? Is it kind of the willingness to work with them on price? Is it the product offering, your scale? I'd love to just get your thoughts on what do you think is resonating the most to drive such a nice retention level.\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Great question, Stephanie. That's a very complicated answer because there's so many inputs to it. But it starts with being highly focused on taking incredibly good care of our customers and attracting and retaining the very best people. But then giving them product, services, tools so that they can not only have the intent to take great care of our customers, but do just exactly that.  So -- and that gets into great products that I mentioned earlier, the service -- focus that we -- or the tools that we're making that make it easier to do business with us. But it gets down to our people and positioning them to take a really, really good care of our customers and then executing on that. And they're executing at a really high level.  And we talk often about when markets -- when things are challenging, when it's hard to attract people, when it's hard to procure products, when it's hard to operate in the marketplace, it gives us a chance to shine. And our culture is shining through. And our people are doing one heck of a job in taking care of our customers.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.\nScott Schneeberger: Guys, you've certainly -- it sounds like you really want to speak to a SmartTruck because that's been going very well. I was hoping you could add also on automation to facilities. And where I'm going here, just kind of an update on where I'm going here is it sounds like you've been getting nice efficiencies and you still see more room to run.  Is there any quantification you can put on that? I know you're looking for margins up this year overall business. But maybe just help us get an idea of what's at play there and how much you can do.\nTodd Schneider: Scott, I'll start. Mike, if you would like to chime in there. We're deploying technology, and you can call it automation, you can call it technology, you can call it digital. We're deploying that across all of our businesses and across all areas of our business as well, and we've been focused on that for years.  But there certainly is -- we're seeing some real benefits there with our investment with SAP, with our investments -- our partnerships with Google and with Verizon. And it's -- those are -- we see that there's plenty of opportunities still to come there to improve in the efficiencies of our business and to automate certain functions.  And we call it -- make it easier for our customers to do business and make it easier for our employee partners to take great care of our customers. The more we can invest there, we think it's an incredibly good use of our balance sheet because it positions us well for not just the short term, but the long term as well.\nMichael Hansen: Yes. There are so many details that go into all of the things that Todd just talked about, that it's really hard to put a number on it. Our goal is, as you've heard us say, is continue to improve margins. We have a number of different levers to do so. Our goal is incrementals in that 20% to 30% range, recognizing we're at the bottom of that range today.  But it's hard to put a specific number on what's left because we're always working on what's -- what more can we do. And there are so many details and so many different projects we're working on. So our guide certainly does imply for continued margin improvement over last year, and that's the way we think about it.\nScott Schneeberger: Great. Appreciate that. The -- you just referenced SAP, and you mentioned CapEx may be high end of the range this year, working on some implementation in the Fire segment. Could you just speak to -- would that have a tail to next year? How much more -- I mean, are we going to see SAP projects for years to come? Just a sense of what you have on the spend side going forward.\nMichael Hansen: From a Fire perspective, the -- we are in the midst of the early innings of the implementation. And so we'll see some pressure in the Fire margins a little bit this year and a little bit next year. The synergies and the benefits don't come overnight. It's not a flip of the switch.  And so we -- just like we did with the Rental business and the First Aid business before that, we need to get onto the platform. It takes a little bit of time to get really good at using the platform, and then we really start to see the benefits accelerate just like we have in First Aid and Rental. Now that's a -- Fire is a smaller part of our business, but we certainly expect that those benefits will come.  As it relates to SAP, SAP is not -- it's a journey, right? And we are -- even though we are on SAP and will be for most of our business after the Fire Protection business gets on, there are constant things to learn from SAP. There are new initiatives in working with SAP and Google and Verizon that create new and different things. And so we look at this -- I think Todd's talked about it as one of his largest initiatives in terms of technology.  And it's a journey. It's not a flip of the switch. We turn on new systems here and there. So we're in the midst of that. We'll continue to invest in all of that. And our expectation is, it's going to continue to bring benefits into the future.\nTodd Schneider: Scott, to expand upon what Mike said, it is a journey. But when you're on that journey, there is benefits -- a long, long tail of benefits as well. And so we will continue to invest appropriately. We have relationships at a very high level in each of those organizations, and it's going to bear fruit for us. And that's part of our plan.  It's not easy. It's very challenging to go through these processes. But our team has shown the wherewithal to not only digest the change, but then leverage the opportunities that are in front of them.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: Todd, maybe you can just peel the onion back a little bit more on that margin on the First Aid side? I know you pointed to some sourcing and stuff like that. But it seems like the business has gone from mid-teens to low 20s in the course of the year. And I was wondering if there -- is there something to do with the route optimization?  Is it mix related, pricing? Anything else that operationally made such a significant difference? And after that, I have just a question on the labor environment for you guys yourselves? Are you -- is it easier for you guys to source people for what you need?\nTodd Schneider: Good question, Shlomo. Yes. Again, we love the First Aid business. But we're -- there's so many inputs to margin expansion, and we're leveraging them all. It starts with really good revenue growth, and we're seeing that. And that's in a big way because the value proposition is resonating, the products, the services that we offer in the marketplace, trying to attract and retain people is still challenging.  And people are trying to -- customers are trying to take really good care of their people. And we're benefiting from that and we're helping them accomplish exactly that. We're helping them run their business better. So that's helpful. The mix, as you know, has -- back during the pandemic, it was certainly so much more focused on safety products, a lot of clubs and a lot of sanitizer and those types of items.  And that has abated a bit, and the mix is back focused on First Aid and those types of products, more recurring revenue type. And yes, we are absolutely leveraging technology to make it easier to do business, but also to position our partners, our employee partners to provide more value to our customers.  And SmartTruck is a component of that. We did have a little bit of energy tailwind, 40 basis points. But as Mike cited earlier, not all that's because of the price at the pump. That is also because we are extracting the inefficiencies out. And we always talk around here about how we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop.  That's better for our customers, that's better for our employee partners. And all that is contributing. And then lastly, as I mentioned, our supply chain team has done a great job. They are leveraging the opportunities there. The larger we get in that business, the more leverage they have, and they're executing at a high level.  And -- so many inputs that are contributing to it, and -- but the -- what's really encouraging is, we see those having an opportunity to continue in the future. So certainly, no event is more of a process.\nShlomo Rosenbaum: And then just the labor environment on your own, like for the people that you're sourcing?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Pardon me. So from a labor standpoint, yes. As I mentioned earlier, it is easier, but not easy. And we are looking for great people. We want to hire not only people that are employed somewhere else, but happily employed, which is very challenging. And -- but we think we have a great employee value proposition as well.  And so we're highly focused on that. So -- but yes, easier than it was a year ago. But Shlomo, throughout my career, it's always been challenging. It's a little bit more challenging than it has been historically, but not what it once was a year ago or so.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Kartik Mehta from Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: I know there's a lot of questions and maybe thoughts on what happens to new sales. And I'm wondering, if you go back to kind of 2008, 2009 and hopefully never have that recession again. But if you look at new sales back then, how did Cintas perform for new sales? And any lessons from that you would take as we move forward?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Kartik. First of all, we're a really different company today than we were in 2008, 2009. We have a much more diversified customer base. We're now -- today 70% of our customers are service is providing, 30% are goods producing. We have significant verticals that we didn't have as well, health care, education, government.  So we think we're really well positioned for whenever the next recession is. And I remember '08, '09 because I was running the sales organization back then. And our value propositions still resonated with people, and we still sold new business. And we did so at attractive rates. As I mentioned, it's not always are we asking for new money. Sometimes it's just a redirection of those from somewhere else to us, not only in a -- maybe a direct competitor standpoint, but also they're purchasing clothing, they're purchasing items to take care of the facilities. So we think we're well positioned. I might also mention, you didn't ask specifically about it, but we love having a pristine balance sheet. And we think whenever the next recession is that might open up opportunities for us. And just the fact that we've -- our organization is focused on fighting through whatever the economic environment is, taking great care of our customers, taking great care of our employee partners.  And we've grown sales in 52 of the last 54 years. And we suspect that whatever the economic environment is, we believe we're going to be successful in it.\nMichael Hansen: Kartik, I might add, Todd might be a little modest. He was running that organization. It was a difficult environment, and he and the sales team exceeded their internal goals and really continued to show that value even in tough times, as Todd mentioned. And as he also talked about, our customer base is quite a bit broader than it was back then, and our sales team is a little bit different.  But the really good news is even back then, in the deepest, longest, broadest recession we'd seen in 100 years, we still sold a lot of new business. And it's a nice reflection of the value proposition that we have.\nKartik Mehta: Yes. And just as a follow-up, if you look at the First Aid and Safety business, you're doing really well in it. Is there a way you would look at to say a certain percentage is recurring? Do you consider a certain percentage recurring? I know you don't have long-term contracts in that business. But just from a demand standpoint and what you've seen from a historical standpoint?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Kartik, it's a good question. I don't have that in front of me, but I know it's -- it has returned much closer to historical or even higher as far as what we see from a repeat -- recurring type of revenue. And we want to provide value to the customers, whatever product services they want. It's just the nature of it, what we provide, whether it be First Aid supplies, access to AEDs, access to eyewash stations, access to clean water through our WaterBreak offering.  Those are all items that are really important to our customers more so today than they were pre-pandemic, and we think that, that trend will continue.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: So one of your competitors has been talking about using a strategy where they're incentivizing their drivers to cross-sell products. Can you talk about why you don't use that strategy? What the disadvantages are that you have found when doing that?\nTodd Schneider: Yes. Great question, Toni. I'm glad you asked because my first job 34 years ago was on the trucks. And we have been cross-selling our products via our -- we call them our service sales representatives. We've been cross-selling them since I started, and I'm sure it was in place well before I started as well. So we see -- the fact that we have 12,000 or so trucks that roll out of our parking lots every single day that are focused on taking great care of our customers, when they roll out of those parking lots, they're spending time in those businesses.  And they have eyes. They have ears, they have minds, and they see what's going on in those businesses, and they see opportunities. And it always has been and always will be a key component of our growth trajectory because we see that infrastructure as a real advantage. And we leverage it and make sure that those service providers, either they provide more products and services or they provide a lead to provide more products and services based upon the nature of the product that the customer might be interested in.\nMichael Hansen: And Toni, we've talked a lot about this over the last -- more than 10 years, we've got customers of all different sizes, verticals, et cetera. And so while we do certainly expect those service sales reps to continue to penetrate and sell, we recognize that some businesses are just more complex than others, are larger than others.  And so sometimes, there's a strategy to enhance that opportunity. And it might be through, for example, in health care. We have dedicated people that really do reach out to the decision makers. So it's not just the service sales rep, but it's also other people that have relationship responsibilities that are looking for those new and different penetration opportunities.  It's not as simple just to simply say we're going to go in and have a service sales rep or an SSR go into each customer and sell it, all customers are so different. And so we need a strategy that can attack all types of customers, and we do.\nTodd Schneider: Toni, we know that our customer satisfaction scores are really good. And in large part because they really like our people. They like our service providers, our frontline service providers. And we leverage that. And whether it be, as Mike mentioned, a more -- a smaller type customer, we can cross-sell via the service provider. A larger one that's a little bit more complicated.  There might be a need for some air cover, for some help there. But nevertheless, that's always been an important component of our strategy and always will be.\nToni Kaplan: That is super helpful. I wanted to also ask, I think the last few calls, you've been talking more about technology and investments and things of this sort. Are there any, I guess, technology capabilities that you think you still need? Will -- that you either are getting through hiring technology people or maybe even doing M&A? Like -- and maybe you've done it, maybe you still have yet to do, but are there any technology capabilities that you need that basically would be helped through M&A or hiring internally new technology people?\nTodd Schneider: Yes, Toni, great question. So we are always on the lookout for those opportunities. We think we have a really strong technology platform that we can build off of. But we know that the answer for what our customers are interested in is with spending time with our customers, and our employee partners are the ones who discern those opportunities.  So we're always asking now, how do we make it easier to do business, what -- is there any void? And frankly, that's where most of our investments have come from, that information, been trying to make it easier to do business with us. So we're always in search of trying to be a world-class service provider, but having an incredibly strong technology platform that makes it easier for our customers to do business with us, that makes it easier for our employee partners, our service providers to create a world-class experience for those customers. So yes, we're in search of whether it's -- we buy it or we bolt it on to our current platform or we created ourselves, all of those are of interest to us, and we'll be moving forward.\nOperator: At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley for closing remarks.\nJared Mattingley: Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our second quarter of fiscal '24 financial results in December. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
