Later you will have an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded should you need anything. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Vince Klinges, CFO of American Software. Please begin.\nVincent Klinges: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to American Software's third quarter of fiscal 2024 earnings call. with me, on the call with me is Allan Dow, President and CEO of American Software. Allan will provide some opening remarks, and then I'll review the numbers, but first our Safe Harbor statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among other things, our business strategy and growth strategy. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of this date. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified and are beyond our control. Future developments and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by statements made on this call. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes and uncertainty in general economic conditions, the growth rate of the market for our products and services, the timely availability and market acceptance of these products and services, the effect of competitive products and pricing and other competitive pressures, and the irregular and unpredictable pattern of revenues. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan for opening remarks.\nAllan Dow: Thank you, Vince. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter was one of the busiest periods we've seen in the last year and a half, particularly as we entered into the new calendar year. Our clients and prospects are reengaging on transformational supply chain initiatives that have been in the works for some time, and while we continue to experience some delays in the larger deals, the demand environment appears to be improving. Against this backdrop, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and we remain on track to deliver the fiscal year 2024 guidance we provided last quarter. Before I review the third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to provide an update on the integration of Garvis, which we've rebranded as DemandAI+ and represents the next generation demand intelligence platform. Our teams have been fully integrated, and we're actively collaborating on both sales opportunities and our product roadmap. From a go-to-market perspective, we've continued to leverage pilots to gain access to new strategic accounts. However, the primary emphasis with both new prospects and our existing client community is to drive towards rapid deployment of DemandAI+ into full production use as quickly as possible. We expect to close several longer-term engagements in the fourth quarter, which resulted from winding down the previous pilot engagements and converting them to long-term contracts with broader production deployments. In addition, our pipeline of lift and shifts has increased dramatically as we continue to drive awareness of our AI native demand forecasting capabilities and the first production-worthy use of generative AI capabilities to streamline decision-making for supply chain planning across our client community. In fact, we've already seen some existing agility accounts adopt DemandAI+. One is a rapid-growing U.S.-based coffee brand with a highly promoted product line. The DAI+ solution will help them better manage the spikes in demand they often experience and determine the most cost-effective promotions to profitably grow their company. We are encouraged by this early success and believe that DemandAI+ will play a critical role in the migration of our existing clients to the cloud in the coming years. Turning back to our third-quarter results, we're pleased to see another sequential uptick in our backlog as our clients and prospects began to reengage on previously stock hold initiatives. Our revenues largely tracked our internal expectations, but we note that the declines in our maintenance and service revenues, respectively, were exacerbated by the divestiture of our transportation group and the lower utilization during the holiday periods. From a profit standpoint, our adjusted EBITDA margin held steady on a sequential basis, despite the inclusion of Garvis' expenses for the full quarter and some additions to our product development team. Overall, we continue to see signs of improvement in the demand environment. We have a robust pipeline for entering Q4, leaving us poised for a strong finish to our fiscal year. Our guidance for fiscal 2024 remains unchanged, and we continue to expect to see recurring revenue between $85 million and $88 million, adjusted EBITDA between $14.5 million and $16 million, and total revenue between $100 million to $104 million. Given our performance to date, though, we anticipate reaching at least the midpoint on these respective guidance ranges. Finally, I want to provide an update on other initiatives that have been discussed previously. We bought back over $5 million in stock during the third quarter and have now repurchased all of the shares remaining under our prior authorization. Yesterday, we announced that our Co-founder, Executive Chairman, and Treasurer, Jim Edenfield, retired from the Board as well as his role as the company's treasurer. After over 50 years of leadership for the company, Jim was not only a steadfast leader of our company, which we'll be forever grateful, but he was also a visionary for our industry as a whole. We appreciate Jim's willingness to continue as an advisor to our Board and to me. Jim Miller, who has been our Board member since 2002, accepted the role as Chairman and along with other Board members, will guide us through the strategic initiatives we had previously laid out. Furthermore, in regards to our dual class structure, we remain engaged with our Class B shareholder to consider various options. Jim's retirement has no impact on the previously announced timeframe for that work. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vince who will provide details of our financial results.\nVincent Klinges: Thanks, thanks Alan. Before I discuss our results in more detail, I want to remind everyone that due to the divestiture in the second quarter of our IT staffing business unit, the proven method, our financial statements have been re-cast to show the proven method as discontinuing operations. So our discussion of the current and comparable periods will focus only on the continuing operations from this point on. The total revenues for the third quarter came in at $25.5 million, a decrease of 7% from $27.4 million, same period last year, and it's primarily due to lower revenues from professional services and maintenance. Our subscription fees increased 9% year-over-year to $14.1 million from $13 million in the same period last year. Our software license revenue was $0.3 and that compares to $1 million in the prior year period. Our professional services and other revenues decreased 28% to $3.4 million from $4.8 million the same period a year ago, and that's reflecting lower utilization during our holiday period and our decision to offload more services to our SI partners. Our maintenance revenues declined 11% year-over-year to $7.7 million, reflecting the normal fall-off rate for the quarter, as well as divestiture of our transportation group, which reduced our maintenance revenues by approximately $250,000 for the quarter. Our total recurring revenues comprised of both subscription and maintenance fees represented 86% of our total revenues for the third quarter, and that's up from 79% in the same period last year. Our gross margin was 64% for the current period compared to 66% in the same period last year. Our subscription fee margin was 65% in the current period compared to 69% in the same period last year, but if you exclude the non-cash amortization of a tangible expense of $1.1 million, our subscription gross margin was 72% in both the current and prior year period. The amortization of a tangible expense was $425,000 in the same period last year. License fee margin was 80% compared to 65% in the same period last year. Our gross margins for services decreased to 21% from 26% last year due to lower revenues, primarily from a dramatically quieter holiday period this year. Our maintenance margin was 81% for both the current and prior year period. Our gross R&D expenses were 18% of total revenues for the current period, and that compares to 16% in the same period last year, as we filled open rolls during the quarter and had a full quarter of expenses from our acquisition of Garvis. Our sales and marketing expenses were 20% of revenues for the current period, and that compares to 18% in the same period last year. Our G&A expenses were 23% of total revenues for the current quarter, and that compares to 21% last year. On a GAAP basis, our operating income was $0.8 million for this quarter, compared to $2.7 million in the same period last year, primarily due to lower revenues and also the costs related to the Garvis acquisition. Our net income was $4.1 million, our earnings diluted share of $0.12, compared to net income of $3.2 million or $0.09 per diluted share, including a net income gain of $1.4 million related to the sale of our transportation group. On an adjusted basis, which excludes non-cash amortization of intangible expenses related to acquisitions and stock-based compensation expense, our adjusted operating expenses was $3.6 million, and that compares to $4.3 million same period last year. Our adjusted EBITDA was $4 million, and that compares to $4.8 million same period last year and adjusted net income of $6.4 million, or adjusted earnings diluted share of $0.19 for the third quarter, and that compares to adjusted net income of $4.4 million or $0.13 in the same period last year. Looking at international revenues, this quarter was approximately 22% of revenues, that's up from 20% last year. Our remaining performance obligation, we exited the quarter with RPO, or what we call is backlog of $119 million. Looking at our balance sheet, our financial position remained strong with total and cash investments of $78.2 million at the end of the quarter. During the quarter we paid $3.8 million in dividends and repurchased over $0.5 million shares at a total cost of $5.4 million. Our day sales outstanding at the end of January 31, 2024 was 86 days, and that is down from 101 days, same period last year. Turning to the 2024 outlook, our guidance remains, as Alan said, our guidance remains unchanged and reflects only our continuing operation and we believe we will achieve the midpoint of these ranges is the most likely scenario given our year-to-date performance. So we anticipate revenues in the range of $100 million to $104 million, including recurring revenue $85 million to $88 million, and adjusted EBITDA we anticipate in the range of $14.5 million to $16 million. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to any questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And our first question comes from Willow Miller [ph].\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, I'm Willow Miller. I'm on for Matt. Thanks for taking our question. So starting off, how are sales cycles here today? It sounds like they're improving similar to last quarter and are there any changes on how customers are thinking about budgets for 2024?\nAllan Dow: Willow, thank you for joining us and thank you for the questions. The sales cycles are still extended beyond where they were in years past. It's really the scrutiny on budgets and whatnot, but we are seeing them start to break loose now. So I think as we move forward, the time has already passed on many of those projects and we're trying to get them up and running now, but as we're anticipating with the energy in the market right now that as we get into the later in the spring and into the summer, that we'll have seen those sales cycles start to close up now because people are moving a little bit more quickly. In regards to budget, very encouraging; much more activity going on this time period than we were coming into the holiday season, say six months ago. Things have really picked up and we're quite excited about the growth in our pipeline that we're seeing now as a result of that. So really positive trend for the future.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's helpful. Just one last question; so earlier this month, you released a press release about adding Gen I capabilities to legality. So just wanted to know what the goal is here. Is it to stay competitive and keep up to date with technology? Or is it to monetize it longer term if there's enough value added to customers?\nAllan Dow: It's tremendous value add actually and it's a leapfrog. We were first to market with production ready capabilities around generative AI. That generative AI, many of us are familiar when we talk to our phone or maybe talk to our car, get directions and that sort of thing. It's a similar technology. We're applying it specifically to the supply chain planning. At its beginning stages, at its lowest level, what generative AI brings is more insights, more quickly to a broader community. So the ability to make decisions faster come as a result of it. Some of the same information you could get by pounding on the keyboard, you can get through the same method, but it's much more intuitive, much easier and it opens up the insights that are capable through our system to a much broader audience. So it's more inclusive around the decision making, strategic decisions that need to be made around the applications. We look at generative AI in four phases. The first phase is insights, and that's kind of the phase we're in now, where people are really starting to get their arms around it. Phase two will be directed activity. We're starting to introduce that into the platform today. Directed activity helps now where a user can issue a command or request an action. After that, we move to more autonomous capabilities. We have autonomous capabilities today, but directed through the generative AI capabilities and ultimately really starting to automate many more things through user interaction and so that would be stage four. Stage one is available today. Stage two is coming to the marketplace, really starting to come into play and stage three and four are a little horizon oriented. So it will be breakthrough technology that will radically change the way people use supply chain planning applications.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Galinko.\nMatthew Galinko: Hey. Congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my questions. I think you touched on transformational deals beginning to move again. So can you add a little bit more color on just how quickly they're moving along and whether you expect those to, and you to get across the finish line in the next four quarters? And what do you think specifically contributed to them starting to move again?\nAllan Dow: Yeah, I think confidence. Matthew, thank you for the question, first of all. Confidence in the economy stabilizing. Every day you wake up, it swings one way or the other. Interest rates are going to go down, then they're going to stabilize, and they're going up, but overall, what we're seeing, what we're hearing people talk about, our clients, our prospects talk about, is a stabilization around their business and continued improvement going forward. So their willingness to commit to a bigger investment, willing to put more resources at the table to accomplish more, is really what's stimulating. The need for a transformational project hasn't changed, but their nervousness about the kind of investment it takes to really tackle something like that, they were very anxious about that, so the pace had slowed. So yes, we're seeing an uptick. We see more of those projects coming into the pipeline and over the next four quarters, certainly we anticipate that they'll come to fruition and we'll get started on those projects, start implementing them, and get more and more of that activity going. So nice add-ons, nice lift and shift capability, nice several capabilities, projects going on, but then these transformational ones kicking in will help us in the long term as well.\nMatthew Galinko: Thank you. And as a follow-up, you just mentioned lift and shift, and I think you said that it accelerated. Again, is that partially just confidence in your customers coming back in, or is there some element of your new AI approach and sort of cloud-native assets, opening more opportunities to shift legacy to kind of premise to cloud? Just maybe talk a little bit about that.\nAllan Dow: Yeah, there's really three things that are driving it right now. The predominance of it is the new capabilities we brought to the market, including DAI+, DemandAI+, bringing new capabilities that are only available in the cloud. So that's been an incentive for more and more clients to look at that and say it's time. So that's probably representing half of that growth, just the new capabilities that are available, the in-generative AI capabilities only available in the cloud. Out of the remaining 50%, another 25% is the budget that we just talked about. People now have the -- they wanted to move. They wanted to get an update. They wanted to get some new technology, but now have access to funds. So that's probably helped to stimulate another quarter of the overall pipeline growth. The other quarter is coming from the continued exposure to risk that our clients have in housing their own applications in the data environment. It's quite shocking, the number of those incidents that have come about in the marketplace, not necessarily directly against our applications but in their IT data center, which gave them a lot of heartburn and so more and more of that is coming to the table now where clients are basically saying, we need to be out of this business. We need to have professional management, a more robust data center, better administration and stay up to date and that's stimulating some of the demand as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anja Soderstrom.\nAnja Soderstrom: Hi, thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the progress in the quarter. I'm just curious with you saying that the deals have been starting to lose up, but you say that larger deals are taking longer. How should we think about fiscal 2025 and beyond in terms of that? Could we expect revenue growth to accelerate helped by those larger deals coming through or…\nAllan Dow: Yeah, it's early in that phase now. It's only February, but for fiscal '25 for us starts in May and runs out for another 12 after that, but we're anticipating the same thing, Anya. We're seeing the budgets that are freeing up. We're seeing that people are serious about it. Many clients are on a calendar year, so they are now just getting access to those budgets and kicking off the projects in anticipation of launching them and starting spending in calendar year 2024, which would predominantly fall into our fiscal year 2025. So we're quite bullish about it. We think that the momentum is coming around as we anticipated for the spring and into the summer and are looking forward to a robust year, a very busy year ahead of us.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay, thank you. And in terms of the Gen AI, and you said that we're kind of in the first phase there, going into the second out of four phases. Do you think that might be a roadblock in terms of the sales cycle? Your customer wants to wait and see how that pans out before they make any decisions?\nAllan Dow: No, I don't think so. So it's such a novel and unique capability that people are clamoring for it. It's a natural progression anyway. What we're seeing in the marketplace is that with the excitement, there's a little bit of fear and concern. One of the things we've done very successfully is to put a wrapper around it to give them assurance that our generative AI within our application is not going to be out surfing the World Wide Web and coming up with risky factors around that sort of thing or exposing their data in any way to the outside world. So we've given our clients confidence around that. Now they want to get started. They want to get a feel for what this means, build momentum and build credibility and trust, and then be willing to take the next step. So the evolution of the technology and the ability for people to absorb it and really understand it and appreciate and build the trust is going in lockstep. So we don't anticipate any delay in deals because of the evolution of this technology now.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay, thank you. And I'm sorry if you mentioned this, but you said you exhausted the authorized buyback program. Did you approve a new one or do you expect that to be approved or how are you thinking about buybacks going forward?\nAllan Dow: We haven't made any decision about what to do next. We just completed that right as the holidays were coming together and wrapped up the last one that had been approved for many years now. We had the availability to make that buyback happen. So we'll take that up in the new fiscal year and consider all possibilities. As we said, we're still sitting on a healthy balance sheet with cash available just short of $80 million and in the new year, new fiscal year, we'll make some decisions about how best to deploy that.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay, and as a follow-up to that, what do you see in the main [ph] market now?\nAllan Dow: Interesting market. It's kind of mixed right now of what's out there. There's some interesting things we would take an eye to, but we don't have any specific announcements around at this time. We've not exited that market. We're still interested and we're still engaged and when we find the right thing and get mutual agreement on that, we'll make some announcements about that next move.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Zach Cummins.\nZach Cummins: Alan, I was curious in terms of your go-to-market strategy with Garvis now rebranded as Demand AI, can you talk about just the progression of going through these initial pilots and it sounds like some of these are on the verge of committing to pretty substantial upsizes and longer-term contracts. So do you get a sense of the potential uplift you can see if you're able to sign kind of a full longer-term contract with DemandAI with some of these new prospects?\nAllan Dow: Yeah. So at the point of acquisition of Garvis, that team was very successfully building a book of clients and getting momentum and proof points with the product in the marketplace using the pilot strategy. Very effective from a startup standpoint. What we're seeing is many of those pilots had already matured to the point where we are actively engaged in finalizing contracts for the long-term. Pretty substantial upside in those opportunities when we convert those to long-term because the pilots weren't really built to manage the entire enterprise. They were maybe a product line or a few product lines or a segment, a division of the business or maybe a regional area or something of that nature. So the upside on it, Zach, as you said, is quite significant and coming about, we anticipate that we'll have some of those transactions completed in our fourth quarter, more of them coming on the heels of that in the first quarter. Some of those clients are substantial, complex, can be difficult to negotiate contracts with. So we just really got engaged with them at the beginning, at the end of the calendar year last year, beginning of this year, and rolling up our sleeves and diving in. So we're quite excited about that. We've retained that model. We see it's quite effective. Many clients, particularly larger companies that have significant investments, maybe in any ARP enterprise like an SAP or something like that, are hesitant to bring new applications in. So this is proving to be a good model to penetrate into the account, get some proof points, build momentum, and then grow it from within. So we like the model, but we are only doing so when there's a clear opportunity to develop a long-term relationship. We're not in the business of running pilots for an extended period of time. So we're really looking at that as a strategy. So yes, we see that as a whole new market and channel and approach to the market, go-to-market for us, something we've never done before, but we've learned from that team that came in from Garvis, and we're seeing some advantages in keeping that model in place.\nZach Cummins: Got it. That's great to hear and encouraging on that front to potentially secure some longer-term opportunities. Final question for me, Allan, is just really around the pipeline. Can you give us a sense of the size of the pipeline versus maybe where you were a year ago going into this point? And kind of give us a little bit of understanding of the mix of lift and shift opportunities versus completely new engagements within that pipeline?\nAllan Dow: Yeah, I would say the growth, well, there's really three areas that are driving the pipeline. One is the lift and shift that we referenced. It's representing about a third of the new opportunities that are coming into the pipeline. The other is to extend the relationship with existing clients, so those that are already in the cloud, that we're adding new functionality, expanding to new regions, new user communities, new product lines, something along that nature. So it's an extension of what we currently have. As I mentioned in my earlier talk, for example, we had DemandAI+ sold to an existing client that was already in the cloud. So it was an extension to their footprint and then, of course, the new clients that are coming in, those opportunities are typically larger by a factor of two or three times, an add-on or a lift and shift. So it doesn't take a lot of those to add to the pipeline, but it's roughly three equal parts that are helping us build pipeline. If we look at our pipeline over where we were this time last year, we're up about 40%. So it's pretty substantial. So we're seeing a growth in our pipeline month after month after month. We've been seeing that for the last three or four months now. So it's quite encouraging. It wasn't just one pop and then running off of that. It's continuing to grow every month as we march forward.\nZach Cummins: Got it. Well, sounds great, and best of luck in your fiscal 4Q.\nAllan Dow: Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] There are no additional questions at this time. I'd like to now turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks.\nAllan Dow: All right. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We really appreciate the time you spent with us. Some great questions. Thank you for those as well and we look forward to chatting with you again someday in the near future. Have a good afternoon.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded and that I will be standing by should you need any assistance.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Allan for opening remarks.\nAllan Dow: Thank you, Vince. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Our second quarter was transformative in many respects and we believe we've laid the foundation for sustained growth and margin expansion over the long-term. First and foremost, we completed the acquisition of Garvis a disruptive SaaS start-up that developed an AI-native demand forecasting system, leveraging generative AI to enrich the user experience. We have rebranded the Garvis product as DemandAI+, which has replaced the current Demand components within the Logility platform. As many of you know, Logility invented supply chain statistical forecasting five decades ago and we believe that DemandAI+ is the next-generation Demand intelligence platform that will launch a new paradigm of supply chain planning. The technology has already been validated with over 70 implementations, including deployments at some of the largest consumer goods package companies in the world. With the inclusion of DemandAI+, we expect to increase our acquisition of new customers, particularly at the large strategic account level and to accelerate the pace of cloud conversions within our existing client community. Since we completed the acquisition, we've signed contracts for a dozen new deployments of DAI+, including one of our existing cloud clients who is now upgrading to DAI+. While we have focused intently on identifying opportunities to extend the breadth and depth of our supply chain planning capabilities for the past several quarters, we've also evaluated our existing assets to ensure we can benefit fully from the investments we are making. In the second quarter, we were pleased to find a strategic fit for our IT staffing and consulting services business and we completed the sale of The Proven Method in mid-September. Subsequent to quarter-end, we also sold our transportation business. These divestitures align our focus on being a pure-play supply chain software leader and will reduce the volatility in our results, while enhancing our growth and margin profile. As we believe the actions we've taken will create significant shareholder value, we also implemented a share repurchase program, and we're active in buying back shares during Q2 with substantial success. Vince will provide some further details on this in his commentary. Next, I'd like to review our second quarter results and provide an update on our current outlook for the year. Our second quarter results reflected slower activity as we experienced over the past year. However, we're encouraged to see several previously delayed opportunities finally across the finish line, resulting in bookings performance more akin to our strength we saw in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. As many of our deals closed late in the quarter, the improvement is not readily apparent in our reported results for Q2, but is reflected in the sequential uptick in our backlog. We remain cautiously optimistic that our clients and prospects are adapting to the economic headwinds that have delayed their investments in technology over the past year and we look forward to building upon our progress this quarter during our seasonally stronger second half. Our pipeline remains solid and has expanded as we continue to increase market awareness of our new DemandAI+ solution. As we look back on our first half performance, we had a slow start to the year due to the ongoing economic uncertainty in our usual seasonality. Our sales cadence improved as expected in Q2, but the timing of the deal closures limited the revenue we expected to recognize. Our revised guidance outlook for fiscal 2024, therefore, reflects the combined impact of our two business divestitures, the acquisition of Garvis and the real run rate based on the first half actual results. For fiscal 2024, we now expect recurring revenue to be between $85 million and $88 million. Our adjusted EBITDA to be between $14.5 million and $16 million and total revenue to be between $100 million and $104 million. Finally, I wanted to provide a brief update on our other initiatives we discussed during last quarter's call. Although buyer interest in our headquarters was high, the increase in interest rates has dampened the commercial real estate market and we are no longer pursuing a sale of the property. We'll revisit that topic once the market conditions stabilize. Finally, regarding our dual-class structure, we remain engaged with our Class B shareholder to consider various options with the goal of completing this process by the end of our fiscal year as previously stated. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vince, who will provide details on our financial results.\nVincent Klinges: Thanks, Allan. Before I discuss our results in more detail, I want to note that due to the divestiture of our IT consulting business unit, The Proven Method, our financial statements have been recast to show The Proven Method as discontinued operations. In the second quarter of fiscal year '24, The Proven Method generated $1.7 million in revenue and $78,000 in adjusted EBITDA prior to the closing of the sale in September. And for the first half of the year of '24, it generated $4.9 million in revenue and $0.3 million in adjusted EBITDA. Our discussion of the current and comparable periods will focus only on our continuing operations from this point. So total revenues of $25.7 million decreased 6% to $27.3 million in the same period compared to the same period last year. Our subscription fees increased 8% year-over-year to $13.4 million but declined slightly from the prior quarter. Recall that in Q1, we benefited from approximately $0.3 million in catch-up revenue that did not reoccur in Q2. That, along with our normal quarterly churn, contributed to a sequential decrease in subscription fees. As Allan mentioned, our bookings performance in Q2 was much improved from the prior quarter with many of the deals closing late in the quarter. However, we were unable to recognize much of the revenue associated with it. We expect to see sequential growth in our subscription fees this quarter. Our license fee revenue came in at $0.2 million compared to $0.7 million in the prior year period. Our professional services and other revenues decreased 26% to $4 million from $5.4 million in the year ago period, and that's reflecting longer sales cycles as we experienced over the past year and a conscious decision to offload more services to our SI partners. Our maintenance revenue declined 8% year-over-year to $8.1 million, reflecting a normal falloff rate this quarter. Our total recurring revenues comprised of subscription and maintenance fees represented 84% of total revenues in the second quarter, and that compares to 78% in the same period last year. Looking at gross margin, it was 64% for the current period compared to 66% in the prior year period. Our subscription fee margin was 66% in the current period compared to 67% in the prior year period. But if you include the noncash amortization intangibles of $767,000 in the current quarter, the gross margin was 71% for both the current period and the prior year period. We had amortization of cap software of $464,000 in the same period last year. License fee margin was 59% compared to 86% in the same period last year. Services margin decreased to 29% from 36% in the last period and again due to lower revenues. Our maintenance margin was 79% for the current quarter, and that compares to 82% in the prior year period. Gross R&D spend was 17% of total revenues for the current period, and that compares to 16% in the prior year period. Sales and marketing expenses were 21% of revenues for the current quarter, and that compares to 19% in the prior year period. G&A expenses were 21% of total revenues for the current quarter and that is down from 22% in the last year period. So on a GAAP basis, our operating income was $1.2 million this quarter compared to $2.6 million in the same quarter a year ago, and that's primarily due to lower revenues and the costs related to Garvis acquisition, of which $0.3 million were onetime charges and $0.5 million of intangible amortization costs. Net income was $0.6 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.02 compared to net income of $1.9 million or $0.06 in earnings compared to last year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes noncash amortization of intangible expenses related to acquisitions and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted operating income decreased 13% to $3.6 million compared to $4.2 million in the same period last year. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 13% to 4.1% from 4.7% in the same quarter last year. We note that the acquisition of Garvis reduced our adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of this year by approximately $700,000 of which, as I mentioned, $300 million relates to nonrecurring transaction costs. So adjusted net income decreased 9% to $2.9 million or adjusted earnings diluted share of $0.08 for the second quarter and that compares to adjusted net income of $3.2 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.09 in the same period last year. International revenues for this quarter was approximately 21% of total revenues compared to 19% last year. We exited this quarter with remaining performance obligation or RPO which we refer to as backlog of $113 million, while our total RPO was down 8% from the prior year period, due to the slowdown in bookings activity over the past year. We are pleased to see a return to sequential backlog growth this quarter. Also, during the quarter, as Allan mentioned, we repurchased our stock approximately 431,000 shares under the stock buyback authorization for a total of $4.8 million of cash. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we purchased another 241,000 shares for $2.7 million. So we have approximately 274,000 shares remaining on the stock buyback program. Looking at our balance sheet. Our financial position remains strong with cash and investments of approximately $83.9 million at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we acquired Garvis for $25 million in cash and paid $3.8 million in dividends and repurchased approximately 430,000 shares for a total cost of $4.8 million. Our days sales outstanding was approximately 72 days for the current period, and that compares to 78 days in the same period last year. Turning to the fiscal '24 outlook. Our guidance now reflects only our continuing operations. We note that the original outlook for the year included $15 million in revenue and assumed mid-single-digit EBITDA margin for our discontinuing operations. So for fiscal year '24, we anticipate revenue in the range of $100 million to $104 million, including recurring revenue of $85 million to $88 million. And for adjusted EBITDA, we anticipate a range of $14.5 million or $16 million. Our revised outlook assumes the recent sale of our transportation solutions largely offsets the revenue contribution from the acquisition of Garvis. And we anticipate Garvis' impact on our adjusted EBITDA to remain similar to Q2 level for the remainder of the year. We continue to expect Garvis to be accretive in the next 12 months. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matt Pfau.\nKiran Kuttickat: Hi. It's Kiran Kuttickat on for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. First, can you add some color on the change to guidance and the impact from divestitures versus any macro expectations that may have changed?\nAllan Dow: The majority of the adjustment is related to the divestitures, particularly on the revenue and the earnings hit is a big, a fairly good piece of that. The macro, there was an impact from the first half of the year, early first quarter, that had a slight impact on the adjustment, but not as material as obviously the divestitures. So we wanted to make sure we got that reflected in the forward look.\nKiran Kuttickat: Got it. And then how are customers thinking about budgets for 2024? And did you see any worsening in sales cycles?\nAllan Dow: It's mixed results, Kiran. Thank you. Great question. We feel really good about the budgets coming together. Of course, budgets don't mean spend. There's two layers to that process. One is to get a budget in place first that anticipated spend and then to get the actual release for funds as they approach and start to kick off the project. But we're encouraged by the amount of budgeting activity that's out there, the number of projects that are coming in. Pipeline is looking more robust for next year. I think there still is a lot of sentiment in many of the industries around the consumer goods space. Let's see how the year ends kind of sentiment. We're in that season now. Of course, the sales have kicked off. Black Friday will be next week. Within the next three or four weeks, companies will start to see what's happening and get a real sense of that. But we're encouraged in the anticipated spend for next year. So feel good about that. We've not seen a material change in the sales cycles, the time frame. We actually have seen some projects get accelerated, which was a bit of a surprise in some areas, where they know they're just going to need to make those investments, and this is the season to get started, get prepared. They get projects organized and then they kick into full swing after the holidays. The supply chain part of it is kind of wrapping up after you get past into December. The supply chain work is almost done. If it's not in the store by then, it's going to make it into the store. So supply chain teams can refocus their energy then. So mixed environment, but positive outlook for the future, Kiran. Great question.\nKiran Kuttickat: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nAllan Dow: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from Zach Cummins.\nZachary Cummins: Hi. Good afternoon, Allan and Vince. Thanks for taking my questions. Can you provide a little more insight into the updated recurring revenue guidance that you gave for the year? Is that more so just the timing of deal closings that's impacting the revenue contribution we're going to see? Or any other assumptions that you're baking into there would be helpful.\nAllan Dow: Yes. It is a little bit from early in the year, but mostly the second quarter was really back-end loaded. We were very, very busy right up to the finish line, the last few days of the quarter, actually, that we're bringing those projects in. We've now kicked those projects off. They were anxious even though the legal process and the procurement process delayed them a bit. They were anxious. We were prepared and our teams hit the ground. In fact, first of November, we were out on the street making those projects happen. So the revenue is up and flowing now. We're going to see a real positive impact on that in our third quarter results. You'll see the full impact of those deals coming together for us. So we'll see. We're anticipating a real strong uplift in third quarter.\nZachary Cummins: Understood. That's helpful. And could you go a little deeper into some of the feedback you've gotten since you've acquired Garvis and started rolling it out to some of the existing customers in your base. It seems like pretty great product to really accelerate the transition from some of your on-premise customers to the cloud. So just curious of the feedback so far and how you're thinking about using that as a tool for migrations within the existing base?\nAllan Dow: It's been phenomenal, really. It's -- on a couple of fronts. Number one, the client reception has been exceptionally strong. It's been a bit of a relief, actually, for some of our clients with all the buzz around AI and native AI and generative AI. And we've got CEOs and CFOs that are telling our supply chain teams, you got to go out and find us some of that, whatever it is. They don't know what it is, but they got to go find it. And so our supporters and the client base are saying, thank you for helping it make it easy for me because now it's inside the platform that I have today. And with an upgrade and expansion and maybe a lift and shift to the cloud, we can get at what our leadership team is asking for, and we can bring it to the marketplace. The results have been phenomenal. The results we're seeing a 20% to 25%, 30% improvement in forecast accuracy, which now translates for our clients into millions of dollars of savings. So it's been phenomenal. And that's in comparison to our prior applications, our competitors' prior applications, Excel spreadsheets, anything in the marketplace, we'll stand toe to toe with. So the results that our clients are achieving with the system itself has been phenomenal. The generative AI, the ability to have human interaction directly with the application, get insights from the application, has been eye-opening, particularly for the executives. It's fun and exciting for the user community. But for the executives to be able to self-serve and get the kind of insights they need first-hand to make decisions about the direction of the supply chain, has absolutely blown them away. We've got an executive leadership team that's come together just really wanting to help us. They want to adopt, and they want to help us drive the executives out there and who is a universal hand raising. Who wants to help us continue to proliferate this capability across the platform? Just wildly exciting at the executive level, that's not at the user level. And as I mentioned in my earlier comments, we didn't have a lot of runway from the time we signed that contract started to onboard and we ended up with a dozen contract signed during the quarter. In less than a quarter, it was less than half of the quarter that we had available to us. So that was very exciting. So the reception in the marketplace has been strong and even the interest and the conversions. We got one nailed down already of an upgrade and we've got many more lift and shift opportunities on the forefront for that application, just really stimulating that demand. If you can get a 20% forecast error improvement, that pays for itself as far as the lift and shift goes. And lift and shift is a little bit pricey, but it's value-oriented now, so it's going to really accelerate that. So probably a much longer answer, Zach, than you expected maybe on that question. But thank you for the question. It was a good one.\nZachary Cummins: Always appreciate it, Allan, and all the incremental color there. And just two more clarifying questions. Vince, when it comes to the guidance, I think you said $15 million was assumed at the start of the year. Is that just related to the proven method? Or is that also to your most recent divestiture as well?\nVincent Klinges: That actually was just The Proven Method. So there was an additional $1 million, $1.5 million.\nZachary Cummins: Got it. Helpful. Got it. Got it. That's helpful. And then final question for me is, obviously, Garvis is a slight drag on margins here for the next couple of quarters. But just the remaining business, what's really the right way to think about just what the gross margin profile and the potential adjusted EBITDA margin profile should be for your remaining business now?\nVincent Klinges: From a gross margin point of view, we do see incremental improvement in the subscription fees, but the overall gross margin has been hit by the decline in the services gross margin. But that should mitigate after in the back half of the year, we'll start to see that improve a little bit. And then with subscription margins improving a little bit too, we should start to see a tick up on the overall gross margin, which means that should translate into adjusted EBITDA, operating EBITDA of going from 15%. Right now, it's about 14%, 15%, going up to 16%, 17%, 18% somewhere around there by the end of the year.\nZachary Cummins: Got it. That's helpful. Well, thanks again for taking my questions and best of luck with the rest of the quarter.\nAllan Dow: Thank you, Zach. Have a good evening.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Anja Soderstrom.\nAnja Soderstrom: Thank you for taking my question. So you were very busy towards the end of the second quarter. How has that trended in the third quarter so far?\nAllan Dow: Well, we're pretty early in the third quarter, given that we've only got 15 days in so far, but we've got some progress already. We had a little bit of spill-over from the second quarter into the third quarter already. It's a nice quarter. We actually -- this is traditionally our strongest quarter, Anja. We have essentially three closing events, milestones. We have -- we have the end of the calendar year where budget money is available, so people are scrambling right now if they want to get projects kicked off. We have new money available coming in the fiscal new fiscal year, lining up with a calendar year. So early January. And then we have the -- the unnatural thing that the software companies have always done is that you always get business contracts signed at the end of the fiscal quarter. So that comes at the end of January for us. So that's always resulted in a strong third quarter for us. Almost every year, if you go back for 20 years that Vince and I have been kicking around here, we see the normal trend. It's not every year, but the majority of the year's third quarter is the best. And -- so we're seeing some of that going on right now. We're seeing those projects get going. And we added quite a bit that spilled over from the quarter that we thought might have been closable in second quarter that's spilled into third. And we've just seen an uptick in overall pipeline from two aspects. One, the Garvis acquisition, we think, has had a -- we know we have the measures for it. It's had a pretty healthy impact on our overall pipeline and then just the New Year start. So we're up double-digit growth in our pipeline over where we were a quarter ago and probably a 20% plus increase over where we were last year at this time in the overall pipeline. So it's a pretty healthy environment we're sitting in. But now we just need the economy to shore up, strengthen up and people willing to put money on the table, and we'll get these projects rolling.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay. Thank you. That was all for me.\nAllan Dow: All right. Thank you so much. Have a good evening.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matthew Galinko.\nMatthew Galinko: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Given the acquisition you announced this quarter and some of the investment in repurchase, can you just maybe revisit your thinking about capital allocation particularly through the balance of the year? Is M&A still something you're thinking about? Or are buybacks kind of the priority for the foreseeable future?\nAllan Dow: Well, for the rest of the calendar year, we're going to run out of runway pretty quickly. We're going to -- we're allowing the buyback plan to continue at the current pace. One, we could project that by Christmas, we'll have exhausted the current authorization. So we're going to let that one play out, for sure. We're so close to the finish line on that. We couldn't take an action on it anyway until late next week. So that one will play out. We are still in the market for acquisitions, but we got quite consumed with the three transactions we had going on in the past quarter. So we haven't advanced anything that would be an immediate move. But we have some things in the works that we think are interesting, very early-stage valuation. So we haven't given up on acquisitions yet. But given the time line to complete one, I wouldn't anticipate anything until the spring. So we're talking four months, five months now looking forward before we would get to a completion on that. And then as far as the rest of the capital allocation, the dividend at this point, we've taken no action on that. We'll continue with that. We have had a recent discussion that at some point, we should put that back on the table and talk about it. But right now, a conscious decision was to leave it in place as it is. So that kind of recaps the whole capital allocation, finish out what we got going on continue as is with the dividend and continue to search for nice acquisitions, tuck-in acquisitions that we could make sometime in the next six months, probably.\nMatthew Galinko: All right. Thank you. And my follow-up is, just want to understand your assumptions in building full year recurring guidance. Just given the activity through the first half of the year and particularly activity you're seeing late in the second quarter and some of the traction you're seeing with the acquired assets. How do you think about constructing that full year recurring guide?\nVincent Klinges: Yes, Matthew, this is Vince. So I think the real issue was the fact that we had soft bit bookings in the beginning of the year. So that even though we're seeing a strong pickup in the bookings in the back half of the year, you don't get to take as much of the revenue. So that's why we're adjusting the recurring revenue to that to be a little bit more on the conservative side.\nMatthew Galinko: Yes, sure. No, I understand that component. But so, I guess, the other way of saying is that you have a very -- you have similar activity in the end of -- that you had at the end of this past quarter recur through the next quarter, 1.5 quarters. Or is that place we'd be an upside territory? Or just trying to understand what the range -- what scenarios get you to the above the range or something along those lines?\nVincent Klinges: Yes. If we have the bookings earlier than we anticipate, then yes, we could have some upside on the range. Absolutely. We're just trying to be conservative because as we indicated, a lot of the bookings came at the last week of this quarter. So if that happens next quarter, we won't be able to take any of the revenue for those deals in the third quarter. The fourth quarter bookings almost have no impact, regardless of when. You get them, get them early or get them late, they don't have much impact. And of course, fourth quarter has less billing days than in any way. So that has a nominal impact.\nMatthew Galinko: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, there are no further questions in the queue.\nAllan Dow: All right. Well, thank you all for participating today. We appreciate the time and joining us this evening for our earnings call. And Chelsea, thank you for hosting for us. You all have a good evening and we'll talk again soon.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's program and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time."

Later, you'll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Vince Klinges, CFO of American Software. Please go ahead, sir.\nVince Klinges: Thank you, Travis, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to American Software's First Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. On the call with me is Allan Dow, President and CEO of American Software. Allan will provide some opening remarks, and then I will review the numbers. But first, our safe harbor statement. This conference call may contain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among other things, our business strategy and growth strategy. Any such forward-looking statements speak only as of this date. These forward-looking statements are based largely on our expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which cannot be predicted or quantified, and are beyond our control. Future developments and actual results could differ materially from those set forth in, contemplated by or underlying the forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by statements made on this call. Such factors include, but are not limited to, changes and uncertainty in general economic conditions, the growth rate of the market for our products and services, the timely availability and market acceptance of these products and services, the effect of competitive products and pricing and other competitive pressures and the irregular and unpredictable pattern of revenues. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will prove to be accurate. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Allan for opening remarks.\nAllan Dow: Thank you, Vince. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin by reviewing our first quarter results, providing an update on the current business environment and highlighting several initiatives we're undertaking to create value for our shareholders. Our first quarter results were mostly in line with our expectations with the exception of our professional services revenue, which was down both sequentially and a year-over-year basis due to us winding down projects coming into the summer, and experiencing our usual seasonal well before a number of projects started up after the holiday period. We achieved solid subscription revenue growth of 14% year-over-year, which was consistent with our expectation and included the recovery of some cloud revenue from contracts that were suspended in the fourth quarter. Vince will provide some additional comments on this during his financial review. As we've maintained a very solid retention rate on maintenance revenue, while also securing inflationary increases on renewals, our recurring revenue again exceeded the 70% threshold and now represents 75% of our total revenue. In regards to our services revenue, we will continue to manage the IT staffing business towards improving margin profile. Furthermore, in our supply chain business, the combined impacts of our simplification initiatives to reduce the overall effort from each project, incrementally outsourcing more work to our service partners, and completing a higher percentage of work remotely, likely will result in a lower overall service contribution to our revenue profile. However, these efforts will give us margin improvements, surge capacity, a broader market reach and continued emphasis on our more reliable recurring revenue streams. Although the economic uncertainty continues to persist, we are cautiously optimistic that we will continue to see pipeline and close rates improve as we work through the upcoming holiday period for our consumer goods clients, and they build confidence in the need for new solutions in the year ahead. The remainder of this calendar year is the hardest to predict given the headwinds from recent interest rate hikes and recession fears. But the longer-term trends all point to a strong market for supply chain planning solution for years to come. Our pipeline is strong, and we anticipate continued improvements as our clients and prospects solidify budgets for 2024 spending. Additionally, with our large installed base, most of which is still on-prem, we have ample pipeline to support the accelerated lift and shift transition objectives that we've set out for this year, which will build upon our recurring revenue streams and further enhance the strength and predictability of our financial model. In light of the market and spending uncertainty, we will, of course, continue our cost control efforts, while with a goal of maintaining a flat to slight reduction in the overall cost this fiscal year. Overall, we're on track to achieve our financial plan for this fiscal year, and we are reaffirming our guidance. For fiscal 2024, we continue to expect recurring revenue to be between $88 million and $92 million, the adjusted EBITDA to be between $19 million and $21 million, and total revenue to be between $120 million and $126 million. On the acquisition front, first, we continue to see positive momentum with our network design and optimization solution from the Starboard acquisition and are making progress in our efforts to find new acquisitions that will be complementary to our current platform. We believe that it is likely that we will meet our goal of ingesting one more strategic fit company in the near term, and potentially an additional one before the end of the fiscal year, utilizing our cash flow on hand for stronger investor return while maintaining the quarterly dividend. We recognize, however, that our strong financial position enables us to do more to deliver value to our shareholders. As we look forward to the fiscal year ahead, we remain bullish on the supply chain planning market and our ability to compete effectively. Based on our ongoing performance improvement and view on the market growth, we believe our stock is undervalued. So we are initiating a share buyback that will commence after the current blackout period. We are also pursuing the sale of our headquarters and engaging with our Class B shareholder to address recent feedback on our dual class structure. We believe progress on these fronts will further benefit our shareholders. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vince, who'll provide the details on our financial results.\nVince Klinges: Thank you, Allan. For the first quarter, revenues came in at $29.2 million, a decrease of 7% from $31.3 million in the same period last year. Our subscription fees increased 14% year-over-year to $13.8 million due to bookings in the previous quarter with about two points of that gain being catch-up revenue from some of our clients who had delayed payments that were resolved in the quarter. We do not anticipate any additional near-term recoveries of revenue that was previously suspended and we have seen our retention rates to return to more normalized levels. Our software license revenue was $0.3 million for both the current quarter and the prior year period. Professional services and other revenues decreased 31% to $7 million from $10 million the same period last year. The year-over-year decrease reflects a 33% decrease in our supply chain management unit due to the slowdown in project activity that we've experienced over the past few quarters and the timing of new project starts and our efforts to offload more services to our SI partners. Additionally, we saw a 28% decrease in our IT Consulting business unit, the Proven Method, which continues to be impacted by macroeconomic conditions. However, the revenue began to stabilize on a sequential basis in our IT Consulting business and we expect both areas to exhibit some improvement in Q2. Maintenance revenues declined 8% year-over-year to $8.2 million, reflecting a normal falloff rate this quarter. Total revenues comprised of subscription and maintenance fees represented 75% of total revenues in the quarter, and that compares to 67% in the same period last year. Our gross margin was 60% for both the current and prior year period last year. Our subscription fee margin was 69% for the current period compared to 70% in the period last year. Excluding the non-cash amortization of intangible expense of $340,000 in the first quarter, subscription gross margin would have been 72% versus 74% last year. The amortization of cap software was $508,000 in the prior year period. The decline in our subscription gross margin compared to last year is due to timing of higher short-term costs at the end of the quarter for onboarding new customers we secured in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. Our license fee margin was 75% compared to 72% in the same period last year. Our services margin decreased to 19% from 27% last year due to lower revenues. The margin decreased primarily due to lower revenues from our supply chain business unit, resulting in lower utilization. We are closely monitoring our resources levels and have adjusted cost to make sure we maintain optimal levels of productivity throughout the remainder of the year. We believe services revenue will sequentially increase in Q2 '24 and the gross margins will improve. Our maintenance margin was 79% for the current quarter, compared to 82% in the prior year period. Gross R&D expenses were 15% of total revenues for the current period compared to 14% in the prior year period. Sales and marketing expenses were 21% of revenues for the current quarter, and that is up from 19% in the prior year period, and G&A expenses were 19% for the total revenues for the current quarter compared to 18% last year. So our operating income decreased 39% to $1.6 million for this quarter compared to $2.6 million in the same quarter last year, primarily due to lower revenues. Net income increased 29% to $2.7 million or earnings per diluted share of $0.08 compared to net income of $2.1 million or $0.06 per earnings per diluted share last year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes non-cash amortization of intangibles expense related to acquisitions and stock-based compensation expense, our adjusted operating income decreased 15% to $3.4 million compared to $4 million in the same period last year, and adjusted EBITDA decreased 17% to $3.9 million from $4.6 million in the first quarter of last year. Our adjusted EBITDA this quarter was impacted by a little over $400,000 in severance costs due to headcount reductions implemented to align our cost structure with the current operating environment. Adjusted net income increased 28% to $4.2 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.12 for the first quarter, and that compares to adjusted net income of $3.3 million or adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.10 in the same period last year. International revenues this quarter was approximately 18% of total revenues for both the current and the same period last year. Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, was -- that we refer to as backlog, was $111 million. Our total RPO was down 11% from the prior year period due to higher burn rate and fewer deals and shorter contract duration from the recent deals when compared to last year. Looking at the balance sheet, our financial position remains strong with cash and investments of $115.3 million at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we paid $3.7 million in dividends. Our day sales outstanding as of July 31, 2023, was 76 days for the current period, and that compares to 68 days in the same period last year. However, we had a nice decrease of 10 days sequentially from April 30, 2023, which was 86 days. So we remain confident in our ability to collect our outstanding receivables due to the high-quality nature of our customer base. As Allan noted, our guidance remains unchanged, and at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from [Karen Cuttica] (ph).\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is, are you seeing any further elongation of sales and approval cycles? Or does that remain similar to last quarter?\nAllan Dow: Thank you, [Karen] (ph) for joining us. And the question, yes, it's a super one. Right now, we've seen stabilization in the close cycles and approval cycles versus last quarter. Of course, last quarter, when we got together, we were talking about how they got longer. So at least the conditions aren't getting any worse, but they haven't really shown any signs of improvement yet. We just think that's the nature of the current market conditions. And of course, the first quarter is during the summer, which is always challenging anyway because, as you sequence through the approval cycle, you can always bump into somebody who's in a holiday on PTO with their family and whatnot. So it's always a little bit tougher in our Q1, which is the summer period. But we're hoping that will pick up. We're seeing some acceleration as we look forward. We're seeing people even though they're nervous talking about going a little bit faster and getting things started this fall. So we're anticipating maybe that will start to improve now here that we're coming off the back of the summer period.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That makes sense. And then one more for me. Can you provide any more detail on the strategic actions you mentioned and when we can expect to see that impact?\nAllan Dow: When we see the impact is a little tricky, of course, but -- because it's all subject to lots of timing. In regards to the headquarters building, one of those strategic actions, you may see that we've actually listed the property for sale. We're exploring whether that makes sense. If we get the right kind of money, we believe that in this hybrid work environment, the facility is not as critical to our ongoing operations and the amount of space we have here. So if we have the right opportunity to redeploy that cash and turn that asset into cash and redeploy it in a more strategic way, we'll do so. That could be a very long process. So even though that we've gone to market and we're soliciting offers here in the near term, the full cycle in that transaction could take anywhere from six to nine months, maybe even longer depending on the approval cycles that they would have to go through for property development. In regards to the B share, we're in an investigation period right now. And we've been asked by our B shareholder, Mr. Edenfield, to explore different opportunities, look to see what the market has been like, what other companies that have been in a similar situation have done and come back with some recommendations. Once we get to a conclusion on that, we'll also have to get some third-party validation on that, independent verification of any proposed actions that we would take. So that could take us a little while. We thought that we could do something before the end of the calendar year. We were a little more conservative as you may've read in our proxy to say that in the fiscal year just because we don't know that how long that last cycle might take for us to do something there. In regards to the share buyback, we plan to file a buyback provision as soon as we exit the blackout period that we're in right now, there'll be a few more days to make that happen and we'll start that process, but that can be a long process. We're anticipating -- we'll let that at least run through the end of the calendar year, and then we'll reassess at the end of the calendar year as we head into that holiday period. And then the other strategic move on acquisitions. Those are a little tricky. We've got a couple of actions in play, but it takes two parties to get that sorted out and then again, some approvals in that sort of process that can be a little bit delayed. But at least that initial one, we think we're on the forefront here in the next -- we're counting it in weeks, not months at this point. So we'll see how that plays out, and nothing is done until it's done. So we're hoping that we can take at least one of those actions relatively short term. So long rambling answer, but hopefully, that was helpful and brought a little more clarity to some of those points that I had mentioned earlier.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah. Thank you, that was great.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Zach Cummins.\nZach Cummins: Yes. Hi, good afternoon, Allan and Vince. Thanks for taking my questions. Allan, can you just talk a little bit more about the opportunities to lift and shift some of your existing customer base over to more of a subscription-based agreement? And what are some of the actions you're taking to really accelerate that process this year.\nAllan Dow: Yeah, Zach, thank you so much. Thank you for joining us and another great question. So historically, as many will recall, we've been a little -- quite passive, really relative to that because we -- I was really just watchful for the clients that we're really in a position where they needed to move. They weren't taking the release updates soon. They were falling behind, maybe in some cases, even being out of compliance relative to the underlying infrastructure criteria around operating system releases, database releases, that sort of thing or if they were just -- our observation was that they were not managing the solutions as effectively as they should be. We were being proactive there. This last year, we started initiating a more proactive move where we're going to all clients presenting the opportunities that could be available to them by moving to the cloud. We have new capabilities and features that come out that are exclusive to the cloud. So those upgrades allow them to get access to some of those features and capabilities. And then the other part of it is that we're seeing an acceleration just from our clients expressing a desire to move to the cloud where they put a strategic initiative together to do so. So it's really about intangible benefits that could be achieved by moving to the cloud, those faster releases, the more features, the richer capabilities, the offloading of IT burden, and the flexibility and the more frequent updates that's in there. So that's the method underway. And right now, our pipeline supports the initiative of doubling the number of lift and shifts that we had done historically in this fiscal year.\nZach Cummins: Understood. That's helpful. And my follow-up question is really just around the supply chain management, professional services side. Can you talk about your approach there? It seems like you're voluntarily winding down some projects and offloading those to partners. So I'm just curious of how you're balancing outsourcing work to partners versus what sort of projects you continue to take on with your own internal teams?\nAllan Dow: Yeah. I would -- I mean we're not winding down projects and handing them off, but we're continuing to educate our partners, our SI partners and value-added resellers to give them more skills and more capability and further bandwidth to take on projects right from the get-go. As we go through that process and onboard other partners, onboard more consultants that are scaling up, we're working side-by-side with them on some projects. So in the interim, you see we went from not many projects being done that way to shared resources. And now in some cases, we can really have them implement independent of us entirely. So more and more of that is starting to happen. So it's a transition that we're going through to bring that to light. And again, we think that's probably one of the most important initiatives around this because of the flexibility we have then in resources by having a broader team that is skilled, a virtual team, not necessarily our own employees and a much broader reach and market penetration. So we're very excited about the response we've gotten from these partners. Their willingness to make some investment in education and work side-by-side with us in parallel projects.\nZach Cummins: Understood. Well, thanks for taking my questions and best of luck for the rest of the quarter.\nAllan Dow: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anja Soderstrom.\nAnja Soderstrom: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Some of them have been addressed already. But, I'm curious, you mentioned you expect improved gross margin in this year, but we didn't really see that in the first quarter. What should give us confidence that we can see that improving in the coming quarters?\nVince Klinges: Hi, Anja, this is Vince. We anticipate that because of some of the restructuring cost reductions that we've taken in the first quarter. So that should start playing out in the next couple of quarters. And then also we do see an uplift in professional services that will actually help to improve those gross margins there, too.\nAnja Soderstrom: Okay, great. Thank you. That was all for me.\nVince Klinges: All right. Thank you so much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matthew Galinko.\nMatthew Galinko: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I guess maybe first on the catch-up payment -- catch-up subscription payments. I don't think I heard any quantification of how much that contributed to the sequential growth. So can you give us any more color on how supportive that was for fourth -- first quarter results and to the extent that, that recur moving forward, how much of a headwind is that as we move into the second quarter? Thanks.\nVince Klinges: Yeah. So the -- so Matt, thanks for the question. The pickup was roughly around $200,000, $300,000, and it was kind of a one-off catch-up from customers who had delayed payments, and they finally came back online. So we kind of view it as kind of a more normalized rate of retention going forward after that one-time pickup.\nMatthew Galinko: Got it. All right. Thanks. And then my follow-up question is on the potential for the HQ sale, I guess, does that -- would that predict a more aggressive M&A disposition or capital allocation if you converted that asset to cash? Or can you sort of take it to the next step of what the plan would be on what you would do with the cash if you completed the transaction? Thanks.\nAllan Dow: Yeah, Matt, this is Allan. Again, thank you for joining us. There are three options really relative to that. There could be a distribution of cash. There could be more additional share buyback, would free up resources for that. And then obviously, there's still the opportunity for acquisitions. We talked about all three of those, but it's really hard to put a definitive plan in place because of the timeline associated with this, the sale. Even if we get the right offer, we could put a purchase and sale agreement together and then it'd be anywhere from six to nine months or a year getting all the approvals because depending on what they wanted to do with the facility. So given the unpredictable nature of the timeline of that, we've made no definitive plans on how we would use the cash, but we're confident that one of those three options would return shareholder value. So we'll reevaluate those options, look at what's available to us at the time and then reassess if the cash is freed up -- if the sale goes through and the cash gets freed up, we'll have to reassess at that time. But that could be, as I said, nine months or longer from this time forward.\nMatthew Galinko: Got it. Thanks, Allan.\nAllan Dow: Sure.\nOperator: We have no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to today's speakers.\nAllan Dow: So, thank you very much. Travis, thank you for hosting today, and thank you all for joining us for our first quarter results. Enjoy the rest of this week and the weekend and a long holiday period here in the United States, and we look forward to speaking with you again in the near term. Have a good afternoon.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time."
