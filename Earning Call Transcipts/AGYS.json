I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Hennessy, Senior Director of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations at Agilysys. You may begin.\nJessica Hennessy: Thank you, Justin, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining the Agilysys fiscal 2024 third quarter conference call. We will get started in just a minute with management's comments. But before doing so, let me read the Safe Harbor language. Some statements made on today's call will be predictive and are intended to be made as forward-looking within the Safe Harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our financial guidance. Although the Company believes that its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from these forward-looking statements include the hospitality industry's need for technology solutions, our ability to drive sales and increase market share, our ability to increase profitability, and the risks set forth in the Company's reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a reminder, any references to record financial and business levels during this call refer only to the time period after Agilysys made the transformation to an entirely hospitality-focused software solutions Company in fiscal year 2014. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramesh Srinivasan, President and CEO of Agilysys. Ramesh, please go ahead.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Jess. Good evening. Welcome to the fiscal 2024 third quarter earnings call. Joining Jess and me on the call today at our Atlanta headquarters is Dave Wood, our CFO. Let me first cover sales before discussing revenue and other details. We measure selling success and sales in annual contract value terms. With respect to sales, I don't want to confuse matters between calendar and fiscal years, but please allow me to make one quick comment. Calendar 2023, that is the period from January to December, was our best-ever calendar sales period. Calendar 2023 was an extraordinarily successful 12-month period for selling success and we think the pace of sales will only get better in the future. Now, switching back to fiscal year. As we have reported before, the previous fiscal year FY 2023, the period from April calendar 2022 to March calendar 2023, was our best fiscal year for sales success. Sales at the end of the first three quarters of this fiscal year FY 2024 is progressing ahead of last year's pace. Compared to the first three quarters of the previous fiscal year, sales during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 has seen significant year-over-year, year-to-date improvements across the Asia Pacific region; and in the U.S., across the hotels, resorts, and cruise ship verticals. Sales from gaming casinos continues to be a major strength area for us and remains the number one vertical in terms of overall sales value. We've also seen significant year-over-year sales increases during the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 compared to last year's first three quarters, in the value of non-competitive wins, meaning sales to current customers, where there is no competition involved, and in the value of new customer wins. Sales of POS, point of sale software solutions, InfoGenesis, guest-facing by Kiosk, and guest-facing remote ordering tool, OnDemand, have also been significantly higher this fiscal year-to-date, compared to the prior year. While sales of certain property management system, PMS products, and related add-on modules have done better this year, there are other PMS modules which are yet to pick up momentum. We like our fiscal 2024 sales momentum and expect to do even better in the future now that our products are at an excellent spot, and we are steadily increasing the number of customer success stories based on the use of the re-engineered modern versions of the products and new modules created. Now that we are in the process of moving past the product re-engineering phase in our journey to become a world-class hospitality-focused enterprise software provider, our next objective is to create good reference customers who are seeing success with our new and integrated product ecosystem and are willing to discuss it with others, and that number continues to increase with every passing month. In fact, in the upcoming March 18 to 21st Annual User Conference, we are dedicating an entire breakout session track for customers, who are going to talk about their success stories with our recent product innovations. While on the subject of the User Conference, with about eight weeks ago, the number of customer registrations to attend the conference this year is about 25% higher than during the comparable time last year. During Q3 fiscal 2024, October to December, we added 18, 1-8, we added 18 new customers and all but one of those deals were subscription-based. Though the number of new customers added each quarter remains steady for now, the average number of products sold to each customer this quarter is the highest level we have seen thus far. New customer PMS deals closed this quarter included an average of about seven products each, while each POS deal included an average of 3.4 products, and overall, each new customer agreement included an average of 4.6 products. The average deal size sold to new customers during the first three quarters of 2024 was about 30%, 3-3, was about 30% higher than the new customer average deal size last fiscal year. In annual contract value terms, we've already sold more value of sales to new customers during the first three quarters of this fiscal year, compared to all of last fiscal year. During fiscal 2024 Q3, we also added 63 new properties which did not have any of our products before, but the parent company was already our customer. In terms of sales value to such new properties, this was our highest quarter since last fiscal year Q3. Of the 81 new properties added during the quarter across new customers and new properties of current parent customers, close to 90%, 9-0, close to 90% were either partially or fully subscription-based. With respect to new product sales, there were 80, 8-0, there were 80 instances of selling at least one additional product to properties which already had at least one of our other products currently in use. These 80 instances involved sales of a total of 183 new products. We continue to have a long runway of sales and revenue growth ahead of us, both within the existing customer base and to new customers. Starting now, it's a matter of establishing our modernized state-of-the-art technology-based new products and modules at an increasing pace in the field and reaching the flywheel stage of our reputation growth. We now have the capacity to grow regardless of travel spend trends. If such trends are good, that will be great and tailwinds are always helpful. But given our current very low market share, especially on the property management system, PMS side of our business, we can grow well even if such trends are not great. We've also set ourselves up well for growth across a broad base of possibilities in practically all the verticals we play in currently, gaming casinos, hotels, hotel chains, resorts, cruise ships, and managed food services, and are not dependent on one or two big wins. And of course, we have a long growth path ahead in international regions as well, given our current low market share. There too, it is a matter of establishing credibility and notoriety with more high-quality implementations. During the quarter, one of the biggest and most prestigious resorts to open in Asia in recent times, the INSPIRE Entertainment Resort in Incheon, South Korea, near the Seoul airport, opened successfully using a whole array of the most recent versions of our POS, PMS, and seven experience enhancer add-on solutions for a total of nine products implemented. It's also good to have our POS used at the ongoing Australian Open Tennis Tournament in Melbourne. I personally also enjoyed a few friends and acquaintances calling me to let me know that they noticed the Agilysys name at food outlets at the recently opened casinos in Las Vegas, Durango Station, and Fontainebleau, and also at one of the other major Vegas properties which hosted the recent CES Show. At this property, the various food outlets are in the process of moving to Agilysys' InfoGenesis POS from a competing system and some of the attendees noticed the Agilysys name, which was cool. Such spreading news of successful implementations and customer value-creation, using the most recent versions of our Hospitality Solutions ecosystem, will be key to our future growth. Back to the topic of sales win during the quarter, there were 11 new core Property Management System, PMS wins during the quarter across new customer, new site, and new product, making it among our best quarters in history in this regard. Still small numbers and very early days with our PMS business, but the momentum is building given our PMS product strength has never been better than it is now. The core PMS products and related modules are there where we have always wanted them to be at, and now it is a matter of creating more great references in the field, which we are making good progress with. We are a credible presence in the PMS space now and an increasing presence in most PMS RFP processes, like has been the case with most Point Of Sale, POS RFPs for many years. Once we get ourselves in the game, our end-to-end PMS ecosystem of products, all cloud-native with the capability to also work on-premise, gives us great odds to win. We are competing against very well-entrenched PMS competitors who have dominated the space for a long time, but we are gaining ground. Increasing Property Management System, PMS sales, will also help sell more additional software modules as there are about four times as many add-on modules with PMS as there are with POS. The significant PMS wins during the quarter included Mount Princeton Hot Springs Resort. This historic resort in Colorado has been in service for more than a century, with several amenities and offering visits to natural hot springs. Mount Princeton selected core POS and PMS products along with several experience enhancer add-on software solutions. Among the significant Point-of-Sale, POS wins this quarter, was Dordt University in Sioux Center, Iowa. Other than the InfoGenesis core POS product, this win also included purchase of guest self-service Kiosks and licenses for remote mobile ordering, kitchen display system, and our payment solution. Higher education is another growing sales vertical where our current market share is low, growth opportunities are high, and strong integration partnerships with other vendors, including with one of the major campus card providers, continue to differentiate us in the market. Now on to revenue and profitability. Fiscal 2024 Q3 revenue was a record $60.6 million, that is six-zero, $60.6 million, the 8th consecutive record-revenue quarter, 21.3% higher than the comparable prior-year quarter, including product revenue of $12.7 million, which was 18.5%, that's one-eight, 18.5% higher than Q3 last year. Fiscal 2024 is the first year wherein product revenue has exceeded $12.5 million in each of the first three quarters. One-time product and services revenue combined was a record $25.5 million, which was 28.8% higher than the comparable prior-year period. Apart from being a record sales quarter for services, this was also an excellent quarter for services revenue as the pace of implementations picked up considerably, giving us increased confidence in the recent modern versions of products becoming easier to implement and making a big positive difference for customers at various properties. Services revenue was a record $12.8 million, 41% higher than the comparable prior-year quarter. Services margin of 32.2% was an impressive improvement over recent prior quarters and should contribute to services margins for the full fiscal year being slightly above our original expectation of 25%. In addition, the extent of implementations completed in the field this quarter involving subscription revenue was the highest level we've achieved thus far, measured in terms of annual recurring revenue, ARR, worth of installations. That obviously augurs well for continued good future subscription revenue growth. Speaking of subscription revenue, fiscal 2024 Q3 subscription revenue grew 29.9% year-over-year to a record $19.5 million, that is one-nine, to a record $19.5 million and overall recurring revenue grew 16.4%, one-six, 16.4% to a record $35.1 million. Subscription revenue constituted 55.6% of total recurring revenue, compared to 49.8% in Q3 of last fiscal year. In absolute number terms, subscription revenue grew by $4.5 million year-over-year, which is the highest level we've achieved till now. Comparing subscription revenue this quarter with the comparable quarter two years ago, total subscription revenue has grown by 67%. Subscription revenue from PMS and related additional modules have doubled in this two-year period. Again, relatively small PMS subscription revenue numbers, no doubt, and we are only getting started with PMS growth now, but the trend is definitely encouraging. Further, PMS-related subscription revenue has grown as much in the first three quarters of this fiscal year as it did during the entire last fiscal year. Fiscal 2024 Q3 was our best quarter thus far for revenue from international regions, again, small numbers but encouraging progress with huge future growth potential. Improving implementation services efficiencies helped reduce our combined product recurring revenue and services backlog levels to about 85% of peak levels. We expect product revenue to be under a bit of short-term and ongoing pressure due to several reasons, including a lower starting product backlog, and our POS systems now supporting all major operating systems, Windows, iOS, and Android, thereby giving customers more POS generic hardware options, including off-the-shelf consumer-grade tablets and sleek all-in-one handheld devices. This trend is good for our medium and long term and gives our POS products a clear competitive edge, but is expected to put some pressure on one-time product revenue. We have a good track record of managing well the J-curve involved in the shift to a subscription revenue-based cloud software Company and I'm confident we will manage as well the shift from even less hardware than the level we are at now and more subscription and other software in our revenue mix. We expect services and recurring revenue, including subscription revenue to continue to do well. We remain confident of achieving the recently raised full year -- full fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance range of $235 million to $238 million. This should include continuing solid good subscription revenue growth. We expect full year fiscal 2024 subscription revenue growth to be comfortably in and slightly above the 28% guidance already provided. Fiscal 2024 Q3 adjusted EBITDA was 19.4%, that is one-nine, 19.4% of revenue at $11.8 million, more than 35% higher than the previous highest level, and the first time we have even exceeded the $9 million mark Even after discounting for the fact that Q3 is normally a favorable quarter for us with respect to profitability, due to the absence of various once-a-year trade shows and other once-a-year expenses, even after providing for all that, this was a good quarter for profitability as we continue to focus on achieving greater operational efficiencies. We expect full fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be 15% of revenue, that is one-five, 15% of revenue, higher than the previously guided 14% level and our expectations of 13% going into the fiscal year. We will provide revenue range and other guidance for fiscal 2025 covering the period April '24 to March '25 during the year-end earnings call, mid-to-late May. With that, let me hand over the call to Dave.\nDave Wood: Thank you, Ramesh. Taking a look at our financial results, beginning with the income statement, third quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was a quarterly record of $60.6 million, a 21.3% increase from total net revenue of $49.9 million in the comparable prior year period. All three revenue lines increased compared to the prior year period, with product up 18.5%, professional services up 40.9%, and recurring revenue up 16.4%, including subscription revenue increases of 29.9%. Sales momentum continued throughout Q3 with total exit backlog remaining strong and at comfortable levels to reach our FY '24 revenue expectations. We also remain pleased to see our total backlog increased by 6% over the comparable prior-year period, despite a decrease in product backlog. Implementation efficiencies and effectiveness of the services team have continued to improve, driving more subscription revenue earlier in the quarter. Products revenue increased 18.5% over the prior fiscal year to $12.7 million. The Point-of-Sale business continued to perform better-than-expected for the fiscal year. However, we expect product revenue as a percentage of total revenue to continue to decline slightly and be in the $11 million to $12 million range during our fiscal Q4. As more customers choose commercial-grade devices and other all-in-one handheld devices to run our modernized POS software solution, we expect less contribution as a percentage of revenue from the one-time product revenue line. Professional services increased 40.9% over the prior period to a record $12.8 million. Professional services continued to be a strong leading indicator for the health of the business. Professional services backlog increased slightly back to record levels despite record professional services revenue during the quarter. We expect professional services revenue to increase sequentially in Q4 and grow north of 30% for the full fiscal year. Most of our professional services revenue is related to implementation projects contributing to the acceleration of FY ‘24 subscription revenue. Development associated with larger projects with corresponding subscription revenue happening in future years has been less than 10% of services revenue during the past couple quarters. Total recurring revenue represented 58% of total net revenue for the fiscal third quarter, compared to 60.4% of total net revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased slightly because of a 28.8% increase in one-time revenue consisting of products and professional services. Fiscal 2024 Q3 subscription revenue grew 29.9% over the comparable prior-year period. Subscription revenue comprised 55.6% of total recurring revenue for the current period compared to 49.8% of total recurring revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Subscription revenue increased sequentially $1.2 million and remains at the high end of our expectations. The subscription backlog remains strong and we expect subscription revenue to continue to increase between $0.9 million and $1.2 million sequentially during the fiscal fourth quarter, putting the full year 2024 subscription growth percentage between 28.7% and 29.3% for the year. Moving down the income statement. Gross profit was $37.8 million, compared to $30.8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross profit margin was 62.5%, compared to 61.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We are pleased to see gross profit margin back in the 60%s largely due to an increase in professional services margins to 32.2%. Combined, the three main operating expense line items, product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were 43.1% of revenue compared to 45.6% of revenue in the prior-year quarter. Product development increased slightly to 20.9% compared to 20.6% of revenue in the prior fiscal year. General and administrative expenses decreased to 12.4%, compared to 13.7% of revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Sales and marketing decreased from 11.3% of revenue to 9.8% of revenue, mostly due to expenses related to trade shows and other events happening in different quarters this year, compared to the prior year. Operating income for the third quarter of $7.8 million, net income of $76.9 million, and gain per diluted share of $2.85, all increased compared to the prior year's third quarter gain of $3.5 million, $3.4 million and $0.13. Adjusted net income normalizing for certain non-cash and non-recurring charges of $9.3 million, was higher than adjusted net income of $6.7 million in the prior-year third quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.35 was more than $0.26 in the prior-year period. In our fiscal third quarter, we had a release of a valuation allowance of $65 million, causing GAAP EPS to be higher than adjusted EPS after normalizing this one-time item out through adjusted net income. The release of the tax-related valuation allowance allows us to recognize existing U.S. federal net operating losses of around $175 million and associated state NOLs as deferred tax assets on our balance sheet. With our accumulated earnings in recent years plus our projected earnings going forward, it is now likely that we'll utilize the NOLs. As such, the valuation allowance was released this quarter. For the 2024 third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $11.8 million compared to $8.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in Q3 FY '24 was 19.4% of revenue. Profitability for the quarter was better than expected, largely due to better than expected gross margin within our professional services and recurring revenue lines. Professional services margin improvement during the quarter was mainly driven by an increase in efficiencies across the team. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and marketable securities as of December 31st, 2023, was $116.2 million compared to $112.8 million on March 31st, 2023. We remain comfortable with our current levels of cash. Free cash flow in the quarter was a gain of $11.3 million, slightly less than a gain of $11.7 million in the prior-year quarter. The decrease in free cash flow was largely attributable to an increase in accounts receivable balance and the associated impact on working capital. Our over 90 accounts receivable remains less than 10% of total AR. For fiscal year 2024, we remain comfortably in our revenue guidance range of $235 million to $238 million, inclusive of 28% subscription revenue growth. We are also raising our profitability guidance for the full-year from 14% to 15% adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. In closing, we are pleased with the sales momentum, professional services improvements, and revenue growth during the first three quarters of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ramesh.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Dave. Our progress over the past six to seven years has involved, among other things, a massive overhaul of core products and the creation of an ecosystem of state-of-the-art world-class software solutions focused on the hospitality industry. The past years have therefore been a product development R&D story for the most part. We also took massive strides forward in many other areas, but the highlight was clearly product development. Product development strength is going to remain and grow in a more tempered fashion in the future, but starting now, our R&D efforts are going to be a lot more focused on customer acquisition and winning innovation now that the pressures of massive re-engineering efforts are no longer there. Now, the already built-up product development strength will focus on increasing our competitive advantages in each of the products and modules as they compete for best-of-breed selection versus a variety of competitors, and on enhancing the integrated ecosystem capabilities that very few competitors can match with us today. We cannot think of many other competitors who can match the breadth and depth of our solution ecosystem, all based on modern cloud-native technologies with a versatile ability to also work at customer sites who want to remain on-premises for a while longer. We have done well to fill the technology and functionality feature set innovation gap giant hole in this industry and are now well-positioned to translate that into growth and business success. Also, now the business evolution will shift to the field. Now the focus will be more on services' implementation efficiencies and helping customer properties realize operational gains and guests and staff experience improvements through the use of these new integrated product versions. As we create more such successes, we expect quicker progress towards the flywheel stage in our business when this steadily improving engine will become an unstoppable force. Our total addressable market remains huge relative to our size and this industry and market is hungry for world-class technology solutions. We are seeing good sales growth across sales verticals and product verticals where our market shares have been low in the past. We are now a credible presence in the PMS arena, where our journey is only in the initial beginning stages. Our balance sheet remains clean and strong and we remain disciplined with our growth plans. We believe all that adds up to a great probability of continued future success in creating solid good shareholder value during the short, medium, and long-term. With that, let's open up the call for questions, Justin.\nOperator: And, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes Mayank Tandon from Needham. Your line is now open.\nMayank Tandon: Thank you. Good evening. Ramesh and Dave, I was just curious on the outlook for 4Q. You obviously called out very strong sales momentum. But if I look at the guide for 4Q, I think, it calls for maybe a modest deceleration from 3Q levels, and then also the margin guide would be below 3Q levels. So -- and I'm picking a little bit here, but would just be curious if you could walk through some of the data points that is reflected in your 4Q guide after the very strong sales momentum that you called out in the 3Q beat.\nDave Wood: Yes. Thanks for the question. So, we are expecting an acceleration in revenue in Q4. The commentary was really around the product line. We're seeing more of our products run on off-the-shelf products. So, we're seeing a little bit of a decline in the product, but we are still expecting professional services to increase sequentially and our subscription should still increase between $900,000 and $1.2 million, basically all leading to revenue being up probably around $1 million over where we are today. So, we're still expecting a sequential increase in revenue, but there will be a little bit of a pullback on the product revenue line.\nRamesh Srinivasan: So, Mayank, when we started the year, our revenue expectation was $230 million to $235 million. We then raised our guidance last quarter, $235 million to $238 million and nothing has changed there, that still remains the case that we expect revenue to be $235 million to $238 million just like how we guided at the end of the last quarter.\nDave Wood: And on the margin side, there will be a little bit of a pullback in margin. I mean Q3 is just -- from an OpEx standpoint, is just a lower cost quarter. We just -- there's not as many trade shows. There is less accruals for unused PTO, and all that stuff kind of kicks back in our fiscal Q4, there is more trade shows. So, again, it will pull back a little bit, but leaving the year higher than we exited last year, so north of the 15%.\nRamesh Srinivasan: And again, as a reminder, we started the year thinking it will be 13%, Mayank. And then we increased guidance to 14% EBITDA by revenue and now we expect it to be 15% of revenue. So, the margin, our capabilities of the company have steadily improved throughout the year.\nMayank Tandon: Got it. That's very helpful. And then, as a quick follow-up, Ramesh, on the international side, I'm just curious, I'm sure the competitive landscape is different. The growth challenges are different. So, what are the investments you're making to ensure that you win internationally? And you've had already good success, but to replicate what you've done in North America, so maybe if you could just talk about the investment levels and what are some of the key initiatives to, again, ensure that you have success abroad just like you've had in North America both on the PMS and the POS side.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes. So, the biggest investments we've made over the last six, seven years, has been in the products, because we wanted to make sure that the products are capable of competing effectively in international regions. And we built the products so that they are configurable, easily adaptable to the particular requirements of various countries, while the core product remains the same. So, the first part of the answer to your question, the biggest investments we made in order to be more competitive and do better in APAC and EMEA, especially has been with the products. So, that's where we started. So, now, the next stage of that evolution is greater investments in the services area, where we are doing one successful implementation after the other. And in our kind of business, right, in our kind of B2B enterprise software, you need reference customers, right? You need more and more reference customers and we do have a lot of reference customers with our older versions, but we needed them in the newer versions. So, that's what I mentioned, that INSPIRE Resort, Korea, is a big example of that. They went live in all our modern versions and they have been -- they are one of the top resorts to go live, to get started in the recent past. So, we are now focused on implementations and generating more high referenceable customers. In the meanwhile, we are also increasing our marketing investments in international regions and we have recently expanded our sales staff, especially in the APAC region, where a couple of senior sales personnel, one of them from one of our competing companies has joined us. So, we are now investing in sales and marketing as well. So, we have gone in that order, right. First, improve the products, make sure they are capable of being implemented and doing well in international regions, so, that process is done. Now we are focused on creating successful implementations there. In parallel, we are also increasing our sales and marketing investments.\nMayank Tandon: That's all very helpful. Again, congrats on the quarter, and thank you for taking my questions.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Mayank. Yes.\nOperator: And, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Matthew VanVliet from BTIG. Your line is now open.\nMatthew VanVliet: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the questions. I guess as you look at, specifically on the PMS side of the pipeline here, I guess, how much of the build and sort of record levels that you're seeing there would you attribute to just sort of the product now being more modern and more easily deployed and integrated with other systems? And would you lend any I guess support to the more halo effect of having won the Marriott deal and sort of getting into opportunities that might not otherwise have materialized?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes. Hi, Matthew. Yes, the Marriott deal has definitely given us credibility in the PMS area, no question, right? Because now, there was a time before when we were not included in many PMS RFPs and I can't blame customers for that. But now, with the Marriott deal, we have credibility, now it is tough to exclude us, and which is all we wanted. Now in the meanwhile, there are also two other factors, Matt. One of them is the fact the product is in a much, much better state now and you cannot ignore it, and once you see it, you get very interested in it. So, that's one factor. And a couple of other factors I would mention is, number one, the market is hungry for innovation. So, at least in our opinion, the providers who had dominated the space, the innovation speed has not been that great during the past few years. So, someone had to fill that innovation gap and customers find these products to be far ahead of the competition once they take a look at it. And the biggest factor also is, we built an ecosystem of PMS products. It's not only the core PMS. It's also all, it's about 15 to 20 add-on Experience Enhancer modules around it, and many customers are preferring to reduce the number of vendors they deal with. It is not just a matter of making integrations easier, it is also a matter of pace of innovation. Like you come up with a good idea in golf or spa, and you want a corresponding change in the PMS, it's much easier for us to do all those changes in the next release and customers love the fact. So, I would say that the momentum that is building for us in PMS is attributable to all those reasons. One, the Marriott deal gave us credibility; two, the product is competitively at a much better state and we can answer yes to both being in the cloud and on-premise; third, this industry has always been hungry, it's become hungry for those kinds of good products; and fourth, of course, the ecosystem of PMS products we have built. All that is contributing to our momentum now, Matt.\nMatthew VanVliet: Okay. Very helpful. And then, Dave, you mentioned that less than 10% of services revenue is coming from, I presume Marriott. But the contracts, that subscription will be in later years. Is that sort of the appropriate level we should think about in terms of the mix over the next several quarters as you get closer to the rollout there or should that uptick? And I guess with that, how would you correlate that with utilization rates across the services organization more broadly?\nDave Wood: Yes. So, I mean it just stayed less than 10%. I mean as you would imagine, it will go up and down on a quarterly basis, but the far majority of our 90%-plus is non-large deal services working toward our subscription revenue. But yes, it will go up and down, but we're not expecting it to get larger than 10% in the next couple of quarters. And utilization of the services team has been really well. I mean, the best thing to point to there is the margin, right. I mean we've seen over the last couple of quarters, roughly a 10% margin increase in the professional services team and a lot of that is just more billable -- obviously, more billable work and less non-billable work as we work through some of our prior implementation efficiencies and just work through the backlog.\nRamesh Srinivasan: And the crucial thing to keep in mind, Matt, is this would have been a record services quarter for us regardless, even without the influence of that product development-related revenue, it would have been a record quarter for us. And year-over-year, it's improved by 41%, so only a part of that can be attributed to this product development work that we are doing. The main indicator here, Matt, the crucial thing is, it's an indicator that our new products are settling down well in the field and are becoming easier and faster to implement, which is the biggest thing we take out of our services revenue quarter.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great. And then one last one quickly, if I could squeeze it in. As you look at the longer term, I guess, upside to margins that's potentially in the model here, anything limiting further upside as growth continues on the top-line? Any major investments that you foresee having to make that could impede that or should we expect, with appropriate top-line growth, a fair amount of leverage going forward? Thanks.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes, Matt. With continuing top-line growth, you should expect improving leverage across practically all our operating expenses categories. You should expect improving operating leverage as we go along. But remember, from a quarter to quarter, I would not apply those rules. But on a year-over-year basis, this fiscal year, the next fiscal year, and so on, you should expect profitability levels to continue improving as our revenue levels improve. And especially on the R&D side of it, we have a fair amount of leverage. I mean, it is not as if R&D is going to go down, but it's going to be tempered. The R&D increases are going to be tempered compared to the revenue growth. And also, our gross margin is improving now. As recurring revenue becomes a higher proportion of our total revenue and our services revenue becomes a higher proportion as well, you should expect, overall, our profitability to continue improving as our top-line revenue increases.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And one moment for our next question. And our next question comes from George Sutton from Craig-Hallum Capital. Your line is now open.\nGeorge Sutton: Thank you. Ramesh, you mentioned that you grew subscription revenues 29.9%. I would like to give you a sell-side roundup and say congratulations for your 30% growth. I wanted to make sure, given that both Marriott and Hilton put out pretty positive indications about room growth today. So, obviously, the industry is growing very healthy. But with Marriott specifically is, they're announcing these big room increase numbers, can you just walk through how we think of that relative to what that means for your ultimate contract?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes. I mean, I tried to convince some of my manager team members to buy a little bit more subscription from us to push it over the 30% mark, but it didn't happen, George. It ended up at 29.9%. But yes, that trend continues to be good. Subscription revenue growth continues to be good, all jokes apart. It is going well and we are encouraged by the direction. Now I did listen to that CNBC snippet today of the Marriott CEO commenting on the rooms growth and all that means, George is, is expanding opportunities, alright? Nothing has changed as far as our Marriott PMS agreement goes. We continue to work towards it and both parties, both Marriott and us, continue to very diligently monitor and manage the project and it continues to progress well. But all this extra room announcements, Hilton on the POS side, Marriott on the PMS side, means more opportunities for us. That means if we execute well, if we do well with the opportunities we have today, there are more opportunities to be had. We are in a good industry that is doing well, where there is a dearth of innovation, not much innovation going on. So, I think we are sitting on some very good opportunities and now that the major product work is done, we can actually focus on customer acquisition and innovation and those kinds of activities. So, I see that report as encouraging, George, and I see that report as more opportunities opening up for us, possibly, if we continue to do well.\nGeorge Sutton: So, in your prepared comments, you mentioned that we think the pace of sales will only get better. And you talked about it from a product perspective on why you do think things will get better. Can you talk about it from a sales efficiency/productivity or just go-to-market totality, give us a sense of why things will get better from that perspective?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes. So, starting with sales efficiency, just some anecdotal data for you. Our new reps, right, the recently joined new reps, their productivity has tripled in the nine months this year compared to the nine months last year. So, that's a good indication that as we continue to increase our sales staff, and by the way we have, in the hotels, resorts section, in managed foodservice providers, in that vertical, and in Asia, we have improved -- we have increased our number of sales staff and our experience with the new sales staff who have joined us over the last couple of years, is that their productivity tripled this year. Now, they are contributing about 25% of overall sales this year so far. So, the productivity thus continue to improve because they get excited when they see the new products. They typically come from within the industry. They have worked with our competitors before. And their eyes just open up saying, we had no idea that this kind of ecosystem of state-of-the-art technology products are there. So, that we continue to do and we will continue to improve sales, the number of sales personnel, and that productivity gains are continuing to increase and that's one reason why I think our sales will continue to improve. Now, go-to-market, marketing spend and all that is increasing. We took one step forward this year and we will continue doing that as we go along. Because we are seeing good results. Our name is out there a lot more now and a lot more thought leadership contributions, and lot more participated in trade shows, especially in Asia, and EMEA, and other regions. So, all that will continue to increase. Now what is crucial, George, is we need more field successes in order to establish our credibility and more and more customers talking about the success stories about us. That's the next crucial step and that will be aided by adding more to sales and marketing as well.\nGeorge Sutton: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, George.\nOperator: And, thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nNehal Chokshi: Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my question. Congratulations on a solid set of results here. Ramesh, at the beginning of your prepared remarks, I think you said fiscal year '24 year-to-date sales is progressing ahead of last year's pace. So, just wanted to make sure, when you say pace, you mean year-over-year growth, is that correct?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Correct, Nehal. So, just to expand on that answer a little bit, Nehal. FY '23, right, which is April '22 to March '23, was a record fiscal year sales for us. And this fiscal year, which is April '23 to March '24, at the end of three quarters, at the end of Q1, Q2, Q3, is ahead of last year's pace. That is correct.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. So, basically, you're seeing accelerating sales pace, which is your definition of sales, I call it bookings, but you're seeing that accelerate independent of the…\nRamesh Srinivasan: Correct, correct. We are [Multiple Speakers] I'm sorry?\nNehal Chokshi: Independent of the [Indiscernible] deal.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Correct. Yes, Nehal. Just to reiterate that, that deal is not counted in any of our sales numbers as yet. That we will start counting in sales when the individual properties start signing up with us. So that's not in any of our sales or backlog numbers that we generally report to you. So to come back to your original point, fiscal year 2024, when you compare Q1 to Q3 with fiscal year 2023, Q1 to Q3, this year is ahead. And by the way, fiscal year 2023 was our best fiscal year up to then.\nNehal Chokshi: Great, fantastic. And Dave, thoughts on free cash flow for fiscal year ‘24 now that we're basically 10 out of 12 months through fiscal year ’24?\nDave Wood: Yes, I mean, no change to expectations in free cash flow, and that being free cash flow, less CapEx over the year should be pretty close to adjusted EBITDA. Certainly, there's a little bit more headwinds with timing of billing this year. So most of the free cash flow, typically, we get some pretty favorable working capital adjustments in Q3. And it wasn't the case this year, but no concern there, it was just timing of billing. We billed things earlier in the year, and we expect to collect on those next quarter. So no change to free cash flow. I mean, over a period of time, free cash flow less CapEx is, it'll remain pretty…\nRamesh Srinivasan: Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx.\nDave Wood: Yes, adjusted EBITDA less CapEx will be free cash flow.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. So, just a bit of guidance is around, I think, like $36 million, $37 million. CapEx is trending around $9 million. And so, talking about $27 million free cash flow for fiscal year ’24?\nDave Wood: Yes, that's right. And most of that will come just from working capital specifically related to accounts receivable.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. And, you know, I mean, for fiscal year ‘21, fiscal year ‘22, fiscal year ‘23, $27 million of free cash flow each of those years. Yet your adjusted BITDA, you know, is going to have increased about $10 million over that three-year period. And so your working capital requirements are increasing essentially then?\nDave Wood: Well, this year there was a lot more CapEx related to our office moves. We talked about our office moves. We moved offices in our Chennai office, Alpharetta, and Vegas. So it's kind of the -- there was just a lot more CapEx this year related to office moves than there has been in the past. And obviously, you know, we'll be in these offices for a while. So the CapEx just starting normalizing back down next year.\nNehal Chokshi: Got it, great. And then look, your cash balance continues to accrete really nicely. You're doing a small level of share repurchases, but I mean, it's nowhere close to the rate of free cash flow generation. And you've proven to have a very prudent M&A task that you did a nice acquisition three years ago, but I mean, it's nowhere close to the three years of free cash flow that you generated since those last three years there? Why not go ahead and accelerate the rate of buybacks here?\nRamesh Srinivasan: So, Nehal, we are comfortable with our cash balance now, and it is not high enough to do anything significant, Nehal. And we have acquisition opportunities do come to us now and then, but we tend to be very conservative and we're very careful with what we look at. And organic growth is good for us, so we are not going to use inorganic growth as a crutch. But there are opportunities that now and then can come to us. So we are comfortable with our current cash balance, but as cash flow generation continues to accelerate, all options are open in front of us, right? We will be prudent, we will do the right thing for shareholders, and at the moment, we are at the early stages of accelerating our cash generation. At the current level of cash balance, we are comfortable with. In case there is a rainy day, or in case a good tuck-in acquisition kind of thing comes our way, we are well positioned to take advantage of it.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay, great, Thanks for taking my questions.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Nehal.\nOperator: And thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would not like to turn the call back over to Ramesh for closing remarks.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Justin. Thank you for all your interest and support. Best wishes to all of you for a very happy, cheerful, healthy, and successful 2024. Our next earnings call will be in about four months from now, around the middle to end of May, when we will be reporting Q4 and full fiscal year 2024 results. Thank you.\nOperator: This concluded today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Hennessy, Senior Director of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations at Agilysys. You may begin.\nJessica Hennessy: Thank you, Victor, and good afternoon everybody. Thank you for joining the Agilysys fiscal 2024 second quarter conference call. We will get started in just a minute with management's comments. But before doing so, let me read the safe harbor language. Some statements made on today's call will be predictive and are intended to be made as forward-looking within the safe harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Perform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our financial guidance. Although the company believes that its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from these forward-looking statements include the effects of global economic factors on our business, the hospitality industry's need for technology solutions, our ability to drive sales, our ability to increase profitability, and our ability to improve services margins and manage increased cost investments and the risks set forth in the company's reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a reminder, any references to record financial and business levels during this call refer only to the time period after Agilysys made the transformation to an entirely hospitality-focused software solutions company in fiscal year 2014. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramesh Srinivasan, President and CEO of Agilysys. Ramesh, please go ahead.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Jess. Good evening. Welcome to the fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. Joining Jess and me on the call today at our Alpharetta, Atlanta headquarters is Dave Wood, CFO. As has become the regular practice in our earnings calls, let me cover the selling success summary first, before moving on to revenue and other details. We measure of sales of selling success in net annual contract value, ACV, of sales agreements won and signed. Fiscal 2024 Q2 July to September was one of our best ever sales success quarters. Overall, fiscal 2024 April to September was our best first half of fiscal year sales, comfortably better than the first half last year. Fiscal 2023 last year, was of course our best ever full year of sales and we are off to a significantly better start halfway through this year. July to September was a good sales quarter for virtually all the sales verticals across gaming casinos, resorts, cruise ships, hotels, managed foodservice providers and international regions. Sales from non-gaming resorts, hotels and cruise ships were particularly stellar and increasing because our market share levels in these areas are still low with major growth possibilities ahead. April to September was also our best first half thus far for international sales across Europe and APAC. As of the end of September, year-to-date APAC sales was already close to the full-year sales level reached across all of last fiscal year. Our competitive positioning strength is increasing with every passing month. An end-to-end ecosystem of software solutions, the breadth and depth of feature sets offered, with more getting added at increasing rates, now that most of the product re-engineering efforts are done and over with, all based on state-of-the-art cloud native technology, which can also work well in on-premise installations, which several hospitality customers still prefer, all that is becoming increasingly compelling value creators and unique selling propositions for us. The significant pick-up in selling success, which started around the month of August calendar 2022, has continued unabated through the recent July to September period 13 months later. We've not seen any noticeable negative effects of macroeconomic challenges. The hospitality industry is global, huge, and has a high need for technology and innovation to help with growing needs, to improve operational efficiencies, enable ease of use for staff users, and help create far better guest experiences that are possible today. We cannot say the technology providers of this industry have done too well keeping up with the innovation needs due to among other reasons, a lack of focus on end-to-end hospitality needs and far less than needed research and development investments. In the meanwhile, the digital transformation revolution around hospitality is accelerating, raising the expectations of property employees and guests. We think we have done well executing on our strategy to fill the gap and expect our escalating product and technology-driven competitive advantages to continue to drive good business momentum in this huge total addressable market space. We think that momentum will have good staying power even in a possible challenging macroeconomic environment. In line with that assessment, thus far, we are not seeing any growth-threatening clouds in the sky. Our sales win-loss ratios continue to be at impressive levels. One of the highlights of sales success during the first half of fiscal 2024 was the rapidly increasing sales productivity of quota-carrying sales personnel hired during the past couple of years post-COVID. To place this in context, the average Agilysys tenure of our quota-carrying sales personnel is around 7.5 years now. Of them, slightly less than half the personnel have joined us after COVID, and the average Agilysys tenure of this Group is only about a year. During the first half of fiscal 2024, this group of sales personnel have already won sales measured in annual contract value amounting to close to twice as much as they did all of last fiscal year. While we continue to make prudent and appropriate decisions with respect to increasing sales force strength, current sales staff still have additional capacity to not only maintain momentum but also grow sales from current levels. In addition, the number of marketing-generated sales accepted opportunities focused on new customers and new properties, generated by innovative and effective marketing efforts continues to improve. During recent months, this number has been twice as high as it was at the same time last year. While our competitive strengths with point-of-sale, POS solutions, continues to improve by leaps and bounds and remains our mainstay, sales wins during the first half of fiscal 2024 have also included several significant Property Management System, PMS, wins. A notable win during Q2 was Black Rock Oceanfront Resort on the Western Coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. This iconic property selected Agilysys PMS and several experience enhancer add-on software modules for their stunning multi-amenity oceanfront resort. There are now close to 20 properties live on the modernized ground-up re-engineered Visual One PMS rebranded as Versa and released for production deployment about 18 months ago. We are still in the early stages of establishing our state-of-the-art technology-based cloud-native PMS value proposition in the field. There is a long runway of PMS and related modules growth ahead of us. During Q2 fiscal 2024 July to September, we added 17, 1-7 -- 17 new customers, of which 76% were fully subscription agreements. 17 new customers is within the 15 to 20 new customers per quarter range, which has been one of the drivers of our revenue growth in the recent past. New customer deal sizes remains at impressively high levels. We also added 70, 7-0 -- 70 new properties, which did not have any of our products before, but the parent company was already our customer. The average deal size of new property deals this quarter was about 25% higher than the previous couple of quarters. Of the 87 new properties added during the quarter across new customers and new properties of current parent customers, more than 90 -- 9-0, more than 90% were either partially or fully subscription-based. In addition, there were 67 instances of selling at least one additional product to properties which already had one of our other products. These 67 instances involved a total of 142 new products sold to current customer properties. The average deal size across these 67 instances of new product sales was about 40, 4-0 -- 40% higher than the sequentially preceding Q1 quarter. Now on to revenue. Fiscal 2024 Q2 revenue was a record $58.6 million, the seventh consecutive record revenue quarter, close to 23% higher than the comparable prior year period. The year-over-year quarter revenue increase of $10.9 million is the highest we've ever seen. Overall revenue during the first half of fiscal 2024 was 20% higher than revenue during the first half of fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024 Q2 recurring revenue grew 18%, 1-8 -- 18% year-over-year and 6.6% sequentially quarter-over-quarter to a record $34.2 million, driven by a 29% year-over-year increase in subscription revenue. Subscription revenue constituted 53.6% of total recurring revenue compared to 48.9% Q2 of last year. The year-over-year growth in quarter subscription revenue compared to Q2 of last year was a record $4.1 million, consisting of record year-over-year increases in both POS and PMS and related modules. Quarter-over-quarter sequential growth of subscription revenue of $1.6 million and overall recurring revenue of $2.1 million were both our best such sequential increases. Subscription revenue generated from add-on experience enhancer software modules, most of which were developed during the past few years, grew at a slightly better rate year-over-year than the overall subscription growth of 29%. The value of these models and the -- modules and the end-to-end ecosystem we have built over the past few years goes far beyond such numbers. These add-on modules working in conjunction with each other and with the core POS and PMS products are helping customers make tangible measurable improvements in their operations. We heard several such customer stories about positive measurable impact on hotel operations during the recent gaming show, and in Customer Advisory Board meetings held in Las Vegas, and these stories were shared with other attending customers. Each of these modules are competing on their own at best-of-breed solutions and bringing tremendous value when used, enhanced and innovated together. Services revenue was a record $11.7 million, 44% higher than the comparable prior-year quarter. The increasing pace of implementations being handled by services teams augurs well for upcoming recurring revenue growth. We continue to make good progress with implementing relatively newer software products and modules at a quicker pace now, handling complex multi-product implementations and managing the balance between majority cloud and several on-premise installations. Services margins improved to 23.6%, but still fell short of our 25% expectation. Improving Services margins from current levels remains one of the few business objectives we are falling short of currently. We remain focused on taking all necessary steps to improve services margins without affecting customer satisfaction levels. One-time revenue consisting of product and services revenue added up to a record $24.4 million, about 30%, 3-0 -- 30% higher than the comparable prior-year quarter. Revenue levels during the first half exceeded our initial expectations and we are not happy to be in a position to raise full-year fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance range to $235 million to $238 million. The rate of project implementations has picked up well and subscription revenue growth during the first half of the year was better than we anticipated. We think subscription revenue growth during full-year fiscal 2024 will be 28%, significantly better than the previous guidance of 25%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $8.1 million and 13, 1-3 -- 13.7% of revenue, a couple of percentage points better than the sequential prior Q1 quarter and ahead of our expectations going into the fiscal year. We've done well, managing through a difficult period of increased cost investments, which were required to drive medium-term revenue growth. Increasing revenue and stabilizing cost levels should help us improve profitability consistently going forward. We now expect EBITDA by revenue to be 14, 1-4 -- 14% for full-year fiscal 2024, one percentage point higher than the 13% guidance provided at the beginning of the year. With that, let me hand over the call to Dave for further color.\nDave Wood: Thank you, Ramesh. Taking a look at our financial results, beginning with the income statement. Second quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was a quarterly record of $58.6 million, a 22.8% increase from total net revenue of $47.7 million in the comparable prior year period. All three product lines increased compared to the prior year period, with product revenue of 19.8% and professional services up 43.8%. Recurring revenue was also up 18% with subscription up 29.1% over the prior year period. Sales momentum continued throughout Q2 with total exit backlog remaining strong in near record levels despite revenue being above our expectations. We also remain pleased to see our professional services backlog remain about the same for the second quarter in a row despite strong sales as implementation efficiencies and effectiveness of the services team have continued to improve. Product revenue increased 19.8% over the prior fiscal year to $12.6 million. Our point-of-sale business continues to perform better than expected, which is increasing our product revenue expectations for the year. We now expect product revenue to stay north of $12.5 million during the last two quarters of the fiscal year. Professional services increased 43.8% over the prior fiscal period to a record $11.7 million. As previously mentioned, we are pleased that implementations are keeping pace with sales velocity and backlog levels have begun to stabilize at near-record levels. We expect professional services to continue to increase sequentially throughout the year and should grow north of 30% for the full fiscal year. Most of our Professional service revenue is related to projects contributing to the acceleration of fiscal year ‘24 subscription revenue. Development for large projects with the corresponding subscription revenue happening in future years has been less than 10% of revenue. Total recurring revenue represented 58.4% of total net revenue for the fiscal second quarter compared to 60.8% of total net revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased slightly because of a 30.3% increase in one-time revenue consisting of products and professional services. Subscription revenue grew at 29.1% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Subscription revenue now comprises higher than 50% of total recurring revenue at 53.6% compared to 48.9% of total recurring revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Subscription revenue increased sequentially $1.6 million and was better than the FY ‘24 expectation for sequential revenue increases. The subscription backlog remains strong and we expect subscription revenue to continue to increase between $0.9 million and $1.2 million sequentially each quarter for the rest of the fiscal year. Q2 was higher than normal due to timing of completion of a couple large multi-product implementations which were in the backlog and were being worked on during prior quarters. Moving down the income statement. Gross profit was $35.1 million, compared to $29.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross profit margin was 59.9% compared to 61.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As expected, gross margin was affected in the first half of the year as we continue to ramp up the services team. Second half gross margin should get back into the 60% range. Combined, the three main operating expense line items, product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensation, were 46.2% of revenue, compared to 46.1% of revenue in the prior year quarter. Product development increased slightly to 22.8% due to previously discussed additional investments made to prepare for large future deployments, compared to 21.9% of revenue in the prior fiscal year. General and administrative expenses decreased to 12.7% compared to 13.7% of revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Sales and marketing increased slightly from 10.5% of revenue to 10.8% of revenue, mostly due to timing of expenses. Operating income for the second quarter of $3.6 million, net income of $4.1 million, and gain per diluted share of $0.16, all increased compared to the prior year's second quarter gain of $2.9 million, $3.1 million, and $0.12. Adjusted net income, normalizing for certain non-cash and non-recurring charges of $6.6 million, was slightly higher than adjusted net income of $6.3 million in the prior year's second quarter, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.25 was slightly more than $0.24 in the prior year period. For the 2024 second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $8.1 million compared to $7.4 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in Q2 FY ‘24 was 13.7% of revenue. Profitability for the quarter was better than previous guidance of high single digits, largely due to higher-than-expected revenue levels. Profitability levels remain comfortably ahead of our prior FY ‘24 guidance of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue of 13%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and marketable securities as of September 30, 2023, was $107.4 million compared to $112.8 million on March 31, 2023. We remain comfortable with our current levels of cash. Free cash flow in the quarter was a gain of $2.5 million, slightly above $2.3 million in the prior year quarter. For the year, we still believe adjusted EBITDA, less CapEx, will be a good proxy for free cash flows. For our fiscal year 2024, we are raising our revenue guidance range to $235 to $238 million, inclusive of an increased expectation of 28% subscription revenue growth. We are also raising our profitability guidance from 13% to 14% adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue for the year. In closing, we are pleased with the sales momentum, professional service improvements, and revenue growth during the first half of the year. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ramesh.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Dave. In summary, we do understand the macroeconomic headlines and the drum beat of predictions of possible expected headwinds. We do not want to sound tone deaf to what we are hearing each day when we listen to the news and read what the economy pundits are saying. However, we can only report what our reality is. The truth is, we are not seeing any signs of slowdown in business momentum. To use a crude example, we are a relatively small fisherman, now operating with state-of-the-art modern equipment, with huge growth potential in a large total addressable market pond with a lot of fish around of all possible sizes. It is possible that we may not feel any negative effects even if there are any ripples or the level of the water shrinks a bit, unless it becomes an enormous drought that overwhelms everything. We have met and spent time with many customers during recent trade shows and other meetings, and have not heard of or seen signs of any reluctance on their part to make the required appropriate technology investments to meet their short-term and long-term business needs. In addition, the massive levels of product innovation we have worked through during recent years, including the creation of around 25 high value creating additional experience enhancer modules, the real tangible value, the modular and integrated solutions are beginning to create for customers, all of that is also providing an additional blanket around us that should protect our growth prospects for the foreseeable future. And we will ensure we remain disciplined managing growth, never getting too far ahead of ourselves. While our implementation services effectiveness and efficiencies have improved significantly during the April to September first half period of this year, the continuing sales success has kept aggregate recurring revenue, services, and product backlog total at a near-record level, giving us confidence in the raised revenue guidance provided. We will also continue to increase our sales and marketing investments as necessary to keep business momentum moving along. To repeat what we said last quarter, our overall business remains in excellent shape and we are well positioned for all-round progress and growth. With that, let's open the call up for questions. Victor?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from line of Mayank Tandon from Needham. Your line is open.\nMayank Tandon: Thank you. Good evening. Well, first, congrats on the quarter and great to hear about the record sales performance. Ramesh…\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Mayank.\nMayank Tandon: Great. Ramesh, let me ask you more just in terms of the growth rate. As you look ahead, how do you break that down between new logo wins, expansion with existing clients, and our full expansion? Could you maybe just parse it out between the three components as we think about growth going forward?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yeah. So when we think about the first half, Mayank, the sales from new customers, that is, internally we refer to it as new logos, new customer sales, when you compare the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, this year's new customer sales success was far higher, was significantly higher than last year. So that remains a big driver of growth for us. More new customers signing up with us is definitely a significant driver of growth. The other driver of growth is whether it is new products, meaning current property signing up for new products, or new customer signing up, our deal sizes are giving us a big advantage now. Typically, customers sign up for multiple products compared to a few years ago. So deal sizes, the fact that customers sign up for multiple products instead of just one, that remains a good growth driver for us. The other growth driver that we expect to get better and better with every quarter is our PMS presence now. Property management systems, where we still -- our market share is still very low, we are becoming an increasing presence in all major PMS RFPs, and the products are also a lot more impressive now. That also is driving our growth forward, while the point-of-sale, POS, strength continues to remain and continues to drive forward. Our current customers also continue to make a lot more investments in us, whether it is new sites or existing customers signing up for services and other existing product purchase expansions, that is driving us as well. And above all, win-loss ratios, right? Without increasing our sales efforts way too much and spending too much, when we participate in an effort, the chances of winning is also much better now than what it used to be in the past. So I would say all that together is driving our growth forward now. And it is all product and innovation driven for now. And our marketing efforts are also getting lot more opportunities to the door now. So I would say it's a combination of all those factors, Mayank.\nMayank Tandon: That's a very helpful color. And as a quick follow-up question, I wanted to focus in on the margins. So the outperformance that you saw this quarter and then that you're guiding to for the remainder of the year, how does that break down between gross margin expansion and leverage on the operating cost line?\nDave Wood: Yeah, so gross margins were about 1 point ahead of expectations, largely just like we talked about due to the higher revenue levels. Certainly the sequential subscription increase of $1.6 million was pretty accretive to the gross margin expansion. So think of it as kind of, one, a point or two ahead on the gross margins. And then, our cost was pretty much settled coming into Q2. I mean, most of our investments for the rest of the year would be incremental. So the higher revenue, obviously, we didn't incur additional OpEx costs. So most of it was the revenue overachievement and the expansion of the subscription revenue.\nRamesh Srinivasan: And, Mayank, what you should expect, like I mentioned in my comments, is margins, we typically measure our profitability as EBITDA by revenue, to improve consistently from here. We've gone through the tough phase when we had to make significant cost investments in order to drive medium term growth and you're aware of that. So starting now you should see a consistent improvement in profitability during the second half of the year and into the next fiscal year as well.\nMayank Tandon: That's great to hear. Again, congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking my questions.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Mayank.\nDave Wood: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Matthew VanVliet from BTIG. Your line is open.\nMatthew VanVliet: Yeah, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess when you made a couple comments around, one, your win rates continue to be very strong, And then also the deals, especially in Europe and APAC, that you mentioned, strength there. So I guess as you think about sort of the big drivers there, and I know you went through a couple on the last question, but curious on how much, if at all, it's been mentioned that the win of the Marriott contract has sort of brought Agilysys more top of mind for potential customers? How much that's helping versus the re-platform product? And then the sales investments, especially in the international markets, driving that? Anything sort of additional on the international side that you would highlight that might be a little bit of a diverging or I guess at least different driver than in the US?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yeah, so whether it's this international or even domestic area where our market share is a bit low, I mean, actually very low, what is driving us to get the opportunities are superior marketing efforts compared to where we were one and two years ago. So those are -- the marketing efforts are definitely opening up opportunities for us. And the product -- the impressiveness of the product demos is definitely keeping us in contention. Now what we need to do is get more reference customers. There are many countries in the world where we have to establish ourselves more because apart from the product superiority and the ecosystem superiority, they also require customers who will give them the comfort feel that yes, we went with these products and we are doing well. That's what we are building now. The product work is more or less done, Matt, and now it is the field work that is beginning in many international regions and even in some domestic areas. So now we are focused on establishing these products, establishing these integrations within our ecosystem in the field and creating more reference customers and then the ball will really start rolling. So the win-loss ratios are very good when customers look at our product demos and nobody else is doing this kind of end-to-end ecosystem innovation. But what we are focused on now is generating more presence in the field, more customers saying great things about our products. That's what we are focused on now.\nMatthew VanVliet: Very helpful. And, Dave, your comments seem to sort of imply that the majority of headcount additions for the full year have more or less been made here. So, one, wanted to just sort of confirm that's what your comments implied. But maybe more importantly, what would give you the confidence or the rationale to add additional headcount in the back half, especially as we think about the continued success of new business wins? Do you need some additional capacity potentially on the services delivery team, especially as the Marriott project ramps up, or where do you stand in terms of total capacity on the delivery team in light of the better bookings performance of late?\nDave Wood: Yeah, so starting with the services team, I mean, we still have ramp left on the services team. I mean, they've done a tremendous job with revenue through the first half of the year, but there's still ramp left on that team, which their gross margin should continue to increase. But, certainly I think we're pretty settled and we're pretty from a headcount, whether it's OpEx or delivery, we're pretty settled on headcount and, certainly for the revenue guidance we've given. But that's not to say that we wouldn't make more incremental investments as we see fit. Right? If other parts of the market start to open up or there's something, we wouldn't be foolish over that. But we feel pretty settled on where we sit from a headcount perspective at the moment.\nMatthew VanVliet: All right, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nGeorge Sutton: Thank you. Ramesh, I appreciate the fishing analogy in particular. So you and I have talked about increasingly you are playing offense versus playing defense, particularly when you're out at a large trade show. I just wondered if you could walk through what exactly you mean by that and help translate that to part of why you're seeing the sales success and the increased guidance.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yeah. So that comment about offense versus defense, like, when you compare us to a few years ago, right, during my initial days here, and even a couple of years after we got here as we started improving the products, whenever you meet customers in trade shows, the success of implementations tends to be measured by the low number of pending issues, pending technical issues. Oh, there are only 10 issues pending to be resolved. That's how they tend to be measured, and you're constantly playing defense with customers, making sure they stay with you despite the technical issues that are there and all that. In recent shows, especially this year, in the various shows we have attended, there were more and more stories, and some of these stories were shared publicly in publicly attended sessions, where they were talking about, we moved from a competing system to Agilysys, we implemented their core PMS product and these two or three additional modules, and these business parameters went up from this percentage to that. So they were actually happy to share those details with other customers, so that's what I mean by playing offense, that we no longer go into trade shows expecting to play defense like many enterprise software companies do, where customers are going to come and complain and you're going to defend with them. Now we are looking for the positive stories that can be shared with other customers. So more and more we are switching to offense from the defense we used to be many years ago and the products are supporting that and our implementation services staff are supporting that. Our support is becoming better as we go along. So there are more positive stories for customers to share with others that provide an incentive for other customers to buy the products as well. That's what I meant, George.\nGeorge Sutton: That's great. So there were clearly some big large operators, particularly in the gaming space, that have had some cybersecurity issues. I know you've made a big investment in your capabilities on the cybersecurity side. Can you talk about any impacts that those have had to you and what happens when cybersecurity becomes part of a sales cycle, which I know is increasingly important? How are you doing in those situations?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yeah, so a number of questions there. Let me make sure I cover all of them. Number one, no impact directly. There's a couple of news that you have heard recently. No direct impact. Our knowledge of the incidents and our overall understanding of the incidents is nothing more than what has been reported publicly. So not impacted directly and we are not directly involved in it, though we were there to help the customers with bringing up the various products back up again, to the extent they asked us for help, of course, we were absolutely always there to help them. So a couple of things to keep in mind here, George, as you think through this. Number one, cybersecurity incidents are not new in hospitality. If you just go look up in the last, say, five years or so, there's quite a list of hospitality customers, our customers, who have been affected by this, because they tend to deal with a lot of guests, lot of consumers, so hospitality tends to be like a magnet, right, it attracts the hackers and cybersecurity incidents tend to happen. So number one, what happened a few months ago is not new. It has happened many times before, so that is one thing to keep in mind. The other thing to keep in mind is our revenue growth now is broad-based. Our sales and revenue growth -- sales growth, revenue growth is broad-based and not too dependent on one, two, or three customers, right? Right across the chain, only in enterprise software, so we are not in the SMB space, but in that enterprise software, the size doesn't matter, there's just a lot of fish in the pond, to use that analogy. Some decisions do get postponed, George, but none of them get canceled, and those kinds of decisions being postponed because they are focused on getting themselves back or tightening cybersecurity around themselves does not too badly affect our sales or anything. The patients get postponed and then they tend to happen a few months later. So it's not any direct impact or something we are too worried about from a sales or revenue growth standpoint. But what we are worried about is making sure we are there to help the customers whenever required and we do help several customers during the year. This is sort of a regular thing, and reasonably frequenting, and we are always there to help customers, we have security specialists with us, and all that. So we are always involved in helping, but I wouldn't be worried about these from a sales and revenue growth standpoint. So we have protected ourselves very well as best as we can. There is no perfection in cybersecurity, multiple layers within the company, very severe training of employees, very stringent training of employees, protecting various layers of our business. And even if a hacker gets through to one layer, making sure they cannot reach much else. So we have worked with several great vendor partners to do increasing investments to make sure that we are absolutely about as well protected as you can be. And also in application design, in the applications we create, information security personnel are always involved. Now it's a joint exercise among IT, information security, and product development to make sure that the products we are creating cannot be used as a weapon later on. Again, there's no perfection there, but we are absolutely doing our best to both protect ourselves and the customers.\nGeorge Sutton: Apologies, I'd love to just squeeze one more in. You haven't said a favorable thing necessarily about managed food service for a while, and this sounds like it was a pretty good quarter. Could you just give us a little bit more specificity in that specific area?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yeah, so the FSM business, George, continues to recover and progress well from COVID time. But if there is a star in this particular first half of sales and Q2 sales, it is definitely resorts and cruise ships. So what we refer to as HRC internally, hotels, resorts, cruise ships, was definitely the star performer compared to how much things have improved over the last couple of years. FSM, I would say, continues to show a steady improvement from the depth of the COVID days.\nGeorge Sutton: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Once again, one moment for our next question. All right, and our next question will come from the line of Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nAri Friedman: Hi, this is Ari Friedman sitting in for Brian Schwartz. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the quarter. I remember speaking about management companies -- mid-size management companies, and the opportunity there. And I was wondering what's like the usual product or module that they land with, and how does this compare to, say, like, your other customers you currently have, and where do you see the opportunity ahead there?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes, hi, Ari. So as far as mid-size management companies, that is one area we continue to make good progress. I would say a good majority of the sales deals we are involved in with such companies tends to be on the point of sale, POS side. And they tend to use the PMS that is suggested or recommended by the various brand names whose brand name tends to be used in those properties. So the best way I would describe it is our progress with midsize management companies continues to improve. We are talking to more and more of them who are keen on looking at our latest product versions. It tends to be more on the POS side at the moment, and the PMS side continues to improve.\nAri Friedman: Got it, thanks. And then I guess like one other question is, you guys talked about strength in POS as well this quarter and last. I was wondering if you could like compare it to like maybe like a baseball analogy. What inning would you say we are in terms of like the growth and how much is left for POS?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Oh yeah, I mean there's a lot of growth, Ari, left for POS. We are doing well with POS. The competitive advantages of POS have been established with all the rewriting and reengineering we have done. We seems to be -- we seem to be ahead of the competitors as far as POS is concerned because we've had a long track record with it, well established product, lot of good stories in the field. So POS has been a strength of ours and it continues to improve, but market share wise, our POS market share is still very low in many areas. So there's just a lot of growth ahead on the POS side, though we are a bit more mature in how we compete in the market. On the PMS side, all the product re-engineering work is done. We've also created like 20 additional modules that are adding a lot of value, but we still have more field work to get done. The product work is done, but as far as establishing the PMS products in the field, having more customers sing the praises of the products, that I would say we are very early in the baseball game. We are in the first or second inning there and that still has to improve. POS were well established, high competitive strength, but still low market share in many areas, both geographical and sales verticals. PMS, all the product work is done. We are in the early stages of establishing ourselves in the field.\nAri Friedman: Awesome. Thank you so much.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Ari.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi from Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNehal Chokshi: Thank you. And a great quarter. Nice to see this big revenue and a big guidance uptick. It sounds like this is being driven by an earlier and expected turn on of some large implementations rather than better-than-expected ACV in the September quarter. Is that correct?\nRamesh Srinivasan: No, Nehal. I would not say that it's correct. The subscription revenue growth was driven by a couple of large projects that went live and our revenue recognition, we only recognize the revenue after they go live. But that has got nothing to do with the sales progress we talked about. The sales progress has been broad-based. It has been particularly high in the resorts and cruise ships and hotels, that space, but gaming casinos continues to do very well. FSM continues to improve, and we had our best half of sales internationally ever before -- than ever before. So sales is broad-based across all our verticals, but subscription revenue growth, the sequential growth this quarter, was driven by a couple of large implementations that went live that we have been working on for quite some time.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay, so to be clear, the main reason why you're raising guidance is because you did have a really strong ACV bookings quarter within the September quarter?\nDave Wood: Yeah, Nehal, we have a strong sales quarter and even despite the large revenue increase, I mean, keep in mind our backlog is still at near record levels. I mean, it's for most of our product lines, it's within the, it's either number one, two, or three as far as record level. So despite the good revenue quarter, there wasn't a depletion in the backlog, which sales has gone really well as well.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. So maybe an additional factor is that the rate of implementation has improved better than expected and that's also a factor in the rate guidance?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yeah. In the revenue doing well, subscription revenue doing well, recurring revenue doing well, the fact that implementation efficiencies are increasing, Nehal, because we had a lot of new products to establish on the field, we are getting more fluent with implementing those new products. We are also getting more adept at dealing with multi-product complex implementations. So yes, all that is contributing to recurring revenue. But us increasing the guidance of revenue also has to do with our sales doing very well and winning new opportunities at a faster pace.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay, can you give a little bit more color as far as how did ACV bookings actually trend in the September quarter more than just simply saying, one of the best ever quarters and for fiscal one-half, best ever. Because when you're growing 20-plus-percent year-over-year, it's kind of like an expectation that every quarter is going to be kind of the best ever.\nRamesh Srinivasan: As far as -- I mean, Revenue, I understand what you're saying, Nehal. Every quarter is generally expected to be our best ever when we are a growing company and doing well. As far as sales is concerned, when you finish a quarter, every quarter you start from zero and you have to build it back again. Our sales continuing to do well has a lot to do with our product strength and has a lot to do with the fact we have a lot more products to sell and in many geographical areas our market share is low. So that's one of the reasons why sales should continue to do well. And some of the color we have given if this quarter was one of our best, but the first half of the year was our best first half of the year of any year as far as sales is concerned, and comfortably higher than last year. Now when you take last full year fiscal 2023, it was a record sales year for us. So this year first half, we made a much better start to the year than even last year.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay, all right. Finally, made a comment last quarter. Sharks and dolphins are in the pipeline. How's the shark and dolphin pipeline looking this quarter, September quarter, relative to June quarter? Has it continued to traject up at a rapid rate? Do you have any graduation of those within the September quarter? Any detail on the sharks and dolphins narrative would be great.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes, I mean, George will also like this analogy, Nehal. Sharks and dolphins continue to play a big part of our sales. So we do have the entire gamut of sales opportunities in terms of size of customers. But during the first half of the year, April through September, there were several sizable sales wins that we had, which were the resort or the cruise ship, they were sizable companies and they also bought multiple products from us with good deal sizes. And that trend, I don't think, there is going to be any slowdown of that trend. When we look at our sales pipeline, there are quite a few doubles and triples that are possible in that sales pipeline. So yes, we do have sizable opportunities, whether you refer to them as doubles and triples or sharks and dolphins, they are there. They were there in the April through September first half, and they continue to be in our pipeline going forward.\nNehal Chokshi: And they've increased in amount in terms of numbers. On a queue?\nRamesh Srinivasan: More and more, yes. We are getting, increasing significant opportunities, mostly because the opportunity sizes are bigger, Nehal, mostly because they tend to buy multiple products from us. The deal sizes are higher.\nNehal Chokshi: Got it. Understood. Thank you and congrats.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you. Thank you, Nehal.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, I would now like to turn the conference back to Ramesh for closing remarks.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Victor. Thank you all for your interest and participation. Enjoy the holiday season. We look forward to talking to you again in about three months when we will be reporting fiscal 2024 third quarter results. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Agilysys Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jessica Hennessy, Senior Director of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations at Agilysys. You may begin.\nJessica Hennessy: Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining the Agilysys' fiscal 2024 first quarter conference call. We will get started in just a minute with management's comments. But before doing so, let me read the Safe Harbor language. Some statements made on today's call will be predictive and are intended to be made as forward-looking within the Safe Harbor protections of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding our financial guidance. Although the company believes that its forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially. Important factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from these forward-looking statements include the effects of global economic factors on our business, our ability to increase profitability, our ability to improve services implementation efficiencies, and the risks set forth in the company's reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a reminder, any references to record financial and business levels during this call refer only to the time period after Agilysys made the transformation to an entirely hospitality-focused software solutions company in fiscal year 2014. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Ramesh Srinivasan, President and CEO of Agilysys. Ramesh, please go ahead.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Jess. Good evening. Welcome to our fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings call. Joining Jess and me on the call today is Dave Wood, CFO and we're at the new Alpharetta, Atlanta headquarters. We moved into here a couple of weeks ago. As has become the norm during our last several earnings calls, we will cover sales first before moving on to revenue and other details. All sales numbers discussed in this and other calls are measured in annual contract value terms. The current stretch of increased sales success, which started around August last year has kept up its momentum during the past few months as well. The state-of-the-art cloud native technology breadth and depth of the functionality feature sets we've built in the end-to-end hospitality-focused ecosystem of software solutions are making our sales value propositions compelling for prospective customers. Fiscal 2024 first quarter sales was the highest we've seen during any April through June period. This was the best sales quarter in APAC in about 3.5 years and that was the top highlight of the quarter with respect to selling success. It was also another excellent sales quarter for the U.S. HRC, Hotels, Resorts, and Cruise Ships sales team. Other sales verticals also kept up their recent progress, rounding out another excellent sales quarter. With respect to sales across product categories, software subscription and services sales during Q1 were respectively 46% and 28% higher than the comparable quarter of last fiscal year. The other highlight was services implementation efficiency picking up during the quarter to match the pace of sales success, resulting in total backlog across products, services, and recurring revenues decreasing slightly, which is a positive for the business. Services backlog by itself remained flat from the sequentially preceding Q4 fiscal 2023 quarter end while product and recurring revenue backlog reduced slightly. Thanks to the improved pace of project delivery during the quarter. Total backlog across products, services, and recurring revenue as of June 30 at the end of Q1 was at 96% of record levels reached at the end of the sequentially previous quarter and 46% higher than at the end of Q1 last fiscal year. With respect to sales deals won during Q1 fiscal 2024 April to June, we added 20 new customers, 18 of whom signed full subscription SaaS agreements. There was an average of about three products or modules licensed for new customers during the quarter. We also added 74 new properties, which did not have any of our products before, but the parent company was already our customer. Of the 94 new properties added during the quarter across new and current customers, about 85% were either partially or fully subscription software license based. In addition, there were 91 instances of selling at least one additional product to properties, which already had one or more of our other products. These 91 new product sales instances included a total of 199 new products sold. Our quota-carrying sales teams strength has increased steadily over the past couple of years, while the average Agilysys tenure of sales personnel is above 7.5 years across the entire team, close to half the team members have been with us for only 2.5 years or less. The value of sales reached closed one by them represented only 6% of total sales during full fiscal year 2023 and it's already 3x higher at 19%, 1-9, at 19% through the first quarter of fiscal 2024. During the first three months of fiscal 2024, the total value of deals closed by this half of the team who have been with us for 2.5 years or less is already at about 72% of the total value of sales closed by this team during all of fiscal 2023. Sales productivity is another growing strength in our business now. On to revenue. Fiscal 2024 Q1 revenue of $56.1 million was a record for the sixth consecutive quarter and 18%, 1-8, 18% higher than the comparable prior-year quarter. This was the best-ever record quarter for all four major revenue categories; subscription revenue, overall recurring revenue, products and services revenue. We are off to a good start this fiscal year and have put ourselves in a good position to achieve our full fiscal year revenue and other annual goals. Recurring revenue during Q1 fiscal 2024 grew to $32.1 million, about 16%, 1-6, about 16% higher year-over-year driven by a 27.4% increase in subscription revenue. Subscription revenue constituted 52.2% of total recurring revenue. Subscription revenue from add-on experience enhancer software modules, most of which were developed in our R&D labs during the past few years constituted 17%, 1-7, 17% of total subscription revenue this quarter compared to 15%, 1-5, 15% during Q1 last year. Our ability to provide end-to-end solutions continues to be a significant competitive strength keeping sales win-loss ratio at impressive high levels. One-time revenue consisting of product and services revenue added up to $23.9 million, close to 21% higher than the comparable prior-year quarter. Services revenue was $11.2 million, the first time we have crossed the $11 million mark during a quarter, and 27.7% higher than Q1 last year. Many of our recently hired services personnel were in a ramp-up mode during the quarter causing services margins to be lower than the sequentially preceding Q4 fiscal 2023 quarter. We continue to expect services margins for full fiscal year 2024 to be around 25% with higher margins expected during the second half of the year. Services implementations increasing in volume and efficiency was another good sign of improving business momentum and has helped our increased confidence in the annual revenue guidance provided. Given the extent of reengineering efforts, new software modules development, product integration initiatives completed, and the dramatic improvements in product innovation undertaken during the last few years, virtually all the implementations we are carrying out in the field today involve software developed, most of them in-house during the past few years. Now that is both the strength and the challenge. The most encouraging aspect of this April to June quarter was all these products and modules becoming progressively easier to implement and support and settling down well in the field. That paves the way for growing improvements in our future ability to scale up and keep improving customer satisfaction levels. That was true this quarter, especially on the PMS side of our business, that's Property Management Systems. We are now involved in more Property Management Systems, PMS sales opportunities than ever before and are encouraged by the PMS credibility we are building with prospective customers. Our competitive positioning against the major very well-established PMS provider is far better today than it was a year ago. We expect core PMS products along with all the add-on experience enhancer PMS software modules, we've integrated the core products with to make increasingly bigger contributions to our short and long-term growth. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $6.3 million and 11.2% of net revenue slightly ahead of our expectations, but still the lowest EBITDA of revenue percentage during a quarter in about three years. As discussed during the last couple of earnings calls, this decline in profitability was caused by recent increases in cost investments in preparation for major business growth opportunities we are making good progress with along with the fact that the first half of each fiscal year tends to be more challenging for us with respect to costs and cash management. The timing of incentive bonus payments, trade shows, professional fees, and several other cash and cost elements, and incoming annual maintenance payments, a majority of which tend to come in during the second half of the fiscal year makes the first half relatively more challenging for us for cash management and profitability. Free cash flow during the past couple of quarters have been affected by increased capital expenditures pertaining to our moving to new offices in our two main U.S. locations Atlanta and Las Vegas. And the fact that India Development Center is also in the process of moving into a single building. We are currently distributed across multiple buildings, which are within one world-class campus in Chennai but are not contiguous. Profitability during the next sequential quarter Q2 fiscal 2024 will also remain compressed due to many of the recent cost increases now becoming applicable for the entire quarter. We expect profitability to then return to our normal previous levels during the second half of the fiscal year. We continue to expect EBITDA by revenue percentage to be around 13%, 1-3, around 13% for full fiscal year 2024 and expect the Q4 exit rate percentage to be higher than the corresponding prior year Q4 exit. As during previous fiscal years, we expect free cash flow to approximate to adjusted EBITDA minus capital expenditures on an annual basis with the unfavorable first half being compensated by the second half of the fiscal year. With that, let me hand the call over to Dave for more color on the financial and other business details.\nDave Wood: Thank you, Ramesh. Taking a look at our financial results, beginning with the income statement. First quarter fiscal 2024 revenue was a quarterly record $56.1 million, an 18% increase from total net revenue of $47.5 million in the comparable prior year period. All three product lines increased compared to the prior year period with product revenue up 15.7% and professional services up 27.7% due to a strong sales quarter with sales up 21% over Q1 fiscal year 2023. Recurring revenue was also up 15.9% with subscription up 27.4% over the prior year period. The backlog remains strong and on track for the FY '24 plan. Q1 FY '24 exit total backlog across products, recurring revenue and services decreased slightly as we deployed more products and started to implement some of our larger projects. The total backlog remained 46% higher than a year ago when comparing Q1 FY '23 exit levels. Product revenue increased 15.7% over the prior fiscal year to a record $12.8 million. At our current sales levels $12.8 million in Q1 FY '24 product revenue should be the high mark for the year. We expect product revenues to level out and remain around $12 million per quarter for the remainder of the year. Professional services increased 27.7% over the comparable prior fiscal year quarter to a record $11.2 million. We are also pleased to see our professional services backlog remained about the same as the last sequential quarter exit as we ramped up the resource strength in the services team and the pace of deployment stayed in sync with sales velocity during the quarter. We expect professional services revenue to continue to increase sequentially through the year and should grow north of 30% for the full fiscal year. Total recurring revenue represented 57.3% of total net revenue for the fiscal first quarter compared to 58.4% of total net revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Recurring revenue as a percentage of total revenue remained around the same level despite a 21% increase in one-time revenues. Like we said on the last call, we expect FY '24 recurring revenue as a total percentage of revenue to remain the same or slightly decrease as we perform professional services for larger customers prior to realizing corresponding subscription revenue growth in subsequent fiscal years. Subscription revenue grew at 27.4% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Subscription revenue now comprises over 50% of total recurring revenue at 52.2% compared to 47.4% of total recurring revenue in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Subscription revenue increased sequentially by $0.9 million and in line with our FY '24 plan. Subscription sales and backlog levels remain comfortably in line with our FY '24 plans. We expect subscription revenue to continue to increase between $0.9 million and $1.2 million sequentially through the year depending on timing of go-lives in any given quarter Moving down the income statement. Gross profit was $33.1 million compared to $28.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Gross profit margin was 59% compared to 60% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. As expected, gross margin percentage will remain lower in the first half of the year as we continue to ramp up our services team. The second half gross margin should return to the low 60% range. Combined, the three main operating expense line items, product development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses, excluding stock-based compensations were 47.8% of revenue compared to 46% of revenue in the prior year quarter. Product development range remained about the same at 20.9% compared to 21.1% of revenue in the prior fiscal year first quarter. General and administrative expenses have remained about the same as well from 14% to 14.3% of revenue. Sales and marketing have increased from 10.8% of revenue to 12.7%, mostly due to the increased number of quota-carrying sales reps and timing of trade shows and other expenses, which tend to be higher during the first half of the year. Operating income for the first quarter of $1 million, net income of $1.1 million, and gain per diluted share of $0.04 were all less than the prior year first quarter gain of $3 million, $2.6 million, and $0.10. Adjusted net income normalizing for certain non-cash and non-recurring charges of $4.6 million was less than adjusted net income of $5.2 million in the prior year first quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.18 was less than $0.21 reported in the prior year period. Fiscal 2024 first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $6.3 million compared to $6.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA in Q1 FY '24 was 11.2% of revenue. Profitability for the quarter was slightly better than the previous guidance of high single digits, largely due to higher-than-expected Q1 revenue performance. Profitability levels remain on track for our FY '24 guidance of adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue of 13%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Cash and marketable securities as of June 30, 2023, was $107.1 million compared to $112.8 million on March 31, 2023. We remain comfortable with our current levels of cash. Free cash flow in the quarter was a loss of $3 million compared to breakeven in the prior year quarter. For the year, we still believe adjusted EBITDA less CapEx is a good proxy for free cash flow. Q1 free cash flow was negative due to working capital adjustments, which are typical in the first half of the year. For fiscal year 2024, we remained comfortably in our expected revenue range of $230 million to $235 million. In closing, we are pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year and remain on plan for fiscal year 2024. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Ramesh.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Dave. In summary, we are pleased with the Q1 April to June quarter results which have given us an excellent start toward reaching our fiscal 2024 financial and other targets. Across several measures, including sales success measured in annual contract value terms, this is the best start we've enjoyed to a fiscal year. While selling success across our traditional strongholds like gaming casinos and foodservice management performed well during the quarter, we were particularly pleased to see APAC sales having a good sales quarter and sales in the U.S. hotels, resorts, and cruise ships vertical where our market shares are not great currently continue its excellent progress. While all those were increasing aspects of business during Q1 fiscal 2024, probably the best news was the improvement in services implementations efficiency which is a good indicator that the recently created products are settling down well in the field and our transformation to a cloud subscription-based business unit built on solid state-of-the-art technology-based solutions is making great progress. This kind of major transition of an organization of our size is not an easy task, and we continue to make excellent progress while managing well the balance between continuing good short-term results and setting things up well for the medium and long term. We are not sure of the so-called J-curve pertaining to such transformations can be managed any better than this. We are confident the profitability did seen in this quarter as we do the needful and make the necessary cost investments to ensure we take advantage of the significant growth opportunities currently in our grasp is temporary and should last at a little less than this level perhaps for only one more quarter. We are being included now in an increasing number of RFP processes especially Property Management System, PMS RFPs, and are currently in the midst of several major exciting sales opportunities across both PMS and POS. From our vantage point, the pace of technology investment decisions and intent to move legacy applications to the cloud remains at a healthy pace in this industry with no sign of any notable slowdown. The momentum that started around August of last year in selling success has continued on that basis regardless of the uncertainty seen in the macroeconomic headlines. Backlog levels across products, recurring revenue, and services are at near-record levels, all that adds up to our continuing confidence in the fiscal 2024 guidance levels provided across subscription revenue growth, overall revenue range, and profitability. The overall business is in excellent shape and well positioned for all-round progress and growth. With that, Lisa, let's open up the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from Matthew VanVliet of BTIG. Your line is open.\nMatthew VanVliet: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon. I appreciate you taking my questions. Ramesh, I wanted to maybe dig in a little bit more and see if you could offer a little bit more commentary around the comments that you made around the - especially the PMS side of the pipeline from a sales activity perspective. Are you being able to pursue or you involved in some larger deals there that might include more standardization across an entire hotel chain for instance or things of that nature? Maybe just help us to understand kind of what's building through that PMS pipeline and how you're going to approach it over the next several quarters?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes, Matt. So overall not only PMS, Matt, across POS, Point of Sale as well. There are several significant sizable deals that are cooking and where we are making great progress with but need not necessarily equate to hotel chains, all the time, Matt. There are many large multi-property multi-site opportunities across the landscape of hospitality, not necessarily always in hotel chains and several of them are progressing well for us and we are very encouraged by the number of larger-sized RFPs that we are currently getting included and especially on the PMS side. But the only correction I would make, Matt, is please don't equate them always to hotel chains. There are several large opportunities building up even outside of the hotel chains and they're all multi-property across multiple sites.\nMatthew VanVliet: Okay, very helpful. Appreciate that. And then on the professional services team, I wonder if you could give us a little more detail in terms of the amount of headcount added during the quarter, potentially more open racks that you might have, or how much hiring you're anticipating the rest of the year as the backlog continues to be high but good to hear that sort of keeping up on the implementation side this quarter but I think a lot of us want to see just a little bit more capacity potentially as you continue to have success on the sales side?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes, Matt. So as far as services is concerned, it's a profit center. And in terms of managing headcount profit centers are always easier to manage or easier for decision-making compared to cost centers. Because cost centers, you're always worried about what is the right level of cost to support the kind of revenue growth we want. But when you look at profit centers, it's quite easy, right? As the profits go up as there is more work you keep hiring. Now to answer your question on services, when we say and without getting into the exact headcount numbers, when we started the fiscal year around the March-April timeframe, we had a target that we needed to hire before June in order to make sure that we have the headcount necessary for the financial plan we had and that recruitment has gone well. We are pretty much there, give or take a couple of employees. The target that we started with for hiring and services, we've done a good job of doing that hiring and we're pretty much there almost to the number. We are happy with our service's strength now. Now, we didn't realize the full potential of that because there is always a ramp-up period involved when the services personnel become more familiar with our products with the integration steps required and all that. So that part of it has gone well. Now, as far as how it will go for the rest of the fiscal year, it just depends on how our sales success works out. Does it go according to plan, does it go better than plan? If it goes better than plans, then we will do the appropriate hiring and services. So services hiring is not a complex decision-making process, Matt. So the short answer is, whatever we planned for at the beginning of the fiscal year, we are there now. We are exactly - almost exactly where we wanted to be end of June. Now how much more hiring we do it just depends on how our sales plan works out. If we feel that we are going ahead of plan, we will continue hiring more into that team. It's a reasonable assumption, Matt, that I expect the services team to be significantly higher at the end of this fiscal year than it is today.\nMatthew VanVliet: And then if I could squeeze one last more in on the Marriott deal kind of build out of that projects maybe any updates on additional milestones from either the product development side or the staffing side that might be helpful just to make sure that that continues to progress and you're doing everything from year-end that you can? Thank you.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes, sure. Thank you, Matt. So starting from the last part of that question, the hiring has gone well, as far as services is concerned, we are pretty much at the strength we needed to be with respect to the services team. As far as the R&D teams are concerned where we were the product development teams, where we're adding resources, we're just about there. We are now in the last 10% or so of the hiring we needed to do for that. So that's gone more or less according to plan. If anything slightly behind plans as far as product development hiring is concerned but we are more or less there. We are now doing the last 10% or so of that hiring. So hiring has gone well. With respect to the deliveries, they have gone well, our portion of the deliveries we are more or less in range give or take a few weeks and we are a critical requirement for the overall Marriott project, but we are not on the critical path, if you know what I mean. So our deliverables are going as according to plan, there is always a few weeks difference between the plan and reality, but there is no concern there. So the project, there is no further update on it and everything is moving along, as mentioned before, and there is no change in that. And all the deliverables so far have worked out reasonably well. And the one thing to note Matt is many of the enhancements to the product since it's a cloud native product and since everything, all the additional enhancements are being built within the product, it is not a customization of the product. Many of the enhancements, Marriott is already in production that can be used by other customers if they require them. So overall, the short summary is going according to plan, give or take a few weeks, we are not on the critical path there are much bigger things that have to happen in the project within Marriott. So far all good no further updates and everything is going according to plan.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great to hear. Thanks for the answers. Appreciate it.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, while we prepare for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Brian Schwartz of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nBrian Schwartz: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my questions. Ramesh, you mentioned in the introductory comments that you had a record sales quarter. I think your commentary suggested that this was in both up selling as well as landing with more products with the new logos. My question is, are you doing anything different with the go-to market to make this happen or is this mostly just strengthening of the end market demand?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes. So this is - hi, Brian. So this was a sales record, Brian for the April through June quarter. This is the best Q1 quarter that we've ever had in sales, so that was an excellent sales quarter for us and like it always tends to happen in our sales, the sales success came from both current customers and from new customers. And of course the new opportunities we divided into three parts. One is brand new customers who have never used our product before. One is new sites, which we have - these are customer - current customers, but that particular property has not seen our product before. And then, of course, a big part of it is new product, which is a current property has a product and now they are buying more products from us. That's how we divide it. And this Q1 sales success was almost equally divided between those two. We had excellent success with new products, new properties and new customers. Our deal size for new customers is among the highest levels it's been at, and a lot of current customers also expanded their sales business with us. So it was a combination of all of that, which is how it tends to be for us, Brian. Our current customers are so happy that we have invested and innovated and done so much with our products. So they continue to invest more and more with us, which is great for us because, obviously, the sales acquisition costs are very low. And new customers, especially the bigger, the sizable opportunities are increasingly more and more last year and this year. So that is also increasing. Now in terms of go-to-market, we have expanded our sales. The last 15 months have been excellent for us as well as marketing is concerned. In terms of digital marketing, in terms of greater reach out to prospective customers, it cannot be any better than what we have done in the last 15 months, especially compared to our past. So the marketing activities have gone well. We are participating more in trade shows, which tends to be one of the best mechanisms where - by which new customers get in touch with us. And also, we have expanded our sales force, which is a major driver for us, like the data that I gave you during the prepared remarks. If you divide our sales force into two halves, Brian, the top half consists of veteran who have been with us for a long time, and then the second half consists of people who have been with us for a maximum of 2.5 years, the second half only contributed 6% of sales all of last fiscal year. And so far, we are already contributing close to 20% - 19% to 20%. And when you take the second half of the sales team, whatever total sales they did all of last year, they've already done close to 75% of that already, in the first three months, 72% or so. So the second half of our sales team is also beginning to contribute a lot, and that has a lot to do with the fact that these new products that the industry really needs is now settling down in the field, which means we have more and more reference customers. The customer satisfaction levels are increasing. And for us, there is nothing greater go-to-market than having more referenceable customers. So all the momentum across marketing and increased sales team, the second half of the sales team contributing a lot more now, which means sales productivity is picking up. All the new products we developed in the last three, four years are settling well in the field. So we are getting more references from there. So all across, the momentum is really increasing well in Brian.\nBrian Schwartz: Thank you, Ramesh. If I could just dig into again how you think about pricing in the market. You've had commentaries. It sounds like the products are doing well. The newer products are settling down, talked about the referenceability. If I think about what's happening in the market this year on price increases, it seems like it's happening almost ubiquitously across software companies. It looks like it's visible in your end market and the RevPAR data, too. So can you talk about the desire to kind of pull that pricing and packaging lever to key pace with some of the market increases that we've been seeing out this year versus maybe just keeping price as is and then using it as a marketing tool against your competitors and just to take market share faster in the hospitality space. And then I have one follow-up for David. Thanks.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes, sure, Brian. I'm not sure if I'm appreciating your question exactly, but let me get started with the answer and please stop and correct me if I'm on the wrong path. So when you look at our pricing levels, Brian, the two main words or phrases I would use is we remain competitive. That's number one. Number two, we are not the lowest vendor. So every RFP, every competitive sales opportunity position we get into, we generally tend to be either equal or the highest pricing vendor. So we have never compromised on that because we invest, like you know, a lot of money in R&D and we are not here to be desperate to win low-margin deals because all customers take a lot of services effort and then take a lot of support effort. And then we have such a big R&D engine that's going to give them value for the recurring revenue they pay us with future software versions. So we are never the lowest vendor. We are, in fact, in almost every opportunity, we are the highest vendor. And we are competitive pricing-wise because we don't want to lose deals either, right? So we are competitive, but on the higher side already. So that's one. Number two is when you sell a package of products, when you sell a combination of products, you have core products and then you have the experience enhanced add-on modules, our pricing tends to hold up quite well without us doing anything artificial because when you think about our competitors, there are different competitors who have strengths in different geographical and other areas, but there is practically no one providing this end-to-end ecosystem of software solutions. When you are practically the only vendor providing that kind of end-to-end solutions, we are able to hold our pricing at pretty decent good levels. We don't want to become too greedy with our pricing. We want to be competitive, but we are happy with where our pricing levels are Brian.\nBrian Schwartz: Thanks Ramesh, you definitely answered the question. David, the one question I just wanted to ask you was just on the - your thoughts on the guidance, the annual guidance. You reiterated at this morning, this afternoon instead of flowing through the upside that you had in Q1. That's matched with all your commentary. It sounds like you have very good predictability in terms of that guidance. My question for you is, did any revenue get pulled forward either from Q2, maybe into Q1 from faster implementations as a cause of holding back on increasing that guidance? Or did your view changed at all on your expectations for the next three quarters just based on the business and what you've been seeing over the last three months. Thanks David.\nDave Wood: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes, I think we're still on track for the year. I mean, obviously, the revenue was a lot stronger in Q1 than we expected. And a lot of the pull forward, like we talked about in the commentary was starting to level out the velocity between our services team and our sales team. I think we were originally expecting that to happen in Q2 or Q3. So it's happening in Q1 helped us pull forward some of the product revenue. It also made the professional service number a little bit better than expected. And I think that's why you'll see the product revenue dip slightly in Q2 through Q4 because there was a little bit of a catch-up with the professional services team doing better than expected.\nBrian Schwartz: Thank you for taking my questions.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thank you, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment while we prepare for our next question. And our next question today will be coming from George Sutton of Craig-Hallum. Your line is open.\nGeorge Sutton: Thank you. I wondered if you could address the concept that you announced the Marriott deal in December, and this was the first time you were presenting at HITEC since that point. Now you're telling us that your PMS opportunities are greater than they've ever been. Can you just walk through sort of the response you're getting from potential customers post this Marriott win and directly what you're hearing in HITEC.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Hi, George. Yes. So the best way I would describe it, George, is our PMS credibility. Though it's in this initial phase is we are what we are happy with now. Given that our two world class of the three products, two of them are cloud-native SaaS products, one of them is about 2.5 years or so really in the field at a mass level, and one of them is about 1.5 years old. So those products have settled down well. So when you think about why is it that we now have PMS credibility where customers feel compelled to include us. And once we are included and they see a guest journey demo, which is an end-to-end demo of all the modules and the core PMS, we got a good shot at winning the deal. Now what is giving us the PMS credibility now? One of them - one of the reasons is the Marriot deal, but I wouldn't put anything there or the Marriott announcement. That has given us PMS credibility, hey, we have to take these guys seriously there. Now remember, we are competing against some very well entrenched competitors who have been sort of dominating the space for well more than a decade. So that has given us credibility. But what has also given us credibility is the fact that these products are settling down well in the field. There are more and more customers who are now realizing the benefits of that. And when it comes to end-to-end PMS functionality, there's really nobody who can compete as a single vendor, they have to bring multiple vendors together to provide the value. So that contributes as well. So all these together is now - are giving us the kind of credibility we've always wanted in the property management system phase. That gets us to the demo stage, that gets us to the inclusion in RFP stage and thereafter the products and our services teams and the quality of our professionals all take over from there. And so compared to where we are, where we were one year ago, we have credibility, we are getting more inclusions in opportunities. We are being included a lot more often, and that is leading to some pretty good-sized deals that we are currently working through.\nGeorge Sutton: Great. If I could move over to Asia, you have suggested that is a challenging competitive market for you. And it sounds like you had a surprisingly strong Q1 in Asia. Can you give us a bigger picture of kind of where you see your competitive set today, where the longer-term Asia opportunities are?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes, George. So the Asia competitive market continues to be very tough because, again, very well entrenched competitors who have done well there for multiple decades, 10, 15, 20 years. So they have done well there. And those competitors in APAC are also not shy to go low in pricing. So there are two battles we fight in APAC: number one, well entrenched competitors and number two, very often low pricing. Now for the last few quarters, last few quarters, we've seen good sales pipeline in APAC. There have been quite a few good opportunities we were working on, but we found the decision-making process to be a bit slow and frustrating because customers have not yet reached the stage where they were willing to pull the plug on the opportunities. It appeared for a while that they were clearly leaning towards us because of the quality of the products and the end-to-end ecosystem and all that, but they were not ready to pull the plug yet. And of course, they were getting much lower price propositions from our competitors as well. This quarter, it looked like we at least partially crossed the bridge. A couple of decisions were made that led us to good sales numbers in APAC. And so what was slowing us down for the last couple of quarters in terms of decision-making speed seems to have picked up in APAC. So we are getting a bit bullish about APAC going forward this fiscal year.\nGeorge Sutton: Great. Finally, if I could just get a little better sense of your less tenured group and the success that they're seeing. Can you give us a sense of how is this less tenured group structured? Are they pointed at specific verticals, specific geographies or specific customer sizes?\nRamesh Srinivasan: The quick answer is no, George. They are all part of our sales vertical teams. Like we have an APAC team, we have an EMEA team. And in the U.S., we have a team that focuses on gaming casinos, a team that focuses on hotel resorts, cruise ships, a team that focuses on food service management and a couple of other teams that focus on specific certain big customers. So that's the way it's always been structured. And within each of the teams, you have the long tenured salespeople who always tend to do very well every year. And then you have the second half of those teams where we have expanded during the last 2, 2.5 years. So it is not as if we take the less tenured sales personnel and focus them on certain areas. They probably handle a less number of customers, current customers and prospective customers, but each team contains a combination of them. And the second half of the team is really beginning to contribute very well now. And the senior half of the team has always done well year after year after year.\nGeorge Sutton: Okay. Good stuff. Thanks for that answers.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Thanks George.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment while we prepare for the final question of the day. Thank you. Our question will be coming from Nehal Chokshi of Northland. Your line is open.\nNehal Chokshi: Thank you. yes, hi, great quarter. It sounds like you had a great ACV booking this quarter, and then I think you specifically called out that subscription ACV was up 46%. And product ACV was up 27% year-over-year bookings basis. So those seem like very strong numbers. Can you just clarify that was indeed above plan?\nDave Wood: Nehal, the backlog was up 46%. Sales was up 21% over last year. So the backlog that was up 46%.\nNehal Chokshi: Got you. That subscription ACV sales that was up 21% year-over-year.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Overall sales. Overall sales.\nNehal Chokshi: Got you. And then backlog was up 46% year-over-year on an overall basis or a subscription basis.\nDave Wood: Total. Total.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Got it. Okay. So I guess still the bottom line is that, is your ACV bookings, was that above your plan or not above plan?\nRamesh Srinivasan: I would say it was in sync with the plan. And if anything, it was slightly above, but it was in sync with the plan. So the reason why Nehal, we have kept the guidance, we reiterated the guidance, is that everything seems to be going according to plan, if anything slightly ahead of plan, but whatever the sales we were expecting for the year, we are well on our way towards achieving it is how it seems slightly based on the Q1 start we have. And we provide - we think of plans on an annual basis, Nehal. That's how we think. We don't try to predict quarter after quarter because that can go a little bit up and down. But when you think about our annual plan, good start to the year. So we are comfortable with the start we have made.\nNehal Chokshi: And just remind me, what is the current lag - average lag between when you broken ACV dollar to when it actually starts especially on the recurring revenue line?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes, that could vary from project to project, Nehal. Like you know, the large project we have talked about, that's going to take a year or two. Sometimes we go live - we generally revenue recognized or we recognize revenue after it is implemented on site. That is how we normally do it. While hardware, of course, you recognize when you ship it and it has reached them, software you recognize it when we ship them. But the recurring revenue, we recognize it only after the go-lives get done. And those implementations can vary. Some projects could happen in a matter of weeks. Some projects could take two, three months and sometimes it could take six months. It just depends Nehal. And a lot of the implementations we are working through now are what has been sold in the previous quarter and so on and so forth, right? So that could vary from project to project Nehal.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes. Okay. Great. So what sort of threshold in ACV bookings do you guys have to hit in terms of year-over-year growth in the upcoming next two quarters in order for you guys to say, hey, we now see our revenue being above current guidance or for being below the current guidance?\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes. So when you look at the sales this year, how it has gone in Q1 so far, it's a good start. If anything, it's a little bit better than what we were bargaining for. So it's a good start. So we feel comfortable about the revenue guidance we have given now. If it continues to go according to plan, I would say we will stay in sync with the revenue guidance we have given. If it does much better than what we are bargaining for, for the year, then we will see. We will cross that bridge when we come to it.\nNehal Chokshi: Okay. Got it. And then you talked about the increase of contribution to ACV bookings for representatives less than 2.5 year in tenure. Why you said 2.5 year tenure cutoff for this metric?\nRamesh Srinivasan: No particular reason, Nehal. So we keep track of sales productivity across our whole sales team. And the way it sort of works out is when you look at our quota carrying sales people across the world, it just - you have to draw the line somewhere. And when we looked at about the top half of the team, they have been - they're a long tenure with us, like seven, eight, 10 years, 15 years kind of tenure they have with us. And then we just drew the line at about half the team size, and that's where we came up with the 2.5 years. And after COVID, in terms of expansion of the sales teams, started happening a couple of years ago. That is why we drew the line there. No particular scientific to that but it's a pretty good indication, right? We have a set of salespeople about half the team that have been with us for a prolonged long time and who always tend to contribute a huge majority of the sales. So in terms of our sales success increasing, we were also focusing on the second half of the team, which is a little bit less - a lot less tenured with us than Agilysys. So it's just one of those cutoffs, no particular scientific reason behind that Nehal.\nNehal Chokshi: For the reps are less than 2.5 years, are you seeing differentiation in terms of their ramp in productivity in terms of maturity within that 2.5-year period.\nRamesh Srinivasan: Yes. It always is true, Nehal, that some portions of the group are doing better than the others. But overall, when you take them as a group, we are extremely happy with how they are doing this fiscal year. I mean, last year, like we told you, they contributed 6% of total sales and now they are at a run rate of 19%, 20% of what they contributed of the total sales, but the biggest start that we gave you is if you take their total sales last year, they've already done about 72% of it in the first three, four months So that's incredibly good. So as a group, they are doing far better. And that is great for us because that means the sales productivity is continuing to increase quite significantly.\nNehal Chokshi: Yes, okay. Great.
