[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKris Newton: Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian, and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns, and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our Q3 FY 2024 call. I'm pleased to report, that we delivered exceptional performance across the board, despite an uncertain macro environment. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by the momentum of our expanded all-flash product portfolio. This strength coupled with continued operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for consolidated gross margin, operating margin, and EPS for the second consecutive quarter. Entering FY 2024, we laid out a plan to drive better performance in our Storage business and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business, while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macroeconomy to further improve our profitability. These actions have delivered strong results to-date, support our raised outlook for the year. And enhance our position for the long-term. Only NetApp delivers a comprehensive architecture based on a single operating system, that supports any application or data type, spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments, and is available in traditional CapEx or as-a-service procurement models. Our unified data solutions, address some of the biggest priorities IT organizations face today, modernizing legacy infrastructure, improving resiliency against ransomware attacks, and building scalable, high performance data pipelines for AI workloads. The consistent operations, common management tools, integrated data services, and unique and proven capabilities for Hybrid Cloud of our unified storage architecture, provides customers the ability to simplify at scale and lower storage costs. Our silo-free approach to unified data storage is clearly resonating with customers, driving healthy demand for our products and services, and positioning us well to deliver long-term growth. Turning to the results of the quarter, we delivered robust year-over-year performance in our Hybrid Cloud segment with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 10%, driven by momentum from our newly introduced all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year. Strong customer demand for our industry leading all-flash solutions drove all-flash growth of 21% year-over-year, to an all-time high annualized revenue run rate of $3.4 billion. In Q3, our all-flash business expanded to approximately 60% of Hybrid Cloud segment revenue. As Mike will detail, we expect a sustainable step-up in our baseline product gross margin going forward with the continued revenue shift to all-flash. The AFF C-Series all-flash arrays again exceeded our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. As customers modernize Legacy 10k Hard Disk Drives and Hybrid Flash environments, we are displacing competitors' installed bases with our All-Flash Solutions, driving share gains. Our newly introduced ASA families, of SAN-optimized, high-performance and capacity-oriented all-flash arrays also outperformed our expectations. We're excited about the enormous potential in the nearly $20 billion SAN market. Our modern all-flash SAN arrays, backed by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees, are well-positioned to redefine the competitive landscape. In Q3, we had numerous competitive take-outs across a broad set of workloads and vertical markets as customers leveraged our C-Series and ASA products to modernize their legacy infrastructures and deploy new applications like Artificial Intelligence. We continue to see strong interest in our advanced portfolio of Ransomware Protection Solutions. We help customers, take proactive steps to protect, detect, and recover their data. Competitive Solutions focus only on data recovery, but NetApp keeps data protected and secured from the start with products designed to block cybersecurity risks and mitigate the high cost of downtime. ONTAP is the first Enterprise-Class Storage Solution validated by the NSA for the Commercial Solutions for Classified Program, demonstrating the strength of our state-of-the-art, data protection and cybersecurity solutions. We saw good momentum in AI, with dozens of customer wins in the quarter, including several large NVIDIA SuperPOD and BasePOD deployments. We help organizations in use cases that range from unifying their data in modern data lakes to deploying large model training environments, and to operationalize those models into production environments. To best take advantage of Generative AI capabilities, customers are looking to augment foundational models with their own data. Our high-performance, scalable unified data storage systems create intelligent data pipelines that allow customers to capture, aggregate and prepare their data for AI. NetApp delivers the data management capabilities for security, performance, and simplicity that enterprises require for their GenAI workflows. We continue to advance our position with the development of GenAI driven cloud and on-premises solutions in partnership with industry leaders. Demand for consumption options is also growing as some customers look to increase budget flexibility in an ongoing uncertain macro and higher interest rate environment. However, this is not a universal mandate. Our unified data storage solutions are available as CapEx, as-a-service, and cloud native offerings, providing customers with the widest range of buying options, enabling them to meet their budget requirements. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering, delivered another strong quarter, with revenue growing triple-digits from Q3 a year ago. Keystone is a great solution for customers who want a cloud-like operating model on premises. For customers who are ready to move to the cloud, we uniquely partner with the leading hyperscalers to deliver cloud-native storage services. Public Cloud segment revenue was $151 million, up 1% year-over-year. First party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly, with the ARR of these services up more than 35% year-over-year. These offerings are highly differentiated and tightly aligned to customer buying preference. We continue to deepen our hyperscaler partnerships, and deliver growth in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR with this part of the portfolio. As I outlined last quarter, we are taking action to sharpen our approach to our Public Cloud business. As a part of this plan, we exited two small services in the quarter. We also began the work of refocusing Cloud Insights and InstaClustr to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings and integrating some standalone services into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes to widen our competitive moat. In Q4, we anticipate approximately $20 million in ARR headwinds from unrenewed subscriptions. This will create minimal revenue impact and should be largely offset by growth in first-party and marketplace services. We will continue refining our focus in fiscal year 2025, building a stronger base from which to grow. Our hyperscaler partnerships and natively integrated storage services, position us to address the new and emerging GenAI opportunity in the cloud. A leading open-source developer of GenAI tools, datasets and models is leveraging AWSâ€™ FSx for NetApp ONTAP as a part of its offerings. The customer was looking for a high-performance and resilient file storage solution to train extensive AI/ML workloads. FSxN gave them a scalable solution with performant storage for intensive AI model training. As a fully managed service, FSxN removes operational burdens, allowing their DevOps teams to focus on business value activities. In summary, we entered the final quarter of fiscal year '24 in a much stronger position than we were at the start of the year despite the ongoing macro uncertainty, our modern approach to unified data storage, which spans data types, price points and hybrid multi-cloud environments is resonating in the market. We are successfully executing against our top priorities, growing in all flash and cloud storage services. We are well positioned with an expanded TAM, including block storage, and new market opportunities like AI to drive continued growth and share gains. We are moving to a higher product margin profile, supported by growth in all-flash products. And we will continue to maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. I'm very pleased with our momentum and very confident in our ability to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. Finally, I want to make you aware of our June 11, Investor Day, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy and business model. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, all numbers I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Our focus and strong execution again delivered record-setting results, reaching all-time highs across key profitability measures, including consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, net income and EPS. Before I discuss the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As George noted, we continue to see positive results from our new all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we implemented at the start of the fiscal year. The momentum from our industry-leading flash portfolio, coupled with our operational discipline, drove both top and bottom line growth in the quarter. Q3 consolidated gross margin of 73% and product gross margin of 63% and were both at all-time highs for the second consecutive quarter. Gross margin leverage and operating discipline drove operating margin of 30% and EPS of $1.94, both also setting company records for the second consecutive quarter. Q3 operating cash flow came in at $484 million, and free cash flow was $448 million. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least $1.3 billion, tracking relatively in line with net income. The strong execution of our priorities of winning in flash and growing first-party cloud services are clearly paying off. Given our strong execution of results that met or beat our guidance ranges, while driving record-setting profitability measures for the second consecutive quarter, we are once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Looking ahead, we are even more confident in our position to drive long-term revenue growth and profitability. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q3 billings increased 7% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, driven by momentum in our all-flash array product families. Hybrid cloud revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and product revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $747 million. Support revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $631 million. We are pleased with the success of moving the responsibility for the majority of our renewals to the customer success team implemented as a part of our go-to-market focus. Public cloud revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $151 million. As expected, growth was driven by our first party and marketplace cloud storage services offset by declines in subscription services. Now for our operating results. Q3 consolidated gross margin was 73%. Gross profit margin dollars increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion driven by strong growth of product gross profit dollars. Q3 product gross margin of 63% was 250 basis points higher than the high-end of our guide, primarily driven by better-than-expected mix shift to all-flash products and pricing discipline in what remains a cost-sensitive environment. Operating expenses of $682 million increased 5% year-over-year and declined slightly from Q2 as expected. As a result of operating leverage and disciplined management, Q3 operating profit dollars increased 30% year-over-year to $485 million and operating margin increased 580 basis points from a year ago to 30%, a record for the second consecutive quarter. EPS grew 42% year-over-year to a record high of $1.94. Our tax rate was 18%, lower than expected due to an adjustment of our full year tax rate. Normalizing for a tax rate of 21.5%, EPS would still have been a record high of $1.86. Q3 operating cash flow of $484 million was up 28% year-over-year, and free cash flow was up 40% year-over-year, driven by solid billings and profitability. DSO was 45% and inventory turns were 14, both consistent with expectations. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $1.1 billion increased 23% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $203 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $526 million in net cash. Year-to-date, we have generated $963 million in free cash flow and returned more than 100% to stockholders. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q3 was $4.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Before moving to Q4 and fiscal 2024 guidance, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our product gross margin expectations going forward. We have seen the price increases on NAND from suppliers, and these increases will impact all industry participants. The mix shift to our higher-margin all-flash products will partially offset the headwinds from these price increases going forward. As a result of our shift to all-flash, we expect product gross margin to expand to the upper 50% to 60% from our historical norm of approximately 55%. Please note, in any given quarter, commodity prices, product mix, and the pricing environment will cause product gross margin to fluctuate from this new baseline. That being said, I want to make sure to reiterate this point: even with the increase in commodity costs we fully expect our product gross margins to expand to the upper 50% to 60% level driven by the shift to our all-flash portfolio. Now letâ€™s turn to guidance. As George noted, we are pleased with the results of our focus and continued operational discipline. Given our better-than-expected results and our improved outlook for Q4, we are again raising our FY 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $6.185 to $6.335 billion, or $6.26 billion at the midpoint. We expect to see continued strength in all-flash products and Hyperscaler First Party and Marketplace Services. FY 2024 consolidated gross margin is expected to be in the range of 71% to 72%. Product gross margin is expected to be approximately 60%, driven by the continued favorable mix shift to all-flash products. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 27% and EPS to be in the range of $6.40 to $6.50, with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $40 million and share count of 212 million. Our full year tax rate is projected to be 20%. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least, $1.3 billion. In Q4, we expect revenue to range between $1.585 billion and $1.735 billion, which at the midpoint of $1.66 billion implies an increase of 5% year-over-year. We expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71%, and product gross margin to be approximately 60%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 27% to 28%. Implied in this guidance, we expect operating expenses to increase from Q3 due mainly to higher incentive compensation, the timing of marketing programs and targeted investment to drive key product roadmap items. Our tax rate is expected to be 20% and EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.83. Also please note that our purchase commitments for NAND for FY 2025 demand will impact our cash flow and balance sheet in Q4, which is included in our updated cash flow forecast and will result in inventory turns to be in the eight to 10 times range. In closing, I want to thank our customers, partners, employees and stockholders for their unwavering commitment and investment in NetApp. We continue to prove our ability to manage the elements within our control and our solid top-line results demonstrate the value that customers realized from our products and services. Our innovative portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments and we remain committed to delivering sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I guess, George, you went into a lot of detail just around what you're seeing on the AI side. I guess if you could just get a sense of when you're seeing the timing of maybe people making investments versus -- kind of the various stages of AI? And then maybe just as a follow-up question, just what you're seeing in terms of the competitive environment just in terms of kind of innovative thinking around AI solutions. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you for your question. I think we're in the early phases of the GenAI opportunity. As you know, we have been in the AI market for a long time and have seen a lot of examples of proven use cases in predictive AI. We are starting to see the early phases of Generative AI. And what I mean by that is customers collecting and unifying their data and starting to augment the foundational models with their own data, so that it is more relevant to their business. We expect that to continue for several months or a year, and we think that the deployment of production models and the movement from training to inferencing, becomes more relevant as we head into next year. With regard to the work that we have seen, we had a really strong quarter in the flash business. And weâ€™ve got several eight-figure deals in Q3, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies build their AI supercomputer NetApp, one of the world's largest genomics company relying on our technology to speed up genomic analysis with NVIDIA and NetApp, one of the world's largest media companies is using us to drive some of the early phases of their Generative AI work. And we also have examples in the public cloud where one of the world's largest open source model providers is using NetApp's cloud technology to enable their customers to access and train their models. So we've got real many different examples of success. I think if you draw out our strength is scale and performance, super part certification, the fact that we can build a hybrid cloud data pipeline and the data management capabilities that we've had for many years that allow you to do things like model versioning, security for your mission-critical data and be able to deploy and connect data pipelines from production back into training. So I feel really good about our strength in the AI market. It's early around GenAI, and we are doing the work to expand our opportunity there.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nEddie Pellon: Hey guys, this is Eddie for Chris. Congrats on the great execution here. George, I think many people still underappreciate how file services is an AI beneficiary. For example, if you set up an AWS SageMaker account, developers can have plenty of file services options, including NetApp's FSX, so maybe talk about what differentiates FSX versus other file services, and what kind of customers you attract, what use cases is it used for? And if you can touch on how big ANF and FSX are within public cloud, that would be great. I do have another question, please.\nGeorge Kurian: First of all, I think that unstructured data is the vast majority of the value in Generative AI. Generative AI really operates on documents and objects and videos and images and a variety of those data sets. And as you know, NetApp has a huge percentage of the enterprises unstructured data stored or systems. We help them in a few different ways. One way that we help them is if their data science team that's building AI training and building some of their models, wants to start in the public cloud, you can very quickly and easily take data from your enterprise environment securely into the public cloud and use it in the public cloud. Second, as you know, we have very high performance scale-out solutions like the one that we referred to on the call, we're one of the world's largest open source model providers is using our high-performance scale-out SSX solutions on Amazon to do model training. And then the third is in the enterprise itself, if the enterprise wants to scale that production environment, we have certifications with NVIDIA, for example, that allows them to quickly build a super part with us, train it and then deploy the trained models into production. So we feel very, very confident about the expanding opportunity in front of us. We've had several good wins and we are investing to expand our opportunity in this space.\nEddie Pellon: That's very helpful, George. Thank you. And one for Mike quickly. Can you give a fresh, please our memory about how customer behavior has historically changed when NAND prices increase aggressively in short periods of time? Like do they usually reduce purchases of all flash arrays and go more to hybrids? Or is NAND a small percentage of the bill of materials today, because of a very low pricing, where a 50% increase in NAND prices, for example, will not meaningfully change the system price you guys charge customers. That's it for me. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Yes. Eddie, there was a lot of questions in there. What we'd say is a couple of things. Remember, customers' budget based on dollars, and that's the way that they purchased. We haven't seen anything like in the last year in terms of really NAND prices declining as much as they did. More than anything, we think that, that has made SSD flash technology more affordable, all the benefits that you get around environmentals and economics as well as energy now make that a much better economic decision for them. So that's really the change that we've seen. Short-term -- other short-term changes really don't change the market that much because, again, these are long-term decisions companies are making.\nGeorge Kurian: And just to add to that, SSDs are not 50%. They are less than 50% of our bill of materials or probably anybody else's bill of materials.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Cardoso: Hey. Thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So, first one for me. It seems like you continue to see strong momentum with the C-Series and the other new flash products that you guys have introduced and they even appear to be outperforming your expectation in each quarter. So just curious, if you could talk to how momentum for those products have tracked through 3Q and into 4Q to-date. It doesn't sound like you're seeing any signs of that momentum slowing down, but can you just confirm that. And do you expect that we're still very much in the early innings of these product cycles with your customers? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. Maybe I can address that in three ways. I think the C-Series product cycle is to modernize both, traditional hybrid flash systems as well as deploy new private cloud environments, and we are seeing strong advantages there. That's the first use case. And you can see we do not see any end to that. The 10-K drive transition is a multiyear transition. We're in the early stages of that. On the private cloud side, I think some of the changes in licensing that some of the software vendors have, have renewed interest in our technology as a vehicle to give them -- give customers a path to the future. The second opportunity is the ASA product family. NetApp has had a long history in the block storage space, we've had tens of thousands of customers using our technology to serve block workloads, and we are in the early innings of bringing out a package solution that's focused solely on the block market. And we've been pleased with both of those use cases. And then the third area, of course, which is set for rapid expansion and growth is AI. And I feel really, really good with the focus on execution. Every time we've set a set of targets internally, we've been them and we've raised them externally. And so, we got strong momentum. We're going to stay focused and disciplined in our execution going forward.\nJoe Cardoso: Got it. I appreciate the color there, George. And then just as my second one, it appears the appetite from customers to consume storage more on a consumption basis is increasing based on our checks with the channel as well as comments from you and your peers. I know you touched on the driver being in some part due to this uneven macro that we're seeing. But are you seeing anything else as a driver there, like the maturity around the offerings or go-to-market motion. The reason I'm asking, it just feels like it wasn't too long ago when the opportunity here felt more theoretical and there was not as much appetite coming from the customers. So I would just be interested to hear, like has anything changed on that front? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think there's probably two or three things. I think the maturity of the offerings. I think customers comfort around how they would procure cloud-like models. I think the second is the increase in interest rates that on the margin caused certain customers to think about CapEx versus OpEx. And then the third, of course, is the customers that are in transition from one environment to another. For example, when you're in a data center transition and you've got a portion of the life of a data center environment that needs to be continued, moving to an as-a-service model is a good transition point. We have offered as a service for many years. Clearly, the most flexible, the fastest and the easiest to build an elastic environment, is around true public cloud. We also have solutions with colocation providers like Equinix that allows the customer to get a full cloud-like opportunity in a colocation environment, connected to the Public Cloud and our Keystone service in the customers' data centers had another really strong quarter. We are up year-to-date almost more than triple-digits, including this past quarter. So we see strong momentum in that category. And we do not see a mandate for it, but it's a nice new way for us to address a set of customer buying preferences.\nJoe Cardoso: Great. You appreciate the questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question today comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. George, I just wanted to better understand the current competitive landscape for fiber storage market, especially given the AI application. And I have a follow-up.\nGeorge Kurian: It's always big competitive. There are different vendors that come and go in the market. I think if you look at the installed base of unstructured data, that becomes the vehicle to build data pipelines for AI and ML applications, NetApp has a very strong position. And we have the only solutions that allow customers to build hybrid cloud pipelines to build solutions that are super scalable and high performance. But also have the security protection and data management that AI will need as these models get scaled. So I feel really good about our position and look forward to continuing to expand our presence in that market.\nMehdi Hosseini: Maybe perhaps I could rephrase my question. Mike just, raised is product gross margin to 60%, which is pretty much what you're guiding for the January quarter. You're also increasing use of QLC. So should we anticipate some flexibility with pricing that QLC gives you, by remaining competitive with your competitors? Because I don't see gross margins already at work the new target is. So where do we go from here?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think that, first of all, the mix shift from hard drives to flash, in our business continues. And it's an important kind of underlying factor that gives us confidence that we are raising the structural baseline product gross margin, as Mike said, from the mid-50s, which has been a historic norm to the upper-50s and up to 60%. The mix shift is the most important lever in that equation. The second, of course, is the value of our ONTAP Software and the ongoing management of the commodity supply chain. I think all of those, factor in. I think that we are uniquely positioned with our operating system to benefit from using QLC in a broad bench of applications. Currently, only another one other vendor has QLC based all-flash arrays, and it gives us an opportunity to go target other vendors who don't have QLC support. So we feel really good about our solution. And I would tell you that AI and all of these enterprise applications are not just about price. They're about value, and we built a real good value for our customers over many years.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nMike Cadiz: Hi, good afternoon. This is Mike Cadiz for Asiya at Citi. So my one question is, given ongoing -- in the AI field, given ongoing security and data sovereignty concerns by many companies, is there anything notable in the customer conversations regarding AI model placements, whether on-prem or in the cloud or any other architecture preferences that they may have?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think that data is the foundation on, which AI is built. And if you look at what enterprises are doing today, they are augmenting foundational models with their own data to bring the relevance of AI to their business and their organizational needs. As a result, issues like malicious injection of bad data into a data landscape can cause huge impacts on AI, the ability to maintain data security, privacy, and lineage is are all conversations that are happening regardless of the regulatory environment, and they will only get stronger as the regulations get enforced like you are seeing, for example, in the European Union. This gives the needs to have data management across the life cycle of AI extreme importance, and we are exceptionally well-positioned, having the capabilities to build secure, private environments in the public cloud, as well as in customers' data centers.\nMike Cadiz: Okay, got it. Thank you very much. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: Hey, thanks, and congrats on the strong results here. Mike, can you give us some early thoughts on fiscal year 2025. And what are the key things we should be thinking about when modeling fiscal year 2025 here?\nMike Berry: Yes. Thank you for the question, Nehal. So when going into fiscal 2025, we've talked about it, hey, we feel really good about the momentum that we have in Q3 as well as the guidance that we built in Q4. We've talked about the momentum around C-Series. George talked about all the industry, trends that are also tailwinds for us. And when you look at all of the priorities that our customers are looking at, we feel like we're really well-positioned. We've given you a good view of where we think our product gross margins will land. The support business continues to be an important driver of profitability as well. And we will continue to be prudent around our investment to make sure that we drive growth. We want to do that. We want to make sure that we are disciplined in our spending. But hey, there are some things that we also need to do and want to do to be able to continue to drive the top line. I think we've done a lot of great work around cloud to be in a much better position for next year. George talked about the 35%-plus growth in cloud storage in first-party marketplace. And Eddie asked that question as well. In the quarter, cloud storage continues to grow as a percentage. It's now closer to 65% from a revenue perspective. So that's where the growth will be. And then, we will continue to do the right things around return of capital to shareholders. We always want to leave flexibility for investments, but we also want to make sure that we're mindful of our share count. So without trying to guide 2025, that's only the best Readers Digest version, I can give you.\nNehal Chokshi: That's fantastic. If I may, how should we think about the support revenue? You're coming off 4 quarters of year-over-year product revenue declines now that you're back into year-over-year growth on the product revenue, how long do you expect the Support revenue start to cut back up basically?\nMike Berry: Yes, great question. And we look at this a lot, obviously. So in the last two quarters, we've seen deferred revenue actually decline year-over-year. A couple of things to haul, keep in mind, that what you see on the balance sheet as a total deferred, it also includes cloud that has declined a little bit more than the Support business in the last two quarters. 90% plus Support will come off the balance sheet, so you can take a hard look at that. But what we've also seen is a different trend where instead of tech refreshes we've seen a lot of customers renew their Support for up to a year, and that has also helped continue to drive Support revenue. You don't see that as much in deferred. But the big driver will be growth in product revenue drives additional Support revenue with the multiyear Support. You'll see that in billings. You'll see that in deferred revenue. So we feel good about being able to get that growth in Support. I think it was 2% this year, hopefully, at least that and going forward, if product -- when product revenue grows, support revenue should follow. It will be a little bit of a lagging indicator a couple of quarters, but it will definitely follow because of the business model.\nNehal Chokshi: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Yes. Congrats I mean congrats on a strong number of quarters here and really good ongoing execution. And I guess George, that's I guess what I'd like to ask, I guess the first question is -- and I'm sorry if you spoke to some of this, I was -- there's a few calls going on tonight. So I came on late. But to what degree the last couple of quarters or so, do you think that the strong product growth that you guys have put up. I'm going to try to actually parse to the degree that's possible. Is the result of new product features, kind of new products, things that customers are doing beginning to do sort of differently with their data? It sounds like not really a material GNA benefit yet, which makes sense. But if you could parse -- if there's any way to parse through those things, that would be helpful. And then, I guess the second part of the question is, I think I heard you make mention of you think there is like a tail to this going forward. And I mean is part of what you're saying is that you think the product demand sort of outlook begins to look a lot different as you go through calendar 2024 and then maybe even beyond? I know that's a lot, but I'd appreciate that. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. Listen, I think, first of all, the macro has stayed relatively consistent the whole time. It is uncertain. It's not getting worse, but it is not the fundamental reason for the improvement in results. The second is the two biggest reasons for improving our results. One is product and the second is focus on go-to-market execution. Let me hit on, in terms of product, we brought the world's best operating system to two or three major new opportunities. We brought it to a price point in the all-flash market that we have not addressed before with the QLC flash offerings. We brought the world's best operating system to a block storage opportunity that multibillion dollars, multiple tens of billion dollars that we had never built a purpose-built block storage product for. And we are continuing to see an expanding range of AI opportunities as customers are doing both training as well as building context called retrieval augmented generation drag. And so all of those have driven improvements in our results. I think the other part of the equation would be to recognize the benefits that we've had from focus in our go-to-market. We have prioritized two areas; the hyperscaler marketplace and first-party cloud storage services in public cloud. And we have focused on our all-flash portfolio as the two major priorities, and we have had strong results in both of them, and I'm very pleased with the results.\nAnanda Baruah: That's great context. I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up for Mike here. Mike, you talked about attach in some context. And I guess I just wanted to ask you with the operating margins already in the high 20s, philosophically, is there any reason why with everything you have going on with mix and attach over time, you couldn't touch 30% operating margin?\nMike Berry: So we did this quarter, Ananda.\nAnanda Baruah: Sorry, it's funny. I haven't -- yes, I apologize. I have to with all the numbers I had you didn't -- that's a miss on me. So well, let me just ask you then, let's start there. Like I mean, should we just expect mix up then going forward? I mean, how are you thinking about like showing the margins in the P&L versus doing something else with the op income dollars as mix continues to work in your favor? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Yes. And no apologies necessary. I know you folks are busy today. So hey, we're super excited about the 30% margin. And a lot of that. There's all 12,000 employees that helped us on that number. We've guided to 27% to 28% inQ4. What I would say is that we very much want to continue to be able to grow the business. And even as a CFO, I know, hey, we need to invest in some areas. There are some product investments that we need to make. We want to make sure that the go-to-market continues to have sales capacity. We've said it at the last Analyst Day, we'll say it again, which is we want to invest, but our goal is always to grow OpEx at a lower rate than revenue to drive the margins up. Where those go really depends, I think, on a couple of things. One is how well we can continue to grow product revenue, that's obviously a big piece. And that then drives storage, which was Nehal's question around -- I'm sorry, around which is a big piece. So we don't have a target in mind. And quite frankly, the other thing I just want to make sure and underline, this is both gross -- product gross margins and operating margins. Hey, we love the dollars more. And so our goal is to be able to drive dollars. That may mean that, hey, margins stay relatively consistent or they go up or down in a quarter. Our goal is to drive more revenue, more gross margin dollars, more operating that then goes to EPS. So I don't want to give you a target. Now we'll talk about this a little bit in June. There is that trade-off.\nAnanda Baruah: Thank you. Thatâ€™s super helpful. Thanks a lot, Mike.\nMike Berry: Thanks, Ananda\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nIrvin Liu: Hi. Thank you for the question. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. George, you mentioned new customer wins resulting from the displacement of competitor 10K hard disk drive and hybrid deployments with C Series. But can you give us a sense on what the upsell opportunity looks like for some of your other product lines such as A series and public cloud services, particularly with these new customers.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, we always start with one environment, and then we can cross-sell other environments into the customer. I think what we have seen quite clearly in the market is that the idea of having multiple different operating systems and storage landscapes in our customer is causing cost, complexity and security vulnerabilities and the idea of going to one consistent architecture across multiple landscapes is clearly seeing resonance and customers. And I think that as we have got obviously both unified, as well as block focused offerings across high-performance AFF A Series, as well as more value-oriented C-Series products, we see opportunity to not only win one part of our customers' footprint, but over time, win all of their footprint. The work that we've done in public cloud allows us to penetrate accounts that we don't have a relationship with using the public cloud sales motion. And as we have shared many times, the number of new to NetApp customers in the public cloud sales motion is very strong, and we are excited about that. We continue to see good progress on that front even this past quarter.\nIrvin Liu: Thanks. I also had one follow-up. Just on the dip in your mix of U.S. public sector revenue. Was there anything to call out here just in terms of government IT spending?\nGeorge Kurian: It's just normal seasonality. I think public sector actually was a strong number for us across the globe and nothing other than normal seasonality for us.\nIrvin Liu: Got it. Thatâ€™s all I had. Thank you.\nKris Newton: All right. Thanks, Irvin.. I'm going to pass it back to George now for some closing comments.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you, Kris. Let me reiterate my strong confidence in our position to drive continued growth and profitability despite the uncertain macro. We've sharpened our focus, improved our execution and successfully introduced new products that expand our addressable market. Capacity flash, block storage and AI all represent enormous opportunities for us. We are performing well in these areas and expect continued growth. We have taken the actions needed to improve the health of our cloud business, creating our healthier business to drive growth in fiscal 2025. We are capitalizing on our share gain opportunity and we'll maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. Thank you for your time today, and I hope to see you at our June 11, Investor Day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."

[Operator Instructions] After todayâ€™s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKris Newton: Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us.

During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. Iâ€™ll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q2 improved on our solid start to FY 2024 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance while our operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. We remain relentlessly focused on managing the elements within our control while driving better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive results from these actions, with increased profitability and a stronger position for delivering long-term growth. In Q2, we held our INSIGHT user conference where I witnessed the tangible excitement for the silo-free innovation, our unified data storage provides. It was invigorating to be with the thousands of attendees and hear stories of the extraordinary outcomes NetApp delivers for our customers. NetApp is at the forefront of the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers turn disruption into opportunity with intelligent data infrastructure. Todayâ€™s organizations need storage infrastructure that harnesses the power of public and hybrid clouds while keeping data secure and protected from ransomware attacks. They need infrastructure that supports dynamic workloads like AI, cloud-native, and open-source applications. And they need infrastructure that helps to create more sustainable data centers. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, that supports any application, any data type, and spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments. This comprehensive architecture delivers unparalleled simplicity of management, simplicity of deployment, and consistency of automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. We further elevate the customer experience with our BlueXP sustainability dashboard and NetApp Advance a common set of programs and guarantees that include Storage Life Cycle program, which removes the burden of upgrade cycles as well as storage efficiency, ransomware recovery and data availability guarantees. Intelligent data infrastructure combines unified data storage, integrated data services, and intelligent operations, so customers can operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unify their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Looking at the results of the quarter, momentum from new products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year drove 10% quarter-over-quarter growth in hybrid cloud segment revenue to $1.4 billion. Our all-flash array business benefited from the growth of the AFF C-Series increasing 14% from Q1 to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.2 billion. The AFF C-Series all-flash array continues to exceed our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. In the quarter, we successfully competed against an all-flash competitor with C-Series to win a $16 million deal at an Infrastructure-as-a-Service company. The customer was looking for new storage to host a broad variety of critical applications. Our ease of management for large storage environments, unique data resilience, common toolkit across all our storage systems and the right price performance ratio secured our win despite the competitor's attempt to use price once they realize their value proposition was insufficient. ONTAP One, our all-in-one software license that gives customers access to the industry's most comprehensive data management suite has laid the groundwork to future tech refresh and expansion opportunities. Building on the success of the C-Series, we introduced blocked optimized and AI-ready visions. The ASA C-Series family is a solution tailored to deliver high-performance and guaranteed high availability storage for critical applications, databases and VMware infrastructure, coupled with capacity flash to make enterprise-grade block storage more affordable and sustainable than ever. We added the AFF C-Series to the ONTAP AI architecture, lowering the overall cost of entry to scalable AI without sacrificing performance. Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering is also growing rapidly. In Q2, we added performance and availability guarantees to Keystone, expanding on the existing sustainability and storage efficiency guarantees, creating a comprehensive program to keep storage operations running optimally. We also announced NetApp storage on Equinix Metal, powered by Keystone, providing customers with a single subscription to a full stack of compute, networking and storage infrastructure with low-latency interconnection to all major public clouds. Turning to Public Cloud. As we said last quarter, our priority is growing first party cloud storage services. We aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partnersâ€™ go-to-market structures at the start of the fiscal year and are seeing new customer additions and growth in those services. However, that growth has been masked by weakness in subscription services, which have declined to 23% of Public Cloud ARR. During the quarter, we engaged in a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio. As a result, we will continue to prioritize cloud storage offerings delivered through the hyperscalers, while refocusing some services, such as Cloud Insights and Instaclustr, to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings, creating greater differentiation and additional value for customers. We will integrate other services that are sold as standalone subscriptions today, such as data protection, into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes. We will also carefully manage the transition of cloud storage subscription services to align to customer preference for consumption offerings. And, we have decided to exit the SaaS backup and virtual desktop services. We anticipate ARR headwinds of approximately $55 million from exited services and unrenewed subscriptions in the second half of fiscal year '24. Growth in first party and marketplace services are expected to partially offset this decline, positioning us to enter FY '25 with a more focused and much healthier business from which to grow. Now to the results of the quarter. Public Cloud segment revenue in Q2 was $154 million, flat from Q1 and up 8% year-over-year. Our first party and marketplace offerings are highly differentiated and are tightly aligned with customersâ€™ buying preferences. These services grew over 30% from Q2 a year ago. We continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as increases in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR in this part of the portfolio. In Q2, we extended our partnership with Google with the introduction of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. Now, we are not only the only vendor to have a natively integrated storage service in the public cloud, but we are natively integrated into all three of the leading hyperscale vendors. And we are not standing still with this advantage. Just two months after introducing the GCNV service, we announced the availability of a new lower-cost tier of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, expanding the offering to address a greater range of workloads. These partnerships uniquely position and enable us to participate in the innovation and adoption of AI services in the public cloud. As examples, during Q2, we announced support for Google Cloudâ€™s Vertex AI with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, as well as cross-protocol, hybrid cloud AI pipelines on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with support for SageMaker Studio notebooks. Our position with the hyperscalers also enables us to displace legacy on-premises competitors as customers migrate workloads to the cloud. A U.S.-based medical equipment company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to replace a competitorâ€™s SAN systems when they moved their database workloads to the cloud. This is the customerâ€™s first engagement with NetApp. Following a successful initial deployment, they are evaluating FSxN for workload consolidation and disaster recovery. Looking forward, our focus is clear and is delivering results. We expect the momentum we saw in Q2 to continue through FY '24, despite continued softness in the demand environment due to the challenging macro. Customers value our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure, and data management which enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely, and sustainably. With recent innovations that enable us to address a broader set of markets more efficiently, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. Iâ€™ll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a very solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging macro environment with soft IT spend. Our relentless focus and consistent execution delivered results that met and exceeded our guidance ranges and drove record-setting non-GAAP profitability measures across consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our modern, innovative solutions are resonating with customers and our disciplined operational management drove profitability margins to a record high. As we look ahead, we expect our industry leading solutions and unwavering focus to drive revenue growth and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year. Q2 consolidated gross margins of 72% were at an all-time high, driven by product gross margin of 61%, also at an all-time high. Gross margin leverage and the returns on our strategic investments drove record operating margins of 27% and record EPS of $1.58. During the quarter, we returned approximately $403 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing share count by 4% versus Q2 '23. Over the course of the year, we expect to return at least 100% of free cash flow to stockholders. Given our growth, profitability and working capital improvements, we expect operating cash flow for the full year to normalize and track relatively in-line with net income for the full year. Due to our solid execution and operational efficiencies, we outperformed the second quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year. As a result, we are raising all our guidance measures for fiscal year '24. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q2 billings of $1.5 billion decreased 9% year-over-year, and revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 6% year-over-year, as IT budgets remain constrained in a challenging macro environment. Adjusting for the FX tailwind of 160-basis-points, billings and revenue would have decreased 11% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 7% year-over-year, and product revenue of $706 million decreased 16% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, the first half of fiscal year '23 revenue, and most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog entering fiscal year '23. For the second half of fiscal year '24 year-over-year comparisons should be more apples-to-apples. Support revenue, an attach to our install base and indicative of the value of our products, grew 3% year-over-year to $623 million. We are pleased with the momentum of our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives implemented at the start of fiscal year '24. Public Cloud revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $154 million and was relatively flat from Q1 '24. As George noted, year-over-year growth was driven by hyperscaler first party and marketplace services, partially offset by continued declines in subscription services. Now, for our operating results. Q2 consolidated gross margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 72% and product gross margin increased 1,080 basis points year-over-year to 61%. Product gross margin benefited from three main factors: Number one, a mix shift to higher margin and higher capacity products. Number two, favorable COGs stemming from lower component costs and our strategic purchase agreements for NAND. Number three, price discipline in a cost sensitive, competitive pricing environment. I want to be very clear on this point: there were no unusual or one-time transactions that drove the higher product gross margin results. As we discussed in prior calls, we continue to make strategic purchase commitments to lock-in NAND pricing and mitigate margin pressure from rising prices in the future, as NAND prices largely bottomed out in Q2. Operating expenses of $706 million were flat year-over-year and grew $3 million quarter-over-quarter. Within a relatively consistent OpEx envelope, we will continue to reallocate investments to areas of higher opportunity to drive long-term growth. In Q2 operating margin increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 27%, which includes 80 basis points of FX tailwind. EPS grew 7% year-over-year to $1.58, which includes a $0.07 FX tailwind. These record results demonstrate the strength of our business model, product relevance and unwavering focus and execution. As expected, Q2 operating cash flow of $135 million was impacted by seasonally lower collections and repatriation tax payments. DSO was 46 and inventory turns were 15. More importantly, year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million grew 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 8% the same period a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $97 million, bringing the year-to-date amount to $515 million, up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $403 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $230 million in net cash. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q2 was $4 billion. The slight decline year-over-year is driven by lower multi-year support and public cloud subscription billings. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. Given the success of our product portfolio and consistent execution on operational improvements, we are raising our fiscal '24 guidance in still a soft IT spending environment. We now expect fiscal year '24 revenue to be down approximately 2% year-over-year, an improvement from our previous guidance. We expect to see continued strength in product and hyper-scaler first-party and marketplace services, as we work through minor headwinds from public cloud subscription services. Consolidated gross margins are expected to be approximately 71%. For the second half, we expect product gross margin to range between 58% to 60%, driven by continued mix shift to all-flash products and taking into account the current pricing environment and our commitment to maintain pricing flexibility. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 26% and EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25 with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $30 million and share count of 212 million. Operating cash flow is expected to move in-line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. In Q3, we expect revenue to range between $1.51 billion and $1.67 billion, which at the midpoint implies an increase of 4% year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins to be roughly 71%, and operating margin to be approximately 28%. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.74. In closing, I want to thank our customers, employees and investors once again for their steadfast commitment and investment in NetApp. I remain confident in our ability to manage the elements in our control and focus our key priorities to help customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud journeys. Our portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments, and we are committed to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Operator, we'll begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my question. Two quick follow-up. Given the updated fiscal year '24 revenue guide, should we assume that the July product revenue of $590 million was essentially the bottom and you would continue to see a sequential improvement in the second half? And the second question has to do with and momentum with some of these higher margin, higher capacity to product. To what extent should we assume these market share has enabled you to ride out a tough IT spend environment?\nGeorge Kurian: I'll take the second one, and then Mike can take the first, maybe. We feel very good about the momentum with our C-Series portfolio, we are able to serve customer workloads and use cases, particularly at time of soft IT spending where we are aligned to the value that we bring. And the software value of ONTAP is particularly useful in these all-flash configurations. We are also expanding the total addressable market with the all SAN Array configuration of the C-Series and of the high-performance flash products. So I'm excited about what the future holds for our flash business, and it is because of that momentum and the focus of our go-to-market that we've taken up our guide for the full year.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George. Good afternoon, Mehdi. On your question on product revenue, certainly for fiscal '24 implied in the guidance is continued growth in â€“ or growth in the second half for the product line. Total revenue growth averages about 4% for the second half. We have not guided for fiscal '25 yet, but we certainly would -- we feel good about going into '25 as it relates to our product portfolio and our operational improvements.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nKris Newton: Thanks Mehdi. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Yes, ma'am. And our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. A couple of questions. Just one, realizing that you're saying there's no major contributor to the gross margin upside. But just how do you see NAND prices increasing, just an outlook on how you see gross margins developing throughout the year and whether these are sustainable? And then just as a second question, do you attribute the more confident in the year to the early success that you're having with C-Series? Do you attribute it to signs you're seeing coming out of INSIGHT? Just what gives you more confidence on the year just given the dampened environment? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Hi, Meta. This is Mike. I'll take the first one, and then George will take the second one. So the comment in the script was specifically related to no one-time transactions that drove the overachievement product margins. As we look forward through the rest of fiscal '24 and '25. And let's start with the second half of '24, we're currently guiding product gross margins between 58% and 60%. As we all know, we continue to benefit from the lowest component costs we've seen in many years. We have included some room in our guidance to be flexible in pricing as well as mix and capacity. And as we've all seen from the industry analyst reports, we do expect that component pricing has bottomed out in our Q2 and will rise as we go throughout the rest of '24. We do feel very good about our position for the rest of the fiscal year as it relates to purchase agreements that we have struck as well as prebuy. Similar to '24, we are looking to extend that into '25, and we'll continue to work with our suppliers as we go through the rest of the year. I'd also note that, hey, historically, we all know storage industry pricing evolves as component pricing changes, and we expect that trend to continue. So, all that being said, we feel good about the second half of '24, as we've included in our outlook. As we head into '25, we'll see how things progress as it relates to mix, pricing and component costs and will guide '25 when we get to our Q4 call. With that, I'll hand it to George.\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to your question on the underlying factors that support our optimism in the guide. First of all, from a macro perspective, it's still a challenged macro with the soft demand environment. We saw incremental improvement in North America, but equally a deceleration in certain parts of Europe, mirroring the economic landscape in the public domain. I think within the large enterprise, we see a case-by-case situation in terms of demand and we continue to see a more robust product business in this commercial or mid-market customer base. So, no real fundamental change in the demand environment. With regard to the two underlying factors for confidence. One is, we are a much more focused go-to-market organization, and we are seeing the second consecutive quarter of pipeline and performance from the changes we made at the start of the fiscal year. And so I want to credit our go-to-market teams for their focus and the results that they have delivered this quarter, and that is one of the key contributors. The second is the really strong performance of our all-flash portfolio. We talked in the prepared remarks about a large competitive win against a purely flash competitor. And we see that across multiple segments where we are seeing competitive wins with our portfolio. So those are the two fundamental reasons: go-to-market focus and execution and confidence in our portfolio.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Actually I have two questions for George. George, first one, kind of like what are the lead times for the storage products today? And what does that imply for your visibility when you look into calendar '24? And the second question is, curious whether on a storage content per customer, does it â€“ have you seen any increase in it because of AI? Or do you think that will happen maybe at some point in the future? Or is there any way to put some time lines around it?\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to lead times, we are at normal lead times for our portfolio, and we reached those normal lead times a few quarters ago. With regard to the question on storage demand for AI, listen, I think we have been in the AI business for predictive AI or industrial AI for five years. And there are large data sets that are built out to support training of those models and the implementation of those models across the enterprise. So we have a good and robust business there. We are starting to see early signs of trials and use cases with generative AI. Generative AI is particularly well suited for NetApp's capabilities because it operates on unstructured data, files, documents, video, audio and so on. And so we have large repositories of those and customers, and we are able to use that data set and add to that data set to support AI use cases. This quarter, we won a large AI implementation at a very large U.S. bank that was really focused on generative AI document summarization analysis and so on, and we are the infrastructure foundation for that. So it will take time for generative AI to become a demand driver. We are seeing early positive signs there.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks, George.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi. Good afternoon. I had two questions on the product business. So first of all, I'm not fully understanding what you're saying about the pricing environment. At one point you said, you maintained disciplined pricing and then at another point you would be flexible going forward with pricing. So can you sort of give us a sense for how challenging or not challenging it is to hold pricing in these gross margins? And the second one is related to the product gross margins. I'm just still trying to get a sense for how sustainable this last quarter and the guidance for the next quarter is in terms of product gross margins, even if we adjust for the changes in NAND pricing? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, on pricing, we've been in this industry for a very long period of time. And while there will be people who are vendors who are aggressive in any particular transaction or other, depending on their own strategic reasons. Overall, we don't see fundamental changes in the pricing environment. Clearly, the room with lower component costs gives you an opportunity to do more in terms of pricing flexibility. But I think that our past quarter's gross margin results our demonstration of the fact that we've been able to maintain pricing discipline at a time where demand is soft, and it talks to both the differentiation of our product portfolio and the execution in our field teams. I'll have Mike talk a bit about your second question.\nMike Berry: Thanks, George. And I'll refer to George's comments, Steve, when I talk about the sustainability. So as -- so we finished at 61% product margins in Q2. We guided a range of 50% to 60% in the back half. We feel very good about our component costs and the view of that for the rest of our fiscal '24. The reason why we guided slightly lower than Q2 from a margin perspective, that's exactly what George talked about, which is we feel really good about our pricing discipline in our products but we want to make sure and leave room to be flexible should we need that in the second half. That's the one part of the equation that we don't control as much as the cost. So hopefully, that helps. We would not have guided that range if we didn't feel good about it for the second half, Steve.\nSteven Fox: Yes. Thatâ€™s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Citi. Please go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you. Maybe just a little bit on the macro. Clearly, you're executing really well. And should we -- should we expect slightly better than seasonal growth for you guys in the second half, just given the fact that you guys are ramping on a new product? And then just broadly on the macro, are we starting to see more adoption of flash across the customer base in general as people start to appreciate maybe more pricing being more attractive or is this something that was specific to NetApp just given the success that you're seeing in your C-Series? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I'll take the second, and Michael cover the first question. Thank you for the question. Listen, I think that with regard to customer adoption of flash-based technologies, they are -- we saw the high-performance landscape moved to flash several years ago, and there's been a steady movement of that footprint to flash. That is about 15% to 20% of the overall storage market, maybe 20%. The next tranche of use cases are more in the general purpose application footprint. These are in the process of migrating over multiple years. We are in the early innings of that migration. And so we feel very good about the position of our flash portfolio to attack that part of the market. It is essentially the 10K hard drive market that is about 30% to 40% of the hard drive market. So, you'll see that move over time. And so I'll let Mike talk to the first question you had.\nMike Berry: Sure. On your question, Asiya, as it relates to linearity, we did see a nice quarter-on-quarter pickup in Q2 which was really driven by the factors that George discussed. And look at the midpoint of guidance for the year, we do expect it to be relatively consistent with the numbers we like to talk about, which is the 48% in the first half and 52% in the second. Again, keep in mind that the good bit of our revenue, thankfully comes from support, very predictable. Hopefully, we can do a little better, but that is -- the midpoint of guidance is pretty much right on linearity.\nAsiya Merchant: Great. Thank you.\nMike Berry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. I was wondering, George, if you could comment a little bit on a public cloud revenue trajectory in fiscal '24, given some of the changes that you noted? And given those changes in CloudOps, how does that change your long-term revenue outlook for that business on a relative basis, I think before you were thinking 40% of total Public Cloud. Wondering where you're thinking that, that might shake out now in the long-term?\nGeorge Kurian: So, let me provide some baseline before I jump into the strategy review takeaways and the implications. First, cloud is roughly 10% of total revenue. Subscription is 23% of cloud revenue, down from about 35% a year ago. So, it's a small percentage of the total cloud revenue and an even smaller percentage of the total company revenue. The mix of Cloud Storage and CloudOps is still relatively consistent approximately 60/40. We focused our strategy review on all elements of our cloud portfolio and had five key takeaways that I outlined in my prepared comments. Sharpening the focus on first-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services. These performed very well in the second quarter and continue to be uniquely differentiated both to end customers of our on-premises solution and a vehicle to acquire net new customers alongside our cloud partners. We would carefully manage the transition of some of the storage subscriptions to our consumption offering as we roll out [1P] services, customers that used to buy storage subscriptions prefer to now go towards the 1P offering, and we'll manage that carefully. We will integrate some standalone services like data protection and privacy into our cloud storage offerings so that they bring more value to the base offering. And we'll refocus other services like Cloud Insights, which are subscription services and Instaclustr to differentiate NetApp in the cloud storage workload motions that we are focused on. We've decided to exit some standalone services like Virtual Desktop and SaaS Backup services. And all of this will lead to about a $55 million ARR headwind from these actions in the second half of fiscal year '24. The reduction in Public Cloud subscription services will be partially offset by the good growth of our consumption cloud storage services in particular. And so our plans for the second half of the year assumes that we will have a modest decline in cloud revenue. We're not going to guide it but we assume that. And we have built that into the guidance for the fiscal year '24, which we took up by approximately $100 million. We're not going to comment today on the outlook for the overall cloud business. We will talk to you when we update our long-term models to that effect.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thanks, George. And if I could, Mike, your margins were really, really strong, both sequentially and on an absolute basis. Wondering as we think about free cash flow margins, would all this EBIT margin improvement flow through into free cash flow margins? And secondarily, just on the EBIT margins, is there a way to dimension out of the three things that you noted, maybe rank order or order of magnitude so that we can get some sense around the confidence of sustainability, especially as it relates to commodity pricing, which you seem to indicate won't really matter too much sequentially. But just wondering what was the biggest sequential driver of that margin improvement? Thank you.\nMike Berry: Sure. So on two questions there. First of all, on cash flow, and I'll do operating cash flow. We do expect for the year, I talked about it in the prepared remarks, operating cash flow to move relatively consistently with non-GAAP net income. So to your question, yes, as the income increases associated operating cash flow, short of any quarterly fluctuations in working capital. So all good there in terms of free cash flow margins largely moving with operating cash flow. And then on the second question, and I'll answer this on a sequential basis, not a year-over-year basis. As we look from Q1 to Q2, certainly, the mix shift was a significant impact. We did receive some benefit on costs as those older inventories are now completely gone. And then, of course, pricing discipline is in there as well. So I would rank from a sequential perspective, the order that I did in my prepared remarks in terms of mix shift, which is both product and capacity than favorable COGS and then pricing discipline. So hopefully, that helps.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNehal Chokshi: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You guys mentioned 30% growth in first-party storage services. What's the NRR underlying that?\nGeorge Kurian: We don't break those out. I think we feel very good about -- we have brought in the number of workloads that we serve. We have brought in the number of hyperscalers now with Google coming online. We have brought lower price points for Azure and Google, and we have brought higher price points for Amazon. So I feel really, really good about the momentum in our first-party cloud storage services.\nNehal Chokshi: Maybe phrasing it in a different way, the driver of that growth is expansion or lands?\nGeorge Kurian: The combination of both new customer adds and add new workload use cases within existing customers as well as expansions.\nNehal Chokshi: Great. And then a follow-up, quick question. George, you talked about how you had a $16 million win with the C-Series. And you mentioned four drivers behind that. Much of those four drivers was really probably the biggest element of that win?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think we have a really strong operating system capability for performance and simplification at scale. Many of the other vendors that start simple run into real trouble when you try to build a large enterprise environment. And we have a really good portfolio to do that. I think that was probably the number one reason. And the number two reason is now that we have the C-Series, we have a price point to deliver to customers who used to not have it.\nNehal Chokshi: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, just a quick clarification. On the strategic review update, I just want to confirm, it sounds like you've concluded that review apart from sort of regular business kind of reviews. I just want to confirm that, that's the case. And then really, the element I'm trying to sort of tease out here is you've taken out $55 million of ARR, so roughly $15 million of revenue, yet your outlook is higher. What is informing the higher outlook? What's been the biggest surprise and the biggest delta contributing to the higher outlook? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: So first of all, let me hit that in three parts, right? First, we have concluded the strategic review. We have a set of good decisions we've made that we need to now go implement that will result in a more focused cloud business and a healthier subscription base, albeit a smaller one that build off. We believe that these actions should allow us to get back to growth in fiscal year '25 of a healthier business mix in cloud. We always will do reviews of various aspects of our portfolio as ongoing parts of our business. But the focused strategic review, I would say, is mostly complete. I think the second is with regard to the confidence we have. Listen, we said that when we guided the second half of the year, we took up the overall guide by close to $100 million. That is mostly based on the momentum of our all-flash Hybrid Cloud storage portfolio. We've raised the second half guide by substantially more than we beat in the second quarter. And it also accounts for the fact that we will have some headwinds through the rest of fiscal year '24 in our cloud subscription business, which will only be partially offset by growth in our cloud consumption business.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question then comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of those have been asked and answered. But I wanted to go back to some prior discussion around this notion of AI. And we hear a lot about like AI, large language models becoming smaller and implemented more maybe pervasively over time in traditional enterprise environments. We've even heard more about inferencing and how that might evolve in enterprises. I'm just curious, are you seeing at all any signs of that pulling either discussions or early signs of demand? And if so, is it a prerequisite that, that has to pull as all-flash storage with that kind of footprint. And the reason I ask is there's a lot of discussion about a lot of this existing infrastructure that's going to have to be upgraded to support these acceleration of AI in infrastructure? Sorry for the long-winded question.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. No problem. I'll address that in three steps. I think first is the use of smaller models as opposed to the very, very large model. Yes, that term is distillation. We do see that going on in customers, whereas they kind of run these different models, they begin to realize that you can get as effective an outcome with much faster results and a smaller number of parameters. For example, the demonstration, the live demonstration that we showed at NetApp INSIGHT actually was the distillation. We started with a much larger LLM and we brought it to a much smaller range of parameters because you get the same benefit. So that's going on. The second is with regard to training environment, which is the part of the data life cycle in AI where you aggregate a data set and you train the algorithm or the language model for better answers to be able to either predict a good outcome or generate a relevant outcome. You do need very high-performance storage because the GPUs that drive those algorithms need very, very fast parallel access to data. And with our unstructured data scale-out file system, we feel very well positioned for that. And then the third is with regard to inferencing, inferencing is the part of the data life cycle where you've taken a model and now you want to put it into production on our data set could be on a factory floor, could be in a distributed office. There it really depends on the data set and the use case what type of storage you need. You may need it for larger environments like shop floors, but you may not need super high-performance storage and compute for a very small office, like a claimâ€™s office, for example, in insurance.\nAaron Rakers: That's very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, real quickly, who is your predominant competitor that you see on the block optimized C-level all-flash arrays or C-Series arrays?\nGeorge Kurian: It's all -- the block market is a crowded market. We feel very good about our offerings in the mid-range, especially and the ability to offer a single solution with common automation, common administration, common life cycle management for both fire and block. And no other vendor in the market can do that. And so we feel very good. I think the large competitors are clearly Dell and HPE are in the mid-range and then you occasionally see some pure.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question today comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess if I start with the Public Cloud strategic review that you discussed, just wanted to clarify, based on the changes you're making there, are there any cost implications other changes? I'm assuming that allows you to focus your go-to-market a bit more, but is there any sort of cost implication where you're enabling some cost take out there? And secondly, Mike, you mentioned sort of the 58% to 60% gross margin on the product revenue in the second half. When we think about, sort of, prebuys that you might do going into fiscal '25, how should we think about the trajectory of the gross margin into fiscal '25. Any levers that you have to offset sort of the flow-through of that to the operating margin that you're really reporting at a very strong level right now? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources to drive growth in our first-party cloud storage, we feel good about the demand environment there, and we want to continue to accelerate that. Whatever cost opportunities they are, it's been factored into the second half guidance that we gave you.\nMike Berry: Okay. And then thanks for the question, Samik. On the question, especially going into fiscal '25 from the product margin, I'll go over a little bit my answer to Meta when he asked the same question. So as we've all seen from the analyst reports, we have -- we do expect that NAND is largely bottomed. We're at the loss component pricing we've been at in a while. We did a really nice job and kudos to the supply chain team for doing the prebuys and purchase agreements for '24. We will certainly look at those and continue to look at those in '25, but it has to make sense for both NetApp and our suppliers. So as we go into '21, there are certainly some levers. The big question there, Samik that I don't have an answer to is what does the market do and pricing do over the next six months. That's why we're going to wait, will guide the margin number when we guide for the full year because we really want to get through the next couple of quarters to see how component pricing goes, what we expect the mix to be. And then what happens from a pricing environment perspective.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. \nAnanda Baruah: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, George, an inference related question, maybe two quick parts. Are you hearing any of your customers talk about legislation around inferencing, having an impact on their plans? And I guess, just generally speaking, any opinion you have on sort of what that ramp over what time period kind of looks like even. If just anecdotally would be helpful. I appreciate it. Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. I think, first of all, we are in the stages of generated AI. Predictive AI is quite mature and has very strong use cases. We have done really well in health care and life sciences in manufacturing, in parts of financial services, lots of use cases, right? And so I think that's mature. It requires good data sets and good data management to make it have the right outcome. With Generative AI, there is obviously a lot of discussion on both regulation as well as judicious use of the technology, everything from fairness to epic to privacy to all kind cybersecurity, all of those things. And I think it will take time. Where we are with most clients today is proof of concepts, right? They are trying to put their data sets together, they are trying to learn what these models, will help them do. And there are some use cases which are really easy to see the benefits from software development. It's very easy to see the benefits from, the more advanced ones where some of these concerns exist. They basically customers move cautiously. So it will take time. These are multiyear use case developments. And so we feel good about where we are at the moment, and we're just realistic that will lead time to build momentum.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes. Thanks for the context. Thatâ€™s helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question today comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nSidney Ho: Great. Apologize if you have already addressed this. On the macro level, are you seeing any major differences between demand from large enterprises, small leading businesses in federal. Any particular verticals you would point out that shows particular strength of weakness both on the Hybrid Cloud and the Public Cloud? Thanks\nGeorge Kurian: The demand picture is still soft and mixed. Overall, we saw some improvements in the U.S., offset by some weakness in Europe. Nothing is not in the public domain. With regard to the customer time, large enterprise is still soft. Tech, for example, tech and service provider spending has not really come back. It is really a customer-by-customer situation versus a broad industry situation. With regard to the demand picture in midsized enterprise, our mid-sized enterprise business performed more robustly and secularly better than our large enterprise business. Public sector continues to be a work in progress. We saw some of the impact of the budget negotiations result in softer budgets for certain agencies. Our business performed well, particularly in the civilian agencies.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thank you. \nKris Newton: Thank you, Sidney. I'm going to hand it back to George for some final comments.\nGeorge Kurian: In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their strong execution and operational discipline in Q2, which drove revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and record gross margin, operating margin and EPS. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions, helping customers operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unifying their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT sources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Innovation in our all-flash storage portfolio enables us to address a broader TAM and we continue to innovate and lead in Public Cloud storage services. Our go-to-market team is laser- focused on these positions of strength, enabling us to deliver strong results in the challenged macro landscape. Looking ahead, I'm confident that the momentum we saw in Q2 will continue through the remainder of fiscal year '24. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKris Newton: Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Kurian: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q1 marks a solid start to FY '24 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance, while our operational discipline yielded operating margin and EPS above our guidance ranges. As I have outlined on previous calls, we are focused on: managing the elements within our control; reinvigorating efforts to drive better performance in our storage business; and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive early indicators from this plan to sharpen our execution, deliver growth, increase profitability, and further strengthen our position for long-term success. Looking at the results of the quarter, I am especially pleased with the reception to our recent product introductions. The AFF C-series has been the fastest ramping all-flash product launch in our history, with strong demand across all products in the family. Similarly, the AFF A150, our entry-level, high performance all-flash array, grew quickly in its first full quarter of shipping. Our Storage Lifecycle Program is also seeing good early uptake, driving longer-term commitments to NetApp as we help customers future-proof their environments with a world-class ownership experience. Building on this momentum, we introduced more storage innovation in Q1. We announced the ASA A-series, a family of SAN-specific all-flash arrays, supported by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees. These systems are the only all-SAN storage arrays with virtual machine and application-granular data protection mechanisms. Complementing our unified storage offerings, they enable us to expand on the tens of thousands of customers who already use NetApp for block storage today and drive share gains in the $18 billion SAN market. In addition to delivering on our innovation agenda, we have implemented the go-to-market changes we outlined on the Q4 call, focusing our enterprise sellers on the flash opportunity and building a dedicated model for cloud. In May, we held our annual sales kickoff meeting, the first time we've gathered the global team in person since the pandemic. Everyone was energized by the innovation we're bringing to market and the objectives appropriately aligned to each team's strengths. Because many of the products we've introduced open new TAM for us, we are also including training to sharpen our attack on these opportunities. The changes have been well received, are already showing up in pipeline expansion, and should help drive top line growth in the second-half. Q1 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Our all-flash array business decreased 7% from Q1 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. The demand environment is unchanged from the last half of FY '23, with headwinds from enterprise continuing to weigh on product and AFA revenue. Additionally, as Mike will outline, the first-half of fiscal year '23 benefited from elevated backlog, impacting the year-over-year comparisons. In the past few quarters, every conversation I've had with customers and investors has touched on artificial intelligence. Generative AI is top of mind for everyone. While still in the early innings of this opportunity, AI is not a new topic for us. We have been a leader in storage for predictive AI and machine learning workloads since we introduced ONTAP AI, a joint NetApp and NVIDIA-proven architecture, in 2018. Today, hundreds of customers rely on NetApp's storage infrastructure and data management for their AI workloads, including some of the largest pharmaceutical, financial services and retail companies in the world. Effective predictive and generative AI projects depend on high quality, well-managed, unstructured data. The data pipeline and workflow typically involve data from multiple file and object sources across cloud and on premises. High performance, highly scalable hybrid cloud storage and data management is a core NetApp advantage and naturally positions us as a leader in this market and will continue to benefit us as the Gen AI market evolves. While early, we are already engaged with customers who are interested in fine-tuning large language models with their own data on-premises, as well as those who are leveraging the hyperscalers' Gen AI offerings on the public cloud together with the storage and data management capabilities of NetApp Cloud Volumes services. Accelerated by the rise of AI, data continues to grow in both volume and value. A company's data is its most valuable asset. Our robust cyber resilience portfolio helps customers ensure that they have the right enterprise data protection and security on-premises and in the cloud. With built-in features that protect and secure data and deliver rapid recovery based on AI and machine learning, our systems can proactively spot and counter malicious or anomalous actions. Our confidence in our industry-leading capabilities is underscored by the ransomware recovery guarantee we announced in Q1 and demonstrated by the fact that NetApp is the only enterprise storage vendor on the NSA's classified program components list. Now, turning to Public Cloud. I want to acknowledge our cloud results have not been where we want them to be and assure you we are taking definitive actions to hone our approach and get back on track. At the start of this year, we aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners' go-to-market structures. Additionally, we are in the process of a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio, expand on the success of first party services and improve subscription performance. We will have more details to share with you on our next call. That said, Public Cloud segment revenue in Q1 was $154 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Public Cloud DBNRR declined to 107%. Within these numbers, strength in first party and marketplace consumption services was masked by weakness in our subscription services. Let me emphasize that our strategic focus is on first party cloud storage services, and we continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as revenue and ARR growth in this part of the portfolio. Our expectations for FY '24 Public Cloud revenue are reflected in the guidance Mike will walk you through. First party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners, position us uniquely and represent our biggest opportunity. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and delivering growth. Our close and long-standing relationship with Microsoft Azure continues to deliver solid growth. Likewise, our partnership with Google remains strong. And in the coming weeks, you can expect to hear exciting news about the expansion of our partnership. Our relationship with AWS is also yielding positive results. As expected, we are starting to win large enterprise deployments with FSx for NetApp ONTAP. We were chosen to be the cloud storage infrastructure for a global sportswear manufacturer's SAP HANA deployment. FSxN was the only storage service that could meet the company's mission-critical service level, availability, and recovery requirements. This is a large, long-term SAP project that will continue to develop and grow over the coming years, driving significant consumption of FSxN capacity. Once completed, it will be one of the largest SAP environments on AWS. In the face of the challenging macro, demand remains muted, and sales cycles remain elongated. Although customers continue to exhibit caution, they are moving forward with strategic initiatives, prioritizing investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth. Our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely and sustainably. Customers turn to NetApp to help them increase the performance and reliability of their digital and cloud transformational projects. Looking forward, our priorities are clear. We will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in the storage business, and continue to refine our Public Cloud business. Early results indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth year-over-year while yielding top-line growth in the back half of fiscal year '24. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to thank the NetApp team for their continued focus. I also want to remind you we'll be hosting our INSIGHT user conference in person in Las Vegas this October. We hope to see you there.\nMike Berry: Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed a solid quarter in a challenging macro environment, hitting or exceeding all our guidance ranges. We are delivering on our commitments, evident in our solid Q1 results. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our disciplined operational management and the strong customer acceptance of our innovation continues to pay off. We expect improved execution and new products will drive growth and operating margin expansion as we move through the second-half of the year. As expected, Q1 consolidated gross margin was strong. Product margin came in at 55%. Given our expectations for competitive dynamics and product mix, we remain confident in our projection that product margin will hold at these levels through the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash from operations was a first quarter all-time high. Operating cash flow benefited from the reduction of premiums, as well as lower component pricing and incentive compensation payouts. Over the course of fiscal year â€˜24, cash flow should normalize, with operating cash flow tracking relatively in line with non-GAAP net income. We returned approximately 120% of free cash flow to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing Q1 fiscal â€˜24 share count by almost 4% year-over-year. As we discussed during last quarter's call, we intend to return 100% of free cash flow this year. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q1 billings of $1.3 billion decreased 17% year-over-year. Revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 10% year-over-year. The challenging macro environment continued to pressure IT spending. However, as George pointed out, we are well aligned to customers' priority investments and remain confident our go-to-market changes and product innovations will drive growth in the second-half of fiscal year â€˜24. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Product revenue of $590 million was down 25%. Remember that first-half fiscal year 2023 revenue, most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. Support revenue of $611 million grew 2% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR grew 6% year-over-year to $619 million. Public Cloud revenue of $154 million increased 17% from Q1 a year ago. First party and marketplace services grew as customers continue to choose solutions based on NetApp technology for mission-critical and cloud native workloads. This growth was offset by underperformance in subscription services. As George noted earlier, Public Cloud did not meet our expectations for the quarter, and we are taking action to hone our approach and reaccelerate growth. Q1 consolidated gross margin of 71% came in above our guidance, up 400 basis points from a year ago, and again reaching an all-time company high. Product gross margin was 55%, in line with expectations. As we discussed on the Q4 call, we made strategic purchase commitments to lock-in record low NAND pricing and mitigate rising prices in the future. NAND prices continued to decline in Q1, and we are still positioned favorably versus the market. The potential for increased price competition is factored into our expectations and we remain confident in our ability to hold product gross margin consistent at this level through the year. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92%. Public cloud gross margin improved to 67% from 66% last quarter. As expected, operating expenses of $703 million were flat year-over-year and grew 4% from Q4'23. The sequential increase was driven by annual merit increases and a reset of incentive compensation, as well as expenses related to our in-person sales kick-off meeting. Q1 again highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined operational execution with operating margin of 22%, ahead of expectations. EPS of $1.15 was also above the high end of our guidance. Operating cash flow was $453 million in Q1, an increase of 61% year-over-year, driven by lower supply chain payments and variable compensation, partially offset by lower collections. In Q1, DSO decreased to 41 and inventory turns improved to 13. Free cash flow increased 94% year-over-year to $418 million, helped by strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. During the quarter, we returned $506 million to stockholders through shares repurchased and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $600 million in net cash. We have approximately $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q1 was $4.2 billion, up slightly from a year ago. We ended the quarter with approximately $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for the full-year. Our total revenue guide is unchanged, with revenue down low to mid-single-digits year-over-year, measured on a percentage basis. Based on our Q1 results and updated projections, we expect Public Cloud revenue growth to come in lower than initially expected primarily due to softness in our subscription services. This minor weakness is expected to be at least offset by strength in our Hybrid Cloud revenue. We continue to expect fiscal year '24 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, operating margin to be approximately 25%, and EPS to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.85. We expect Q2 revenue to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a decline of 8% year-over-year. If FX rates stay at end-of-July levels, we would see nearly 2 points of FX tailwinds to revenue. As I called out earlier, first-half fiscal year â€˜23 revenue benefited from elevated levels of backlog due to last yearâ€™s supply chain constraints, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, and operating margin to be approximately 24%. EPS should be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. In closing, I want to thank our employees, customers and investors for their commitment and investment in NetApp. I am confident in our ability to help our customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud transformation goals. We are well aligned to priority IT investments and are committed to deliver sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. Iâ€™ll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q & A. Kris?\nKris Newton: Thanks, Mike. Operator, letâ€™s begin the Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks for doing the call. So last quarter, you guys talked about spending for large enterprises were cautious, where obviously you guys are overexposed. That doesn't seem like that has changed that much. From your conversation with customers, do you have a sense when demand could start picking up, maybe based on utilization data or whatnot? First, just give us some historical context at what utilization rate level do you start seeing demand pick up, and do you think that will be quite any different this cycle? I mean, while youâ€™re at it talk about the trends in small and medium businesses as well? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Overall -- thank you for the question. Overall, the spending environment this past quarter was unchanged from what we saw in the second half of the prior fiscal year. Our mid-sized enterprise business across the globe and public sector did better than large enterprise. Within large enterprise, as we noted, the same verticals remained cautious in spending, service provider, high-tech and, to a lesser extent, financial services. With regard to their spending criterion, they are spending on strategic projects but are running infrastructure, broadly speaking, hotter than meaning at higher levels of utilization than they typically do and what we typically tell them is best practice. That is common in such macro environments, but it's not a long-term trend. I think we expect them as we progress through the fiscal year for them to start to expand investment because they cannot run systems that hard. As we noted in our prepared remarks and in prior calls, we do not expect the macro to change substantially to support our guidance for the year. Our guidance for the year reflects our confidence both in the changes that we made in go-to-market as well as in our product portfolio that we recently introduced.\nSidney Ho: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick follow-ups. George, I want to go back to the big picture and revisit the topic of repatriation. How do you see generative AI strengthening this argument that there will be repatriation enterprises have better ownership of the data that, that would actually help with a faster adoption? Is there any update? Is there any feedback from the -- your conversation from your enterprise customers that you can share? And a quick follow-up. Can you provide a mix of a QLC NAND that you're procuring? And how do you see that changing towards the end of the calendar year?\nGeorge Kurian: With regard to Gen AI projects, which we are already engaged in, in a number of customers, we see a mix of use cases. I would say there are three common patterns. One is unstructured data. The second is the need for consistent data management, both security and privacy are hot topics as well as the lineage of data so that they can keep track of which version of Gen AI model is the best and most accurate. And then the third is from a deployment architecture, we are seeing them engage in both on-prem discussions, as well as public cloud discussions. In public cloud, the advantages are much faster feature velocity, as well as prepackaged models available on the public cloud. With the on-prem environments, the major sensitivity is the data being kept in a restricted location. So we intend to benefit from both. I don't think that it is a meaningful driver of repatriation at this point in the discussion maybe. There we're seeing a mix of public cloud and on-prem environments.\nMike Berry: And then, hey, Mehdi, it's Mike. On the QLC, we're not going to break-out specific numbers, but we would say we are procuring more of that. We started to see the pickup. We'll see how the rest of the year goes, but we do expect that to continue as a percentage as we go through fiscal '24.\nMehdi Hosseini: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Cardoso: Hey, thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Just one question from me. You reported a strong gross margin performance in the quarter and I was just curious if you could quantify how much of the improvement were is it related to premium? The premium benefits, strategic purchases, et-cetera, that you've highlighted and how we should think about that tailwind as we progress through this year, including and excluding the expected price competition that you have embedded into the guide? And then just real quickly, a clarification on that last part, like are you guys actually seeing price competition currently from your competitors? Thanks.\nMike Berry: Hey Joe, it's Mike. So, on your question, we've talked a lot about premiums and as we talked about last-time, we're super-excited and not have to talk about them anymore. So largely in Q1, all of those premiums have I would say gone away, not only from a P&L perspective, but cash. We talked about that number was anywhere typically between, call it, $30 million and $40 million a quarter, sometimes it bumped up to $50 million, so call it an average of about $40 million. That -- we got a good bit of that. We did not have to accrue in Q4 and then the rest hold to Q1. So it's 55% last quarter, 55% this quarter. And now premiums are fully out-of-the number. So as you look-forward, it's one of the reasons why we feel confident in the 55% guide. There -- hey, there has always been price competition. We see it in certain geographies or certain customers. We haven't seen any material change to that in our guide. We do expect that we will be -- we will need to be, call it, marginally more aggressive in certain situations, but certainly nothing significantly different than we are today.\nJoseph Cardoso: Thanks for the color.\nMike Berry: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMichael Tsvetanov: Yes, thank you, guys. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. I wanted to ask, your ARR in the quarter -- your ARR growth in the quarter slowed quite a bit. And I know you guys have pushed out your $2 billion sort of target, but I just wanted to take a step-back and I think about like to your first billion, what -- how would you describe the trajectory to getting there and maybe timing? If you can kind of just help us think about where we go from here? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes, I think first of all, our -- we have two models in which we serve customers; the consumption model, which is essentially a pay-as-you-go utility model; and then a subscription model, which is where the customer pays for a certain amount of capacity or managed units or capability and then renews that on an annual basis or a term basis. Then consumption part of our business has grown to about three quarters of our total business, roughly speaking. Of our cloud business, subscription is the quarter. And if you look at the last quarter's performance, the cloud storage and consumption businesses continue to perform well. They grew year-on-year. Their dollar-based net retention rate was at the industry average, industry norms. Subscription is where we saw a challenge, both a small part of cloud storage subscription as well as CloudOps and we are conducting a review and we'll get you an update at the next quarterly call about our plans for that part of our business.\nMichael Tsvetanov: Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And if I can just add one more. I just want to understand your all-flash business is down about 7%. And I can appreciate the macro backdrop there, but I'm wondering if you can just help me understand the share kind of trends? And maybe your best estimate where that's been this quarter? How it's changing? And kind of what your expectations are moving through the year? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: I think first of all, the year-on-year compare for our flash product business is impacted by last year benefiting from elevated levels of backlog that we shipped in the comparable quarter last year. If you -- if you remove that backlog, flash actually grew year-on-year this quarter and we saw strong growth from our capacity flash products. We expect overall flash portfolio to grow as a percentage of our business through the course of the year. The first-quarter customers are still qualifying our capacity flash products, the C-Series. And so we weren't able to move all of our intended customer environments over to all-flash yet, but they are headed that way. And so we feel really good about both the go-to-market changes that are starting to reflect in pipeline expansion as well as in the flash product portfolio that we have. And you should see that reflected in growth in the second-half of the year. With regard to share gains, our expectation based on what the others have guided is that we have picked-up the second position in share in the market behind Dell.\nOperator: The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nVictor Chiu: Hi, this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. You guys noted that the product gross margin is expected to hold for the remainder of the year, but I think the latest industry forecasts and commentary from NAND manufacturers implies that the market experiences a sharp overcorrection next year. Can you help us understand how this impacts your expectations for the next fiscal year and whether you've secured any pricing agreements for flash media beyond this fiscal year?\nMike Berry: Yes. Hey, Victor, it's Mike. So, hey, we haven't guided for fiscal '25, but let us walk you through that. As we talked about between pre-buys and price locks, we have secured a large portion of our NAND purchases for fiscal '24, not all of it, you never want to hedge the whole bucket, but we feel really good about that. In addition, some of those agreements do flow into fiscal '25, it's not a majority at this point. So where we stand today as we feel really good about where we are at â€˜24, we have some of that rolling into '25 and we are certainly looking for about -- what should we do? We'll do a lot more work on that, call it, in the next 90-days and update you on the next call. As you know, it's a very changing market. We want to make sure it be prudent and think through that, but it is something that we are looking hard at.\nVictor Chiu: Okay, that's helpful. And just on the other side of the legacy part of the business, the last several quarters have seen pretty sharp declines in shipments of legacy spinning drives. I know historically, there has not very much correlation between storage media trends, the storage systems, but more recently, one of your competitors have asserted that there won't be any new spinning disk drives manufacturer in five years. Do you have any view on this commentary? Do you agree with this perspective and how do you see this impacting NetApp I guess over the long-run?\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think we have the best spinning media and the best flash technologies in the market. I think that's reflected by the richness of our feature set, the flexibility of our operating system and increasingly the data security functionality that natively integrated into our offerings. I think that the outlines of what our competitors have talked about is a long-time. And so we give our customers choice and we'll continue to invest in a broad range of technologies that meet the right price performance points. When you cannot support a type of technology, like our competitors cannot, then you have to throw grenades and say that that technology doesn't exist because you frankly can't support it.\nVictor Chiu: Okay, so you think that that's extreme view that that the past legacy -- is that spinning drives will be gone in five years, that's extreme in your opinion?\nGeorge Kurian: Five years is a long-time in technology as we've all learned.\nVictor Chiu: Yes. Okay, okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you for taking my question. In the past, I think you guided for some linearity on first-half versus second-half. So just wanted to clarify if that still holds for the remainder of this year? And just back on the public-cloud side of things. I know it's guiding to a little bit lower relative to prior expectations, due to the subscription weakness. How should we think about just the linearity? I mean, are we expecting these run-rates to kind of continue to have any more insight into how we should think about the growth rates for the rest of the year? Are we still looking at something -- are we still expecting from a year-on-year basis as the comps get easier in the back-half of fiscal '24 to have cloud revenues accelerate from this point? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes, thank you for the question. So, on the first question on linearity, based on the midpoint of guidance, we are still assuming about 48% revenue in the first-half and 52% in the second, pretty close to round in which is very consistent with what we did last quarter. So, no big change there. And that's very consistent with the linearity that we've shown historically. Also, our Q2 guide is up about 7% quarter-on-quarter, which is well within our historical linearity as well. On the cloud revenue number, so we're not going to update the guidance. We had originally thought and forecasted somewhere around, call it, mid-teens growth in that cloud revenue business. Even if as you look at the historical numbers, that cloud revenue, and we're not forecasting it, well, if it stays where it's at today, there would still be growth year-over-year because of the growth last year. So we have baked all of that into our full-year number, so we feel good about where we are on that guide. We'll see how the rest of the year goes. But at this point, we've reflected that in our full-year number.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two high-level questions in AI for George. Our understanding is that most of the benefit of storage, as we put all-flash unified file and object solution; A, is that assessment accurate or are you seeing hybrid HDD solutions being used in AI workloads today? And second, for unified cloud and object, can you speak about your product portfolio there and your competitive position, compared to other solutions like FlashBlade from Pure Storage and PowerScale from Dell. And also if unified filing object solutions are more expected of benefit from AI, it's a market share that's similar to market-share in other storage solutions like block and file? Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Listen, I think that the first comment that I would make is AI primarily offerings today on unstructured data, whether it's predictive AI using unstructured data to analyze images or audio files or generative AI that analysis text on various types of document formats, unstructured data is the priority. Second, I think with regard to unified file and object, listen, we created unified storage and we have a really strong track-record in unified across file, block, object and cloud. And I think that is the new definition of unified rather than little systems that tried to say that they've got one protocol or the other. I think the third is when you talk about AI, it's a broad topic. And therefore, what customers typically have is versions of data that they used to trade different models. At the time that they are running the trading workload, they typically store it on a high-performance landscape like all-flash system. But they keep those models available so that they can go back and look at when they make changes to models and data sets and what the implications are for accuracy. And so the archival life cycle of that data is usually on disk or on cloud. And then I think the last point I would make is, listen, we are seeing clients use hybrid workflows. Public cloud is a strong place where a lot of the developers and data science teams are beginning their Workflows, either Vertex in and Google or Sagemaker in Amazon and our solutions on public cloud give us a strong position to start with the data science team at the start of these AI projects.\nKrish Sankar: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: The next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks. Hey, George. Hey Mike. I had some phone difficulties. So I apologize if you addressed this. On sort of the AI sort of strategy going forward versus like mass capacity storage, what are you hearing from your customers from the enterprise side in terms of what the priority looks like from an investment perspective? I know your mass capacity product is seeing some really strong traction out of the gate. But over the longer term, how do you think the mix between high-end, high-performance storage and mass capacity trends? And then maybe just on Public Cloud real quickly, I know this has been sort of a fits and starts business for you. When you think about how much of maybe an impact on your management bandwidth, how are you thinking about that business longer term now? I know you're talking about giving out updated outlook maybe next quarter. But do you still think it has the same opportunity to be a key driver for the business? Or is it maybe a little bit less of a longer-term opportunity today than you might have thought 90 days ago or even a year ago at this point? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Let me hit on those two points. I think the first is with regard to AI, again, as I mentioned, it's a broad life cycle of tasks. There are light portions of the life cycle that run on extremely high-performance systems. And then there are portions of the life cycle where the data sits on more fine-tuned capacity-oriented systems because you want to keep versions of your models available. And so I look at it like any type of workload, there's a portion of time where the workload has data that's hot and then there's a portion of its life cycle where you want to keep a copy of the data. With regard to the overall all-flash array outlook, listen, I think we have one quarter in. We are really pleased with the adoption of our capacity flash products. Overall, what I see is all-flash will grow at higher than our total storage business and will be a bigger part of our mix. Within all-flash, the capacity flash products will grow more quickly than the performance flash products because one is attacking the next tranche of upgrades and refreshes, which is the 10-K drive market while the high-performance products have already been in market for a long period of time. So I think that's how they break that out. With regard to cloud, I think that, listen, the opportunity is strong. We are excited about the growth of our cloud storage services all of the capabilities and the pace of customer adoption of those services. We have more exciting news to come with Google around the work we're doing with them, both with regard to the expansion of our offerings as well as new use cases in the Google Cloud that you'll hear more about in the next couple of weeks. And I think that our approach right now is to focus on the best parts of our cloud portfolio have a dedicated go-to-market model that has been well received by the hyperscalers. We're 1 quarter in. The cloud storage and consumption offerings performed well. We have work to do on the subscription side. We'll give you an update next quarter. Our overall view of cloud has not changed.\nDavid Vogt: Great, thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSteven Fox: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up on some of those last comments, George, especially on subscription. I guess I'm wondering, obviously, you want to grow faster in public cloud. But -- and the subscription business being down, it seems like it's consistent with the type of macro we're in. So I guess I'm trying to understand more specifically, given all the other stuff that's going on in terms of public cloud, in terms of refining the business, why the subscription business is especially disappointing here as opposed to maybe riding it out until you start to see an up cycle? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: Yes. Listen, I think that we are not the only company in the world that had a subscription cloud software business that got impacted. When we saw the trends for optimization, you generally see the consumption part of the business get optimized quickly because you are on a pay-as-you-go contract. I think the subscription part usually gets affected at the time of a renewal of a subscription or a decision to expand or not expand a subscription. That doesn't excuse the fact that we wanted to do better in the subscription part of our business. I think we've got work to do to refine our portfolio, sharpen the value proposition, optimize pricing in certain cases to meet customers' expectations, and we'll give you an update on that. We're already working on those. We'll give you an update on that on the next call.\nSteven Fox: Great, thatâ€™s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. It sounds from your comments like you had at least 7 to 8 points of backlog-related headwind from last year in AFA. Can you help us think through is the magnitude sort of similar in fiscal 2Q? And for fiscal second-half on the Hybrid Cloud side, is it fair to think that there's going to be a 4 to 5 point acceleration in growth? And as you look at the estimates that the Street's modeling is kind of -- that's kind of what is implied. And I'm wondering if you could talk about what is the upside that you're seeing in hybrid that's offsetting the weakness in public, given your relative overall guidance didn't change? Thank you so much.\nMike Berry: Hey, Wamsi, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So let's go through the numbers. So yes, you're pretty close on the impact. It was about [Technical Difficulty] So last quarter, we talked about, if you adjust for the backlog benefit in the first half of fiscal '23 and you compared our growth this first-half with the second-half of last year when we declined about 5% or 6%, we expect the growth to be better than that, still slightly negative. That is about the same in Q1 and Q2, so Q2 has about the same impact. Based on the midpoint of guidance, we do expect Hybrid Cloud then to have growth in the second-half, the low-single-digit growth based on the guidance that we gave. And we're still comfortable with that based on the progress that we saw in Q1, especially related to C-Series. The focus that we have on the new products, as well as the go-to-market changes, we do expect those to bear more fruit as we go into the second-half, and that's based on what we've seen not only in pipelines and then also sales activity. So overall, yes, that would be accurate, and that's what gives us confidence as we go into the second-half of the year.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay, great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe as a first question, you noted that the storage and consumption piece of the business you expected that, that was growing about market rate this quarter. I guess just is kind of the assumption there that essentially optimization has stabilized, and we are starting to see growth again? I just kind of want to get a sense of where you guys are in terms of what you -- if we're at kind of the bottom of optimization and seeing growth again or if we're still kind of in this bottom out period? And then as a second question, just if there's any kind of surprises in terms of customer types or workload types that have been more interested in C-Series than kind of initially expected? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: On the first question, Meta, I think that what we saw was continued good pace of customer additions, which means that there are cloud projects and ongoing deployment of workloads on the cloud. We saw the pace of optimization slowdown as customers have basically done the easy stuff. And so now they probably are more cautious about what further to optimize. Within the latter bucket, the customers that have been optimizing, there are early signs of them starting to do new projects on our technology, but they haven't ramped those projects yet. So the benefit we saw within the quarter was new customers and new workloads as opposed to the ones that optimize reaccelerating spending. With regard to the second question, capacity flash, we were selling high-performance flash into use cases where capacity flash was a better product. Those were in two flavors. One would be more of a general purpose private cloud environment where customers don't care about the performance of a particular application, but generally want good performance. And so that was one and then smaller environments where we had the A150 product that was also introduced at a lower price point than any other flash product. Both of them saw strength. And I think we saw strength in the mid-market segment, broadly speaking, across all of our products.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I got caught off in the middle, so I apologize if this was addressed. But on the Public Cloud, can you just talk about what are the reasons that led to the miss of here? Was it macro or there any micro impact as well? And then when you talk about the initiatives you're taking, is it more around just aligning your specialists to the hyperscalers? Or are you taking any more incremental initiatives? Just love to understand macro versus micro impact? And then what are the initiatives you're specifically taking to address them?\nGeorge Kurian: I think broadly speaking, if you look at our cloud business, roughly three-quarter is consumption and one-quarter is subscription. That mix has shifted in favor of consumption a meaningful amount over the last year as customers have preferred more of the marketplace and first-party offerings over some of our more traditional subscription type, bring your own license offerings. I think the impact that we saw was more pronounced in subscription rather than consumption. Consumption performed quite well. And so I would point out that it's in the one-quarter of the business in subscription. Then second, with regard to whether it was macro or micro, it was a mix of things. I think it was -- in some customers, clearly, it was related to budget constraints, where upon renewal, they said, listen, I want to use less of the product and only use it for the most mission-critical environment, some of our monitoring tools. In other cases, it was the customer not being ready to deploy the product and so we've taken a couple of actions. One action is to, as we said, conduct a review of our products, make sure we have the right products tailored to the right use cases that pricing is set up right, that the value share between us and the customers set up right, that is already underway. We've implemented some of those changes. We'll give you a more fulsome update. And then with regard to go-to-market, we've, as we noted, implemented both a dedicated cloud specialist organization aligned with the hyperscalers and also implemented customer success so that customers can get expertise from NetApp on how to use the products. It's early. We've seen some good evidence of progress, but there's more work to be done.\nAmit Daryanani: Got it. That's really helpful. And Mike, if I could just have you clarify Q1 free cash flow, I think, was much better than what I had expected and what you typically be in Q1, I think, as well. Can you just touch on maybe what drove that, if there was a bit of a pull-in or something with some of the stuff? And any view on fiscal year free cash flow, given the strong performance here?\nMike Berry: Yes. Awesome. Thanks for the question on cash. Yes, there was -- it was quite a bit better than we thought. There was three moving parts. Amit, I would say you've seen billings come in lower in the last two quarters. So collections were down year-over-year. But what really drove the operating and free cash flow was the reduction in our supply chain spending. And that's not only premiums. It's the quantity of components that came down significantly. And then, of course, pricing came down as well. So that, if you think about the rest of the year, we should expect to continue to see some of that benefit not as big as in Q1 because that compares to Q1 of last year when we were still, I'll call it, bulking up on inventory because we expect the growth before things slowed down in the middle of the year. You know, the one-time benefit year-over-year, which unfortunately is we paid a good bit less in incentive compensation. So that helped drive it as well. And then lower CapEx helped drive free cash flow as well. And we did say, hey, the $239 million we spent last year, we expect to be the high and we expect that to continue to come down. As you look at the rest of the year, we do expect on a full-year basis it to track pretty close to non-GAAP net income, which guidance is somewhere around $1.2 billion. I do want to note, though, hey, folks in Q2 -- and this happens every year, keep in mind, it's the quarter we pay most of our taxes. So we pay almost $88 million in repatriation taxes and then we make our U.S. federal tax payment as well. So expect Q2 to be down from Q1, and it's been like that every year. And then in the back half, following more typical trends. So thanks for the question.\nAmit Daryanani: Thank you.\nOperator: And the final question today comes from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. I guess my first question, George, can you talk about ONTAP AI from a competitive standpoint? Are you seeing this as an ability basically to sell into your existing customer base you are using ONTAP and comfortable with it in that? Or is this something that, from a competitive differentiation standpoint, can actually drive switchers to NetApp's product set? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: We sell ONTAP AI into data science teams and AI teams, whether they are in our installed base or net new accounts. They are -- it's a very verticalized selling model. So for example, in pharmaceuticals, we work with teams on rapid drug discovery, clinical data analysis so that they can apply really high-performance GPUs from NVIDIA with -- together with large-scale data storage from NetApp. We could also do the same thing. For example, in manufacturing, we are selling into advanced digital twin prototypes where they are optimizing manufacturing yield and sort of accelerating development. So I think those are the key areas that we have sort of net new budget, net new customer landscape. Our advantages are high performance, large scale advanced demo management, the best in the industry, and it's highly integrated into the data science toolkit of our customers. And then increasingly, we also now have the same versions of 2 chains running on all the leading public clouds, and you'll hear more about that in the next couple of weeks at the Google conference.\nShannon Cross: Okay. And then I guess we've asked you about AI from sort of an opportunity standpoint. But how are you thinking about utilizing generative AI internally within NetApp to increase productivity, save costs and maybe, I don't know, improve customer experience? Thanks.\nGeorge Kurian: We already use AI tools in three ways. One is to accelerate software development and to increase the pace at which we can deliver more innovation to customers. The second, to integrate AI into our products and services so that we can automatically detect, for example, ransomware attacks or impending risks from running systems harder than they should be or various other things and give customers proactive advice rather than reactive response. And then the third is across the range of our businesses, everything from marketing collateral, documentation, multilingual support as well as chatbots. In customer service, we have AI capabilities already being integrated. And Gen AI is the next version of that. So there are lots of exciting projects underway on that. Thank you, Shannon.\nShannon Cross: Thank you.\nGeorge Kurian: Let me close with a few comments. The strong customer reception to the substantial innovation we have brought to market has got in FY '24 to a solid start, despite the choppy macro backdrop. We are laser-focused on our FY '24 priorities to be prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, to reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in our storage systems business and to build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. Early results of this focus indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth while yielding top line growth in the back half of the year. I am absolutely delighted by the positive reception to our new products, the differentiation and continued growth of our first-party public cloud storage services and our exciting innovation road map. I hope to see you at INSIGHT and look forward to updating on our continued progress on next quarter's call. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
