At this time, all parties are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Tony Piazza, Senior Vice President of Finance and his colleagues at NetScout are on the line with us today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Tony Piazza to begin the company’s prepared remarks.\nTony Piazza: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to NetScout’s third quarter fiscal year 2024 conference call for the period ended December 31, 2023. Joining me today are Anil Singhal, NetScout’s President and Chief Executive Officer; Michael Szabados, NetScout’s Chief Operating Officer; and Jean Bua, NetScout’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. There is a slide presentation that accompanies our prepared remarks. You can advance the slides in the webcast viewer to follow our commentary. Both the slides and the prepared remarks can be accessed in multiple areas within the investor relations section of our website at www.netscout.com, including the IR landing page under financial results, the webcast itself, and under financial information on the quarterly results page. Moving on to Slide Number 3, today’s conference call will include forward-looking statements. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements regarding our future financial performance or position, results of operations, business strategy, plans and objectives of management for future operations, and other statements that are not historical fact. You can identify forward-looking statements by their use of forward-looking words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “plan,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” or other comparable terms. We caution listeners not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements included in this presentation which speak only as of today’s date. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements due to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including but not limited to those described on this slide and in today’s financial results press release. For a more detailed description of the risk factors associated with the company, please refer to the company’s annual report on Form 10-K for the financial year ended March 31, 2023, on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. NetScout assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information contained in this communication or with respect to the announcements described herein. Let’s now turn to Slide Number 4, which involves non-GAAP metrics. While this slide presentation includes both GAAP and non-GAAP results, unless otherwise stated, financial information discussed on today’s conference call will be on a non-GAAP basis only. The rationale for providing non-GAAP measures along with the limitations of relying solely on those measures is detailed on this slide and in today’s press release. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP metrics with the applicable GAAP measures are provided in the appendix of the slide presentation, in today’s earnings press release, and on our website. I will now turn the call over to Anil for his prepared remarks. Anil?\nAnil Singhal: Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you all for joining us today. At a high level, we delivered third quarter revenue and non-GAAP EPS ahead of our expectations due to the timing of customer year-end budget spending and our continued cost containment efforts. However, the macro environment remains challenging with constrained customer spending and elongated sales cycles. We continue to see strength in our cybersecurity business, where we delivered double-digit revenue growth during the first nine months of fiscal year 2024. Our service assurance business continues to face headwinds, primarily due to the Tier-1 U.S. carriers’ capital constrained environment. Accordingly, our enterprise customer vertical was relatively flat for this period, while our service provider customer vertical is creating the majority of the revenue pressure. Given the macro dynamics, we anticipate delivering full fiscal year 2024 revenue at the low end of our previously disclosed outlook range, while our cost containment efforts and other activities should position us to deliver non-GAAP EPS for the full fiscal year at the higher end of our previously disclosed outlook or relatively in-line with last fiscal year’s EPS, on a lower revenue base year-over-year. We will provide more specifics during our remarks. With that as a backdrop, let’s turn to Slide Number 6 for a brief recap of our non-GAAP financial results for the third quarter and first nine months of our fiscal year 2024. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, revenue was ahead of our expectations at approximately $218 million, due to the timing of customer year-end budget spending. On a year-over-year basis, this was down approximately 19%, as growth in the cybersecurity product line only partially offset a decline in the service assurance product line for the reasons previously mentioned. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.73, which exceeded our expectations due to higher revenue and lower costs than we previously anticipated. This was a decrease of 27% year-over-year, primarily related to lower revenue, partially offset by continued cost containment efforts and other activities. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, or the period ended December 31, 2023, revenue was $626 million, down approximately 11% year-over-year. During this period, our cybersecurity revenue grew more than 13% but was more than offset by a service assurance revenue decline of approximately 20%, both on a year-over-year basis. Excluding radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue from the comparison, service revenue – service assurance revenue declined approximately 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first nine months was $1.65, down approximately [indiscernible] year-over-year as the impact of lower revenue was partially offset by cost containment efforts and a lower share count. Now, let’s move to Slide Number 7 for some further perspective on market and business insights, starting with our enterprise customer vertical. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, enterprise revenue was essentially flat year-over-year, as revenue growth in our cybersecurity product lines offset a middle digit percentage decline in our service assurance product line revenue. In the enterprise market, flow through rate continued to be affected by higher spending scrutiny and delayed project funding as customers navigated the current macroeconomic environment. However, some sectors grew year-to-date, such as government and financials, while others, like the healthcare sector, were notably softer. We expect our enhanced cybersecurity solutions and ability to extend visibility to the edge will continue to resonate with our customers. These solutions help protect customers’ networks from attack, cover “blind spots,” address control challenges, and facilitate their leverage of offpremises and cloud solutions within digital transformation and new network architecture initiatives. Moving to our service provider customer vertical. Revenue in the first nine months of the fiscal year declined approximately 22% year-over-year. Excluding radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue from the comparison, the service provider customer vertical revenue declined approximately 13% year-over-year, as revenue growth in our cybersecurity product line was more than offset by a decline in our core service assurance product line revenue. The service provider market remains challenging, especially for the U.S. Tier-1 service providers given capital spending constraints, which is causing intense spending scrutiny and delayed project funding. This dynamic appears to be impacting the finalization of carriers’ new calendar year budgets and funding as well. We expect the challenging market dynamics to persist for the remainder of the fiscal year and likely into the next fiscal year. However, we believe that as 5G adoption accelerates, new use cases advance, and the 5G traffic volumes increase, our core visibility and cybersecurity solutions will be increasingly required. We remain prepared and ready to support carriers through this inevitable transition with our differentiated solutions. Despite the current selling environment, we are encouraged by the interest in our new offerings, like Omnis, and recent traction with our other cybersecurity solutions, particularly our DDoS offerings, including Adaptive DDoS and Mobile Security. Michael will provide more insight regarding customer orders in our verticals during his remarks. Now, let’s move to Slide Number 8 to review our outlook. Looking ahead, taking into consideration the current environment, for the full fiscal year 2024 we expect revenue will be at the low end of our previously disclosed revenue outlook range, or approximately $840 million. We anticipate delivering non-GAAP EPS at the higher end of our previously disclosed EPS outlook range as we continue to benefit from our cost containment efforts and other activities. This would put our non-GAAP EPS relatively in-line with last fiscal year’s EPS, on lower revenue year-over-year. Jean will provide a recap of the outlook in her remarks. Despite the continuation of near-term headwinds, we believe that fundamental longer-term demand trends remain intact for NetScout as enterprises and service providers require industry-leading cybersecurity and service assurance solutions such as ours to deliver actionable visibility at scale. Accordingly, we remain focused on leveraging our industry leading Visibility Without Borders platform to help customers tackle the performance, availability and cybersecurity challenges of the increasingly complex connected digital world. We expect the continued execution of this strategy will enable us to deliver sustainable value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing our progress with everyone at the conclusion of our fiscal year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Szabados: Thank you, Anil, and good morning, everyone. Slide 10 outlines the areas that I will be covering today, starting with customer win highlights in the third quarter. In our enterprise customer vertical, during the quarter we displaced a competitor to win a low-seven digit figure – low-seven figure order from a leading domestic insurance company, which is a new logo for us. The opportunity related to our service assurance solutions needed to address datacenter and hybrid cloud visibility. We won this deal due to our superior technology that addressed incumbent vendor shortfalls and our strong reputation as an industry leader. We believe that there are more opportunities on the horizon to support this new customer with further service assurance deployments as well as potential cybersecurity solutions, given strong explicit interest in this area as well. Turning to our service provider customer vertical, a Tier 1 European carrier renewed a multi-year agreement with us and placed a mid-seven figure order that included both service assurance solutions to advance their 5G network evolution as well as cybersecurity solutions. The order included our recently released Mobile Security Solution that leverages our innovative MobileStream and Sightline offerings to detect DDoS attacks on the mobile network, a product derived from our market-leading solution generally deployed in the fixed line network. We won this opportunity due to our proven technology and strong long-standing incumbent relationship with this customer. As we advance this new Mobile Security Solution we are encouraged by the high interest in this offering as we are actively engaged in multiple deal discussions in addition to a handful of trials across the service provider landscape. Now in terms of go-to-market activities, recently we announced the launch of Adaptive DDoS for Arbor Edge Defense to protect ISPs and enterprises from so called DNS Water Torture Attack as we enhance our solutions with our new technologies. Additionally, we plan to attend Mobile World Congress, MWC in Barcelona in late February, where we will be meeting with existing and prospective customers. Our focus will be on sharing our latest service assurance, AI and ML analytics and cybersecurity solutions related to 5G network visibility and cybersecurity requirements. That concludes my remarks. Thank you everyone. I will now turn the call over to Jean for a review of our financial results.\nJean Bua: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will review key metrics for our third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2024 and provide some additional commentary on our fiscal year 2024 outlook. As a reminder, this review focuses on our non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated, and all reconciliations with our GAAP results appear in the presentation appendix. Regardless, I will note the nature of any such comparisons. Slide number 12 details the results for the third quarter and first nine months of our fiscal year 2024. Focusing first on our quarterly performance, total revenue was $218.1 million, down 19.1% year-over-year. Product revenue was $95.8 million, a decrease of 35.9%, while service revenue was $122.2 million, up 1.8% both on a year-over-year basis. Gross profit margin was 81.8% in the third quarter, up 1.3 percentage point’s year-over-year, primarily attributable to higher service revenue and lower variable incentive compensation expense as compared to the last fiscal year. Quarterly operating expenses decreased 5.2% year-over-year primarily due to cost containment efforts including reduced variable incentive compensation. Operating expenses for the quarter included our ENGAGE, User and Technology Event which had historically occurred in our first quarter. We reported an operating profit margin of 29% compared with 35.5% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.73 compared to $1 in the same quarter last year. Turning to Slide 13, I will review key revenue trends by customer verticals and product lines. Please note that all comparisons here are on a year-over-year basis consistent with our other remarks. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, our enterprise customer vertical revenue was effectively flat. Our service provider customer vertical revenue decreased 22.1%. During the same period, our enterprise customer vertical accounted for approximately 54% of our total revenue, while our service provider customer vertical accounted for the remaining 46%. Turning to our product lines. For the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, our cybersecurity revenue increased by 13.5%, while our service assurance revenue decreased by 19.7%. During the same period our service assurance product line accounted for approximately 68% of our total revenue, while our cybersecurity product line accounted for the remaining 32%. Turning to Slide 14, this shows our geographic revenue mix. In the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, 59% of our revenue was derived from the United States, with the remaining 41% provided by international markets. As expected, the mix between domestic and international markets shifted from the same period last year partially due to lower Tier 1 domestic carrier radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue this fiscal year. Also, no customer represented 10% or more of our total revenue in the third quarter or for the first nine months of the fiscal year. Slide 15 details our balance sheet highlights and free cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $330.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, short- and long-term marketable securities and investments, representing a decrease of $2.5 million since the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Free cash flow for the quarter was $12.7 million. During the third quarter, we repurchased a total of approximately 706,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $18.8 million or an average price of $26.66 per share. From a debt perspective, we ended the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 with $100 million outstanding on our $800 million revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2026. To briefly recap other balance sheet highlights: accounts receivable, net, was $221.6 million representing an increase of $77.7 million since March 31, 2023. The DSO metric at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 90 days, versus 69 days at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 and 58 days at the end of fiscal year 2023. The higher DSO metric in the third quarter of this fiscal year was due to the timing and composition of bookings. Let's move to Slide 16 for commentary on our outlook. I will focus my review on our non-GAAP targets for fiscal year 2024. As Anil noted earlier, we are updating our outlook for fiscal year 2024, which was last presented on November 2, 2023 during our second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. We now anticipate revenue to be approximately $840 million at the lower end of our previously disclosed range. We anticipate non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to now be within the range of $2.15 to $2.20. This is toward the upper end of our previously disclosed range as we benefit from continued cost management efforts as well as a lower tax rate and share count. The effective tax rate is expected to be at the lower end of our range of 20% to 22% as we finalize the tax impacts related to legislation associated with the capitalization of R&D costs. Our weighted average diluted shares outstanding is assumed to be between 72 million and 73 million shares, which includes the impact of our recent share repurchase activity. That concludes my formal review of our financial results. Thank you and I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Hedberg: Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions.\nAnil Singhal: Sure.\nMatt Hedberg: Anil, you noted in your prepared remarks, obviously some of the pressure on service provider spending, I think you said you think some of that could drift into next year, but that 5G could start to improve some spending trends there. I guess I'm wondering, as you talk to customers, I think we've always been sort of curious on what that spark could be on 5G? What are some things that you're hearing from customers that gives you sort of the confidence that some of those trends could start to reverse, something maybe with consumer broadband, anything on the wireless side. Just anything that you're kind of seeing there that kind of gives you the thought that those trends there could start to improve?\nAnil Singhal: Thanks Matt. So I think maybe we can talk about our strategy for next year at a high level rather than some of the estimates from people because they're still finalizing their budget and we keep hearing different stories at different time, even though I've met with almost all of the Tier 1 carriers in the last six months. So what we are looking at it is that with this Omnis product line, we have our data while there is lot of pressure on capital spending on the service assurance solution, but is very good for AIOps type and automation applications. So that's one direction we are talking to them, appeal to a different audience in the customer base and user incumbency. And second is reducing our dependency on the service assurance service provider business. And so with a combination of those things if 5G takes off in other words, there could be some upside. But that's basically what we are looking at because I think it's not deterministic what's going to happen to the capital spending on the traditional service assurance part of our service provider business.\nMatt Hedberg: Got it. That's helpful. And then you noted on this a second ago, I guess just double clicking on the cyber business, which seems to be doing quite well. Are there things that relative to expectations are doing a bit better? And maybe just to double click on that because it feels like there's a lot of good things happening, kind of even below some of the top line growth estimates that we're seeing there?\nAnil Singhal: So if you – we have mentioned in the past that we didn't integrate the Arbor business, so in high level we have service assurance business which is like 65% of the business. In that we have service provider spending challenges as a bigger issue. Then we have the Arbor business, which also have a service provider enterprise. And then Omnis was introduced just last year and still taking some time for traction. So if Arbor business was integrated into NetScout roughly two years ago and we are seeing the effect on this – on from a technology point of view we're bringing the DPI technology to the DDoS market. So typically DDoS is for volumetric attack and we have introduced something called adaptive DDoS, which is really application layer attacks. We talked about – Michael talked about DNS Water Torture Attack and that's driving this growth this year and hopefully this will continue next year.\nMatt Hedberg: Thank you very much, appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Fish with Piper Sandler.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys. Thank you. This is Quinto on for Jim; maybe double clicking on Matt's second question there. We've heard from both you and other vendors in the space about the acceleration of those DDoS attacks that have occurred this year. Can you talk about any relationship you've seen between the pace or the volume of these attacks and your cyber performance in the past? And as we look towards Fiscal 2025 is this something that could kind of reaccelerate or continue to accelerate security growth as customers may be nearing their upper end of capacity and are in need for an upgrade?\nAnil Singhal: Yeah. Sure. So first thing that I want to mention that on our website, we publish a threat report which talks about how the attacks are morphing and like there are attacks called carpet-bombing attack, which is new, which is basically, you – instead of attacking a server, you basically attack multiple devices in customer’s network. It's very hard to detect. And then there's a DNS water torture attacks where you bring down a DNS server, then nobody can do anything. So these are the two areas we introduce new functionality. So yes, attacks are increasing, but we are now handling new kinds of attacks, which we call Adaptive DDoS, and we think there's going to be that there is a lot of interest in that. Plus Arbor business was more service provider business. NetScout had a lot of enterprise business. So as we combined the sales forces, we are seeing traction on the enterprise portion of DDoS, which is our AD – AED product which is different than in the past.\nUnidentified Analyst: Makes a lot of sense. And then maybe, for Anil, for you, in your prepared remarks, you talked about benefiting from the year-end budget flush, it sounds like this was more on that cyber side. But can you walk through any verticals or segments specifically that benefited from this flush compared to last year? Thank you.\nAnil Singhal: Yes. Maybe Jean can add to this. But this was not necessarily budget flush. Maybe some of the orders from Q4 went into Q3. And so we didn't see this traditional budget flush, which we have seen in the past, especially after COVID. Jean, anything you'd like to say?\nJean Bua: No. You are correct. Anil, when we had given our color for Q3, we were not sure whether the – our customers would be using their calendar year 2023 budgets or start using their calendar year 2024 budgets, hence the skew between our Q3 and our Q4. And so what we found was that they did use their 2023 budgets, which is our fiscal calendar – fiscal year Q3 year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Fantastic. Appreciate it.\nAnil Singhal: Sure, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kevin Liu with K. Liu & Company.\nKevin Liu: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask, about kind of your early expectations for next fiscal year. Specifically on the cybersecurity side, given what you're seeing in terms of pipeline build for your new products versus some of the growth coming from the Arbor side of the business? How should we think about, what the mix of business on cybersecurity and ultimately, should we expect that to accelerate growth or do you think it'll stay pretty consistent with what you've seen over the past 12 months?\nAnil Singhal: Yes. So this one was much higher growth versus in the past and like I mentioned some of the integration of technology, some of the new product resulted in that. I also want to add that we also have a product called Omnis Security, which is in the NDR space. And so when we talk about security revenue, we will include both of them. This year Omnis Security has not picked up, so bulk of the growth is because of Arbor. So we think that security growth will be better – continue to be better than the service assurance next year also. And hence the percentage of security might go higher and but we should be able to provide some guidance on this in the next earnings call.\nKevin Liu: Understood. And then Anil, could you also elaborate a little bit on kind of the opportunities outside of Tier-1 service provider as we move into this current calendar year? Just wondering if you believe there's enough opportunity there to help offset some of the declines that might be coming from the capital spending side. Yes, if you could just talk about that a little bit?\nAnil Singhal: I think, the challenge is, Kevin, is in that there are cheaper price incumbents on the lower end of the market beyond the top 10 or 20 where we already are coverage. So I see in service assurance the bigger opportunities 5G takes off in terms of user plan much faster or, and or doing something with the Mobile Security area or applying some of our solution to AI use cases like heavy user bandwidth, air fiber which is like the fiber over FTTH, which is AT&T recently announced. And so those are the trends which are going to be, but I think going after that below Tier-1 or where we are not incumbent, I see is hard because there are a lot of regional vendors and there is very big price competition.\nKevin Liu: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.\nAnil Singhal: Sure.\nOperator: This does conclude the question-and-answer portion of today's call. So I'd like to turn the call back over to Tony for any additional or closing remarks.\nTony Piazza: Thank you, operator. That concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining us and enjoy the rest of the day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at this time."

I will now turn the call over to Anil for his prepared remarks. Anil?\nAnil Singhal: Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered second quarter revenue in line with our preliminary results announced in mid-October. Revenue was impacted by a slowing in order conversion rate in the second quarter related to industry and economic headwinds that we expect will persist into the second half of fiscal year 2024. In response to these dynamics, we initiated several actions to manage discretionary costs, which more than offset the bottom-line impact in the second fiscal quarter and should reduce the negative impact to our full fiscal year earnings per share outlook – without compromising our longer-term objectives. We will provide more information on these market dynamics affecting our business as we review our performance and outlook. Let’s turn to Slide 6 for a brief recap of our non-GAAP financial results for the second quarter and first half of our fiscal year 2024. For the second quarter, financial results were in-line with our preliminary expectations released on October 16th. Revenue for the quarter was $196.8 million, down 13.7% year-over-year, due to the previously mentioned order conversion slowdown related to the industry and economic environment impacting our customers as well as a lower level of radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue compared to the prior year. Despite the revenue decline, we delivered diluted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.61, an increase of 7% year-over-year, as we benefited from several discretionary cost saving actions that we initiated in response to the current environment. For the first half of the fiscal year, or the period ended September 30, 2023 revenue for the first half was $407.9 million, down 6.6% year-over-year, primarily for the reasons stated earlier that impacted our second fiscal quarter revenue. The corresponding diluted earnings per share of $0.92, was an increase of 13.6% year-over-year, which again, benefited from the actions taken during our second fiscal quarter. Finally, for the first half of the fiscal year, our cybersecurity revenue grew approximately 10% year-over-year, due to growth in both our core DDoS and our newer Omnis Security solutions, as customers prioritized spending on security solutions. This was more than offset by a decline of approximately 13% year-over-year in our service assurance revenue, due to the reasons we mentioned earlier. Excluding radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue from the comparison, service assurance revenue declined approximately 8% year-over-year. Now, let’s move to Slide 7 for some further perspective on market and business insights. Starting with our enterprise customer vertical. In the first half of fiscal year 2024, enterprise revenue declined approximately 3% year-over-year, as growth in our cybersecurity product line revenue was more than offset by a decline in our service assurance product line revenue. Toward the end of the second quarter, our order flow through rates began to be affected by higher spending scrutiny and delayed project funding as customers navigated the evolving and challenging macroeconomic environment. This resulted in sub-pockets of softness across multiple enterprise sectors as deals were delayed or reevaluated, most notably in the financial and healthcare sectors, which were partially offset by growth in the government sector. Despite the current economic environment, we remain confident that our value proposition of providing enhanced cybersecurity solutions and extending visibility to the edges of the network will continue to resonate with enterprise customers as they seek to protect their networks from attack, cover “blind spots,” address control challenges, and facilitate their leverage of off-premises and cloud solutions as part of their digital transformation and new network architecture initiatives. Moving to our service provider customer vertical. Revenue in the first half of the fiscal year declined approximately 11% year-over-year, which was primarily attributable to a lower level of radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue. Excluding radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue from the comparison, the service provider customer vertical revenue declined approximately 3% year-over-year, as revenue growth in our cybersecurity product line, driven by the prioritization of security solution spending, was more than offset by a decline in our core service assurance product line revenue. Revenue in this vertical was also impacted by a slowing in demand flow-through late in the second quarter, as higher spending scrutiny and delayed project funding was observed, likely due to the well-publicized capital spending constraints impacting service providers. Notably, most of the order delays in this vertical related to cable and international service providers. We anticipate North American service providers will follow a similar pattern in the second half of the fiscal year given recent news and customer interactions, which is reflected in our updated outlook. Despite the industry challenges in this vertical, we believe that as 5G adoption accelerates, new use cases advance, and 5G traffic volumes increase, our core visibility and cybersecurity solutions will be increasingly required. We remain prepared and ready to support carriers through this inevitable transition with our differentiated solutions. Michael will provide more insight regarding customer orders in our verticals during his remarks. Now, let’s move to Slide 8 to review our outlook. We adjusted our fiscal year 2024 outlook to account for the changed market environment. We reduced our revenue outlook by $80 million, assuming the midpoints of our original and updated revenue outlook ranges. This represents a combination of both service provider and enterprise-related opportunities in our pipeline that we believe may be delayed or revisited due to current industry and economic headwinds as deals are increasingly scrutinized and take longer to close. We originally expected these opportunities, as well as other factors, to more than offset the approximately $60 million of lower radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue anticipated year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, we took immediate actions to prudently manage costs, such as curtailing hiring, eliminating certain programs and events, and adjusting variable incentive compensation, to reduce the negative impact to our full fiscal year earnings per share outlook without compromising our longer-term objectives. Jean will provide a recap of the outlook in her remarks. Looking ahead, we are committed to delivering results in-line with our updated outlook as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities and position NETSCOUT to deliver long-term stakeholder value. Despite the near-term headwinds, we believe that the longer-term demand trends driving our business remain intact as enterprises and service providers continue to require cybersecurity and service assurance solutions that deliver actionable visibility at scale. With our industry leading ‘Visibility Without Borders’ platform, strong customer relationships, and solid financial profile, we remain well-positioned to play a critical role in enabling our customers to tackle the performance, availability, and security challenges of the increasingly complex connected digital world. We look forward to sharing our progress with everyone throughout the remainder of our fiscal year. With that, I’ll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Szabados: Thank you, Anil, and good morning, everyone. Slide 10 outlines the areas that I will be covering today, starting with customer win highlights in the second quarter. In our enterprise customer vertical, we experienced several deals where customers purchased across our platform of solutions, a trend we are seeing more of, which we believe validates the power of NETSCOUT’s unified portfolio and supports our strategy. For example, a federal agency placed multi-solution orders totaling mid-seven figures with us in the second quarter. These orders consisted of solutions across our service assurance, availability, and security product portfolio, within which our Omnis solution was a significant portion of this order. We have a long-standing relationship with this customer and our proven technology and historical performance continues to win us repeat business as they deploy our new and legacy solutions more broadly within their organization. Now, turning to our service provider customer vertical, we remain focused on supporting carriers’ 5G network evolutions as well as their security efforts, as cyberattack incidents accelerate, and threat surfaces continue to expand. We continue to see carriers invest in 5G and other areas, albeit at a slower pace and through smaller order sizes, given the current environment. During the second quarter, a long-standing, Tier-1 North American carrier customer placed follow on orders with us amounting to high-seven figures. These orders were for our service assurance solution, for both their mobile network, related to 5G and the radio access network, as well as for their business IT systems. We remain excited about continuing to broaden our relationship with this customer as a trusted partner across their organization and network ecosystem. Turning to our go-to-market activities. Since our last earnings call, we announced several product advancements. This included the release of Adaptive DDoS for our Threat Mitigation System and RAN Analytics for Carrier Aggregation. Additionally, we revealed a recent total economic impact study, completed by Forrester Consulting, which found that our Arbor DDoS protection solution delivered a return on investment of over 200% during the study period. We also announced that we achieved Amazon Web Services or AWS Security Competency for our advanced NDR product, Omnis Cyber Intelligence or OCI, in the category of threat detection and response. In addition, we issued our first half 2023 Threat Intelligence Report, highlighting the continued rise in cybercriminal activities. The report revealed that approximately 7.9 million DDoS attacks took place in the first half of the year, a 31% increase year-over-year. We also issued our latest Environmental, Social, and Governance report demonstrating our progress in this important area. Finally, in early October we hosted our customers and partners at our Annual ENGAGE Technology and User Summit in Orlando, Florida. It was another successful event, which included a combination of presentations, panel discussions, solution demonstrations, and hands-on trainings. Registration and attendance increased more than 50% year-over-year, demonstrating strong interest and loyalty among our users. During the event, we showcased our “Visibility Without Borders” Platform and how it provides a unified approach to addressing the industry’s most pertinent issues – an important value proposition as the performance, availability and security challenges of the industry are multiplying and are often interconnected and overlapping. At the event, we also announced our next-generation data export technology targeted at AIOps solutions running on advanced analytics platforms and data lakes to expand our “smart data” footprint. Thank you, everyone. That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Jean.\nJean Bua: Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will review key metrics for our second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024 and provide some additional commentary on our fiscal year 2024 outlook. As a reminder, this review focuses on our non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated, and all reconciliations with our GAAP results appear in the presentation appendix. Regardless, I will note the nature of any such comparisons. Slide 12 details our results for our second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2024. Focusing on quarterly performance, total revenue declined 13.7% year-over-year to $196.8 million. Product revenue declined 28% and service revenue was flat, both on a year-over-year basis. Our second-quarter fiscal year 2024 gross profit margin was 80.3%, up 3.5 percentage points over the same quarter last year. The increase was primarily attributable to lower levels of radio frequency propagation modeling project costs this quarter compared with last year and a reduction in variable incentive compensation. As a reminder, radio frequency propagation modeling projects tend to have significantly lower gross margin than our other products due to the labor-intensive nature of those projects. Quarterly operating expenses decreased 15.1% year-over-year, primarily related to cost reductions associated with variable incentive compensation and certain events. We reported an operating profit margin of 28%, compared with 23.7% in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.61 compared with $0.57 in the same quarter last year, an increase of 7% year-over-year as we took the actions previously mentioned to offset the impact of the revenue decline. Finally, I wanted to note that in the last month of the second quarter we divested the test lab automation portion of our Test Optimization business to Spirent for approximately $8 million. This business was not material to NETSCOUT’s overall financial profile, nor strategic to the company’s core offering. We believe that the sale to Spirent places the business with a better aligned owner. From a performance standpoint, the Test Optimization revenue contribution year-to-date was approximately $6 million. And we expect this absence to be a headwind of approximately the same level in year-over-year comparisons in fiscal year 2025. Turning to Slide 13. I’d now like to review key revenue trends by customer verticals and product lines. For the first half of fiscal year 2024 on a year-over-year basis, our enterprise customer vertical revenue declined 2.9%, while our service provider customer vertical declined 10.6%. During the first half of the fiscal year, our enterprise customer vertical accounted for 53% of our total revenue, while our service provider customer vertical accounted for the remaining 47%. Now turning to our product lines. In the first half of fiscal year 2024, our cybersecurity revenue increased 10.4% and – while our service assurance revenue decreased 13.1%, both on a year-over-year basis. During the first half of the fiscal year, our service assurance product line represented approximately 68% of total revenue, while our cybersecurity product line represented the remaining 32%. Turning to Slide 14, which shows our geographic revenue mix, in the first half of the fiscal year 60% of our revenue was derived from the United States, with the remaining 40% provided by international markets. The mix between domestic and international markets shifted from the same period last year, partially due to lower Tier 1 domestic carrier Radio Frequency Propagation Modeling project revenue this fiscal year. Also, no customers represented 10% or more of our total revenue in the second quarter or for the first half of the fiscal year. Slide 15 details our balance sheet highlights and free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $332.6 million in cash, cash equivalents, short and long-term marketable securities and investments, representing a decrease of $95.3 million since the end of fiscal year 2023. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of $27.9 million. During the second quarter, we repurchased a total of approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $31.2 million or an average price of $27.90 per share. From a debt perspective, we ended the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 with $100 million outstanding on our $800 million revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2026. To briefly recap our other balance sheet highlights, accounts receivable net was $152.6 million, an increase of $8.7 million since March 31, 2023, the DSO metric at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 69 days versus 52 days at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 and 58 days at the end of our fiscal year 2023. The higher DSO metric was due to the timing and composition of bookings. Moving to Slide 16 for commentary on our outlook. I will focus my review on our non-GAAP targets for fiscal year 2024. As Anil noted earlier, we updated our fiscal year 2024 outlook on October 16, 2023. For the full fiscal year 2024, we now anticipate revenue in the range of $840 million to $860 million. The effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 20% to 22%. Assuming between 73 million and 74 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding which includes the impact of our second quarter share repurchase activity, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to now be between $2 and $2.20. I’d also like to offer some color on the third quarter of the fiscal year. Starting with revenue. As Anil mentioned, the deals in the pipeline may take longer to close and may be influenced by the timing of customer budget cycles based on the calendar years, meaning the last calendar quarter of 2023 using that budget would hit our Q3 fiscal year. And if budgets for 2024 were being used, it would hit our Q1 2024 fiscal year. Therefore, we anticipate approximately 23% to 24% of the $850 million midpoint of our revenue outlook could take place in the third quarter. With regard to diluted earnings per share, third quarter EPS will be impacted by the anticipated timing of revenue as well as the cost of our ENGAGE event which took place in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 versus historically occurring in our first fiscal quarter. As a result, we anticipate third quarter EPS to be approximately 17% to 18% of the $2.10 midpoint of our EPS outlook. That concludes my formal review of our financial results. Before we transition to Q&A, I’d like to quickly note that our upcoming IR conference participation is listed on Slide 17. Thank you and I’ll now turn the call over to the operator to start Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. \nDan Bergstrom: Hey it’s Dan Bergstrom for Matt Hedberg. I appreciate taking your question. Can you hear me?\nAnil Singhal: Yes.\nDan Bergstrom: Okay. Great. So the spending environment has been kind of not great all year, but you’ve been fairly insulated from pressures and service provider over much of the first half. I appreciate the commentary on the call, but just wondering if you could provide any further color on maybe what changed in the environment or what you view as change and then really when that emerged in the quarter?\nAnil Singhal: Well, as we mentioned, Matt, that we started noticing this towards the end of the second quarter, but we see signs of big layoffs, if you look at two of the big bellwether of NEMs, Ericsson and Nokia announcing big layoffs and cutbacks. So all these are signs of this will continue for some time. And – but none of it is impacting – is impacted by competition or anything. So we think that the sales cycle has lengthened and these projects are important, but they should happen sometime in the next 12 months.\nDan Bergstrom: Okay. Great. And then maybe a little more on the two segments. Curious how you categorize enterprise demand outside of the financial and health care verticals. You called those out as soft Sounds like federal was strong. And then maybe on the service provider side, it sounds like much of the softness was in international markets. You’re assuming that occurs in North America over the second half, but you’re not seeing it yet. Is that correct?\nAnil Singhal: I think basically, as we mentioned, Matt, in the past, the service provider deals are very lumpy. And one big order in international can polarize the results. So I think it’s mainly international and cable, but cable is a lot of U.S. and even cable providers are doing 5G and mobility now. So I think the things are intertwined, and we think that it’s just the timing of who is affected when. And that’s why it looks like we are seeing only in international, but it’s just the timing of the orders, which – or the forecast, which makes it look like it’s just an international versus U.S. event in the first half.\nJean Bua: Yes. So just to add on to what Anil had said, in the service provider in international, there is a large Asian carrier that we do business with. And they are more like delayed their purchase as opposed to eliminated it. So it’s probably why you see the international service provider being decreased. Going forward, given the comments that Anil made about the constraints that you see in the North American carriers, the sales force has adjusted their projects and the timing of their projects, which contribute significantly to the change in revenue that we reported.\nDan Bergstrom: Okay. Thanks.\nJean Bua: And also just as one final thing because it’s usually – it’s the Fed quarter. The federal government did very well this quarter. We grew a little – between 25% to 30% for the quarter. And on a year-to-date basis, we’re up between 40% to 50% on – for the first half of the year versus the first half of last year.\nDan Bergstrom: That’s great. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. \nJames Fish: Hey, thanks for the questions. Working off to Dan’s question there, understanding budgets are tight and you’re seeing delays in push-outs. But I guess, based on your seasonal guide here, Jean, what makes you guys confident that this comes back in the March quarter based on the seasonality we typically see? I guess, what’s given the sales force confidence that it hits in March instead of sometime in fiscal 2025? As it really embeds a much, much larger pickup in that March quarter than we’ve seen historically even to hit the reduced guide here.\nJean Bua: So the sales force has – as you know, we have long-term relationships with all of the carriers. And – as Anil mentioned, the change in the budget was a surprise showing up in probably actually even in the later part of September in our quarter. What the sales force believes is in talking to each of our sales – each of our customers and going through a detailed list of carriers, they believe that the projects have either been delayed or they’ve been rightsized at this point. Q3 has historically been a larger quarter recently, and that has been mostly due with budget flushes. And I think the question of whether it will be in our Q3 using a 2023 remaining budget or budget flush or in our Q1 is something that we’re dealing with and the timing right now. And your question is, could it slip further out of fiscal 2024? At this point, the sales force doesn’t see that and they have significantly changed what their original expectations were.\nAnil Singhal: I think one more thing to add, James, to what Jean is saying is that we have seen this dynamic play out. There has been times where Q4 has been bigger than Q3. And because many of our carrier customers are – are using – their fiscal years are starting in January. So when these kind of things happen, sometimes the budgets instead of going – we have the opposite impact, instead of using budget flush for in the last – in the December quarter, we are in – our projects are funded by the new budget coming in the new fiscal year. So we have seen that with a couple of big carriers in the past, and that’s what we are anticipating this time depending on what happened with Q3.\nJean Bua: Yes. And just to be clear, in case I wasn’t when I said Q1, I’m thinking Q1 calendar year. So Q1 calendar year is our Q4. And as we’ve discussed in the past, Q3 gets the customer’s budget flushes and Q4 is the last quarter that our sales teams can get into accelerators into their commissions and other incentive compensations. So they usually have a high incentive to try to close those deals using the New Year’s budget in our fiscal Q4.\nJames Fish: Helpful color, guys. Can you guys just walk us through how you’re thinking then about gross margins? As they were pretty strong this quarter, obviously, – we don’t have the RFP projects going on, but how are you thinking about gross margins versus OpEx for the back half of the year? It seems like despite the revenue headwind for this current quarter, that you’re embedding actually a fairly massive sequential uptick in OpEx of about $20 million to $25 million. I guess, really the core of my question is why wouldn’t cost stay kind of near these levels, excluding the ENGAGE conference that you guys just hosted?\nJean Bua: So in Q3, we see the gross margin probably approaching 78%, 79% and Q4 being closer to 80% or higher. Operating expenses are flat in Q3 year-over-year due to the ENGAGE event, some head count additions and most of that has been offset by the change in variable incentive compensation. When you go out to Q4, we would see that there would be a decrease in operating expenses mostly due to the change in variable incentive compensation, such that for the full year, we would anticipate that our full year operating expenses could be down on a year-over-year basis by as much as 5%.\nJames Fish: Got it. Thanks guys.\nJean Bua: Thanks, Jim. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Kevin Liu with K. Liu & Company. Your line is open. \nKevin Liu: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to touch on the service provider business. As while, you mentioned cable as an area of weakness. So I was curious what percentage of your business that’s represented either over the first half or last year? And then what are some of the types of projects that are being delayed where we can look for those to come back potentially?\nAnil Singhal: Yes. So we don’t break out the – I mean, most of the cable business is part of the enterprise service assurance – enterprise works to – carrier vertical in the U.S. And largely, all of the cable business is that. So I don’t have the breakdown of the cable versus the total because we don’t report that. But the types of projects – there are projects in the security area, and DDoS area, Omni security area, DNS protection, there are a lot of security type projects. There are a lot of visibility type projects in the cable. And so it also a lot of people are using now, cable also are having their own 5G initiatives. So there are projects related to that. So they are all traditional things, except there has been more focus on the cable side in the recent past, and that’s why we see the impact this time.\nKevin Liu: Understood. And just as you kind of parse through the demand environment, is there any noticeable change in priorities between kind of your service assurance portfolio versus cybersecurity?\nAnil Singhal: Yes. I think like for many other vendors, if you look at any companies who have multiple verticals or multiple solution sets, yes we see the Cybesecurity project and – get higher prioritization, especially when the spending is tough. And that’s why you saw an uptick in that area versus the service assurance for the first half. \nKevin Liu: Thanks for taking the questions.\nAnil Singhal: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the Q&A portion of today’s call. And I would now like to turn the call over to Tony for any additional or closing remarks.\nTony Piazza: Thank you, operator. That concludes our call for today. Thank you all very much for joining us. Have a good rest of the day. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today’s NETSCOUT’s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. You may disconnect at any time."

Let's now turn to Slide number 4, which involves non-GAAP metrics. While this slide presentation includes both GAAP and non-GAAP results, unless otherwise stated, financial information discussed on today's conference call will be on a non-GAAP basis only. The rationale for providing non-GAAP measures along with the limitations of relying solely on those measures is detailed on this slide and in today's press release. These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of all non-GAAP metrics with the applicable GAAP measures are provided in the appendix of the slide presentation in today's earnings press release and on our website. I will now turn the call over to Anil for his prepared remarks. Anil?\nAnil Singhal: Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. Welcome, and thank you all for joining us today. Let's turn to Slide number 6 for a brief recap of our non-GAAP financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We delivered solid financial performance in the first quarter of fiscal year and released several key product offerings since our last earnings call. Revenue was $211.1 million, representing year-over-year growth of over 1%. We expanded both our gross margin and operating margins and grew our diluted EPS by nearly 30% year-over-year to deliver $0.31 per diluted share in the period. We also accomplished several product milestones with the release of our next-generation solutions that have already been well received by customers, and that we expect to start contributing to revenue in the second half of the fiscal year. This includes the release of our visibility with our broader platform that provides performance, security and availability across one common data framework. By proactively identifying areas of complexity, fragility and risk, the platform unlocks insights at unparalleled scale to deliver the intelligence needed to increase visibility, improve agility and keep data and application secure. Additionally, we relaunched our OCI or Omnis Cyber Intelligence Solution. This next generation of OCI is an advanced network detection and response for solution that uses highly scalable deep packet inspection and multiple threat detection matter at the source to detect threats in real time. OCI also applies historical investigation of high-fidelity network metadata and package. In the face of rising cyber threats, OCI provides security teams with real-time package level visibility across their digital infrastructure and help identify threats earlier in the attack life cycle. OCI also quickens investigation by gathering network-based forensic evidence to reduce the Mean Time to Response. OCI is a valuable tool for verifying the effectiveness and improving the existing cybersecurity ecosystem, ensuring compliance and lowering the risk of successful cyber-attacks. We also released our 2 new DDoS solutions. The first is adaptive DDoS, which helps protect enterprises from rapidly spreading and dynamic DDoS attacks. It adapts to the evolving threat landscape and automated countermeasures used to address cyber-attacks, including the latest multi-vector dynamics attacks. And the second is mobile security, which extends our powerful DDoS capability that service providers currently leverage in their wireline networks to now protect their mobile network and address their distributed threat surface. Now let's move to Slide number 7 for some further perspective on market and business. Starting with our enterprise customer vertical. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, enterprise revenue grew nearly 13% year-over-year, driven by the expansion in both our cybersecurity and service assurance businesses. We remain confident that our value proposition of extending visibility to the edges of the network will continue to resonate with enterprise customers seeking to cover blind spots, address control challenges and facilitate their leverage of off-premise and cloud solutions as part of their digital transformation and new network architecture initiatives. Moving to our service provider customer vertical. As expected, revenue in the first quarter for this vertical declined approximately $0.09 year-over-year, 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the lower level of radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue, in the second quarter compared with the same quarter last year. We continue to see a domestic and international carriers to invest in their 5G deployments. Notably, several carriers now have the spectrum and deployed stand-alone networks in certain markets and are ready to drive traffic over those network over 5G, once 5G required applications materialize. We believe that as the 5G adoption advances and 5G traffic volumes increase, our core visibility in cybersecurity solutions will be required. We are prepared and ready to support carriers through this inevitable transition with our differentiated solutions. Michael will provide more insight regarding customer orders in a vertical during his remarks. Now let's move to Slide number 8 to review our outlook. Looking ahead, we remain excited about the market opportunity we are seeing for both our existing and new solutions and are reiterating our fiscal year 2024 outlook. We also continue to see the supply chain challenges that drove the increase in fulfillable backlog resolving and anticipate that fulfillable backlog will continue to return to more normalized levels. We remain focused on operating the business with a balanced approach to driving revenue growth and profitability as we manage through the dynamic macro environment and position NetScout to deliver long-term sustainable value for our stakeholders as a guardians of the connected world. Jean will provide additional color and a recap of the outlook and our numbers in our remarks. In summary, we delivered solid first quarter financial results and achieved several product milestones that establish a foundation of delivering our objectives for fiscal year 2024 and beyond. We remain confident that NetScout is well positioned to help customers address the challenges and opportunities of today's digital world through our unique and expanding solutions. We look forward to sharing our progress with everyone throughout the remainder of our fiscal year. With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Szabados: Thank you, Anil, and good morning, everyone. Slide 10 outlines the areas that I will be covering today, starting with Customer Win highlights in the first quarter. In our enterprise customer vertical, our proven technology and long, productive partnerships with our install base of customers have always been a strong foundation for our business. As customers continue to adapt, advance, and expand their IT strategies, they continue to depend on NetScout to ensure the success of these transitions. As an example, during the quarter, we won a mid-seven figure deal in service assurance order with a large US regional bank, in support of their datacenter transformation. The opportunity arose from the bank's initiative to upgrade its infrastructure from on-premises to a distributed, co-lo based architecture. NetScout's solutions have been critical to several areas of the bank's business, including online banking and Unified Communications call centers. Our long and productive partnership positioned NetScout to win the business, despite the competitive bidding process. Now, turning to the service provider customer vertical, we remain focused on supporting both our domestic and international carriers' 5G network evolutions. We also continue to support our service providers in their security efforts as cyberattack incidents permeate, and threat surfaces continue to expand. As an examples from the quarter, on the service assurance front, a long-standing Tier-1 North American carrier customer placed additional orders with us amounting to a mid-seven figure sum as they continue to advance their 5G projects. On the security front, a mid-size international service provider customer placed a low-seven figure order for our Arbor products to upgrade their DDoS protection, replacing a competitor. The main driver for this investment was to deliver a reliable so called \"clean pipe,\" leveraging an integrated detection and mitigation solution, for their high value customer base. We won the order due to our superior technology, strong reputation, and positive references from the leaders in their sector. These strengths, combined with our recent innovative new product offerings, should continue to drive customer interest in our best-in-class solutions in the rapidly evolving cybersecurity environment. Turning to go-to-market activities, we remain focused on promoting our industry leadership, trusted brand, next-generation solutions, and platform. This included attending several high-profile events such as the RSA conference, Cisco Live, Dell Technology World, and Big 5G. In the second fiscal quarter, we plan to participate in VMware Explore and Black Hat, to name a few. Looking ahead, NETSCOUT plans to host its customers and partners at our Annual Engage Technology and User Summit from October 2nd to October 5th this year in Orlando, Florida. At Engage 2023, we'll demonstrate how our Visibility Without Borders Platform provides a unified approach to addressing the industry's most pertinent issues, including how performance, security, and availability challenges are multiplying and are often interconnected and overlapping. We'll also highlight our next-generation Omnis Cyber Intelligence solution and our new DDoS products such as Adaptive DDoS and Mobile Security. Thank you, everyone. That concludes my remarks, and I will now turn the call over to Jean\nJean Bua : Thank you, Michael, and good morning, everyone. I will review key metrics for our first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and provide some additional commentary on our fiscal year 2024 outlook. As a reminder, this review focuses on our non-GAAP results unless otherwise stated, and all reconciliations with our GAAP results appear in the presentation appendix. Regardless, I will note the nature of any such comparisons. Slide number 12 details our first-quarter fiscal year 2024 results. During the quarter, total revenue grew 1.1% percent year over year to 211.1 million dollars. Product revenue declined 3.7% percent and service revenue grew 5.4% percent, both on a year-over-year basis. We ended the first quarter with backlog of approximately 16 million dollars, consisting of approximately 12 million dollars of fulfillable orders and approximately 4 million dollars of radio frequency propagation modeling projects. We anticipate that backlog will return to historically normalized levels as global supply chain challenges appear to be subsiding and as radio frequency propagation modeling projects have led to the deployment of the 5G infrastructure needed for supporting business and consumer applications. Our first-quarter fiscal year 2024 gross profit margin was 78.3 percent, up 3.8 percentage points over the same quarter last year. As you may recall, the prior year's quarterly gross margin was impacted by approximately 15 million dollars in radio frequency propagation modeling projects, which had an average gross margin of less than 30 percent. Quarterly operating expenses increased 3.6 percent year over year, primarily attributable to increased sales headcount, travel, and events. We reported an operating profit margin of 14.0 percent, compared with 11.7 percent in the same quarter last year. Diluted earnings per share was 31 cents, compared with 24 cents in the same quarter last year, an increase of 29.2 percent year over year. Turning to slide 13, I'd now like to review key revenue trends by customer verticals and product lines. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, on a year-over-year basis, our enterprise customer vertical revenue grew 12.9 percent, while our service provider customer vertical revenue declined 9.3 percent. During the quarter, our enterprise customer vertical accounted for 52 percent of our total revenue, while our service provider customer vertical accounted for the remaining 48 percent. Now, turning to our product lines. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, our cybersecurity revenue increased by 9.9 percent and our service assurance revenue declined 2.4 percent, both on a year over year basis. During the first quarter, the service assurance product line represented approximately 69 percent of total revenue, while our cybersecurity product line represented the remaining 31 percent. Turning to slide 14, which shows our geographic revenue mix. Compared to last year's first quarter, our revenue was less concentrated in the U.S. due to the prior year's higher radio frequency propagation modeling project revenue. There were no customers representing 10% or more of our total revenue in the quarter. Slide 15 details our balance sheet highlights and free cash flow. We ended the quarter with 390.5 million dollars in cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and investments, representing a decrease of 37.4 million dollars since the end of fiscal year 2023. Free cash flow for the quarter was a use of 24.3 million dollars. From a debt perspective, we ended the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 with 100 million dollars outstanding on our 800-million-dollar revolving credit facility, which expires in July 2026. We currently have capacity in our share repurchase authorizations and, subject to market conditions, plan to be active in the market. To briefly recap our other balance sheet highlights, accounts receivable, net, was 108.3 million dollars, a decrease of 35.6 million dollars since March 31, 2023. The DSO metric at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 44 days, in line with the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, and a decrease from 58 days at the end of our fiscal year 2023. Let's move to slide 16 for commentary on our outlook. I will focus my review on our non-GAAP targets for fiscal year 2024. As Anil noted earlier, we are reiterating our non-GAAP outlook for fiscal year 2024 that was presented during our May 4, 2023, fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023 earnings call. As a reminder, for fiscal year 2024, we continue to anticipate revenue in the range of 915 to 945 million dollars, which implies a low single digit growth rate at the midpoint of the range. The effective tax rate is anticipated to be in the range of 20 to 22 percent. Assuming approximately 74 to 75 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding, we expect non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $2.20 and $2.32, which implies a mid-single digit growth rate, at the midpoint of the range. I'd also like to offer some \"color\" on the first half of fiscal year 2024. At the midpoint of our full fiscal year 2024 outlook ranges, for revenue we continue to anticipate delivering approximately 46 to 48 percent of our revenue outlook during the first half of the fiscal year. For earnings per share, we anticipate delivering mid-single digit diluted EPS growth for the first half of the fiscal year, on a year-over-year basis. That concludes my formal review of our financial results. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to the operator for Q&A. At this time, if you would like to ask a question your telephone [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Matthew Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great congrats on Q1, Anil, maybe to start with you. Between your service assurance business, it was down obviously a little bit, and enterprise was up [indiscernible] growth. Can you give us a sense just on overall demand trends? Do you think there's been some form of stabilization? Obviously, you guys have delivered consistent results here. But what are you hearing from customers out there from a buying perspective? And maybe where you most optimistic from a demand perspective as this year continues to progress?\nAnil Singhal: Yes. Thanks, Matt. So, I think first thing is the quarterly trend on service provider business usually has not been meaningful because of lumpy deals. So, on a year-year over basis, there's not much change from what we talked about at the prospect at the last conference call You have heard some earnings and challenges in the service provider which sometimes tend to lengthen the sales cycle. But overall, the biggest investment we have made on the product side this year is combining the Arbor and NetScout technology to create some new solutions. We relaunched that OCI product, which we talked about as well as we announced new options and new features in the form of adapted DDoS and some other features in both the service provider side, which is the mobile security and as well as on the enterprise side. So, we see that is we are expecting that to be a growth area and more so on the enterprise side this year, but also on the service provider side.\nMatthew Hedberg: That's helpful. Actually, that was a segue into the next question on OCI in particular. Maybe just a little bit more color on what that means from a product perspective, a go-to-market perspective, how material is that relaunch? And from a pipeline generation perspective, is that one of the bigger announcements kind of coming out of the cyber-attacks?\nAnil Singhal: Yes. So right now, since we just released – relaunched the product and announced it in April time frame, I think it does not have an impact on the one earlier, but we are expecting some improvement in that area quickly and hopefully have an impact on the second half. The big change is that industry is really focused on mitigation of cyber threat, and there has been less and less focus on early detection, which we think is the key to success and to deal with cyber threats. So that’s a big change that doing analytics at source to do more detection early in the life of the cyberattack is what we acquiring the differentiator in this NDR space and network detection and response. And that’s a change also from what we announced last year.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish : Maybe just a follow-up on Matt's initial question. What are you guys seeing specifically with your Tier 1 North America carrier customers, given some of your competitors were kind of out there talking earlier this quarter about digestion and inventory stuffing? Just trying to understand how you guys feel about the pipeline in those large customers.\nAnil Singhal : Well, if you take the radio frequency orders out of the picture and both the backlog and that, I think pipeline is good overall. And -- but we don't just do business with Tier 1, but people call Tier 2 is also a big portion of the business where there are about 10 or so Tier 2 provider and also some of the cable companies like Charter and Comcast are getting into the 5G business. And so, we think we are -- we can make up for some of the shortfalls if there is challenges on the service on the mobile -- traditional mobility provider side with some of these things which we can do. And those are -- I mean, all the cable companies, all the top 4 or 5 cable operators are big customers of NetScout already both on the Arbor side and the fixed line side. So that's what we are -- when we look at the overall service provider business, our mobility, both on the security side and on the service assurance side, I think we think that we are in good shape.\nJames Fish : Got it. And Jean, for you. On the backlog side, first off, I appreciate the continued disclosure here as we start to normalize overall. But it sounds from last quarter pretty meaningfully. Is this level of backlog of $16 million or so normal as we think about coming out of fiscal Q4 into fiscal Q1? Or what's giving the confidence in the outlook then is it seems like it's about half of your normal backlog if we compare it to long-term disclosures where it was somewhere around $25 million, $30 million in the past in fiscal Q4?\nJean Bua: Yes. Actually, if you look back over a long period of time, and I would say at least the 10 years, our average backlog has probably been closer to somewhere between $10 million to $15 million. It’s been as low as like $200,000. And if we – and just to reiterate, the backlog started growing in Q3, Q4, I believe, of FY ‘22. And that was again due to the hardware issues that were in the supply chain. So, people were buying software. So, we see it – as we said in the comments, we see it normalizing back to somewhere probably between $10 million to $15 million. Obviously, we always like backlog. So, if we have the opportunity to continue, we would be very happy with that. What gives us confidence to reiterate our revenue guidance is a few things. One, as I think you’ve seen in the headlines, the 5G infrastructure has been pretty much laid down. And that actually I can point to all of the radio frequency propagation odelling projects that we had that the antenna is the capture of the signals, the RAN network that way is also getting established. So, for us, it’s less about the infrastructure build and more about the applications that will go over the 5G network. And what we hear when we talk to various people in the industry is that hopefully, private networks within enterprise would be the first killer app. And that has been slower to start mostly due to the chip shortage. So, we are hopeful that since the 5G infrastructure has been established, that the applications will start to come to bear production traffic, which is where our products are really needed. And then as Anil said, in security, we have the relaunch of OCI, which, again, in talking to certain salespeople, they’ve seen at least pockets of sales and especially internationally, where they have a lot of opportunities where customers are really liking what we can do. And then we have mobile security, which is being – which is launched, which has been something that’s been in development for a few years. And then as Anil also mentioned, the adapted DdoS. So, when we point to those areas, this is what we would give confidence to the range of $9.15 to $9.45 at this point.\nOperator: I will take our last question from Kevin Liu with K. Liu & Company.\nKevin Liu : From a near-term perspective, given kind of the government business that typically hits in the September quarter. Just wondering how that pipeline looks to you today and whether you expect any sort of meaningful uptick in that revenue this year versus last year?\nJean Bua : We actually had a good overall Q1 for government, including some federal. So right now, again, they are -- they use our big demand of our products, and it always is what gets funded. We probably would see right now being consistent on a year-over-year basis with what we had in Q2 of last year.\nKevin Liu: Got it. And then just with all of the new security announcements that you guys have, do you expect that to contribute meaningfully to the second quarter results? Or would we still see kind of a more normal mix between your service provider and enterprise business? And then maybe longer term, just when do you think security starts to shift more materially in terms of the overall revenue mix here?\nAnil Singhal: Well, I think if we look at -- when we break out the security revenue, it includes DDoS, which is practically 100% of the security revenue last year, maybe a small single-digit percentage was from OCI. So with the 3-pronged strategy to grow the security business. One is on the service provider side, grow it through the mobile security and some of the other initiatives we have announced on the enterprise -- so that's on the security DDoS side. On the enterprise DDoS side, adapted DDoS as one of the drivers to drive refresh to the new solution. And third is OCI, which is in the enterprise security area, which is non-DDoS and which was, like I said, a very small number last year. So those are the 3 areas. And I think we expect growth in the security area this year to be much higher than the growth in the overall business.\nOperator: And it appears that we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Tony Piazza for any additional or closing remarks.\nTony Piazza: Thank you, operator. This concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining us and enjoy the rest of the day.\nOperator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
