My name is Paul, and I will be your operator this afternoon. Before this call, A-Mark issued its results for the fiscal second quarter 2024 in a press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.amark.com. You can find the link to the Investor Relations section at the top of the home page. Joining us for today's call are A-Mark's CEO, Greg Roberts; President, Thor Gjerdrum; and CFO, Kathleen Simpson-Taylor. Following their remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Then before we conclude the call, I'll provide the necessary cautions regarding the forward-looking statements made by management during this call. I would like to remind everyone that this call is being recorded, and we will be made available for replay via a link available in the Investor Relations section of A-Mark's website. Now, I would like to turn the call over to A-Mark's CEO, Mr. Greg Roberts. Sir, please proceed.\nGreg Roberts: Thank you, Paul, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. Our second quarter results demonstrate the strength of our fully integrated platform to generate profitable results. We delivered $0.57 per diluted share and generated $25.1 million of non-GAAP EBITDA during the quarter, underscoring our ability to manage less favorable market conditions while still delivering solid results. During the quarter, we successfully repaid our notes payable for $100 million on our asset-backed securitization and continued to enhance shareholder value by increasing our share repurchase program by buying back an additional 440,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $12 million. This morning, we announced that we entered into a non-binding letter of intent with AMS Holdings, a leading multichannel marketer of vintage and modern coins, which provided for three transactions. The most significant of these transactions is our planned acquisition of LPM Group Limited, one of Asia's largest fabricated precious metals dealers. This strategic acquisition is an important step in growing A-Mark's international presence in Asia and reflects our commitment to expanding A-Mark's global reach. With access to A-Mark's inventory and resources, we expect that LPM will be able to secure larger purchase orders and will be able to provide their customers with a broader set of product offerings. We are hopeful that our proven wholesale and e-commerce expertise and our portfolio of products and ancillary services such as storage and fulfillment will assist LPM in its planned growth strategy. In addition to the LPM transaction, Pinehurst Coin Exchange, our strategic affiliate, of which A-Mark owns 49% and one of the nation's largest distributors of modern certified coins, will be acquiring all of the assets of ModernCoinMart from AMS. ModernCoinMart is one of the more established modern bullion coin dealers in the U.S, while also shipping to many international locations. Through this strategic acquisition, Pinehurst intends to further expand its direct-to-consumer business and its product offering to its customers. The third transaction involves a joint venture between A-Mark, Pinehurst and Stack’s-Bowers Numismatics, a related party of A-Mark to acquire a 10% common equity interest in AMS. We expect to close these three transactions simultaneously by the end of this month, subject to preparation and execution of definitive agreements and the receipt of third-party consents or approval. As we continue to invest in growing our platform and global footprint, we will also continue our focus on logistics automation initiatives at our AMGL facility in Las Vegas. These initiatives are designed to enhance our operational efficiency, enabling us to effectively manage a larger number of SKUs and increase volume all while minimizing operational costs. We are confident that these strategic measures will support our growth strategy as we strive to further expand and diversify our business. Now, I will hand the call over to our CFO, Kathleen Simpson-Taylor, who will provide a more detailed overview of our financials. Then A-Mark President, Thor Gjerdrum, will discuss our key operating metrics. Afterwards, I will provide further insights into our business and growth strategy. Kathleen?\nKathleen Simpson Taylor : Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. Our revenues for fiscal Q2 2024 increased 7% to $2.079 billion from $1.950 billion in Q2 of last year. Excluding an increase of $231.6 million of forward sales, revenues decreased $102.5 million or 7%, which was due to a decrease in gold and silver ounces sold, partially offset by higher average selling prices of gold and silver. The DTC segment contributed 18% and 23% of the consolidated revenue in the fiscal second quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Revenue contributed by JMB represented 16% of the consolidated revenues for Q2 of 2024 compared to 21% in Q2 of last year. For the six months period, our revenues increased 19% to $4.563 billion from $3.850 billion in the same year ago period. Excluding an increase of $891.6 million of forward sales, revenues decreased $178.2 million or 6%, which was due to a decrease in gold and silver ounces sold, partially offset by higher average selling prices of gold and silver. The DTC segment contributed 15% and 23% of the consolidated revenue for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Revenue contributed by JMB represented 14% of the consolidated revenues for the six months ended December 31, 2023, compared with 21% in the same year ago period. Gross profit for fiscal Q2 2024 decreased 28% to $46.0 million or 2.21% of revenue from $64.0 million or 3.28% of revenue in Q2 of last year. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profits earned from both the wholesale sales and ancillary services and DTC segments. Gross profit contributed by the DTC segment represented 48% of the consolidated gross profit in fiscal Q2 2024 compared to 57% in the same year ago period. Gross profit contributed by JMB represented 41% of the consolidated gross profit in fiscal Q2 2024 compared to 51% in Q2 of last year. For the six months period, gross profit decreased 32% to $95.4 million or 2.09% of revenue from $140.6 million or 3.65% of revenue in the same year ago period. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profits earned from both the wholesale sales and ancillary services and DTC segments. Gross profit contributed by the DTC segment represented 45% of the consolidated gross profit in the six months period ended December 31, 2023, compared to 56% in the same year ago period. Gross profit contributed by JMB represented 38% and 49% of consolidated gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. SG&A expenses for fiscal Q2 2024 increased 8% to $22.4 million from $20.8 million in Q2 of last year. The change was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense, including performance-based accruals of $1.4 million, higher consulting and professional fees of $0.6 million and increase in information technology costs of $0.4 million, partially offset by a decrease in insurance cost of $0.9 million and lower advertising cost of $0.4 million. For the six months period, SG&A expenses increased 15% to $44.2 million from $38.6 million in the same year ago period. The change was primarily due to an increase in consulting and professional fees of $2.6 million, an increase in compensation expense, including performance based accruals of $2.6 million, an increase in information technology costs of $0.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in insurance cost of $0.5 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal Q2 2024 decreased 14% to $2.8 million from $3.3 million in Q2 of last year. The change was primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles related to JMB. For the six months period, depreciation and amortization expense decreased 13% to $5.6 million from $6.4 million in the same year ago period. The change was primarily due to a $1.1 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles related to JMB. Interest income for fiscal Q2 2024 increased 27% to $6.3 million from $5.0 million in Q2 of last year. The aggregate increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in other finance product income of $0.8 million and an increase in interest income earned by our secured lending segment of $0.6 million. For the six months period, interest income increased 23% to $12.4 million from $10.1 million in the same year ago period. The aggregate increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in other finance product income of $1.5 million and an increase in interest income earned by our secured lending segment of $0.8 million. Interest expense for fiscal Q2 2024 increased 41% to $10.2 million from $7.2 million in Q2 of last fiscal year. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase of $2.4 million associated with our trading credit facility due to an increase in interest rates as well as increased borrowings and an increase of $1.1 million related to product financing arrangements, partially offset by a decrease of $0.3 million related to the AMCS notes, including amortization of debt issuance costs due to their repayment in December 2023. For the six months period, interest expense increased 50% to $20.0 million from $13.4 million in the same year ago period. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $5.6 million associated with our trading credit facility due to an increase in interest rates as well as increased borrowings, an increase of $1.6 million related to product financing arrangements, partially offset by a decrease of $0.4 million related to the AMCF notes, including amortization of debt issuance costs due to their repayment in December 2023. We also had a $0.2 million decrease in loan servicing fees. Earnings from equity method investments in Q2 2024 decreased 83% to $0.8 million from $4.7 million in the same year ago quarter. For the six months period, earnings from equity method investments decreased 53% to $3.5 million from $7.3 million in the same year ago period. The decrease in both periods was due to decreased earnings of our equity method investees. Net income attributable to the company for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 totaled $13.8 million or $0.57 per diluted share. This compares to net income attributable to the company of $33.5 million or $1.35 per diluted share in Q2 of last year. For the six months period, net income attributable to the company totaled $32.6 million or $1.34 per diluted share, which compares to net income attributable to the company of $78.6 million or $3.18 per diluted share in the same year ago period. Adjusted net income before provision for income taxes, a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes acquisition expenses, amortization and depreciation for Q2 fiscal 2024, totaled $21.7 million, a decrease of 53% compared to $46.5 million in the same year ago quarter. Adjusted net income before provision for income taxes for the six months period, totaled $48.5 million, a 55% decrease from $107.7 million in the same year ago period. EBITDA, a non-GAAP liquidity measure for Q2 fiscal 2024, totaled $25.1 million, a 48% decrease compared to $48.7 million in Q2 of fiscal 2023. EBITDA for the six months period, totaled $55.5 million, a 50% decrease compared to $110.9 million in the same year ago period. Turning to our balance sheet. At quarter end, we had $28.5 million of cash compared to $39.3 million at the end of fiscal year 2023. Our tangible net worth at the end of the quarter was $426.1 million, down from $436.8 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. A-Mark's Board of Directors has continued to maintain the company's regular quarterly cash dividend program of $0.20 per common share. The most recent quarterly cash dividend was paid in January. It is expected that the next quarterly dividend will be paid in April 2024. That completes my financial summary. Now I will turn the call over to Thor, who will provide an update on our key operating metrics. Thor?\nThor Gjerdrum: Thank you, Kathleen. Looking at our key operating metrics for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we sold 450,000 ounces of gold in Q2 fiscal 2024, which was down 20% from Q2 of last year and down 9% from the prior quarter. For the 6-month period, we sold 945,000 ounces of gold, which is down 21% in the same year ago period. We sold 26.6 million ounces of silver in Q2 fiscal 2024, which was down 30% from Q2 of last year and down 13% from last quarter. For the 6-month period, we sold 57.0 million ounces of silver, which was down 23% from the same year ago period. The number of new customers in the DTC segment, which is defined as the number of customers that have registered or set up a new account or made a purchase for the first time during the period, was 52,500 in Q2 fiscal 2024, which was down 60% from Q2 of last year and increased 34% from last quarter. For the 6-month period, the number of new customers in the DTC segment was 91,600, which is down 49% from 180,200 new customers in the same year ago period. The number of total customers in the DTC segment at the end of second quarter was approximately 2.4 million, which is an 11% increase from the prior year. The year-over-year increase in total customers was due to organic growth of our JMB customer base as well as from acquired customer lists. The DTC segment average order value, which represents the average dollar value of product orders, excluding accumulation program orders delivered to DTC segment customers during Q2 fiscal 2024, was $2,218, which is down 7% from Q2 fiscal 2023 and down 9% from the prior quarter. For the six months period, our DTC average order value was $2,316, which is down 2% from the same year ago period. For the fiscal second quarter, our inventory turn ratio was 1.9, which is a 21% decrease from 2.4 in Q2 of last year and a 24% decrease from 2.5 in the prior quarter. For the 6-month period, our inventory turn ratio was 4.3, a 4% increase from 4.5 in the same year ago period. Finally, the number of secured loans at the end of December totaled 7.15, a decrease of 32% from December 31, 2022 and a decrease of 11% from the end of September. While the number of secured loans decreased, our secured loans receivable balance increased over these same periods, bringing the value of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2023 to $106.6 million, a 4% increase from December 31, 2022 and a 7% increase from September 30, 2023. That concludes my prepared remarks. I will now turn it over to Greg for closing remarks. Greg?\nGreg Roberts : Thank you, Thor and Kathleen. A-Mark's strategic focus remains on opportunities to further expand our geographic presence and market reach that will create synergies with A-Mark's fully integrated platform, including our reliable access to supply, our successful logistics footprint and strong customer relations. While we work towards finalizing the transactions with AMS, we look forward to our expansion into Asia and to realizing the synergies and growth potential that these strategic initiatives may bring. Our commitment to generating stockholder value remains firm and we are confident in A-Mark's diversified and proven business model. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question today is coming from Mike Baker from D.A. Davidson.\nMike Baker: Fully appreciate the acquisitions, they look good and presume accretive and strategically make a ton of sense. I wanted to ask you about this quarter, where the EBITDA was a little bit less than last quarter and the earnings were less than last quarter and frankly less than consensus estimates or whatever, consensus estimates are worth. But it felt like the business was sort of bottoming last quarter, but apparently not because this quarter seems a little bit softer. I guess any visibility into when EBITDA might improve or EPS might improve, when we might get back to the idea of at a minimum $1.50 over a 6-month period type of metrics?\nGreg Roberts: Yes. Thank you for the question. I would say that the quarter was saw some continued softness. I think premiums on fabricated silver products in particular continue to be weaker than we have seen historically over the last 12 months. There currently is plenty of silver supply in the marketplace and that's affecting the premium that people are willing to pay for the product. So we have been competing, keeping our market share, but we have had to adjust our premiums down both at a wholesale and a retail level. I think that on a bright note, the lower premiums have given us some great opportunities to acquire inventory, which we plan on doing and acquiring inventory that we think will be most valuable looking forward, we've been able to make some very opportune purchases, which you will see reflected in our balance sheet and our levels of inventory that we're carrying. At the same time, we're looking to go through our inventories and move out or get rid of things that we don't think have great potential looking forward. So there has been a bit of reshuffling both last quarter and this quarter. There are certainly some bright spots. We see the demand for U.S. Silver Eagles continuing to be strong at the moment and that particular product continues to be on allocation from the U.S. Mint and we have been continuing to buy more Silver Eagles than our allocation from some of the other distributors. So I think that it's what we're dealing with right now. I think the spot prices in particular have been fairly range bound and that hasn't really caused any panic or any call to action for customers. And we've seen this before when spot prices are range bound and that's certainly a factor right now. I think the other factor is up until a week or two ago, the equity markets have been performing very well, and that can draw money away from our markets. So I think we're seeing a little bit of that also.\nMike Baker : Can I ask a follow-up on those points? Just in terms of the spreads, the way I look at it, the way we're tracking it, silver spreads right now look like they're in the $7 to $8 range. Gold, I don't know, $100, $105, $106, something like that. Can you remind us historically, what those ranges are? Where do you start making more money? What kind of spread is better for you guys? Obviously, higher is better. What gets you excited?\nGreg Roberts: To be honest with you, I think making $25 million EBITDA in this market in this quarter was a fantastic result. So let's start there. Secondly, I don't understand your question. So you're going to have to be more specific. The numbers you just threw out, you need to be specific what you're asking because I didn't, it didn't make sense to me. I've also heard a lot of questions, but that one I don't know. And the simple answer is the higher the spreads between our cost of product and what we sell them for, the more money we make, which is pretty basic.\nMike Baker : Let me rephrase it. Maybe I just didn't ask properly. So we're trying -- what I'm trying to do is -- so we're tracking like the spot prices versus retail prices at JM Bullion and a number of competitors. And if we just look at silver, for instance, it looks like it's around -- silver spread is around $7, I think. The way we look at it, maybe I'm wrong with that. That's what I'm…\nGreg Roberts: That doesn't really make sense to me.\nMike Baker : I'll follow-up on that. Sorry.\nGreg Roberts: It depends on what specific product you're talking about. So to help you a little bit, the United States Mint sells Silver Eagles at approximately $3 premium per ounce over the melt value. And then whether A-Mark sells at wholesale at $4 or whether JM Bullion sells it wholesale at a $6, $7 premium, that's what the coins end up selling out at. If you're talking about a SilverTowne or Sunshine Minted product or even a Royal Canadian Mint product, that premium is going to be lower than the Silver Eagle. The question about premiums really, it has to be tied specifically to the product and there's no one product that is going to instantly make A-Mark more profitable because we probably sell 1,200 different products or more. And as it relates to the question on gold, I don't know what you're talking about $100 per ounce. Is that $100 premium per ounce?\nMike Baker: I'll just follow-up after. I'll take it offline. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Lucas Pipes from B. Riley.\nLucas Pipes: I'll start with some higher level questions, on the strategy and then maybe dig into some more specifics. First question is kind of how do you think about your presence in Asia, cultural issues to be aware of or how do you envision an integration to proceed? Thank you for your perspective on that.\nGreg Roberts: Sure. I mean we're very excited, enthusiastic about this acquisition as well as all three of the acquisitions, but leading with LPM, which we believe and based on the price we paid, it's the most significant of the three transactions. LPM, as you can see from our release, has been around for over a decade. They've been operating exclusively in Hong Kong. We here at A-Mark have looked at a number of different opportunities in Asia and over the last five or six years, and we've never been able to complete a transaction that we thought was good for us as well as good for the other side. This transaction came together through a fairly long negotiating period and quite a bit of diligence to this point. And obviously, when you have a lot of different factors as well as an international target, it was fairly complicated for the diligence side and for us to get to a deal. We're very happy with the deal. We're happy with the price we paid. We're happy with the earn out potential here for the seller, which would be very good for us. We looked at the whole transaction as is it structured and is the risk to reward properly recognized and we think that has happened. So we're happy with it. I think it's important to note that historically, we were a wholesale trading company before we got into our DTC segment. And as we've now expanded that greatly with JM, we believe we've built up a tremendous amount of expertise in DTC and e-commerce retail. LPM currently is a supplier of a number of different specialty products and they supply those all around the world, both retail and wholesale. They have a number of licenses and a number of relationships with Sovereign Mints, Private Mints, different product suppliers that we believe will be very accretive to A-Mark, that A-Mark currently does not have in their wholesale segment. LPM currently is approximately 75% to 80% wholesale and about 20%, 25% retail. So we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity in the region to grow the retail side of things. Obviously, we have struggled over the years by not making an acquisition or expanding in this area for the cultural reasons that we just aren't familiar with. I think the opportunity for us to acquire the business, the customers, the intellectual property and the pipeline of products that we've not had access to before is extremely important. This transaction gives us the best of both worlds. It gives us a very strong wholesaler, which if you're going to be doing business in Asia, you need a wholesaler and you need a trading desk and you need people that are used to trading both wholesale and retail and you need the right people. And I think we're very excited about the LPM staff, particularly the CEO and Founder, Charlie Chang. And we think we are fortunate that we've been able to acquire a business or we are going to acquire a business that has both wholesale and retail. Bringing in both Charlie's local knowledge and his cultural knowledge of being in business in Asia as long as he has, as well as the expertise we bring from Rob Pacelli and his team at JM Bullion on e-commerce, we're very enthusiastic about what the potential is. And we think that we're well positioned right now to go there and to go to that expansion. I think we're also closely looking at the Singapore market. We believe that LPM is a good platform for us to expand into Singapore and we think there's some great opportunity there both from the local population as well as visitors to Singapore or people who are doing business in Singapore that are from other country or so. We think that's a very safe environment for us, a very safe place to expand into. We're very comfortable with LPM in Hong Kong right now, but just see this as just a really good opportunity for A-Mark to expand outside of the United States.\nLucas Pipes : Two follow-ups on that. Should we think of this as a kind of bridgehead platform into the Asian market? And then two, kind of what is your appetite for M&A after this announcement today? Is it -- look, we put some good amount here on our plate, let us digest this first or do you think you will continue to be active elsewhere around the world or North America?\nGreg Roberts: For sure. I think that the platform and the people and the business that we're acquiring really gives us a great starting point to organically grow LPM's business in Hong Kong. So, I think it's very important and we've looked long and hard at this acquisition and we're very enthusiastic about this opportunity it's going to give us. And I think again, just to reiterate that, we really -- to expand on the e-commerce side and retail in Asia, we would have needed to either relocate or we would have needed a desk and we need logistics and storage and we would have needed to create all those things before we could have even moved into the DTC market. And so the ability to acquire this business that has both things going is really a great platform for us and we believe it will be very good and we can expand very efficiently. As I've said before, one of the silver linings to a slower market and lower premiums is that, we are seeing opportunities for M&A and we are look -- still continue to look at a number of potential acquisitions. And I think that the two, three months that we experienced where things were softer, it's also very difficult on our competitors. And I have always been a big proponent of, if you buy your competitors, good things happen. And we see there is opportunity out there. And we're still very enthusiastic about other M&A opportunities. I think the size of this transaction, the $41 million as well as the other two smaller acquisitions. I think it's a very good size for us. It's about 10% of our tangible net worth. I think that we are able to do this very comfortably with no new debt or without any thought of raising more money. So I think this LPM transaction is the right size for A-Mark at the moment, but I think we thought long and hard about this deal. And I think A-Mark is very focused on being able to continue everything that we've talked about and everything we've been able to do in the past, we want to make sure that everything is sized properly, so that we can look at things from a risk to reward standpoint without having to be tight. And I think the key components for us are continuing our dividends, continuing to buy back stock when we believe that the stock is undervalued and returning shareholder value that way, as well as being able to take the advantage of opportune inventory, times and things that we can buy and add to our inventory, as well as taking advantage of M&A opportunities when we are able to look at results of targets and be able to negotiate from a little bit more from strength. The results from targets we're looking at aren't going to be as robust as maybe they would have been two years ago. So I think the company is very well positioned, and we're very thoughtful in all of these sizing and the transactions we're looking at and feel very good that we're in this for the long haul and we can make very good decisions and take advantage of all of these opportunities as they present themselves.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Andrew Scutt from ROTH MKM.\nAndrew Scutt: First, I'd just like to ask a few follow-ups on LPM, just maybe ask a little bit differently. So you mentioned in the prepared remarks that you see opportunities in leveraging your own inventory to help LPM secure larger orders. So I was just kind of wondering how many SKUs or products whatnot you'll be able to provide to LPM? And then kind of secondly on that, Asian consumers, I guess, you could say have a higher propensity to invest their personal wealth in precious metals than Western consumers, so do you kind of see -- like you said, maybe expanding into Singapore, but just further growth opportunities there?\nGreg Roberts: Absolutely. So as the prepared remarks illustrated, LPM has operated over the last 10 years with a balance sheet that has more likely than not restricted a little bit the amount of inventory in precious metals that they are able to buy and hold. I think that one of the great, you could call it a synergy or you can call it an opportunity is that, it gives LPM the opportunity to work out of A-Mark's inventory. So as we take these opportunities to buy new inventory at favorable premiums or prices, we will start to take into consideration what LPM believes they can sell. And when we talk about larger purchases in the marketplace, the more you buy the cheaper the price. So as LPM can identify products they can sell and take advantage of A-Mark's balance sheet to help purchase more and hopefully get a discount, that will be a synergy that LPM will be able to take advantage of. It will also be helpful for our own wholesale and retail business in North America that if we can get a bigger price and LPM helps us sell through 30%, 40% of what we're buying, it's going to make A-Mark stronger and have better negotiating power when we look to buy products, if that makes sense and answers your question.\nAndrew Scutt: And then just one more follow-up. So kind of in the last 12 months, you guys have acquired a handful of additional businesses, entered a few new geographies. Meanwhile, the mints, owned mints have been running at near or at full capacity. I know there's kind of oversupply in the market right now, but maybe over the medium term, could you share any thoughts around the mint capacity expansion?\nGreg Roberts: I mean, at the moment, we're not looking too much for expansion. We're comfortably at the moment managing the production out of the SilverTowne Mint. We have been fortunate enough that the SilverTowne Mint does a great job at pivoting and being very nimble when it comes to what they produce. So whether it's 1 ounce rounds or 100 ounce bars or specialty products, whatever it is, we're able to keep them busy with altering or adjusting what product they're making every week. So this is just a balance and production discussion that we go through once or twice a week on what we want them to manufacture. At the moment I don't see a situation where we need to grow the production ounce numbers at either Sunshine or SilverTowne. But as the premiums tend to contract, there is a fixed cost to manufacturing this product, and I do believe that we could see opportunity if we get a prolonged lower premium environment, we could find a situation where a smaller mint just can't make money at the prices that we can produce at and that may give us an opportunity to acquire some equipment or to do an M&A type activity as it relates to minting. I think there will be opportunities down the road, but nothing that we're focused on at the moment.\nAndrew Scutt: And last very quick one for me. You've been mentioning being opportunistic in acquiring inventory. Do you guys, just kind of with the potential volatile election year coming up, do you guys have an optimal inventory level in mind or are you guys thinking of that as you're acquiring additional inventory?\nGreg Roberts: Certainly, we feel here at A-Mark management that there are a number of events in the future and a number of situations that will be favorable to A-Mark. We try not to predict the future, but we do see a number of situations that seem to be lining up that historically have shifted the supply and demand equation for us in our products. And I think that personally, I don't want to speak for everybody, but personally, I do feel there are a number of things, the election, the continuing bank situation, the commercial real estate issues, what is really going to happen to interest rates and inflation. So, I do see a lot of, just kind of what I would say yellow lights that are flashing. I think our job is to balance. And as I mentioned earlier, we're looking at the balance and the mix of our inventory right now, and we want to make sure that as we increase inventory and as we look towards the future, we want to make sure we have the inventory that gives us the greatest potential if an event occurs. So we are consciously looking to the mix of inventory, repositioning inventory, selling inventory that we don't think currently has potential, and acquiring new inventory that will give us that opportunity. In conjunction with that, you may see our inventories rise over the next six months and you will most likely see our carry cost rise a little bit as we look to position ourselves like we have in the past to hopefully be in a position if the supply and demand equation changes that we have the product that everybody wants. That's how we do the best when we are well positioned and have product because production, manufacture, financing of inventory and being able to do that and pivot quickly, in our business, you just can't do that overnight. So, we are investing in ourselves, we're investing in all the different areas that I've talked about, but we are currently looking to invest in the right inventory that will make us the most money when we sell it.\nAndrew Scutt : Thanks again. Congrats on the quarter and the acquisitions.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Greg Gibas from Northland Securities.\nGreg Gibas: I wanted to first asks, how do LPM's margins maybe compared to A-Mark's, should we think of them as relatively comparable?\nGreg Roberts: I think it's a mix. It is a mix between retail and wholesale, and I think you should look at it as a mix, and that I think the product mix of what they sell is a little bit skewed more towards licensed specialty products that do carry a little higher margin even at a wholesale level. It's important to note that all of our DTC brands, whether it be JM Bullion or Silver Gold Bull or Pinehurst, are customers of LPM. So LPM through their licensing and their exclusive products are sellers of products that we have historically needed. Now we have had to share those products with other retailers. So I think it's fair to say that we haven't historically got as much of LPM's wholesale sales of product that we would like. So we see that as an opportunity to expand and be a great distributor for LPM on their specialty products. I think that their margins should skew a little bit higher than A-Mark Wholesale, but probably not as high as our DTC businesses.\nGreg Gibas: And just as we think about modeling, hard to say where things move. But have you seen, just as we think about fiscal Q3 so far, have you seen similar spreads relative to fiscal Q2?\nGreg Roberts: Yes. I think that in some areas, I would say, January and February, we saw some slight strength. I think right now we're seeing a little bit of strength in the Silver Eagle market, which generally does bode well for our private mint product or our other sovereign mint products. And I do feel at the moment a little more demand and a little less supply on the Silver Eagle market. So I would say that's probably the plus side of things. As it relates to 1 ounce, 5 ounce, 10 ounce private label product, I think that we're seeing similar premiums as what we saw in Q2. Some products a little bit lower, some products a little bit higher. But we're trying our best to inventory as broad a mix of products as we can so that we're able to fill any orders when they come in.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Brandon Coffin from Praetorian Capital.\nBrandon Coffin : I guess, we're just curious, if maybe you could help us understand A-Mark's relationship with big box retailers like Costco and Walmart, specifically where A-Mark kind of fits into that ecosystem. And if you could help us just by clarifying, which specific business segments are earning revenue from those two entities?\nGreg Roberts: Yes, great question. Walmart has been selling into the market for a long time. We indirectly supply them. We have not seen the growth in Walmart that is material to A-Mark, but they have been there for a while. That big box comment is not really anything new for us. I think everybody is very interested in Costco. Costco has been in the news. What Costco is doing at the moment? I think that A-Mark is very well positioned for this. I will say that our partners at Silver Gold Bull in Calgary are currently supplying Costco. They are selling products in the Costco stores. Silver Gold Bull has a presence on the floor of Costco's in Canada and as well as handling some of their logistics and some of their order fulfillment. So we are definitely in tune. Silver Gold Bull specifically at the moment is working in Canada and we continue to look for opportunities where A-Mark or Silver Gold Bull can participate in any domestic needs that Costco may have. In general, I think Costco's entry into the precious metals market has the potential to expand the overall market. As a trusted retailer, Costco could introduce new investors to the benefits of owning precious metals, thereby contributing to the growth of our overall industry. So, I believe that is a positive. I think that Costco's widespread presence and accessibility can just make precious metals more convenient for a broader demographic. And I think the move allows consumers to explore and purchase precious metals during their routine shopping experience. I've heard different numbers, but I think Costco has over 140 million members across North America and Canada. So obviously, we see this as a large opportunity to bring new customers into a marketplace we have been excited about for a long time. I think that any time that you see a new demographic or a new group of people in our marketplace, it does give A-Mark and our DTC an opportunity to try to take advantage of that. To this point, what we've seen is Costco is limiting the amount of ounces that a customer can buy. They seem to be using this currently as a way to increase membership in their different membership programs, and I think that's good for us. Talking to the guys at Silver Gold Bull and from their reports of actually having some pop-up stores in Canada. To this point, they've been very optimistic and they're very positive about their interactions with the Costco customers and the customer's interest in learning more about precious metals. So I think this is very good for us. I think it really creates a terrific opportunity for A-Mark's DTC segment and their companies, in that if a customer is limited in buying 5 ounces of gold from Costco or 1 ounce of gold at a time from Costco. If the customer is educated and wants to buy more, we hope very much that they will find their way to one of our DTC brands. So that's how we see it as an opportunity for A-Mark.\nBrandon Coffin : And then just a follow-up. Where exactly do you see those potential future opportunities coming first? Would that be maybe to the wholesale arm or something with the men's where Costco is potentially buying and selling SilverTowne and Sunshine products?\nGreg Roberts: I think that Costco in Canada has already started to sell Sunshine products. So that answers that question. And I think that we view, Costco, if it continues and it's long-term, I think we will be able to service them across a number of our platforms and our businesses, whether it be Private Mint products, whether it be wholesale, whether it be storage and logistics. We're ready to except the challenge if COSCO wants our involvement and we think we're well positioned for that right now.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Sy Jacobs from Jacobs Asset Management.\nSy Jacobs: So I wanted to drill down on the sort of LPM accretion calculation. So this past quarter, which was a slow quarter, you A-Mark as it stands had about a 1.2% EBITDA margin, it's been as high as I think triple of that in previous quarters. Given what you said earlier about the mix of retail to wholesale being somewhat similar to A-Mark's, is it fair or conservative or aggressive to apply that range of EBITDA margins and good and bad environments to the $400 million of revenue, average revenue you're acquiring from LPM? And then I've got two follow-ups to that.\nGreg Roberts: As you can tell from our performance, it's a little bit of a moving target. LPM was significantly had better margins in 2021 and 2022 than they had in 2023. As we looked at the opportunity and as we looked at the acquisition and the price that we ended up paying, we think that our cash and stock down at $41 million was a very fair entry point for us with $11.5 million of tangible net worth. And we did negotiate and we put a little bit of any further payout on this transaction that it's pay for performance. So we were very in tune with giving the sellers an opportunity that if the market turns or if things get better that they would participate with us and each time we worked on the structure and changed the structure or negotiated the structure, we were of the position that if we pay out all of the earn out numbers and the performance needed for all of those earn out numbers, we would be very happy to pay it out. It would validate the purchase and it would be a very good acquisition for us. So I think that part of the challenge in looking at this transaction, and I know it's what you're thinking and what you're focused on, is how do we look at what's normal and what can we expect and it comes a little bit with market conditions. But I think our belief is that we can add revenue as well as hopefully expand their margin a little bit. But for the most part, I think this is a business that is going to have closer to probably 2% EBITDA margins, so maybe a little bit higher than that, as you're trying to compare them. So, I do think the margins are a little bit higher than A-Mark wholesale, let's say. And if we can expand their retail and we can grow their retail, I don't see any reason why we couldn't -- those incrementally increased revenue dollars at the DTC level wouldn't be more in line or will be more in line with what our current DTC margins are.\nSy Jacobs: So one little follow-up question on that. You talked about sort of revenue synergies getting more wallet share or mind share of their purchases for A-Mark wholesale. Is there an opportunity for SilverTowne and Sunshine to become suppliers? I don't know how much how many SilverTowne bars they sell in Hong Kong. But might that become like a part of their menu whereas it wasn't before?\nGreg Roberts: Yes. I mean, that's a great synergy because as, we every week, we have plenty of SilverTowne product on the shelf and we have both wholesale and retail customers buying out of that inventory. It doesn't cost us anymore to introduce LPM customers to that inventory. Now we will have to -- we've already started on the process of logistics and we will have to stage product a little bit more in Hong Kong and we've been already doing that with Brink's in Hong Kong. As well as I think it's important to note that we entered into a supplier agreement with AMS about, around two months ago and as part of the negotiations and part of the test, we've had a supplier agreement with AMS and LPM, specifically, and we have already started out of our Vegas facility, we've started to ship product for LPM to their customers as well as we've started to finance some of their inventory in Hong Kong. So, we've been operational with them for the last two months, so we've have been able to get a really good idea of what it takes and where we can improve LPM's profitability. So, we have actually been working on that.\nSy Jacobs: And then last question on the transaction and in general. You're paying almost all cash for this. Is the cost of capital missing out on 5% money market on $40 million or are there sort of like add, you said you're not borrowing any money to do it, are there any other sort of costs that you need to subtract from the 2% or more margin and also vis a vis the buyback and how it relates to this? Can you spent something less than 50% of your cash flow this quarter and buying back stock does making this acquisition $40 million, make it any harder to return capital at that pace going forward?\nGreg Roberts: Well, I think there's a little bit of unknown in that question. I am super enthusiastic about this acquisition. I didn't do this to not make 5% on money market. I think this business has the opportunity to really change and to really add to what A-Mark is doing in a market that we're currently getting a very tiny fraction of the market share. So I know what this business has made historically, I know what it made in good times, I know what that revenue and that profitability is worth to us. And I think that if LPM was owned by A-Mark in 2021 or 2022 or even 2023, they would have made significantly more money than they did on their own. So I am looking at this as a home run. I am not looking at it as a bunt single.\nSy Jacobs: And then the buyback part of the question. Does it impinge your ability to buyback at this pace?\nGreg Roberts: No. I think that management and the A-Mark Board, we spent quite a bit of time making sure this was the right size deal that would afford us the opportunity to continue to balance all of these things, whether it be dividend or whether it be stock buyback or whether it be other acquisitions in the future. I think this deal at this moment was sized very well, and it wasn't that long ago that we made $50 million EBITDA in a quarter. As it relates to other opportunities, I think we're very well positioned to keep doing everything when the opportunity presents itself and if we feel that the price of the stock is attractive for a buyback, we're going to continue to buyback the stock. Obviously, we've announced here that we bought back 400,000 shares in the quarter. That's a pretty big buyback against a 23 million share outstanding. So I think I'm pretty excited about continuing to do everything well.\nOperator: And this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Roberts for his closing remarks.\nGreg Roberts: Thank you, Paul. Once again, thanks to all of our shareholders who joined the call today as well as the shareholders that aren't on the call that will listen to it later recorded. I want to thank our employees for the dedication and commitment to our success and look forward to keeping you apprised of A-Mark's progress in the future.

My name is Jenny, and I will be your operator this afternoon. Before this call, A-Mark issued its results for the fiscal first quarter 2024 in a press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of the Company's website at www.amark.com. You can find the link to the Investor Relations section at the top of the home page. Joining us for today's call are A-Mark's CEO, Greg Roberts; President, Thor Gjerdrum; and CFO, Kathleen Simpson-Taylor. Following their remarks, we will open the call to your questions. Then before we conclude the call, I'll provide the necessary cautions regarding the forward-looking statements made by management during this call.

Now, I would like to turn the call over to A-Mark's CEO, Mr. Greg Roberts. Sir, please proceed.\nGreg Roberts: Thank you, John, and good afternoon to everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. As you can see, our first quarter results demonstrate the strength and scalability of our fully integrated platform to generate profitable results, even during conditions. Despite facing a less favorable macroeconomic environment and softened levels of demand compared to recent quarters, we still delivered $30 million plus of EBITDA and diluted earnings of $0.77 per share and continued to grow our direct-to-consumer customer base. Consistent with our commitment to generate shareholder value, the company also repurchased a total of 171,268 shares of our common stock for $5 million during the first quarter, bringing our total treasury stock to 14.8 million. We continue to view our share repurchase program as an attractive investment opportunity for the company and another way to deliver value to our shareholders. Finally, we amended our trading credit facility during the quarter, resulting in increased liquidity and the reclassification of debt to long-term. With that, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Kathleen Simpson-Taylor, to walk you through our financials in more detail. Then our President, Thor Gjerdrum, will discuss our key operating metrics. Afterwards, I will provide a further update on our business and growth strategy and welcome your questions. Kathleen?\nKathleen Simpson-Taylor: Thank you, Greg and good afternoon everyone. Our revenues for fiscal Q1 2024 increased 31% to $2.5 billion from $1.9 billion in Q1 of last year. Excluding an increase of $660.1 million of forward sales, revenues decreased $75.8 million or 5%, which was due to a decrease in gold and silver ounces sold, partially offset by higher average selling prices of gold and silver. The DTC segment contributed 13% and 23% of the consolidated revenue in fiscal Q1 2024 and fiscal Q1 2023, respectively. Revenue contributed by JMB represented 12% of the consolidated revenues for Q1 of 2024 compared to 20% in Q1 of last year. Gross profit for fiscal Q1 2024 decreased 36% to $49.4 million or 1.99% of revenue from $76.6 million or 4.03% of revenue in Q1 of last year. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profits earned from both the wholesale sales and ancillary services and DTC segment. Gross profit contributed by the DTC segment represented 43% of the consolidated gross profit in fiscal Q1 2024 compared to 55% in the same year ago period. Gross profit contributed by JMB represented 36% of the consolidated gross profit in fiscal Q1 2024 compared to 48% in Q1 of last year. SG&A expenses for fiscal Q1 2024 increased 23% to $21.8 million from $17.8 million in Q1 of last year. The increase was primarily due to an increase in consulting and professional fees of $2 million and increase in compensation expense including performance-based accruals of $1.2 million, higher advertising costs of $0.4 million, and increase in insurance costs of $0.3 million, and an increase in information technology costs of $0.2 million. Depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal Q1 2024 decreased 12% to $2.8 million from $3.2 million in Q1 of last year. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.5 million decrease in amortization of acquired intangibles related to JMB. Interest income for fiscal Q1 2024 increased 20% to $6.1 million from $5.1 million in Q1 of last year. The aggregate increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in other finance product income of $0.7 million and an increase in interest income earned by our secured lending segment of $0.3 million. Interest expense for fiscal Q1 2024 increased 60% to $9.8 million from $6.1 million in Q1 of last fiscal year. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase of $3.2 million associated with our trading credit facility due to an increase in interest rates as well as increased borrowings and the AMCF notes, including amortization of debt issuance costs, as well as an increase of $0.5 million related to product financing arrangements. Earnings from equity method investments in Q1 2024 increased 1% to $2.71 million from $2.68 million in the same year ago quarter. Net income attributable to the company for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 totaled $18.8 million or $0.77 per diluted share. This compares to net income attributable to the company of $45.1 million or $1.83 per diluted share in Q1 of last year. Adjusted net income before provision for income taxes, a non-GAAP financial performance measure, which excludes acquisition expenses, amortization, and depreciation for Q1 fiscal 2024 totaled $26.8 million, a decrease of 56% compared to $61.3 million in the same year ago quarter. EBITDA, a non-GAAP liquidity measure for Q1 fiscal 2024 totaled $30.4 million, a 51% decrease compared to $62.2 million in Q1 fiscal 2023. Turning to our balance sheet. At quarter end, we had $48.2 million of cash compared to $39.3 million of cash at the end of fiscal year 2023. Our tangible net worth at the end of the quarter was $421.7 million, down from $436.8 million at the end of the prior fiscal year. As Greg mentioned, we amended our trading credit facility during the quarter, resulting in increased liquidity and a reclassification of the debt to long-term. The facility now matures in September 2025 and provides for automatic annual renewals. A-Mark's Board of Directors has continued to maintain the company's regular quarterly cash dividend program of $0.20 per common share. The most recent quarterly cash dividend was paid in October. It is expected that the next quarterly dividend will be paid in January 2024. That completes my financial summary. Now, I will turn the call over to Thor, who will provide an update on our key operating metrics. Thor?\nThor Gjerdrum: Thank you, Kathleen. Looking at our key operating metrics for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we sold 495,000 ounces of gold in Q1 fiscal 2024, which was down 21% from Q1 of last year and down 39% from the prior quarter. We sold 30.4 million ounces of silver in Q1 fiscal 2024, which was down 15% from Q1 of last year and down 33% from last quarter. The number of new customers in the DTC segment, which is defined as the number of customers that have registered or set up a new account or made a purchase for the first time during the period was 39,100 in Q1 fiscal 2024, which was down 20% from Q1 of last year and down 57% from last quarter. Approximately 32% of the new customers from the last quarter were attributable to the acquired customer list of BullionMax in June 2023. The number of total customers in the DTC segment at the end of the first quarter was approximately 2.4 million, which was a 16% increase from the prior year, The year-over-year increase in total customers was due to organic growth of our JMB customer base as well as the acquired list of BGASC and BullionMax in October of 2022 and June 2023 respectively. The DTC segment average order value, which represents the average dollar value of products ordered, excluding accumulation program orders, delivered to DTC segment customers during Q1 fiscal 2024 was $2,440, which is up 5% from Q1 fiscal 2023, but down 26% from the prior quarter. For the first fiscal quarter, our inventory turnover ratio was 2.5, which was a 7% decrease from 2.7 in Q1 of last year and a 22% decrease from 3.2 in the prior quarter. Finally, the number of secured loans at the end of September totaled 803, a decrease of 26% from September 30, 2022, and a decrease of 9% from the end of June. The dollar value of our loan portfolio at the end of September totaled $99.2 million, a decrease of 1% from the end of last fiscal year. That concludes my prepared remarks. I'll now turn it over to Greg for closing remarks. Greg?\nGreg Roberts: Thanks Thor.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Is everything okay?\nGreg Roberts: Yes. I'm sorry. We had a problem with the phone. Where did it? Where did I leave off?\nOperator: Sir, we got to your closing remarks, Greg, but did you want me to run the Q&A and see if we have anybody in Q&A?\nGreg Roberts: Fine.\nOperator: Okay. So, we will now open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is coming from Lucas Pipes from B. Riley Securities. Lucas, your line is live.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much, operator. Good afternoon everyone. Music at the beginning was better than just now.\nGreg Roberts: We'll work on that. If there's a particular type of genre, you'd appreciate next time, let me know in advance.\nLucas Pipes: No, I appreciate that. And, look, I appreciate you taking my question. And my first one is just on the demand that you're seeing in the market today. Obviously, there's been a lot of geopolitical uncertainty. It seems like demand is firming up, but it would be really good to kind of get your take on the market and what might have changed since the September quarter?\nGreg Roberts: Thank you. Sure. I think we did indicate on our last call that we did see some lower demand for product. And as you have noted before, we did see some compression of our premiums, which did affect our gross profit percentage. I think that there has been an ongoing sentiment in the marketplace that we're not -- our consumers and our customers seem to be a bit unsure as to where precious metal prices are going. Throughout the last 60 days, we've seen some significant increase in the spot prices of gold and silver. Also over the last 60 days, we've seen a number of dips that have resulted in significant increase in demand. So, I think you have a combination of things going on here right now. We definitely have an increased supply, particularly in silver. And you combine that with some uncertainty and some choppy demand, you're going to see some compression in premiums. I think at the moment, you have had gold twice over the last couple of weeks, test new highs and get very near all-time highs. The all-time high in gold in US dollars is around $2,060. And we did test that number a couple of weeks ago. I think there needs to be some conviction in the marketplace as to whether or not we're going to see a breakout to new highs or if we're going to see a retreat. I think in the quarter we're reporting right now, we did see significant activity and significant uptick in demand. When we did see some dips in prices on spot prices. So, I think it's a combination, but I think that kind of I hope that answers your question.\nLucas Pipes: That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then I apologize. I didn't see the margins in the wholesale and DTC segments and didn't have the time to dig further into that. But can you remind us what the margins were in the first quarter? And how you would expect those to trend, the gross margins, here in the second quarter and not sure if you want to venture into a longer kind of medium term outlook, but would appreciate your perspective on that?\nGreg Roberts: I mean, I think in the quarter, we have just finished the one that we're reporting on right now, we did see a lower gross margin. And we are -- as we enter this quarter, we're experiencing some similar market conditions as we did last quarter. So, but I would say from a positive note, I believe the company is continuing to outperform the market conditions and I think that we're investing in the business, we're growing the business, and we're seeing the results that we would expect in the market conditions. I think that as I look forward, there to me in doing this for the lab 40 years, I do see a number of macro issues continuing to pile up that I believe would be favorable to our business, whether they materialize or not, or how they have an effect on our business, I don't my crystal ball isn't quite that clear, but I do like the way things are setting up right now. But we are going to need to see a pickup in demand. And obviously, you can see from the spectacular results we had last fiscal year, and particularly the results we had in Q1 of last fiscal year and Q4 of last fiscal year, the company, when given the opportunity, will perform and has a very high ceiling on what performance can be. But as it relates to micromanaging what's going on this quarter and exactly what's happening today or tomorrow or next week, as we have said before, our business is very volatile. I wake up every day and look at the news and look at the price of gold and the price of silver. And there's a lot of things that go into whether we're going to have a busy day or a busy week. And trying to identify those days in the future can be challenging.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you so much Greg and I'll try to squeeze one last one in. In terms of the buybacks, is that more opportunistic or is there something to read into in terms of where your stock, where you see your stock trading vis a vis opportunities in M&A? thank you.\nGreg Roberts: I mean, I think we've talked a little bit about it before. I think nothing has changed. I look at our business and I look at our balance sheet and I look at what it takes to run our business. I look at our liquidity, our bank lines, a number of different factors contribute to the decision making as to how we allocate capital. We highlighted in this press release that we did sign and enter into a new agreement with our lenders. That agreement, I believe, was a lot of hard work by Thor and Kathleen with our great partners CIBC. And the result of the new credit facility moving to two years committed, moving to long-term debt as well as increasing our flexibility as it relates to how we're going to deploy capital, was a big win for A-Mark, and I don't want to minimize that. It was a lot of hard work and we're very thankful and very appreciative of our partners in the bank group. As we look at the stock buyback in particular, to me, it's just -- it's like any other trade we do. Where is our capital best allocated to return the best result for our shareholders and that’s something that I focus on all the time. As we look at opportunities whether it be capital expenditures, whether it be holding inventory, whether it be acquisitions or whether it be stock buybacks, I view this and the Board to this -- the Board and I are very well aligned on this, that we're looking for whatever the best return is for the shareholders. And, I believe that, at the moment, the stock offers to me a better opportunity, than maybe it did, a few months ago. So, I think certainly the market cap of the company as it relates to our tangible net worth and our book value as well as, inventory or M&A opportunities, they're all factors. And obviously as buying back stock in my assessment -- if I believe buying back the stock, a few years from now is going to be the best investment and the best way to deploy our capital, we will do that. If we believe an M&A opportunity is going to return a better ROI, we're going to look at the M&A opportunity. And if we need to expand our mints or we need to expand our storage or we need to inventory more product, we're going to do that. So, to me, it's something I do every day. I don't believe that there's a playbook for it that every opportunity and every decision is easily defined. It's a little bit of experience and gut and that's what I do. So, I hope that answered your question.\nLucas Pipes: It was very helpful. And I appreciate that approach and thank you for that detail and best of luck.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Your next question is coming from Tom Forte of D.A. Davidson. Tom, your line is live.\nTom Forte: Great. Thank you, Greg. So, I have two questions. I'll ask them both at the same time. Can you talk about -- would it be too strong of statement to say that $0.70 a quarter in GAAP earnings is a current low for the business as configured? The second part for that one is, what is it about the way that you've put together the business right now that enables you to generate such tremendous profitability in a soft quarter? I feel like if I looked back in time when there was soft quarter, you often actually lost money and didn't make money. And then second, maybe just at a high level, can you compare how the core customer is responding to the Israel-Hamas conflict or the government shutdown, news that came out at the end of September And maybe how that compares with the debt ceiling or the Silicon Valley Bank or the Rus-Ukraine, just high level comments there, I'd really appreciate it.\nGreg Roberts: Sure. Let's start with the first one. I am thrilled and very optimistic that with the environment we encountered, we encountered in the first quarter, we made $30 million EBITDA, which we've just announced. I think that is a tremendous performance. When you view the -- what we dealt with and what was going on as it relates to the supply and demand and the sentiment of our shareholder base and I believe that we have, as you pointed out, sometimes it's easy to lose perspective on performance and being a public company, I realize that that our investors are looking at a year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter. But as you've pointed out and you've been here for quite some time, $30 million, if that is near or around our low baseline of what we can do and $75 million to $80 million is our upside, I'm very proud of our employees and our management and our and thankful to our customers for everything they do to cause these results. So, -- and I am -- I know when $5 million was a great quarter for us. So, I agree with what you're saying. And I believe that this business is built for the long-term and this business is built to take advantage when the opportunities are there to have outsized returns that you just don't see very often in any companies. And I love it and we're very good at what we do. And when we have a slow quarter, as I have said before, and we've illustrated before, there's a lot that goes on to building the business and keeping the business running and prepared to take advantage and take market share when the market gives us an opportunity. So, for all we accomplished in Q1 and to make $30 million EBITDA, we're very pleased with the performance. I think that we are in a situation to kind of move towards your second question. I think we are facing some very uncertain times as it relates to what's going on in the world. And I don't think that any CEO can get on the phone like this and talk about that they have any certainty as to how certain things that are going on in the world today are going to affect their business. The crystal ball does become a little foggier when you have events going on, that are really unprecedented. And as I said a little bit earlier, in all the years I have done this, there are a lot of factors affecting the world economies right now that have really never come together at the same time. To kind of dissect your questions related to individual events, I think that in hindsight, it's very easy for me to understand and explain how certain events affected our business, either positively or negatively. Before the events happen, it's very difficult to understand what's going to happen and when and then predict what will be the result of those events. The three -- or actually you asked four specific questions and I will go what I think is chronologically, although I guess we could debate whether it's a direct -- directly chronological. I believe that the war between Russia and the Ukraine had a very positive effect on our customer base and commodities and precious metals in general. You had, a country that was a big producer of oil, of silver, of platinum, of a lot of commodities. That had basically unlimited capabilities as it relates to, going to war, become involved with an ally of the United States that was very important to us from a trading perspective, as well as a geographic perspective. And I believe that the world reacted to that and hadn't really expected or seen something like that, before. And for 4 to 5 months A-Mark, was the beneficiary of a great deal of uncertainty and how it would affect, the US. Economy. I think that the Silicon Valley bank crisis was unique amongst it. It was unique to anything I had ever really seen before where you had, you know, a top 15 bank in the country go under in a matter of days. You had, panic that came about in all financial institutions, and you had a flight to quality and a withdrawal of assets from a number of very large financial institutions. And that withdrawal of assets a good percentage of it in our world flowed into our products. So that event, again, was a little more short lived, but it was, it was, it was extreme. And as I've talked about before, all of these, what I call earthquakes and the aftershocks that follow, are all, you know, they all affect how we do business and what results we can hope to accomplish. The congressional shutdown the interest rate environment, which has taken a number of people by surprise, the what appears to be backtracking and re trading by the Fed on what they're actually going to do and what how they view inflation and how they view, what they're going to do about and interest rates. To me, that's just that's a huge macro issue. That affects huge markets way bigger than A-Mark's markets. And It's not, in my mind, going away anytime soon. And I think it paints a very positive picture for alternative currencies, as well as commodities and precious metals in particular. I believe that issue is more long-term and ongoing. And it's, it's not doesn't have the same exact effect as what I would call a Silicon Valley Bank earthquake that is a big deal and then kind of wanes over time. We'll see how a government shutdown affects our business. I think that right now, it seems to me that, the markets are very skittish. And I think that is it's instilling a little bit of uncertainty in all investors. I think it's a very difficult time right now to really predict, you know, how this is going to play out. I love the business we're in. I think we are positioned tremendously to take advantage of whatever happens. We're going into an election cycle, which, historically has created increased activity in our markets. So I look at that as something to keep an eye on. And then lastly, the Israeli Palestinian conflict or the Israeli Hamas conflict is just a horrible situation. It's just it's very difficult to watch. It's very difficult for me to keep wrap my arms around. And I think that our customers and probably shareholders are somewhat frozen. And I see that event as a situation where people are just not really focused so much on what's going on at the price of silver or gold. And they're focused on things that are unimaginable 60 days ago. And so I think that this particular conflict has probably slowed down. Just a lot of decision making as it relates to, hedging your equities protecting against a deflation of the dollar or different reasons why people look at our business and our products. So, I think it has it has been a little bit of a kind of sit on your hands and do nothing the last since October 7th, I believe it was. So I think that's -- that's natural. And I think it's understandable. And I think the next few months are going to be very interesting how this plays out. But you know, it's hard for me to speculate on how it's going to affect the economics of A-Mark.\nTom Forte: Thank you, Greg. Very thoughtful. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Your next question is coming from Andrew Scutt of ROTH MKM. Andrew, your line is live.\nAndrew Scutt: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. So my first one kind of piggybacks off the previous question. When you look at your DTC business now, there are multiple avenues in store funds you guys have and a broadening demographics of a customer base. I was just wondering if you could kind of dig deeper into the activity you saw there, maybe were there some pockets of customers that were weaker, were there others that may have provided some, countercyclical boost just anything you could provide there would be great.\nGreg Roberts : I think first and foremost, as I look at our numbers for this quarter and I look at our premiums that we're dealing with. I think that the new customer acquisition funnel that we get across all of the platforms are robust. I think our new client acquisition and our ability to take customers from our competitors and our ability to just onboard new customer's I thought it was a great month for that considering the environment. We did test on a number of occasions at JM Bullion in the last 90 days. We've tested really what price we need to sell product at. And we set goals for ourselves as to how many ounces we might be able to sell. If we were to test some lower premiums and some lower sale prices, I believe that was only possible in the current environment. And I will say that our customer base reacted better than I expected. We had a number of promotions in the last 90 days where I set what I thought were some very high end goals for what would be expected results And I think the team, at JM. Bullion and in the DTC segment, they performed very well. So I was very pleased with what we were able to gain as it relates to knowledge and what I believe we gained as it relates to new customers and taking market share from our competitors. So I was very pleased with that. I think that JM Bullion in particular is the lead bowl in our DTC segment, their results have been astronomical in previous quarters. As you can see, they at times contributed 60% of our gross profit. So JM Bullion, in particular, it was a very high bar for them to match or to keep up with. And we are we did see a slower result in this quarter, which we will report. I think that a couple of things on the positive note. Some of the smaller platforms and brands that we acquired over the last 12 months to 18 months. Bullion Max, in particular, we saw some -- some increased demand at very high average order value this last quarter from customers on that platform, numbers that we really hadn't seen in the diligence before we bought them. And I attribute that to Rob and his team at JM Bullion as it relates to their marketing and their taking over of that website. So definitely a positive on that particular platform from what we're seeing. We've also seen a shift to a number of orders that are very large, from a dollar perspective and are concentrated in gold over the last 90 days. And we have seen a bit of a shift in our market mix, our product mix moving over to gold from silver, which is reflected in our results and that that gold is usually slightly lower margin for us than silver and we attribute that and those orders, those very large orders, we think that is very healthy in that it relates to some large customers that are placing big orders. So, overall, I thought all of our platforms did very well. I think JM had a very high bar so in looking at the results it feels like maybe they underperformed, but in the environment we're in I feel like all of our DTC brands did very well considering the environment.\nAndrew Scutt: That's great to hear you're finding ways to navigate the weaker environment. My second one for me is just on the two mints. Could you just comment on the production out of the mints in the quarter and maybe if the waning demand would change your thought process on production rates moving forward?\nGreg Roberts : Yes. I think that the mints have done very well. The mints have navigated managing expectations and what can be expected in the current environment. I can say that I think they have really outperformed and have been very nimble and flexible in what they produce, and I think one of the beauties and positive takeaways that I see in our business for the next 10 years is our ability to shift production in a week to the products that we can sell. And I think we have been very fortunate that Jamie at SilverTowne and Tom Power at the Sunshine Mint and Jason at Sunshine that runs things for Tom, they've been very, very good at shifting products daily, and we're able to pivot to whatever we can sell and we've been very fortunate over the last three to four months that we've had a very good demand for larger size silver bars and we've been able to pick up our production and shift it to that product that we can sell, which just again keeps us nimble and keeps us ready to take advantage of when and if we need to shift back to one ounce silver products that that maybe are a little less in favor at the moment. But I can't say enough about the employees, management at the mints keeping everybody busy, managing the production, and cutting back on overtime and watching their expenses and it's just -- it was a very good job this quarter by our mints.\nAndrew Scutt: Great. Well, appreciate the detail, and thanks again for taking my questions.\nGreg Roberts : Sure. Thank you\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is coming from Greg Gibas of Northland Securities. Greg, your line is live. \nGreg Gibas: Hi. Good afternoon, Greg, Thor and Kathleen. Thanks for taking the questions. I think apologies if I missed it, but did you kind of -- did you see more or less margin compression with the wholesale business versus DTC wonder if you could just kind of speak to that?\nGreg Roberts : I would say that we have seen more margin compression in the DTC. I would say that we have we have we have tested lower premiums. We have done a number of specials over the last 90 days to really test the elasticity of the market to really find out what depth in product our competitors have as well as what price and premium motivates our customers. So I would say in this quarter we have experimented and I believe it has been a very positive outcome in that I think that I have a really good idea today in this environment what price I can sell a million units of one ounce silver product for. I don't know that I had that six months ago, because I don't think we had the same -- we hadn't really experienced this exact same environment in a while, but we did a number of tests where we set very large targets to see and to educate ourselves on what price and premium under what spot price conditions we could overachieve as it relates to units. So I think we've tested that, but with that we probably have seen a little more compression in gross margin and premium at the DTC side. I think the wholesale side has been compressed, but it probably not to the same extent as DTC.\nGreg Gibas: Got it. That's helpful. Greg. And a little bit more of a broad question, but wanted to see if you could address kind of avenues for growth and DTC and how you can capture more of the market and I guess along with that our inorganic opportunities more attractive in this kind of weaker macro environment?\nGreg Roberts : I mean for me I don't want to leave any money on the table. I mean, I look at our business as Sunshine and SilverTowne take 1,000 ounce silver bars that are A-Mark wholesale traders buy, our logistics gets the metal to the mints, the mints create the product and that profit opportunity goes from that 1,000 ounce bar all the way up our integrated business to the end user and I think that we're unique and we are separated from our competition because we have a lot of competition in different parts of the value chain, as it relates to our gross profit individually, but we really are the only fully integrated business that can take 1,000 ounce bars off the exchange and turn them into one ounce silver rounds and get the our retail consumer to respond to if we want to be the cheapest we can be the cheapest. I think the balance is always testing quantity, testing price, testing product and making sure at that DTC level that we are valuing new customers, which we have a metric for that. We're valuing the sale and we're valuing how it affects the rest of our vertically integrate integrated businesses. And just how to maximize and sell the right amount of ounces at the right price, all the while making sure we're keeping our new customer count up, because we we're fully committed to that new customer count, whether it be organic or whether it be through acquisitions. And if we have most of the customers, we're going to get most of the business. We're going to live through different macroeconomic, different environments, different supply and demand imbalances either way, but if we have the customers, and we make sure that we know how to motivate those customers, and we have a good idea of what we can expect from them if we test them, I feel like we don't really care where we get the customers organically or through acquisition, we just want to get as much out of those customers as we can. And if it's in an acquisition, we want to get more of the wallet and more out of those customers than then the company that ran it when we acquired it the management or the or the company platform, if we're taking customers from competitors and we're gaining market share and we're adding new customers that way, we value those customers maybe a little bit differently. And again, we want to make sure if they have $100 to spend, we're getting their $100. And as it relates to geographic, we continue to work very hard on opportunities that we see out there geographically to bring in new customers. We work on how we're going to value those customers and how that affects how we deploy our capital in an acquisition. And we are I believe the best in the business at analyzing opportunities and deciding where we're going to deploy our capital. Now obviously, as I've talked about before in our current situation, there is a lot of analysis that goes into capital deployment, whether it be stock buybacks, whether it be dividends, whether it be special dividends, whether it be M&A opportunities. And we're very focused on as a management team being able to pivot quickly and being able to take advantage of opportunities that will have the best ROI for our shareholders, myself included as one of the larger shareholders. I'm super committed to what we're doing here and long-term value and what making the right decisions today that will be positive in the future. And I think that the benefit we have, which I have said before is when we face some headwinds in the market and we have what many would look at as a slow quarter, $30 million EBITDA is still fantastic. And I would say that there are many millions of dollars that are potentially out there for us, because our competitors are probably going to feel this slowdown more than we are, because we have the best business in the industry. And we're going to also be offered opportunities for M&A that we would hope will be better return on investment equations then maybe in a very hot market. I think as I've talked about before we went through three out of four quarters last fiscal year where we were outperforming everybody but all of our competitors were doing very well. We were able to make outsized profits in that environment, but it didn't bode particularly well for M&A on a large scale, because I was very concerned about what would the business be worth if we did have a slowdown. Well, right now we're in that period as you can see in this quarter. And we're taking a very close look at how a slow quarter affects valuation on potential acquisitions. So to me it's just opportunity. I feel like we have great opportunity. I feel like the business is operating at a very high level. And this is going to be a good ride. I'm very much looking forward to what the next three or four years brings.\nGreg Gibas: Make sense. Appreciate your thoughts. Thanks Greg.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Our last question comes from Sy Jacobs of Jacobs Asset Management. Sy, your line is live.\nSy Jacobs: Hey, Greg. How are you?\nGreg Roberts : Hello Sy. How are you?\nSy Jacobs: I'm doing well. Thanks. So I just wanted you to run a little more with that last point about M&A and then kind of tie it to the buyback. last quarter you sounded pretty optimistic that there were some attractive live things in your M&A pipeline. I think you might even have mentioned one of them being an option to raise a minority stake to a higher level and then organic things? And then business was slowing at that time and you have mentioned the dynamic where like asking prices are sometimes too high when business is good and sellers become more motivated when business is bad. If you can give us an update on where your pipeline looks like in that regard? And then tie it to the fact that I couldn't help but notice that, you bought back stock at an average price that indicated, it happened right at the end of the quarter, because it's the only time the stock was trading below 30, so you kind of knew how the quarter was going, and you bought stock there now the stocks lower? And so just kind of juxtapose look even lower stock price where you were -- then where you were eager to buy it versus maybe even more attractive opportunities to do a creative M&A?\nGreg Roberts : Yes. I'll focus on what I talked about before. We have we have disclosed and we have a contractual option to increase our stake in Silver Gold Bull, the company in Calgary that that is a very well-run company, the founders are great. We appreciate all they do. We think they run a really good business. We have an option window that opens to take a controlling majority ownership. I believe it opens in December. I believe it's open for eight months, it's very specifically defined as to as to how that investment would be made and at what valuation. We're assessing the performance of that business today we understand that we negotiated this option to give us the flexibility to take advantage of the increased ownership, when we felt it was the -- the right deal at the right time related to all of our other options you just mentioned and that one's you know it's -- it's pretty baked. We're going to continue to look at the window of -- of exercising we're going to continue to look at the economics of that deal and we're going to continue to look at the economics of all the deals we're looking at including the buyback. As you can imagine, as our share price reflects our performance or it reflects the sentiment of our shareholders, and the price goes lower, buybacks become more attractive because I believe the stock is on sale. I have in my head, and I always have in my head, what A-Mark is worth. I'm a trader by nature. I have a very good idea what I think the bid side is and what the ask side is. And one of the benefits of being public is that there are supply and demand imbalances just like silver and gold where our stock becomes on sale. So as I look at that and I look at what I think my ask price is, I can have a very clear picture of what I think the return on investment is if I buy stock at 30, 29, 28, 27, 26, and it goes into my internal calculations as to where each dollar of capital should be deployed. So if I thought the stock was a great deal at 28 or 29, I think the stock is a better deal at 27. And we will act accordingly. As it relates to M&A and acquisitions, I tell people that A-Mark gets priced every hour during trading sessions, five days a week. The value of A-Mark is what it is. Right now, it's trading at a certain multiple. Our balance sheet is huge. Our tangible net worth is huge. Our book value is $600 million approximately. I tell people, I can't buy you if I buy A-Mark at a certain price. And unfortunately, when I say I want to buy you, I don't always get the response that I want. You know, other people, I have to live with A-Mark being priced every day, and I've become very accustomed to that. It doesn't bother me at all. But as it relates to what I'm going to pay on an acquisition, as I tell people, the deal has to make sense. Otherwise, why am I going to buy you if I can just buy back A-Mark stock and buy myself, which I have a great deal of confidence and control over. So when those discussions happen in a slowing environment and somebody thinks their business is worth X and I tell them now it's worth 70% of X, two things are going to happen. I'm either going to be right or I'm going to be wrong. And sometimes it takes a little while for the seller to get their arms around what their business is worth. And so deals that may have looked good four, five, six months ago, they have to be re-priced today. It's just the way the markets work. But I'm very patient. I mean, I have deals that we've looked at four or five times over the last three or four years. Some of them we act on, and some of them we're very patient, and we will not act unless we get them at the right price. So I am responsible for your money, and I take that responsibility very seriously and I feel like we've made very good decisions how we invest your money, and we're going to continue to do that.\nSy Jacobs: Great. I agree, Greg. Just one little definitional thing. Is it disclosed or can you disclose specifically or generally this option you have to go to majority ownership in silver gold bulls or whatever it's called in Calgary? Can you say roughly how many millions of dollars that would be cash or whether there would be stock involved? I'm just trying to put it in context of you spent $5 million buying back the stock, your cash still built by $9 million this quarter? I forgot what the number was, $50 million, $40 some odd million in cash. What's the scope of that possible delay?\nGreg Roberts: Yeah. I try for strategic reasons. Now, I don't know exactly what we said when we took the increased state to get us to, I think it's 47% or 49%. I will say that, the increase would take us to 75% and I don't -- and I don't believe the size of that 25% would not be normal course for us if we chose to do it. You know, it's certainly more than $5 million, and if you go back and look and you can see what we paid for the increase that we did make, you know, you can kind of figure it out. There's probably enough information there. I don't want to speak to it at the moment. I just know that as it relates to the way I just described all the decisions in front of us at the moment, we have been preparing in our own minds for the last six months, knowing that this opportunity is there that this window is going to open, and that we feel that that is a top priority, because we believe we value that option, and we believe that we think the option is an asset of A-Mark and we will be prepared if we think it's the right opportunity. We'll be prepared to take it. I don't think the cost or the investment will, it won't affect our decision-making. I think we have enough liquidity to do that. We have enough liquidity to pay our dividend. We have enough liquidity to buy back stock when we think it's the right time. And we have two or three other acquisitions we're looking at right now. So, I mean, I feel like we're very well prepared to take advantage when others need to sell. So I like the hand we have and I think we're playing the hand very well.\nSy Jacobs: Greg, on that point, just last part of the same question. If you were to, you said that option is fully baked. If you were to exercise it and go over 50%? And this could be a question for Kathleen possibly because it involves account.\nGreg Roberts: It is going be for Kathleen because I know exactly what you're going say.\nSy Jacobs: Yeah, is, would it be a situation like JM Bullion where by going over 50%, does the price of the option, is it struck at a price that would cause you to need to write up your minority investment and produce a gap earnings gain?\nKathleen Simpson-Taylor: Yes.\nSy Jacobs: And then you would also get, I assume the other gap effect is you would just have a higher stream of income flowing through the gap income statement because you own more of it?\nKathleen Simpson-Taylor: Yeah, you can look back at the JMB acquisition. We had that re-measurement gain, right? So the book value of how we carried the investment versus what the implied enterprise value is when you would buy the incremental piece. So that would most likely result in another re-measurement gain.\nSy Jacobs: Okay. Great. I appreciate it.\nGreg Roberts: I'm assuming, Kathleen, that we would then consolidate their financials if we did that.\nKathleen Simpson-Taylor: If we're up to 75, we would be required to consolidate.\nGreg Roberts: Okay. Is that good, Sy? \nSy Jacobs: That's awesome. Thanks, both of you.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Well, at this time, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Roberts for his closing remarks.\nGreg Roberts: Thank you, Jenny. Once again, I appreciate all the shareholder confidence. A lot of you have been -- we've been talking for a very long time. I really do appreciate your patience and your support as we navigate, as we've said before, a fairly volatile company as it relates to the lumpiness and choppiness of our earnings. And I think it's very important to look at our business and look at it over a year or two years. And again, quarter-to-quarter can be a little bit, it'd be a little bit difficult, both to a blowout quarter or a slow quarter. So I think it's great that everybody is, over time, has educated and is learning the company. And I thank you all for that support. I'd also like to thank again, our dedicated employees and all of their commitment to A-Mark success and we look forward to keeping you apprised of A-Mark's progress in the future. Thank you very much. Jenny, take it away.\nOperator: Thank you very much, Greg.
