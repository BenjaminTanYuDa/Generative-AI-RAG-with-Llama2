I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Huebschen, Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\nJeff Huebschen : Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Apogee Enterprises Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are Ty Silberhorn, Apogee's Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Osberg, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind everyone that there are slides to accompany today's remarks. These are available in the Investor Relations section of Apogee's website. During this call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions of these measures and reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and slide deck we issued this morning. I'd also like to remind everyone that our call will contain forward-looking statements. These reflect management's expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect Apogee's business and financial results can be found in today's press release and in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Ty.\nTy Silberhorn : Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our team delivered another strong quarter with continued margin expansion, earnings growth and improved cash flow. Today, I'll discuss those highlights from the quarter, how execution of our strategy continues to drive improved performance, provide some comments on our end markets and discuss how we are positioning the company for the future. Then I'll turn it over to Matt for more details on the quarter and our outlook. Let's start with the highlights, which are on Page 4 of our presentation. We delivered another quarter of strong earnings, margin expansion and cash flow performance. This was the second highest quarterly adjusted EPS in Apogee's history and follows the record adjusted EPS we delivered last quarter. While we are focused on driving revenue growth, we continue to demonstrate that we could deliver profit dollar growth and margin expansion even in an environment with low volume growth. Year-to-date, operating income dollars have increased 12% and operating margin improved by 150 basis points to 10.6%, which is above our current strategic goal of 10%. Once again, our improved results were led by exceptional performance in Architectural Glass. The Glass segment has delivered double-digit sales growth every quarter this year and they again achieved operating margins above their 10% to 15% target range. These terrific results reflect the strategic transformation of our Glass segment over the past 2 years. They have significantly improved their cost structure, delivered meaningful productivity gains and are driving their sales mix toward higher value-added premium products. Another highlight in the quarter was backlog growth in our Services segment. We secured approximately $200 million of new project awards during the quarter. These awards reflect the continuing effort to diversify the types of projects that we support. New awards included projects in transportation, healthcare, medical labs, education, multifamily housing and commercial office. We also secured our first major award in California as we've worked to expand further in the Western states. Given the strength of our earnings performance for the quarter, we are increasing our guidance for full year adjusted EPS. It's now been 2 years since our Investor Day where we introduced our 3-pillar strategy, highlighted on Page 5 of today's presentation. At its core, we aim to deliver 2 primary objectives; build differentiated businesses that provide compelling value for our customers and improve operational execution across our businesses to drive a more competitive cost structure. We've made great progress on both fronts, building a solid foundation, and we still have plenty of opportunity ahead of us. Architectural Glass was the lead business for our launch of the Apogee Management System or AMS and has made significant progress in their shift to premium strategy. This has helped the glass business to deliver record results and gives us confidence in our ability to sustain profitability levels should volume slow. Framing Systems has more than doubled their margins since fiscal '21. We still see margin expansion opportunities through further stages of AMS deployment and portfolio management as parts of their long-cycle business remain margin challenged compared to levels in the rest of the Framing segment. Architectural Services did take a step back in margin since fiscal '21 and saw revenue declines as we integrated the Sotawall business. That integration is nearly complete. And with backlog growing again, we see favorable revenue and margin improvement as we move into fiscal '25. Large scale optical has improved its already high margin profile since fiscal '21. And we are making investments which will allow them to expand into market adjacencies in late fiscal '25 and beyond. We are keeping a growth mindset and see further opportunities to strengthen margins and grow profit dollars. Two years in, we are very pleased with the results our team has achieved, and I'm excited for the opportunities that are still ahead of us. Now let me offer some comments about our construction end markets. Overall, there has been strong growth in non-residential construction during calendar year 2023. While every sub-sector of the non-res market has grown in the past year, manufacturing projects have accounted for approximately 60% of the total growth in non-residential construction this year. This is a sub-sector of the market where Apogee has very low participation given our current product offerings. Across the other sectors of non-res construction, much of that market growth has been driven by inflation-related pricing rather than volumes. This mirrors what we've seen in our own business over the past several quarters. In recent months, the rate of growth in non-res construction has begun to decelerate. And we've seen forward indicators like the Architectural Billings Index turned negative. Looking ahead to calendar '24, most industry forecasts call for further deceleration in non-res construction. Higher interest rates, tighter lending standards and increased costs have been putting pressure on commercial construction. We have seen that slowing show up in our short-cycle Framing business this quarter and expect some pressure in parts of that business as we go into fiscal '25. However, we still expect commercial construction growth rates in the low-single-digits overall in calendar '24. On the positive side, we also see institutional and infrastructure projects continuing to benefit from government funding. And the recent Fed signaling of a hold and now likely softening of interest rates could enable a shorter and shallower downturn for commercial construction. This should also loosen what has been a tight market for M&A, providing more opportunities for us to make strategic, financially accretive acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio and provide a catalyst for growth. Regardless of the macro environment, we are working to position Apogee for continued success. It's important to remember that non-residential construction is a very large and diverse end market. Within this large market, there are always opportunities for growth. We are approaching fiscal '25 with a growth mindset focused on seizing those opportunities to outperform the overall market. We believe our combination of leading brands, deep customer relationships and differentiated offerings positions us well to gain share in a fragmented industry. We will also continue to diversify our project mix, focusing on higher growth segments of the market, such as transportation, education and healthcare. And we will continue to evaluate investment opportunities that could accelerate our growth through both organic expansion and through acquisitions. Of course, we will maintain our focus on driving productivity, improving execution and managing costs. These have been the foundation of our performance over the past 2 years. This has allowed us to grow profit dollars above our revenue growth rate, and we continue to see opportunities to further build on that success. Finally, our strong cash flow and balance sheet provide us with significant flexibility to execute our strategy. Our entire team is focused on building upon the strong foundation we have established and continuing to deliver strong performance. With that, let me turn it over to Matt.\nMatt Osberg : Thanks, Ty, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll begin with a review of our results in the quarter. Then I'll discuss our updated outlook for the fiscal year. And finally, I will wrap up with some preliminary thoughts on fiscal '25. The third quarter delivered strong results with significant operating margin expansion, double-digit earnings per share growth and very strong cash flow despite lower revenue. Net sales were $340 million compared to $368 million in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume in Framing, partially offset by growth in Glass. Gross profit increased 4.3% and gross margin improved by 310 basis points, primarily driven by higher pricing, improved product mix, lower short-term incentive compensation expense and lower insurance-related expense. These items were partially offset by the impact of lower volume and a less favorable mix of projects in Services. SG&A expense increased $0.8 million to 15.5% of net sales. The increase was primarily due to higher salary and benefit costs, partially offset by lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Operating income grew 8.3% and operating margin increased 170 basis points to 11.1%, primarily driven by improved segment operating margin in Glass as well as a higher mix of Glass segment results in our consolidated results. This was partially offset by lower segment operating margin in Framing. Looking at our segment results. Framing revenue declined 15.4%. As a reminder, our Framing business is a mix of short and long-cycle businesses. The majority of the business is shorter cycle and primarily provide solutions for storefront and entrance systems and commercial windows. The longer cycle part of framing provides custom-engineered window and curtain wall solutions for midsize and larger projects. The lower sales this quarter were primarily driven by lower volume in the shorter cycle parts of the business, reflecting the deceleration in non-residential construction activity that Ty described earlier. Segment operating margin for Framing contracted 120 basis points to 12.2%, primarily due to the impact of lower sales volume. This was partially offset by improved mix, cost savings initiatives, improved productivity and lower short-term incentive compensation expense. Despite the lower volumes, Framing margins continue to be above the 9% to 12% target range for the segment for both the quarter and year-to-date. Glass revenue grew 11.6% and segment operating income more than doubled to $15.2 million. Segment operating margin expanded 760 basis points to 16.7%. This was primarily driven by improved pricing and mix, partially offset by the impact of lower volume and continued cost inflation. Services revenue and segment operating margin declined, primarily due to a less favorable mix of projects, partially offset by lower short-term incentive compensation expense. However, Services margins -- Services improved margins sequentially from the second quarter and we expect margins to improve again in the fourth quarter. In LSO, despite lower revenue, operating margin improved by 60 basis points to 27.3% with favorable mix offsetting lower volume. Corporate expenses of $6.9 million declined by $1 million, primarily due to lower insurance-related costs. Looking at backlog trends for the quarter. On a sequential basis, backlog for Framing was $184 million compared to $197 million in the second quarter. The decline was driven primarily by our longer-cycle business, reflecting slower award activity and a continued strategic shift towards projects that allow for more attractive margins. Services finished the quarter with $777 million in backlog, up 15% from the second quarter. Project backlog in Services is typically driven by a small number of relatively large projects. This makes backlog changes inherently variable from quarter-to-quarter depending on the timing of project awards. In the first half of the fiscal year, Services backlog declined as we saw delays in projects moving from bid to award. This quarter, several of those delayed projects moved forward, contributing to the backlog growth in the quarter. Turning to cash flow. We had another strong result with cash from operations in the quarter improving $12.9 million. This brings year-to-date operating cash flow to $129.3 million, an improvement of $78.2 million compared to the same period last year. The year-to-date improvement has primarily been driven by favorable working capital changes. Through 3 quarters of the fiscal year, we have already achieved the second highest year of operating cash flow in the company's history. Our primary use of cash in the quarter was debt reduction as we paid down $45 million of debt on our revolving credit facility. Fiscal year-to-date, we have reduced our net debt by $72.7 million, bringing our net leverage ratio down to 0.4x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA compared to 0.9x at the beginning of the year. We had $11.9 million of capital expenditures in the quarter, primarily relating to investments to expand capacity in our higher margin business and enhanced productivity through automation. Moving to our updated outlook for the fiscal year. We are increasing our full year adjusted diluted EPS outlook to a range of $4.55 to $4.70, primarily reflecting our strong third quarter earnings. This updated outlook implies full year growth between 14% to 18% compared to last year's adjusted diluted EPS of $3.98. Additionally, we now expect net sales will decline approximately 3% for the fiscal year. As a reminder, fiscal '24 is a 53-week year with an extra week of operations in the fourth quarter. We expect our consolidated fourth quarter operating margin to decline sequentially, but improve compared to prior year as we expect sequential margin moderation in Framing, Glass and LSO to be partially offset by an improvement in Services margin. We continue to expect an average tax rate of approximately 24.5%. And we now expect full year capital expenditures between $40 million to $50 million, down from our previous estimate of $50 million to $60 million. Looking ahead to fiscal '25, we are currently working through our budgeting process and expect to provide financial guidance for the new fiscal year in April. As we work through this process, we would like to share a few preliminary thoughts about the coming fiscal year. We continue to monitor macroeconomic trends and industry data to assess the potential impacts on our business. As Ty described, most industry forecasts called for decelerating growth for non-residential construction with low-single-digit growth expected for calendar '24. Growth expectations in non-resi construction are impacted by interest rates and financing markets. If interest rate outlooks begin to improve in calendar '24, that could favorably impact our business. However, with the longer-cycle nature of the construction industry, we would not expect a significant impact on our fiscal '25 results. Within the prevailing market environment, we will strive to outperform our industry as we continue to drive strategic changes across our business. Regardless of market conditions, we are approaching the new year with a growth mindset and a focus on driving further productivity gains and improvements in our cost structure. If we do see slower market growth in fiscal '25, this will primarily impact our Framing and Glass segments. The strong backlog growth in Services this quarter positions that segment well for top-line growth next year. We also see an opportunity for growth in LSO as that business continues to expand into new adjacencies and begins to benefit from additional capacity. We also believe we have further positive margin building blocks yet to realize in fiscal '25. Margins should benefit from further productivity, AMS initiatives and a favorable project backlog in Services. Fiscal '24 has been an incredible year for our Glass segment, which has benefited from volume, pricing and mix, leading to sales growth of 20% and operating income growth of 157% on a year-to-date basis. In fiscal '25, we expect Glass segment margin rates to moderate compared to what we've achieved this year as market demand will likely have a negative impact on volume and pricing and as we begin to lap mix benefits from our shift to premium strategy. For fiscal '25, we are focused on maximizing margin dollars in the Glass segment, while delivering margin rates within our target range of 10% to 15%. As a reminder, fiscal '25 will revert to a normal 52-week year, which will create a headwind for year-over-year comparisons of approximately 2 percentage points on revenue. Finally, we expect our priorities for capital deployment in fiscal '25 to continue to be investing in organic growth, accretive M&A and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. To close, this was another strong quarter as we continue to advance our strategic objectives and drive improved profitability and cash flow. We are on track to deliver a strong full year results in fiscal '24 and see opportunities for further progress in the year ahead. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ty for some concluding remarks.\nTy Silberhorn : Thanks, Matt. To wrap up, I wish to thank our team for delivering yet another strong quarter. In the 2 years since we introduced our new strategic direction, we have driven sustainable operating improvements across our business, allowing us to exceed the financial targets we set out at our Investor Day in November of 2021. Our team is focused on delivering a successful fourth quarter to close out this fiscal year. And as we look ahead, we continue to see significant opportunities for long-term profitable growth across our business through both organic and inorganic investment. With that, we are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Chris Moore with CJS Securities.\nChris Moore : Maybe we'll just start with the visibility within Services backlog, $776 million, that's up 15% sequentially. Roughly, what percentage of that still has some of the lower margin work in there? And is that lower margin work likely to -- we'll see that in calendar '24?\nTy Silberhorn: So if you look at it, Chris, if you recall, when we announced the Sotawall integration, that Sotawall we had it as a standalone business was losing money. So they were in a negative EBIT, stayed at that point in time. And so it's a combination of managing our costs as well as looking at how we improve productivity and then kind of shift that business model from a supply side to a true integrated project services business model. They have worked down a significant portion of that amount. So we won't break out those percentages. But I would say as we move through fourth quarter and we get through maybe first quarter of next year, that would become really immaterial to that backlog as they go forward. Part of that revenue dip we saw was them transitioning out of that business model because it's a different customer set than the way Sotawall was going to market before. So that should provide some additional tailwind for them on the margin side as they go into fiscal '25.\nChris Moore : Perfect. That's helpful. And maybe just staying with Services for a moment, the project that you talked about in California, is that -- is there a big growth potential here? And are there any challenges finding employees to work on these?\nTy Silberhorn: We have established a regional office in California of almost a year ago now. And then we have been deploying some of the project managers and kind of the key personnel, if you will, to manage that business from other parts of the U.S. to support that. So we feel we're in a very good position. We actually were pulled out there by one of the large contractors that we work with in other parts of the country. So we feel really good about not only landing that first project, but as we're looking at projects in the Western part of the United States. We've got a couple of good partnerships. And with a little bit of the softness that we have been seeing, we also, as we did in calendar '20 and '21 during COVID, it's a little bit of a flight to quality what we're seeing here too. And our Services segment, which operates under the Harmon brand is known in the industry as a high quality integrated project services business. So we're seeing some benefits from there, not just in the West, but throughout other parts of the region of the U.S.\nChris Moore : Got it. Perfect. And maybe just last one is on Glass margins. Obviously, 16.7%, Matt kind of talked about that not necessarily being repeatable in fiscal '25, but just trying to get a sense as to -- the range is up to 15%, is the bias kind of towards the high end of the range at this stage moving forward?\nMattOsberg : Yes, Chris, it's a great question. And the Glass, like you're pointing out, Glass segment had phenomenal results this year. And as we've said, they're hitting on all cylinders. And as we talked about in my remarks, if there's volume pressure, they'll look at pricing and titrate pricing to the volume and we're trying to maximize margin dollars for next year in that segment within that 10% to 15% range. So I think we're within that range. It depends on the volume pressure that they get and what happens in pricing. But we're very confident that we'll be able to remain in that range next year as we look to maximize EBIT dollars.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company.\nJulio Romero: Maybe to start on the Framing segment, how does that an expected pressure on the shorter-cycle business, which I believe is generally higher margin than the project-related portion of the segment? How does that demand pressure affect expected margins in fiscal '25? And are the margins still expected within the 9% to 12% target range?\nMattOsberg : Yes, I think that's a great -- I think that's a good assumption, Julio, for next year. And it will be somewhat similar to what's happening in Glass, right, as we look at the volume pressure they might get in adjusting pricing, but we still feel good about our long-range target in that segment. And even this year, like we said, I mean, this quarter, they were -- they declined, but they're still ahead of their long-range targets for the quarter and year-to-date periods. So there's still some opportunities for us in that segment with some other margin building blocks as we look into the future.\nTy Silberhorn: Yes. And I would just add to that, Julio. I mean, we've talked about choppiness in order rate, in volumes and we have short -- well, we have low visibility to that short-cycle business as we've talked about. But we did see all 3 months of the quarter for them to be negative. And so we didn't get that 1 month of balance where we had some nice bounce back growth. So that's a sign for us and we do our competitive reconnaissance. The other large players that we compete with in the market, from what we have been able to gather, they all saw similar declines in the same period. That said, November was better than October. So we kind of are looking back how does this play out fourth quarter and then using that fourth quarter to really build our assumptions for fiscal '25. But as Matt said, even if there's continued revenue pressure on that business, that extends into our fiscal '25 for some part of fiscal '25, we still feel really good about the operating levers we have to pull still on margin from a productivity and a cost of goods sold. And then as you highlighted, we have part of that business while it has been coming down as a percent of our revenues, the larger project supply side of that business, it remains margin challenged. So that's an area that we also have some levers to kind of further accelerate the higher margin parts of that business and deal with our costs and some of the margin challenges on the project side of that business.\nJulio Romero: Got it. That's very helpful there. Maybe turning to the Services segment. You obviously saw some strong orders there in the book-to-bill above 2x. What kind of level of inquiries are you seeing today within the segment? And then secondly, I think, Matt, you addressed this in your prepared remarks, but there's a lumpy nature to orders within that segment. I guess, we shouldn't expect that type of level of orders in the fourth quarter. And if that's so, how should we kind of think about underlying demand for the segment?\nTy Silberhorn: Yes. I mean, Julio, I would say just because of the questions on the market, when we look at research firms forecasting calendar '24 non-res construction, there's a little bit wider spread than what we have seen in the last few years. So we're seeing anywhere from minus 1%, minus 2% to plus 5%. So that still says that there's some cloudiness there. And I think until people really get grounded on interest rates, not only -- I think everyone feels the ceilings there. But until they see that first rate cut, I think it's going to still cause some delays in project awards so that the developers, contractors feel more confident about locking in their cost structure for that project. So I think we'll still see some lumpiness. So I wouldn't assume that Q4 is going to look like Q3 in terms of awards and net booking numbers in relation to that. But like I said before, we are seeing a little bit of a flight to quality. So we have seen some nice projects come into our Services segment for bids and quotes. So that continues to be a positive sign.\nMattOsberg : And the only thing I would add, Julio, is really encouraging to see the diversity of project wins that we had in the quarter. So I think that reinforces that if people are looking for quality and we can provide that as we have in the past and to have a more diverse set of project wins come in, that's encouraging to me.\nJulio Romero: Got it. That's helpful. If I could just ask one more here is just on -- the cash flow was really impressive here in the quarter, just how much more runway do you have for working capital improvement? And do you foresee working capital being neutral in fiscal '25?\nMattOsberg : Yes. Great question, Julio. So if you recall back in fiscal '23, I think what's -- there's a couple of things benefiting us. One is, we're doing some good things in fiscal '24 and strong earnings growth helps that cash flow. The second, just from a comparability perspective, fiscal '23, I think are -- just some of the nature of what happened in the marketplace that year, our working cash flow -- working capital went backwards a little bit. So I think you're seeing a really strong recovery on a year-over-year basis compared to '23 because of just some abnormal bad guys that happened in '23. So if you're thinking about year-over-year improvement, I think there's -- I wouldn't assume we're going to do that same type of improvement as I look ahead to fiscal '25. If you're thinking about just sustaining and being able to kind of deliver at relatively high levels of cash flow, I think there's a good possibility of us doing that. I think we've got some opportunity in working capital. But I think being able to sustain where we are at this high of a level is also a good outcome from a cash flow. But we'll get into more of that as we get through our budget cycle and look into fiscal '25.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Brent Thielman with D.A. Davidson.\nBrent Thielman: Congrats on a great quarter. Really just one for me, lot has been answered here. But Ty, your balance sheet is in great shape. You’re throwing off a lot of cash. You’re obviously focused on growth prospects, organic and potentially inorganic. I guess, my question is, as you’re starting to look at those opportunities out there, is it all entirely within the non-residential market? Are you intrigued by some other opportunities because you’ve got this great LSO business producing great margins? And assuming there’s some good things there, I’d just be curious where we see this go?\nTy Silberhorn: Yes, Brent, great question. And we’ve talked before, we’ve built the process, we’ve got resources, we’ve been – we have an active pipeline. We’ll never talk specifics on companies, et cetera. It has remained tight. Even things that were coming into a process and just – they get a sense that there’s not maybe as many buyers yet as they would like. And so we’ve seen some processes pulled as a result of that. When you step back and think about it, we are primarily an architectural products and services company. So we will look to diversify our product portfolio via acquisitions, in part to allow us to play into more of those project types. And we won’t get into specifics, but I’d say, if you think about it that way, from our products-related business and probably things that are more related to are an extension of what we’re doing in Framing, but different product sets. And then, yes, you hit on a really solid point with large-scale optical. We’ve got some really great technology and know-how and understanding about performance coatings on both glass and acrylic or polymer substrates. And as we now have invested in additional coating capacity for that business, and we work to accelerate their diversification, we are being opportunistic if there’s some acquisitions that can accelerate that diversification of that business that we see both a strategic fit from a technology and business standpoint, and again, are accretive to our margin goals as a company. So as we look at that space, it’s likely we’re not acquiring something that’s a 25% -- greater than 25% EBIT, but we’re certainly interested in things that accelerate diversification in that business that are even in the teens from an EBIT perspective that help us grow that business as well.\nOperator: There are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call over to Ty Silberhorn for closing remarks.\nTy Silberhorn : Well, I'd just like to thank everyone for joining us today. And I know we're right up against the holiday season, so I'd just like to wish you and your families happy holidays, and looking forward to a prosperous new year for all of us. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect."

After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Jeff Huebschen. Sir, you may begin.\nJeff Huebschen: Thank you, Towanda. Good morning, and welcome to Apogee Enterprises Fiscal 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me today are Ty Silberhorn, Apogee's Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Osberg, Chief Financial Officer. I'd like to remind everyone that there are slides to accompany today's remarks. These are available in the Investor Relations section of Apogee's website. During this call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions of these measures and reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and slide deck we issued this morning. I'd also like to remind everyone that our call will contain forward-looking statements. These reflect management's expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect Apogee's business and financial results can be found in today's press release and in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn the call over to you, Ty.\nTy Silberhorn: Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Apogee has delivered another terrific quarter as we continue to advance our strategy. Let me touch on some highlights from the quarter and connect those to how our strategy continues to drive sustainable improvements in our business. Then I'll turn it over to Matt for more details on the quarter and our outlook. Let's start with the highlights, which are on page four in our presentation. Overall, this was another strong quarter that continued the positive momentum we've established the past two years. We are especially pleased to report an operating margin that exceeded our 10% target for the first time since we established our financial goals in late 2021. This margin expansion drove adjusted earnings per share to a new quarterly record. I'm proud of our team for the work they've done to achieve these milestones. Just as importantly, we've demonstrated that we can meaningfully grow profit dollars and cash flow even in an environment without meaningful volume growth. Once again, Architectural Glass led the way, continuing their revenue and profit growth trend. As a reminder, when we began our strategic transformation two years ago, the Glass segment had operating margins in the low single-digits. We've now achieved eight consecutive quarters of sequential margin improvement. I'd like to recognize the entire Glass team for this tremendous success. Our improved results are being driven by our three-pillar strategy, which is highlighted on page five in our presentation. We've made great progress towards becoming an economic leader. We better defined our target markets. We're focused on differentiated products and services, we've built more competitive cost structures, and we've made great strides to improve operational execution. In our second pillar, actively managing the portfolio, we've taken steps to shift our portfolio to higher margin offerings, which drive improved ROIC performance. We're making investments to scale and grow our top-performing businesses. We've implemented focused improvement plans to strengthen underperformers, and we are increasing the mix of differentiated offerings across our portfolio. Finally, we are strengthening our core capabilities. The foundation of this is deploying the Apogee Management System, which is our approach to lean and continuous improvement. We are also continuing our shift from a decentralized operating model to one with center-led functional expertise that better supports the needs of our business. And we are improving our approach to talent management and talent development at all levels of the organization. As we move forward, we see significant opportunities to continue to build on this success. When we announced our new financial goals in 2021, we had operating margins in the low to mid-single digits, and we were not earning our cost of capital. As we began to execute our strategy, improving margins and ROIC was the primary focus, especially in Glass and Framing Systems, which were underperforming their potential. In several cases, we made the strategic decision to move away from lower-margin sales where we did not have differentiated offerings. Now that we have substantially improved our margins and our earning above our cost of capital, it is appropriate to shift more focus to driving profitable revenue growth. We are making strategic investments that will enable organic growth. We are leveraging our improved execution and service levels to gain market share. We are working to further diversify our project mix in the higher growth sectors. And we continue to explore potential acquisition opportunities that support our strategy, accelerate our growth and our diversification. These efforts will create opportunities across the enterprise to drive above-market growth in the years ahead. We will do this while sustaining the things that have made us successful these past two years, staying focused on driving productivity and execution, carefully managing our cost structure and further strengthening our results driven culture. With that, let me turn it over to Matt.\nMatt Osberg: Thanks, Ty, and good morning, everyone. First, I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter results and then turn to our updated outlook for the full fiscal year. As we look at our second quarter results, despite revenue declining 5%, it was another strong earnings quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 28% to a record level of $1.36. We also expanded operating margin by 290 basis points to 11.5. Consolidated revenue was $354 million for the quarter, compared to $372 million last year, primarily reflecting lower volumes in Services and Framing. This was partially offset by strong growth in Glass, which was up 22%. The growth in Glass was driven by improved volume, pricing and mix, reflecting our continued strategic shift towards higher-value premium products. In our Services segment, revenue recognition is mainly a function of the stage projects are in and how much work has been completed. Compared to the second quarter of last year, in the current year, we had a higher mix of products that are early in their life cycle, which drove lower levels of revenue being recognized in the current quarter. The revenue decline in Framing was primarily driven by lower volumes, reflecting elevated volumes in the prior year as we work to reduce lead times to drive a reduction in backlog. This was partially offset by a more favorable product mix. Consolidated operating income increased 26% and operating margin expanded 290 basis points to 11.5%, primarily driven by strong sales and margin improvement in Glass. Segment operating income per Glass nearly tripled to $17.5 million, up $17.4 million, up from $6.5 million last year. The Glass segment operating margin improved to 18.5% over a 10 percentage point increase compared to last year and reflects favorable operating leverage and benefits from pricing and mix. Framing grew segment operating income 3% and expanded segment operating margin by 140 basis points to 13.3%, driven primarily by improved mix and cost efficiencies partially offset by the impact of lower volume. Both Services and Large-Scale Optical segment operating margins were down primarily due to the impact of lower volume. However, Services improved margins sequentially from the first quarter and we expect Services margin to continue to improve in the second half of the year. Corporate expenses of $6.1 million were in line with prior year, however, we're less than the first quarter of fiscal '24, primarily due to lower insurance-related costs. While our corporate costs can have variability from quarter-to-quarter, we expect the run rate for the third and fourth quarters to trend more closely with the levels experienced in the first quarter. This quarter, we recognized a $4.7 million pretax benefit from a New Markets Tax Credit, which was recorded in other income. The New Markets Tax Credit is a federal program that encourages investments in local communities. The credit we realized this quarter was related to investments we made seven years ago. We have two similar tax credits pending, which we expect to recognize in fiscal year '26. Our tax rate in the quarter was 22.9%, below our long-term rate assumption of 24.5% due to the favorable impact of discrete tax items. Adjusted EPS grew 28% to $1.36 primarily driven by higher operating income. EPS was also benefited by a lower diluted share count, which reflects our share repurchase activity over the past two quarters. Looking at backlog trends for the quarter on a sequential basis, backlog for Framing was $197 million compared to $221 million in the first quarter. The reduction was driven primarily by a decline in our longer cycle business, reflecting delays in award activity and continued strategic shift towards projects that allow for more attractive margins. Services finished the quarter with $674 million in backlog compared to $709 million last quarter, primarily reflecting delays in award activity. We had another strong quarter of cash flow as we generated $41.3 million of cash from operations, an improvement of $13.5 million over last year. This brings year-to-date operating cash flows to $62.6 million, an improvement of $65.2 million compared to the first half of last year. This was primarily driven by improved working capital as the first half of last year had unfavorable working capital impacts related to sales growth and inflation. We had capital expenditures of $7.6 million in the second quarter, primarily relating to investments to expand capacity in our higher-margin businesses and enhanced productivity through automation. We also returned nearly $12 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we paid down $25 million in debt in the quarter. This debt reduction further strengthened our balance sheet with our net leverage ratio coming down to 0.7 times trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Turning to our updated fiscal year outlook. We are increasing our full year adjusted diluted EPS outlook to a range of $4.35 to $4.65, primarily reflecting the strong results in the second quarter. This updated outlook implies full year adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 17% compared to last year's adjusted diluted EPS of $3.98. We also continue to expect flat to slightly declining net sales for the fiscal year. As a reminder, fiscal '24 is a 53-week year with an extra week of operations in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the extra week is expected to add approximately two percentage points of growth to revenue. Our outlook range contemplates the latest market forecast, which point to a potential slowdown in non-residential construction in the second half of our fiscal year. Any impact of this would more quickly affect the shorter cycle businesses within Framing and Glass. As in past years, we expect the fourth quarter will be the lowest revenue and margin quarter for Framing due to the seasonality of the winter construction season. We expect Framing margins for the full year will be near the top of its 9% to 12% target range. For Glass, although we expect revenue growth and margin levels to moderate in the second half of the year, we expect the full fiscal year operating margin to be toward the higher end of the 10% to 15% target that we articulated last quarter. We expect Services revenue and operating margin to increase in the second half of the year compared to the first half, primarily due to the progression of work on active projects. Although Services margins should improve as we move through the year, we expect that it will likely fall short of the 7% to 9% target range for the fiscal year. We expect sales and margins in Large-Scale Optical to improve sequentially in the second half of the year as customer inventory levels rebalanced. As I mentioned earlier, we expect corporate cost for the third and fourth quarters to trend more closely with the level of expense we incurred in the first quarter. We continue to expect an average tax rate of approximately 24.5% and full year capital expenditures of $50 million to $60 million. We also continue to expect both operating and free cash flow growth for the full year. We are very pleased with the earnings results we have delivered in the first half of the fiscal year with adjusted diluted EPS growth of 17% and operating margin expansion of 140 basis points despite declining sales. We are focused on delivering the back half of the year and continuing to drive our strategic initiatives to set us up for fiscal '25 and beyond. As we look ahead to fiscal '25, we are monitoring macroeconomic trends and industry data to assess potential impacts on our business. As we begin our planning process for next fiscal year, we will stay focused on driving long-term shareholder value and will take a balanced approach for any short to mid-term market changes while maintaining investment and momentum behind our most critical strategic initiatives. We are approaching fiscal '25 with a growth mindset, a focus on driving further productivity gain, and a balanced approach to cost control and strategic investments. While we have been able to expand operating margins significantly over the past two years, we believe that we have further positive margin building blocks yet to realize. We believe that fiscal '25 margins will be helped by further productivity and AMS initiatives and improved project pipeline and services, continued emphasis on improving mix and framing and potentially using our strong balance sheet for attractive M&A. Additionally, although we expect Glass segment margin rates to moderate in fiscal '25, we are focused on maximizing margin dollars while delivering margin rates within our target range of 10% to 15%. As a reminder, fiscal '25 will revert to a normal 52-week year, which will be a headwind for year-over-year comparisons. In closing, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results as well as our continued progress to advance our strategic objectives and drive improved profitability. This improved profitability will better position us to outperform throughout the market cycle. Additionally, our strong cash flow and balance sheet position us for further value-creating capital deployment, investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ty for some concluding remarks.\nTy Silberhorn: Thanks, Matt. To wrap up, I want to recognize our team once again for their tremendous efforts in advancing our strategy. Through their work, we have exceeded our 10% margin target less than two years since we set this goal. And we're not done as we'll continue building on these achievements. While we see some signs of softening in the broader non-residential market, we are seeing positives that play to our strengths and strategic focus. Premium Class A office space is still seeing solid demand and many research firms predict this area will perform better than the broader office segment. We're seeing a higher rate of mixed-use buildings that blend office, retail and residential. Institutional and transportation projects remain strong. And there's a renewed focus on sustainability and green buildings. Our current backlog reflects many of these trends, while future acquisitions could accelerate our growth and diversification. We also expect to drive additional productivity gains through the Apogee Management System and further improve operational execution. We're proud of the progress to date and we continue to see significant opportunities to deliver long-term above-market growth across our business. With that, we are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Moore with CJS Securities. Your line is open.\nChris Moore: Good morning, guys. Congrats on a very nice quarter.\nTy Silberhorn: Good morning, Chris.\nChris Moore: Maybe we'll just start on the framing operating margin. Obviously, Q2, very strong 13.3%. You talked about efficiencies from lean and mix. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about kind of what mix means within the Framing? Are we talking about types of projects, quick turn versus longer? Is it types of buildings? Just anything else in terms of kind of that mix component.\nTy Silberhorn: Sure. It's a great question, Chris. There's a couple of things going on in Framing. One, our shorter-cycle business we see stronger margins and as that business has recovered on service and lead time levels. Last year, in their second quarter, they were catching up and really cleaning up and you saw that the backlog dropping, which was a positive thing for the short-cycle portion of that business because it had built up through some extended lead times due to some supply chain issues. So that was one issue that they were working through from a year-over-year comp perspective. Revenues last year were a bit increased or up a bit for them because of that recovery. But as we are going through that, that short cycle business with that service differentiation, we are able to get some stronger margins than other parts of the business. So we've continued to invest and the team is driving their focus to accelerate and grow more of that business. The project-related business has always had some lower margins compared to the short-cycle business. And there's two things going on there. One, the team is being much more selective about where I think you can differentiate and capture value both for the customer and us, which would translate into some better margins. And then we've encouraged the team that if we can't get margins that help us achieve and sustain our long-term profit goals, then it's probably business we don't want on some of that project-related business. So you're seeing that start to show up in the revenue mix, and you're also seeing that as a driver in some of the drop in the backlog for that business as well.\nChris Moore: Got it. That's very helpful. Let me just switch gears, so aluminum pricing bounced around a bit lately, still well below March levels. Is there any kind of likely benefit or penalty from aluminum pricing that timing that's built into the balance of '24?\nMatt Osberg: Yes. Chris, this is Matt. I wouldn't say there's any real material impact built into the back half.\nChris Moore: Got it. And maybe just on cash flow. Obviously, very strong quarter, good six months, cash flows dropped -- jumped around a little bit at working capital, as you talked about. At some point, is there a normalized relationship you would expect between free cash flow and say net income? Or is there any other metric that we should be thinking about when looking at kind of a normalized free cash flow?\nMatt Osberg: Yes. It's a great question, Chris. I mean, obviously, we had some unique things that happened last fiscal year, and we're realizing the benefits of it this fiscal year as that's becoming more normalized. I think as we look at our opportunities in working capital. There's still some opportunities for us to get better as we move forward. I think the big driver there will be how we look at our investments in CapEx in the future and how we can fund some of our organic initiatives through CapEx. So, obviously, we have a little bit higher CapEx this year than we have in the past. And as we start looking at fiscal '25, we'll figure out how that plays out for next year. But I think this year, we'll be a little bit more return to a normalized working capital, whereas maybe last year was a bit more of an aberration for what was happening in the markets. And as we turn the page and start looking at '25, we'll get more information on how that's going to play out next year.\nChris Moore: Got it. And you're still talking about $50 million to $60 million in CapEx for this year?\nMatt Osberg: Yes. Yes. It's a higher spend in the second half than the first half but just some of the timing of the investments that we're planning to make just to end up being in the second half.\nChris Moore: Got it. I'll leave it there. Thanks so much guys.\nMatt Osberg: Thank you.\nTy Silberhorn: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Your line is open.\nJulio Romero: Thanks. Hey, good morning. Just wanted to piggyback on the last question about cash usage and how you're thinking about. It sounded like based on the prepared remarks, you're really thinking about shifting some focus to growth investments. You talked about maybe a step-up in CapEx in fiscal '25. Just maybe how much of a step-up in CapEx can we maybe expect in '25? And it sounds like you might be closer to maybe some inorganic growth opportunities, would that be fair as well?\nMatt Osberg: Hey, Julio, this is Matt. I'll jump in on this and then Ty maybe add. So from a CapEx perspective, I think what I reflected to Chris was fiscal '24 is a step-up in CapEx from where we've been in fiscal '23. And so I think you can see that. As we look to fiscal '25, we're going to start looking at that and what that might mean. I think there are some good opportunities to invest in some organic growth initiatives, but we haven't gone through that planning process yet. But we want to continue to invest, as we've talked about as we look at '25. We want to continued momentum and invest behind our best strategic initiatives. And so we don't want to lose any of the momentum that we're building. But we don't have numbers yet to kind of project out what that would be in fiscal '25 yet. And then from an inorganic perspective, I think we're always being active in that space. We've got the balance sheet ready to do it. And we just continue to look for the best opportunity out there at an attractive price.\nTy Silberhorn: Yes, I think that's a good summary. Julio, I'll just add. I mean, this year, there's a large driver in a significant colder and building expansion within LSO that will put capacity in place that they can go into some of these adjacent markets that we wanted to enter and we started to hint and talk about that in November of 2021. So that was a big driver for the step-up year-over-year. I think we've commented this isn't probably a normalized run rate. But to the same point, if we see a significant opportunity that requires a meaningful investment that we think has great returns and help drive organic growth, we certainly would look at that. And then as Matt said on M&A, we're active and we have been active. I think our investors would be happy to know that we're being very disciplined in that approach. We're being very thoughtful about strategic fit, how it helps diversification and how it's accretive to our long-term financial goals.\nJulio Romero: Really appreciate all the color and detail there. And then you guys talked about seeing or towards the end of your prepared remarks, you mentioned mixed-use buildings. Just talk about are you seeing more orders for mixed-use buildings and talk about the secular growth prospects of that mixed-use category?\nTy Silberhorn: Yes, we've seen that increase. And I would say there's been a few projects that have been won in the last year where projects may -- they may have been installed for a couple of quarters in terms of award and some rework went back into those to take it from 100% office to flip it and have maybe 30%, 40%, 50% office and then bring in some residential and retail space as part of that, which got that project to go -- gave it the green light from that perspective. So I would say, yes, we've seen an uptick in mixed use. We look at that now as part of our backlog analysis. So we're looking at it in both bid and quote activity. And then certainly, we we're tracking and looking at that now as a separate category in our award activity in our backlog as well. So I think that maybe helps two things from an office standpoint. We still continue to see premium office space projects coming forward and being awarded and greenlighted. And then projects that may be on the drawing board were going to be 100% or nearly 100% office, kind of reshaping those to a mixed-use building has allowed those projects to get off the drawing board and get the green light to be executed. So both of those for us are positives and kind of fit into our sweet spot both in terms of what we're trying to do with our Glass business and the shift to premium and then it fits very well within our Services business for what they target for project types.\nJulio Romero: Really helpful. And then if I could just sneak one last one in here is just on the Glass segment. You're performing very well operationally there. Just how much more runway do you have left with mix improvements in the Glass segment for the rest of the year?\nTy Silberhorn: Well, I would start, as Matt said in his comments, I would look at this quarter as everything went great like everything that could go well in terms of mix, in terms of price, in terms of productivity, in terms of execution. So I would say this quarter is kind of a snapshot of when demand is at the right level, and we've got the highest mix, premium mix that we can get into our bookings and revenue, this is what a really great quarter would look like. As he talked to, I wouldn't put this now as a new benchmark that we don't expect that to continue at that level and certainly from a margin perspective. We reguided to that 10% to 15% in good demand markets, I think seeing them on an annualized basis, perform at the high end of that range is where we want to be. We think that allows us to maximize the profit dollars. And so we don't want to tip over here and all of a sudden get fixated on margin percentage because that business is generating very nice return on invested capital now, it's generating great income dollar growth, and we want to stay focused on making sure we're at the right price points, right margin level, right mix that we can grow those profit dollars.\nJulio Romero: Great. Thanks for taking the questions, guys.\nTy Silberhorn: Thank you, Julio.\nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Braatz with KCCA. Your line is open.\nJonathan Braatz: Good morning, everyone.\nTy Silberhorn: Good morning, Jon.\nJonathan Braatz: Ty, a question, you mentioned that as you look forward, you're going to be spend some money on organic opportunities. And I guess my question is, are we talking about maybe new products, new geographies? Specifically, what are some of the things that you might be thinking in terms of organic growth opportunities.\nTy Silberhorn: I would look at it -- if you look at our non-resi construction business, which is the bulk of our business, I would first think about new geographies. So looking at how can we expand our reach into other parts of North America. So those are areas we've looked at in the past. We wanted to make sure that we are at the right margin level and understood where we could best differentiate what's in the portfolio today. In support of that as well, we are making some capacity investments as well as some productivity investments. Those productivity investments not only help us with growth, but it can help in terms of our service and lead time capabilities, which also is a way for us to differentiate. So we've made and are making some capital investments this year that kind of give us a combination of -- that will help us on the productivity side, but they're also going to give us some stronger capabilities from a service level standpoint that we think helps us even take share in the markets that we're in. We're always introducing or working with customers from a new product perspective. But I would say right now, as we look at those, we don't see things other than the coder investment we made in Large-Scale Optical. We don't see things that are going to take a major capital investment at this point to introduce a dramatically new product offering into the market space. As we look at diversification in the portfolio and you think about adding new products that really move us into other adjacencies within in the segments we're already playing in. Acquisitions is likely a way for us to step into that.\nJonathan Braatz: Sure. Sure. When you speak about new geographies organically speaking. We're not talking about a new footprint but just expanding existing facilities and making those capital investments in current facilities as opposed to new greenfield plants?\nTy Silberhorn: It could be a combination of both, but I think you'd see us be thoughtful in how we do that. I like a real options approach. So if we think there's an untapped market that we're really missing an opportunity on, let's say, on the West Coast. How would we step into that in an optional way that gives us some presence in our ability to serve the local market before we would make major investments in terms of manufacturing, say, coding, extruding capabilities, et cetera. So as we look at those geographies, I think, we can reach some of those with some additional capacity in existing facilities, freight logistics and our ability to have short lead times will limit just how much we can do there. So even an incremental step of having a distribution center, warehouse, et cetera, there's small things we can do to make some minor investments to get a footprint in a market and then prove that out before we make some significant capital investments in equipment.\nJonathan Braatz: Okay. Sounds great. Thank you very much.\nTy Silberhorn: Thanks, Jon.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm sure there are no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO, Ty Silberhorn for closing remarks.\nTy Silberhorn: All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Another great quarter for Apogee. We couldn't be more proud of our team and the accomplishments that we've delivered to date. And as we touched on, we still see a lot of opportunities for our business as we move ahead. We look forward to talking to everyone in the next quarter. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeff Huebschen, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJeff Huebschen: Thank you, Liz. Good morning and welcome to Apogee Enterprises fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings call. With me today are Ty Silberhorn, Apogee’s Chief Executive Officer; and Matt Osberg, Chief Financial Officer. I’d like to remind everyone that there are slides to accompany today’s remarks. These are available in the Investor Relations section of Apogee’s website. During this call, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures. Definitions of these measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measures are provided in the earnings release and slide deck we issued this morning. I’d also like to remind everyone that our call will contain forward-looking statements. These reflect management’s expectations based on currently available information. Actual results may differ materially. More information about factors that could affect Apogee’s business and financial results can be found in today’s press release and in our SEC filings. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to you, Ty.\nTy Silberhorn: Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Well, Apogee's team delivered yet another strong quarter. Our strategy and strengthening operational execution continue to drive results. This morning, I'll cover highlights from the quarter, how our strategy is driving sustainable improvements in our business, and our progress on this year's priorities. Then I'll turn it over to Matt for more details on the quarter and our outlook. The first quarter was a solid start to our fiscal year, continuing the positive trends we've established over the past several quarters. We delivered top and bottom line [Technical Difficulty] sustained operating margins at 9.3% and had a strong cash flow quarter with cash from operations significantly higher than last year’s first quarter. These improved financials are underpinned by the strengthening operational execution across our businesses. We are successfully managing the things that we can control. We’re driving sustainable [Technical Difficulty] improvements through the Apogee Management System. We're maintaining a strong focus on cost management. We're improving key processes and systems across the company, and we're bringing more rigor and focus to how we are managing the business. Looking at the segments, our [Technical Difficulty]. Our glass team continued their [Technical Difficulty]. I'd more to say about transformation of our Glass business in a moment. [Technical Difficulty] and large scale optical also had solid quarters with strong execution, offset inflation, and improved sales mix as we continue to emphasize differentiated product offerings. Results in Architectural Services came in below our expectations [Technical Difficulty] to work through a transition to better position the business for long-term growth and manage lower than expected profitability [Technical Difficulty]. We remain confident in our [Technical Difficulty] potential of the business. Our Harman brand is a recognized leader in its industry with a strong market position and broad set of capabilities. As a reminder, in recent years, services has outperformed its market and we're confident we will see improved performance as we move through this fiscal year. Even with the softer than expected results and services, the first quarter was a strong start to our fiscal year, with our glass business outperforming the market due to their shift to premium and we their continued operational execution. We are well-positioned to build on our success from this quarter and increasing our full-year earnings outlook. Our improved performance continues to be driven by our three pillar strategy referenced on Slide 5 in our presentation. The performance of Architectural Glass over the past two years is a great case study of our strategy at work. Page 6 highlights the Glass segments transformation. Operating under the Viracon brand, our Glass business has long been an industry leader. We have a reputation for quality and service, deep relationships with customers and influencers and a wide range of capabilities, including proprietary products. Even with those strengths, the Glass segment had underperformed its potential. Through our strategy work, we identified two imperatives for change. We needed to build a more competitive cost structure sustaining it with productivity, and we needed to shift our focus to the premium segment of the market that recognizes the value we provide. The team has achieved tremendous success in both areas. We've driven sustainable productivity improvements through the deployment of the Apogee Management System. Our approach to lean and continuous improvement. Additionally, our facility rationalization reduced our overall cost structure without impacting our ability to serve customers in our target markets. We repositioned the business as a leader in premium solutions and we aligned the entire organization to better serve this market. This included changes to our sales organization, leveraging innovation and partnerships to deepen our product offerings, and driving improvements in quality, service, and delivery to outperform customer expectations. This shift in market focus has led a more favorable sales mix, improved pricing for the value we offer our customers, and new growth opportunities. The progress with our strategy is evident in our financial results. The team has delivered impressive margin gains and positioned the business now as an economic leader. Based on this progress, we are increasing our target margin range for Glass as shown on Slide 7. Our new target margin range is 10% to 15% on a full-year basis, compared to our previous range of 7% to 10%. It's very encouraging that this quarter, three of our four business segments delivered margin above the target ranges we set at our Investor Day, especially given that we are still early in our AMS journey. As we move through fiscal 2024, our strategic framework positions us for further progress toward our financial targets, and positions us to outperform throughout the market cycle. While overall non-residential construction activity remains healthy today, there are reasons for a somewhat cautious view of the market as we move forward. Higher interest rates, along with overall economic uncertainty may impact construction activity for at least some period. However, through our team's efforts, we are transforming Apogee into a higher performing, more resilient company. I'm confident that we would drive further performance gains as the year progresses. Page 8 outlines our priorities for the fiscal year, which we introduced last quarter, and this is where we will continue to focus for the remainder of the year. Our entire team is aligned on driving further progress to advance our strategy and to deliver continued [Technical Difficulty]. Now, I'd like to introduce Matt Osberg. Matt joined us in late April, and I'm very excited to have him as part of the team. He brings terrific experiences and perspectives, and he's established a strong record of creating value throughout his career. Let me turn it over to Matt to provide more details on the quarter and our outlook.\nMatt Osberg: Thanks, Ty, and good morning, everyone. I'm very excited to be part of the Apogee team and the opportunities we have as a company to continue to drive shareholder value. I look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming quarters.  Before I review the results for the first quarter and our updated fiscal 2024 outlook, I want to take the chance to recognize Mark Augdahl, for the work he did in the Interim CFO role. Mark did a fantastic job leading the company through a time of transition and he has been extremely valuable to me as I have onboarded with the company. Great job Mark and thank you. Now turning to our results for the quarter. The first quarter was a strong start to our fiscal year, building on the momentum established last year. Consolidated net sales grew 1.4% to $361.7 million. The increased sales were primarily driven by strong growth in Glass, which was up 27.5%, compared to the prior year. As expected, this was [partly offset] [ph] by a net sales decline of 13.5% in services, [14%] [ph] in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Consolidated operating income increased 1.7%, primarily driven by strong sales and margin improvement in Glass. The Glass segment's operating margin was 17%, over a 10 percentage point improvement, compared to the first quarter of last year and reflects the impact not only of higher volume, but also benefits from pricing and mix as we execute our strategic shift to emphasize premium high performance products. This result also demonstrates the significant operational progress that has been made with our initial deployment [in AMS] [ph]. At a consolidated level, the Glass margin improvement was offset primarily by segment margin declines in framing and services. As a reminder, in the first quarter of last year, framing had an approximately $4 million benefit related to the timing of pricing actions and inventory flows. Last spring, as aluminum prices spiked, we were able to realize the benefit of higher selling prices as we work through lower cost aluminum inventory. Setting aside this benefit, the framing operating margin this quarter was roughly in-line with the prior year. Services had an operating loss of $0.6 million, primarily due to lower estimated profitability levels on a [selected number] [ph] of projects that are nearing completion, the impact of lower project volume, and approximately $1 million of severance costs as we continue to execute our strategic transition in the services business. As Ty mentioned, we remain confident in the services long-term potential and expect the operating performance trend to improve as the year goes on. Diluted EPS grew 5% to $1.05, primarily driven by higher operating income, a lower effective tax rate, and a lower diluted share count, which reflects the benefit of our share repurchase activity. This was partially offset by higher interest expense, primarily due to higher interest rates. Our tax rate in the quarter was 25%, roughly in-line with our long-term rate assumption [Technical Difficulty]. Turning to our cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated $21.3 million [Technical Difficulty] improvement of $52 million over the first quarter of last year. This was primarily driven by improved [Technical Difficulty] quarter of last year had unfavorable working capital impacts related to sales growth and inflation. [Technical Difficulty] typically our lowest quarter for cash flow [Technical Difficulty] capital expenditures of $7.4 million in the first quarter, primarily relating to investments to expand capacity in our higher margin businesses, enhance productivity through automation, and deploy improved systems to better support our business. We also returned over $10 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and [Technical Difficulty] balance sheet remains very strong with net leverage ratio, the one-time trailing 12-month EBITDA, and no significant debt maturities until 2027. Looking at backlog trends for the quarter, backlog for framing was $221 million, compared to $243 million in fourth quarter of last year. Several factors are impacting framing backlog. First, we've improved service levels for our short lead time products, so we are converting backlog into sales more quickly.  Second, as a part of our strategic shift, we continue to move away from lower margin sales that we would have pursued in the past. Finally, we continue to see choppiness in bidding and award activity. Services finished the quarter with $709 million in backlog. This was a slight sequential decline compared to the fourth quarter of last year, but 4% higher than the first quarter of prior year. Turning to our updated fiscal year outlook. We are pleased to be able to increase our full-year diluted EPS outlook to a range of $4.15 to $4.45, primarily reflecting our strong first quarter results and an improved outlook for our second quarter. This updated outlook [Technical Difficulty] at the bottom of the range of approximately 4% and EPS growth at the top of the range of approximately 12%, compared to last year's EPS of $3.98. Our outlook includes our continued expectation of net sales for the year to be flat to slightly down, reflecting lower volumes and services and framing, partially offset by growth in Glass. Also, our outlook range contemplates the latest market forecast, which point to a potential slowdown in non-residential construction in the second half of our fiscal year. Despite our sales outlook, we expect to drive EPS growth through expanded operating margins. Although the 17% operating margin in Glass this quarter is likely not sustainable for the full-year, we are increasing our margin expectations for Glass to be in the 10% to 15% range for the year, which is well above last year's level. Services margins should improve as we move through the year, but are expected to fall short of their 7% to 9% target range. Although framing margins are projected to decline compared to prior year, we expect margins near the top of its 9% to 12% range. Finally, we expect LSO margins to be slightly down, compared to last year. We continue to expect an average tax rate of approximately 24.5% and full-year capital expenditures of $50 million to $60 million. We also expect both operating and free cash flow growth for the year. As a reminder, fiscal 2024 is a 53-week year with an extra week of operations in the fourth quarter. For the full-year, the extra week will add approximately 2 percentage points of growth to revenue. In closing, I am pleased with our first quarter performance and ability to raise our outlook for the year. Advancing our strategic objectives is driving improved profitability even in a year with sales growth headwinds. This improved profitability will position us to better outperform throughout the market cycle. Additionally our strong cash flow and low leverage position are enabling us to deploy capital to invest in our business and return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We also continue to look for accretive acquisition opportunities that would accelerate our growth and profitability. I'm glad to be part of the Apogee organization and excited to contribute to the work the team is doing to drive value for all our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to Ty for some concluding remarks.\nTy Silberhorn: Thanks, Matt. To wrap up, I want to reiterate how proud I am of the team for delivering another strong quarter and a great start to our fiscal year. We continue to make progress advancing our strategy and improving operational execution. I'm particularly happy with the performance of our Glass segment and our increased long-term outlook for that business. Through our team's efforts across all of Apogee, we are well-positioned to continue our progress in the coming quarters. With that, we are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Moore with CJS Securities.\nChris Moore: Hey, good morning, guys. I'm not – the line cutting in out a little bit, but hopefully you can hear me.\nTy Silberhorn: We hear you, Chris. Good morning.\nChris Moore: All right. Terrific. Good morning. Yeah. Maybe we could just start with Glass. Obviously, you know, revenue and margin is way above what we were expecting as highest Glass revenue since, I think, Q4 2020. I get that, you know, kind of the better mix and pricing, but you also, Ty talked about, you know, more growth opportunities, and maybe you could just expand on that a little bit?\nTy Silberhorn: I think as we've repositioned that business, Chris, with that focus on the premium side of the market, it's gotten that business back to really focusing on where they can differentiate from a competitive standpoint. So, if you look at it from a top and volume level. There's volume growth obviously in that, but what it's allowing them to do is sell higher value added product offerings, which obviously as a result of that they're able to command a higher price per square foot for those products. And they see the opportunity to build on that throughout the rest of the year. So, they're getting a benefit of a volume lift as they focused in on parts of the market where that story holds up better from a differentiation standpoint, and they're able to sell things at a higher price, as well as sell things with [additional higher] [ph] value add propositions in those product offerings for them to not only get the prices accordingly, but also that helps us with our margin performance. Layering on top of that from a productivity standpoint, the team has done exceptionally well.  And if you'll recall, we said as we closed out last year, it's going to be harder to take the big giant steps forward on the productivity side to drive that margin and we would need to see the mix shift come through. We're seeing that mix shift coming through and that looks good as we look out for the rest of the year.\nChris Moore: Got it. No, that's helpful. I mean, how do you think about the total addressable market in Glass currently versus are, you know, maybe a couple years ago? Is it significantly smaller and you're just going to get a bigger share of it or just any thoughts there?\nTy Silberhorn: Well, I think from a broader market perspective, non resi construction continues to hold up. I mean, obviously, there's talk and there's concerns about how that plays out as calendar 2023 closes out and we get into calendar 2024. And when we worked through our strategic plan, we didn't want the teams to talk about their market opportunity by going down smaller and smaller and defining smaller pieces of the market. We actually wanted them to continue to look at the broad market, but then point their energy and efforts to where they could capture the most value. So, we would still define it as we're playing in that larger, broader market from a Glass glazing opportunity. However, we're being much more focused and selective about what we go after. So, we've got solid growth, top, as well as volume growth this quarter. They're positioned to do that in terms of the volume growth. And top line growth through the year. And I would say, they're outperforming the market on from a growth perspective right now, but they're doing it in a segment of the market where we can capture the value.\nChris Moore: Got it. That's very helpful. Maybe just one last one for me. On the challenges on services, so you know, you called out the impact of lower estimated profitability on certain projects. And I think that the comment was most of those will be running off in fiscal 2024, is that a fair way to look at it?\nTy Silberhorn: Yes. Remember, we had this combination of two things. So, Sotawall has been integrated into that business now. So, everything's operating under the Harmon brand. We knew our fiscal 2024 was going to be a challenge because these are jobs won in calendar 2020 and 2021. So, there was lower volume available to win, on top of margins were squeezed, then layer in some of the Sotawall projects that we are running through this fiscal year, those get behind us. And then a few of those Harmon jobs that we had in Q4 and we had a handful in Q1. We've had to take some write-downs on those projects just with how they're performing. And because those were one in calendar 2020 and 2021, they were already tight on margins. So, as we look at the quarter, it performed, I would say, a little worse than we expected. But remember, services, kind of their Q1’s their low point, they go up from there. So, we do see that that we do have confidence that trend will occur that will see improvements in Q2 and then as we move forward through the year.\nChris Moore: Very helpful. Thanks guys. I'll jump back in line.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Stine with Craig Hallum.\nEric Stine: Hi, Ty. Hi, Matt. Can you hear me? Lines breaking up.\nTy Silberhorn: Good morning, Eric.\nEric Stine: Okay. Good morning. I guess I'll go a little bit more high level here, maybe obviously execution, especially in Glass has been great. But when you think about what the market looks like as you mentioned some uncertainty here second half of this year and into next year, I mean, what do you see as the biggest headwind? I mean, is it and maybe it's a combination of all of them, but interest rates, lending standards, I'd love your thoughts on, kind of the shift, the work from home shift, which seems like it's going to stay in place. I mean, just, how do you kind of judge all of those factors as you look forward?\nTy Silberhorn: Well, Eric, I would say as we've looked out at that, it's the same that you're hearing in the broader market discussions. I think interest rates, as well as lending is going to have some impact on non-resi construction, how that plays out or exactly when that occurs. I mean, we continue to see choppiness. We've had a few quarters in a row now where we just see a lot of choppiness and bid in award activity. So, that's why as we've looked at this and said, hey, we're rolling up our guidance for the year, but we're still trying to be cautious about the back half. And that's reflected in our guidance. When you look at our shorter cycle business, we've pointed to the fact we think framing will now be down on a year-over-year basis from a revenue perspective. There's – I would say, two factors to think about for framing. Number 1, last year, they came in building backlog and that is a – over 60% business is quick turn. So, building backlog for them was actually negative. It means our service levels were dropping and our lead times were pushing out. That was typical for the industry at that point in time. So, they did have some tougher comps I would say on top line in their Q2 and Q3 because that's when they finally started catching up and [started to work that backlog down] [ph]. And then we're reflecting that while we continue to see choppiness, I would say, it's gotten a little bit choppier in our visibility there we think now that that business will probably be slowing and which is why we've said that we expect it to now have a year-over-year decline in revenues.\nEric Stine: Got it. And maybe one other thing is, seeing more talk of, kind of the market non-res, splitting into a little bit from the standpoint of public sector quite strong, lots of investment there for obvious reasons, but private sector, again challenging for the reasons you just discussed. So, maybe thoughts on that dynamic and how it – how that would apply to your backlog? So, maybe current state of your backlog mix, that sort of thing?\nTy Silberhorn: Yes. Well, so while there was sequential small drop, year-over-year we're still up. And if you look at the services backlog, it's still very strong near record highs. We have been working to diversify our mix since we launched our strategic plan two years ago, and that is showing up in that backlog. We don't present or share that specific data. I think I'd commented a couple of times now in these quarterly calls, our percent of office in our backlog, whether you look at our services business or our Glass business, it's down significantly. That's a reflection, yes, that market is softer, although we do continue to see owner occupied Class A office space. We still are seeing projects be let and awarded and go given the green light. But that has been an effort to diversify our mix, knowing there's a question over what's the sustainability for our office being a driver for non-res construction. So, the teams have been working to specifically target other areas in healthcare, institutional, transportation, so airport terminals has been a heavy focus, which has government funding behind it for both Glass and Services. And it is showing up in that backlog mix.\nEric Stine: Got it. That's helpful. Maybe last one for me, I'll just sneak it in. I know you've talked about kind of taking the portfolio approach on the M&A and certainly as continue to make progress on some of the operational initiatives and feeling more and more confident there, maybe just an update on not that process, whether there are some things you feel like you can fill in or just how we should think about that?\nTy Silberhorn: Yes. I mean, as we've said, that is part of our growth levers. It will be a meaningful growth lever for us as we move forward. So, we want to grow organically, obviously. with the right mix. Inorganic is the way that we will obviously drive accelerated growth. So, we put the processes in place. We have the team in place. We have active pipeline from an M&A perspective. So, part of that active portfolio management, that is a regular part of our operating rhythm. So…\nEric Stine: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Julio Romero with Sidoti.\nJulio Romero: Great. Thanks. Good morning Ty, and welcome Matt. I appreciate the segment commentary regarding the outlook. You guys said regarding Glass that 17% is likely not sustainable, but should still end up in that 10% to 15% range for the year. Just can you speak to maybe how the Glass margin trends over the next few quarters? Do you maybe expect more of a stronger margin in the second quarter? And then relative – maybe a [glide down] [ph] sequentially in the third or fourth, just talk about how that Glass margin should trend?\nMatt Osberg: Yes. Thanks, Julio. Appreciate the question and happy to be talking to everybody this morning. So, as you think about our outlook and just, kind of, I know you asked specifically on Glass, but think about it from kind of the top, right? And we talked about our ability to raise our outlook for the year, primarily based on the performance we had in our first quarter and some of our increased expectations in Q2. So, I would say that a lot of that increased confidence in the second quarter is going to be driven by Glass. And so as you think about how that would phase-out. I think we've seen probably a high point for the year in the first quarter, but we'll still see I think some strength in Q2 and then that continuing to maybe normalize throughout the back half of the year and get into that range that we talked about.\nJulio Romero: Got it. That's very helpful. And then just thinking about the cash flow in the first quarter was pretty strong. Just talk to the expectations for cash flow for fiscal 2024?\nMatt Osberg: Yes. You probably heard in my script, we talked about operating cash flow and free cash flow growth for the year. The big improvement we had in Q1 was primarily driven by, I would say, unusual activity in working capital in the first quarter of last year. So, we're very pleased to have the improvement that we did in Q1 on its own with a strong cash flow start to the year and we expect to be able to continue to deliver cash flow throughout the quarters. Remember, we said this is usually the lowest cash flow quarter for the year. So, you do expect sequential improvement as we move through the year from where we are in Q1 and getting to a place where we have good cash flow for the year and we've got growth both in operating and free cash flow for the year.\nJulio Romero: Really helpful. I'll pass it on. Thanks.\nTy Silberhorn : Thanks, Julio.\nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Ty Silberhorn for closing remarks.\nTy Silberhorn: All right. Well, again, I would like to recognize the strong efforts of our team in delivering a great start to the year and our ability to build on that. So, we're excited to share that progress with you as we go through the next few quarters. Thanks for joining us today. And I hope everyone has a great weekend.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
