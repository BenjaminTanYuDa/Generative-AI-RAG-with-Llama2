The Corporation does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement it makes. And at this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Chad Prashad, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nChad Prashad: Good morning, and thank you for joining our Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Earnings Call. Before we open up to questions, there are few areas I'd like to highlight. Earlier this year, we signaled a tightening of credit and slower portfolio growth pace for this year. Our new customer loan volume increased about 22% sequentially this quarter from the prior quarter and about 56% compared to last year's third quarter. But the percent of new customers relative to our customer base was around 30% lower than the prior normal third quarters, especially pre-COVID. Our credit quality performance continues to improve and remain near historical norms or even higher. While our approval and booking rates have improved significantly from our low in August of this year, through the end of this calendar year, our first pay defaults remain at or below historical norms. New loan application volume increased around 30% this quarter when compared to last third quarter. The earlier stat that I mentioned on the resulting loan comparison was a 56% increase of new customer loan volume for the same quarter. New applications increased only 1% sequentially over the prior quarter, second quarter compared to the third quarter, as we shifted marketing and underwriting strategies that resulted in higher approval and booking rates, which earlier I shared is a 22% increase in booked new customer lines sequentially. And those new customers continue to perform well with first pay default rates that are significantly better than fiscal year 2022 and in line with last year and our pre-COVID comparisons. Further, our overall new customer application volume has increased back to within 1% of our pre-COVID application volumes after increasing over 30% in the third quarter when compared to last year's third quarter. We believe we have been able to successfully increase our approval rates without sacrificing credit quality or yields and are focused on continually improving in both our underwriting and marketing strategies. Return of former customers increased around 6% sequentially in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and 17% compared to last year's third quarter. And the percent of former customers relative to the customer base continues to be higher than the prior normal comparable periods, especially pre-COVID. For new customers and the whole portfolio, our yields continue to improve. This is a result of improved gross yields and reduced delinquency. While we are pleased with our current progress in delinquency improvement and the trending of the underlying portfolio, we believe there is still room for improvement in the current and upcoming quarters. With the expectations of economic stability increasing and the decreasing likelihood of major unemployment impacts, management continues to accrue for the long-term incentive plan with vesting tiers of $16.35 and $20.45 earnings per share due to the much-improved credit quality, yields, and operating conditions. Finally, I'd like to thank all of our wonderful team members who have helped so many customers from our communities during the calendar year of 2023, helping to establish and rebuild credit as well as meeting immediate financial needs. We have an absolutely amazing team and I'm very grateful for their commitment to their customers and to each other. At this time, Johnny Calmes, our Chief Financial and Strategy Officer and I would like to open up to any questions you have. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from John Rowan with Janney. Please go ahead.\nJohn Rowan: Good morning, guys.\nChad Prashad: Good morning.\nJohn Rowan: So I just want to understand what change in assumptions drove the $10 million provision release. Obviously, you did -- you talked about lower loss assumptions going forward, but what is the loss assumption that's included in that $10 million reserve release? And what economic factor change drove that assumption?\nJohnny Calmes: Yeah. So you kind of broke up there, right? So the biggest piece that's driving the reduction in that for the quarter is, December is, like seasonally is our lowest risk quarter of the year, right? So just due to the fact that obviously our customer base will sort of have windfall cash receipts in the fourth quarter. So historically that drives down both delinquency and charge-offs in the fourth quarter. And that's something we seasonally see every year. So there is a seasonal adjustment that happens in the fiscal third quarter. The opposite adjustment happened in the fiscal first quarter, right? So there was a substantial increase in the expected loss rates for seasonality that happened in Q1. So this is just sort of the release of that because, again, our customer base and portfolio is its least risky that December.\nJohn Rowan: But I mean, I guess I just don't understand, maybe I'm just wrong, but I mean, wouldn't lifetime loss accounting kind of negate seasonal trends in the reserve level?\nJohnny Calmes: No, there's still a seasonality factor that goes into the CECL, right? So at a point in time, right? So you're trying to assess the expected losses at a point in time still, right? So those point in time expected losses will change based on seasonality.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. And you said that you're still accruing for $16.35 and $20.45, correct, the hurdles? What years -- what fiscal year are those two in?\nChad Prashad: That's by the end of fiscal year 2025.\nJohn Rowan: But -- so they're both at fiscal 2024. So you're accruing that you're going to basically get to $20.45 by fiscal 2025, is that correct? Because obviously, if you're accruing for $16.45, you're certainly accruing -- for $20.45, you're certainly accruing for $16.35?\nJohnny Calmes: Correct.\nChad Prashad: That's right.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Vincent Caintic with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nVincent Caintic: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, actually a follow-up just on that seasonality. Any different expectations with tax refund season this year and how that will shape up versus last year? Hearing different views about whether or not -- whether to expect more or less tax refunds for the consumer this year versus last year. Thank you.\nChad Prashad: Yeah. Good morning, Vincent. For us right now, while we've started filing taxes, it's still too early for us to tell what the impact is going to be for our average customer base, if it's going to be a higher or lower return from that perspective. From a runoff perspective, so typically in the fourth quarter, as our customers receive tax refunds, they tend to pay down their loans. It kind of remains to be seen what that may look like this year. Our portfolio is substantially different this year entering the fourth quarter than it has been in prior fourth quarters. We have substantially more tenured customers with us and less new customers with us. So that may have an impact to the runoff rate. But in terms of how the tax season is itself for our customer base, it's still too early to tell.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. Understood. Thank you. And then -- so very helpful prepared remarks, details on the evolving and the tightening credit and resulting improving metrics. Just wondering if this quarter's metrics are sort of a good run rate to think about going forward. Or maybe said another way, like once the entire portfolio has the metrics of your current underwriting, like, what does that look like in terms of the yields that you're charging, the net charge-offs that you're targeting and so forth? Just trying to basically get a sense of maybe what fiscal 2025 loan metrics look like.\nChad Prashad: Vincent, so on our end, it sounds like you cut out in the middle of your question there, but from what I heard, you're asking about what the credit quality and kind of performance of the new customers look like and what the impact of the overall yields would be?\nVincent Caintic: Yes, please. Yes, thank you.\nChad Prashad: Great question. So for the last 1.5 year or so, we've been tightening credit a fair amount pretty aggressively to begin with, and our loan volumes certainly suffered because of that. But over that time period, a couple of things have happened. One, as those new customers have kind of aged into a portfolio, it's had an impact to the overall portfolio. Two, some of those underwriting strategies for new customers have also been applied to the rest of the portfolio book as well. So that has a greater impact on the overall portfolio. And then three, we've increased confidence in how we've been underwriting. We've increased our approval rates pretty substantially over the last two or three quarters especially, and we haven't seen any reduction in credit quality there. So all that to say, going forward, I wouldn't treat this as a high point in terms of credit quality. I would treat this as sort of the norm going forward. And then in terms of the overall portfolio, we mentioned this about two years ago, that it would take a lot of time for these changes to impact overall portfolio. And you're beginning to really see that in terms of the portfolio gross yields this quarter increasing pretty substantially year-over-year, and we'll continue to see that for some time as well.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. Thank you. And then last one for me. We've been hearing about maybe macro improvement, maybe soft landing, and certainly, you talk about increasing approval rates and you're not seeing -- you’re getting more comfortable with your underwriting, not seeing reduction in credit quality. Is there a point -- is there a macro trend or maybe it just takes a little bit of time before you feel really comfortable in leaning in, and we can see the portfolio significantly grow? Just wondering what you're looking at before we see significant portfolio growth. Thank you.\nChad Prashad: Yeah, I would say we're very conservative in how we look at the macroeconomic picture. We began tightening in April 2021. Personally, I expected a rather tight and quick change to the economy, which obviously didn't come for another year, year and half, and it was much slower than I expected. So in terms of loosening up, we have loosened up where we have seen prudent over the last couple of quarters. Again, our approval rates are up pretty substantially. But in terms of loosening up for growth, we're not in a position at all where we are considering loosening up and reducing credit quality, or in any way sacrificing credit quality for growth. The opposite is actually pretty true, where we have spent a lot of time making sure, from a marketing perspective, an underwriting perspective, we can drive applications and approve applications that are within the acceptable credit box. So going forward, that will continue to be one of our main focuses is to grow the business, kind of move out of this, wait and see, and be very conservative growth approach into a more aggressive approach from a growth perspective, but still very prudent and conservative on the credit side.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks very much.\nChad Prashad: Thanks, Vincent.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Prashad for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nChad Prashad: Thank you all for taking the time to join us today. And this concludes the third quarter earnings call for World Acceptance Corporation.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

The corporation does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements it makes. At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chad Prashad, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nChad Prashad: Good morning, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. Before we open up to questions, there are a few areas that I'd like to highlight. In fiscal year 2023, we tightened underwriting as economic uncertainty and inflation concerns were increasing. For the remainder of 2023 and into early 2024, we weathered delinquency normalization after a period of very low delinquency, mostly induced by economic stimulus, followed by extraordinary portfolio growth. This year, we continue to see lower and normalizing delinquency rates in our portfolio and increasing yields and expect these trends to continue for several more months. These outcomes are primarily due to adjustments to our operational efficiencies, marketing and underwriting as well as an overall heightened focus on credit quality and yields that we've discussed in prior earnings calls. We continue to see economic uncertainties and potential impacts to both customer cash flow and their credit histories, both positive and negative on the horizon as potential outcomes for our customer base. Therefore, we cautiously have been increasing approval and booking rates for our best applicants and continue to explore ways to profitably serve more of our applicants. Today, our approval and booking rates while higher than this time last year, remain low compared to historical norms. During the second quarter, our customer base continued to grow and the number of new loan originations remained stable versus the prior quarter and increased by over a third compared to the same quarter last year. The number of new customers each quarter as a percentage of our customer base continues to increase, and we are returning closer to our historical normal growth rate. The number of former or return customer originations also increased to be slightly above historical volumes. That's as a percent of the customer base and has increased both nominally and relatively compared to the second quarter of last year. This growth is important as our overall average loan balance continues to be right-sized as we've discussed with the portfolio risk and yield. All originations made this quarter have approximately a 10% lower balance year-over-year, and the average current balance outstanding has declined around 4%. While economic uncertainties still exist, management continues to accrue for a long-term incentive plan with vesting tiers of $16.35 and $20.45 earnings per share. We were no longer accruing for the $25.30 stretch EPS target, primarily due to reduced new customer investment, which would hinder overall potential growth for this fiscal year. That growth or lack of growth reduces the earnings power for the next fiscal year. We believe this move is prudent for the long-term health of the company as credit risk and economic uncertainty are likely to persist for some time and our new customer investment remains tempered and focused on the highest credit quality. We continue to see stabilizing and improving credit quality yields and operational conditions as we looked forward and accrue for the $20 and 45% EPS target for fiscal year 2025. At this time, Johnny Calmes, our Chief Financial and Strategy Officer, and I would like to open up to any questions you have.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Vincent Caintic with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nVincent Caintic: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First one on the pullback of the $25 by fiscal 2025 EPS. Just wondering if that will drive any changes to how you're thinking about operating the business? I know there was a couple of variables you were looking at in order to achieve that 2025 EPS. And just wondering what – if there's any change at all and how you're thinking of driving the business with that focus out of the way?\nChad Prashad: No. I think the big change that happened is we - we're just kind of pattern where we're going to be tighter for longer, right? So we were hopeful that we could see some improvement in new customer performance and start to loosen some of our underwriting, which would allow for higher growth. We just haven't gotten to that point yet. And as a result, we won't see the growth that we'll need for this year and potentially next year, that would have allowed us to hit that higher EPS. But everything else still remains the same.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess, relatedly, the $20 EPS target. Is there anything that needs to change from the conditions in the current environment to get there? Or basically, what need to happen to get to the $20 EPS? Thank you.\nChad Prashad: Yes, nothing needs to change significantly to get to the $20, right? I mean, we need to – credit quality to maintain the current levels. So obviously, if something were to change in the macro environment drastically, if unemployment rates were to spike or something like that, that would obviously make it difficult to hit the $20. But I think we have things in place now that would allow us to hit that $20 next year.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. Thank you. And I guess one last one for me, and I'll hop off. So we've seen the portfolio shrinking rightsizing recently, but it sounds like you have kind of encouraging signals in delinquencies and other underwriting seems to be taking hold. Just wondering if we should be expecting the portfolio to start to grow again? Or what your sense is in terms of portfolio balances going forward? Thank you.\nChad Prashad: Yes. I think we'll continue to see some mild portfolio growth. We're not forecasting or shooting towards portfolio growth we've seen in the past year or two. Certainly more muted and certainly focused on much higher credit quality. We do expect that the average balances will continue to decline. We've been working on that for about a year now. So we're seeing that come through for the whole overall portfolio and not just for new customers. In conjunction with that, you're beginning to see with those lower balances, also having higher yields, you're beginning to see the overall portfolio yields increase over the last two quarters as well. So we would anticipate seeing that continue throughout the rest of this year.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is from John Rowan with Janney. Please go ahead.\nJohn Rowan: Good morning.\nChad Prashad: Good morning.\nJohn Rowan: As far as like ongoing personnel expenses, obviously, there was a $5-ish million reversal of prior accrued expense. That's not an ongoing reduction to that line item, correct? Because that's an accrual from – that's a reversal of prior accruals, correct?\nChad Prashad: It is, but it will also reduce the expense going forward, right, because we're no longer accruing for that tranche.\nJohn Rowan: But not the $5 million less per quarter, right?\nChad Prashad: No, no.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. Any plans for repurchases? Or was there any change? I know you've got – you basically renegotiated your credit facility. Was there – any change in repurchase authorization? When will you look to start it up again, if you can?\nJohn Calmes: Yes. So the current credit agreement allows for repurchases once the fixed charge coverage ratio gets back to 2, 2 to 1, and we're just shy of that this quarter, but we should be there by the end of next quarter, and that will allow for repurchases starting in fiscal Q4.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. And then I think you touched on it before, but I was trying to calculate something while you said it. The seasonality in the loan portfolio, obviously, typically loans go up and in the December quarter, down in the March quarter. But loans also usually typically go up from June to September. So I'm just trying to parse out if the credit tightening and what we're seeing is what's a little bit of an abnormal sequential decline here in the September quarter. Like how that affects going forward? Are loans going to go up next quarter and then down in March? Like how should we think about that?\nJohn Calmes: Yes. No, I think we would expect the same seasonality. Typically, the September quarter, we do show some growth, obviously, not to the same level as we show in the December quarter historically. We still expect to see that growth in the December quarter. But yes, the big change versus the history is we are still substantially tighter on new customer originations than we have ever been. We're still seeing very strong application flow, but we've reduced our approval rates substantially.\nChad Prashad: Yes, I think it's important to point out that during the last quarter, we actually did grow our customer base and number of accounts, but the average balance is lower. So the overall portfolio size is lower. So - and it's something we've mentioned before in rightsizing the loan sizes also helped us increase the overall yield. And it's important to do that in conjunction with the overall credit quality as well.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. And then just one bigger question. Obviously, you've been in the highest tier accrual for next year, just looking the consensus estimates in mind too. I mean, we're nowhere near before this, we're nowhere near where you would need to accrue even for the $20.45. John, we've talked about in the past, needing to get to a high single-digit or high single digit, maybe low double-digit type charge-off rate. We're obviously not near there now, although you obviously have improved credit quality. I just – I'm curious about your comment earlier, how you said we have the pieces in place now to reach $20.45 next year. I'm paraphrasing a little bit versus what you said. Obviously, the goals have been changed from the mid-20s to $20.45. I don't think that you hit even the lower number with the 16% charge-off rate? I'm just trying to figure out what are the pieces in place that nothing really material needs to change for you to get to $20.45 next year when obviously, the run rate of earnings $2.71, which I mean even includes a big reversal in it. I mean not gigantic, but a big reversal. How do we get there because that run rate is nowhere near $20.45, but yet you're saying nothing material needs to change for us to get to that number? I'm just – I'm having trouble marrying those comments together.\nJohn Calmes: Yes. So we expect to – we see the credit quality of the portfolio continuing to improve, right? So as we move forward, two things should continue to happen. One, we expect the credit quality absent of any other macro events should continue to improve on the existing portfolio, right? And the loans that – the new customers that we are adding are performing at a much higher level from a credit quality standpoint and have much healthier yields, right? So as we move forward, and it will take – to get to the $20 EPS will take some growth, right, over the next 18 months. And we expect that to happen, right? We expect at some point over the next 18 months, there will be more clarity with where the economy is going and hopefully be able to start losing a little bit, right? But so with that, you'll have higher – better performance on the new customers at higher yields. And we expect the credit quality of the existing portfolio to continue to trend better.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. I was a little confused just with the comment you said that we kind of have – nothing major needs to change from now to get to there. But it's not – nothing major needs to change from what we reported this quarter, but we have to continue certain trends. Am I interpreting that correctly?\nJohn Calmes: Right. Yes.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. All right, that's it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Prashad for any closing remarks.\nChad Prashad: Thank you for taking the time to join us today. And this concludes our second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call for World Acceptance Corporation.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

At this time, it is my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Chad Prashad, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.\nChad Prashad: Good morning, and thank you for joining our fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings call. Before we open it up to questions, there are a few areas that I'd like to highlight. Last year, we instituted a number of adjustments that we believe would have a significant impact on our business and have been quite pleased with the results. As we discussed during prior earnings calls, we tightened underwriting about 1.5 years ago as economic uncertainty and inflation concerns were increasing. We have weathered a period of delinquency normalization after a period of extraordinary portfolio growth as well as higher-than-expected delinquency and losses throughout most of our last fiscal year. Today, we continue to see lower and normalizing delinquency rates in our portfolio as well as increasing yields and expect this trend to continue for several more months. This is primarily due to many operations adjustments, including a heightened focus on credit quality and yields as we previously discussed. We're also very consciously increasing approval rates to new customers as we still see the potential of this uncertain economic environment to impact our customers in the coming year. During the first quarter, our customer base grew more than the prior three years, both in nominal and relative terms. New loan originations by number increased dramatically over the prior year quarter -- over the prior quarter, excuse me, by 47% and are returning to a normal way as a percentage of the customer base. Return customer originations also increased dramatically around 76% over the previous quarter and exceeded the first quarter of last year as well, thanks to an increased focus by our marketing and operations teams. All these outcomes are an especially great team accomplishment, and we consider the reports of increasing delinquency rates across several credit industries during both the calendar year of 2022 as well as the first half of 2023. While economic uncertainty still exists, management continues to accrue for a long-term incentive plan with vesting tiers of $16.35, $20.45 and $25.30 per share due to much improved credit quality, yields and operating conditions. We anticipate the first tier vesting as early as the end of this fiscal year assuming credit quality and performance remains stable and unemployment remains low. We're pleased to begin our fiscal year 2024 from a position of portfolio and capital strength. At this time, Johnny Calmes, our Chief Financial and Strategy Officer, and I would like to open up to any questions you have.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Rowan of Janney. Go ahead.\nJohn Rowan: Just on the accrual, can you repeat the accrual numbers again that you just gave? And also, you had been accruing -- assuming that you get to the full -- the highest hurdle, but there was a reduction in incentive compensation in the quarter. Was there any type of accrual reversal? And are you still accruing assuming that you reach the highest the $25.40 vesting hurdle?\nChad Prashad: Sure. So, the tiers that we're accruing towards on an EPS basis are $16.35, $20.45 and $25.30, and those -- we have been accruing for those over the last four-plus fiscal years and we have not reversed any of the accruals on any of those tiers.\nJohnny Calmes: Right, we haven't reversing expense. Over the period, we have shifted our expectations on when we may hit those, which will have can have an impact of changing the quarterly expense on those. But at the same time, it depends on what period you're comparing it to, it's great investing. So over time, the compensation expense will decrease as some of those tranches become fully invested and we're no longer expensing.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. So, I was just trying to figure out, there was a reduction in incentive compensation for the quarter. If that wasn't a reversal, is this level of compensation expense or correct run rate? I'm trying to figure out if there was a reversal and it pops back up or this is the correct run rate.\nJohnny Calmes: I got you. Yes. So if you're comparing Q1 over Q1, a lot of the reason for that decrease would be the great investing, right? So that run rate will be appropriate, at least through the second quarter of this year. And then it will decrease again because we have the time-based vesting will happen in October, right? So that will be no tranche is fully invested. So then the run rate will decrease again for Q3 and Q4 of this year.\nChad Prashad: And John, I believe it's been a few years that we released a great investing schedule. We'll have to go back and look, it's been probably three or four years since we released that.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. And then just to switch gears a little bit. Obviously, you renegotiated the credit facility. There was no change in rate on that facility, correct? It's still the same. I mean it -- whatever the spread is over so far, that's still the same spread?\nJohnny Calmes: That's correct. Yes.\nJohn Rowan: Was there one lender taken out because there were some shifts in it? I showed that there was a lender put in, but did anyone fall out of the facility?\nJohnny Calmes: Yes. So, there were two banks that needed to come out for different reasons, and as we had two banks that came out and one bank that came in.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. And then I guess just maybe one last question. I probably should have bunch before we went into the next question. But you've kind of given some numbers in the past. I mean, what is it, the 2530 is effectively the number for fiscal 2025 based on the compensation plans. We talked probably a couple of quarters ago about what kind of loss rate you needed to see to get there? Obviously, you're at like 16% this quarter or 16% to change. You still need to be materially lower than that. I think you had given kind of a high single-digit, low double-digit type number. Is that still what you're targeting to get to the EPS hurdles?\nJohnny Calmes: That's right. Yes. So, we -- the charge-off rate has improved substantially, but we still see room for improvement going forward.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. And just to be clear, the $25.30, that's the 2025 figure because you mentioned changing the time frame at some point. That's still 2025, right?\nJohnny Calmes: That's correct.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Vincent Caintic of Stephens. Go ahead.\nVincent Caintic: Just wanted to expand on John's line of questioning and maybe just pull up a little bit. So, the fiscal 2025 EPS target at $25.30. Just wondering, if you could walk through the bigger drivers and how to get there since we're $1.62 this quarter? So, it would be a material increase in run rate EPS. You spoke a little bit just now about the charge-offs, but any other kind of key components to get from here in first quarter of '24 to get to that run rate for the full year 2025?\nJohnny Calmes: Yes, sure. So I'll say one of the most important components at this point will be the charge-off rate. And we -- again, I've seen substantial improvement there and see room for continued improvement. And we will need some growth in the -- sort of the later quarters to help drive revenue there. But we are seeing some benefits of a shift in the portfolio to smaller loans, right? So, that shift is driving up our overall yields. You can see that the yields increased in Q1 versus Q4 of last year and Q1 of last year, right? So, the growth that we had in the first quarter was coming from the small loan portfolio. We actually had some -- a little bit of shrinkage in the large loan portfolio and some growth in the small loan portfolio, which has created some tailwinds to yields, and we'll need to continue to do that, and that will benefit revenue and obviously, continuing to control costs, right? We've done a really good job of controlling costs over the last couple of years, and we'll continue to do that with some buybacks mixed in as well in the later half of this year and next year.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. That's very helpful. And would it be possible to know the metrics that we're seeing in your results is the portfolio results. So of course, having originations that were a little while ago. But if you could maybe talk about sort of the economics of the loans that you're originating today, are they already sort of that high yield, low loss and low unit expenses where we would already get to that $25 EPS? Just trying to see that path from your current metrics versus kind of what you're putting on today.\nChad Prashad: Yes. Vincent, this is Chad. Great question. So when we started tightening about this time last year, a little before during the first quarter of the last fiscal year, especially with new customers. We began to experience much higher credit quality and much higher performance, a dramatic improvement, especially from mid second quarter last fiscal year and on a dramatic improvement in the gross yields of those loans we originated. However, as we've talked about, there was a much lower volume of those loans that we were originating. So while those credit tranches are performing very well, they are very small and don't carry a lot of weight in the overall portfolio or at least haven't for some period of time. For what we're originating today, the quality remains very similar to that. The expected performance and expected both gross and net yields, we believe will also be similar to what we have been originating in the past fiscal year. But we've been able to continue to grow those tranches on a subsequent basis. So in terms of size and weighting in the portfolio, that's on the new customer origination front. There's been a similar pattern for the former customers who are returning. And then in terms of refinancing, we put a number of things in place, and that's where the majority of the portfolio really sits with customers to have a good bit more tenure. So, we've had a number of things in place that we're beginning to see overall portfolio increases in yield as well as overall performance and decrease in delinquency. So, it does take time as a process we began over a year ago, but we're beginning to see it trickle through the overall portfolio. And so, that's really where, as it gets to the whole portfolio versus just new customers, we'll begin to see increased net yields as we anticipate hitting that $25.30 target by the end of next fiscal year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Rowan of Janney. Go ahead.\nJohn Rowan: Just a couple of quick follow-ups. So just to be clear, you guys are no longer on waivers with the revolving credit facility, correct? I didn't -- I just want to make sure that we are now not in violation of debt covenants because I only saw an adjustment to the fixed charge coverage ratio.\nJohnny Calmes: Yes. Yes. So no, we're in good shape relative to all the covenants on the debt facility. Yes, we did change the fixed charge coverage ratio. Obviously, it looks like interest rates might be higher and for longer. So, that was really just to make sure that we have plenty of room over the next three years. So, we don't need to amend again in the future. So, that's kind of what was driving that.\nJohn Rowan: But the collateral performance indicator, that's still part of the credit facility, correct?\nJohnny Calmes: Oh, yes, that is, and we're in really good shape there.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. And then just last question for me. Obviously, your you're more bullish on growing new customers now I mean I think you were a year or so ago when you really pulled back -- it wouldn't be a year ago, but I mean, three quarters ago, you really start to pull back on new customer volume. What's different today with the new customers and you saw back then when obviously we are spiking losses that caused you to pull back in that cohort. What's different now? Is there a change in first pay default like what makes you so sure that growing new customers at this point is not going to yield the same results?\nChad Prashad: Yes. That's an insightful question. So, there are a couple of things. And before I begin, I just want to caution a little bit. I'd say we're more bullish, but we're not strongly bullish on growing new customers at this time, right?\nJohnny Calmes: So, we're still tighter today than we were much tighter today than we were a year ago. So, if we just -- we've loosened from relative to Q3 of last year, where we were extremely tight.\nChad Prashad: That's right. So in terms of where we've been able to loosen and be slightly more bullish and grow the new customer loan volume, it really comes down to where we've seen great operational performance. So, where we've seen the gross yields grow. We've seen delinquencies decline. And as we've seen that, those operational results, it gives us more confidence to begin loosening in certain areas. And actually, in many states, we're not loosening in terms of credit quality, but we are beginning to drive more of those higher-quality customers in or make more attractive loans and increase the approval rates for those that were desiring the most. Again, still seeking to grow the overall gross yield during that whole process, right? So, there's a little bit of a chicken egg here, right? So it's not like we're moving down the credit spectrum or anything like that to lower the credit quality in order to juice application flow or approval rates or anything of that nature. It's -- as we're seeing the performance of those loans. And also we're seeing the gross yields and customers accept those terms. This is a very different origination environment today this summer than it was last summer, given the higher interest rates and other craters have pulled back. So, it gives us a little more confidence on the margin being slightly more bullish.\nOperator: Our next question comes again from Vincent Caintic of Stephens. Go ahead.\nVincent Caintic: Just one quick follow-up. You mentioned share repurchases later this year. If you could remind us what, if any, limitations you have just so we could kind of frame how much to share repurchases to model in?\nJohnny Calmes: Sure. Yes. So, the big hurdle there is we need to get the fixed charge coverage ratio back over 2%. And we may get there after the second quarter, but we fully expect to be there after the third quarter, so which would mean we could either start buying repurchasing in Q3 or Q4. And then, we still have the same sort of good reset of net income requirements that we've always had in there.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chad Prashad for any closing remarks.\nChad Prashad: I just want to thank everyone for taking the time to join us today. And this concludes our first quarter earnings call for World Acceptance Corporation. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
