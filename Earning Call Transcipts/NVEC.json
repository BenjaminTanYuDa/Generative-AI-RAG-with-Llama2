At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Dan Baker, President and CEO.\nDaniel Baker: Good afternoon, and welcome to our conference call for the quarter ended December 31st, 2023. This call is being webcast live and recorded. A replay will be available through our website nve.com. I'm Dan Baker and as always I'm joined by Accounting Manager and Principal Financial Officer, Daniel Nelson. After my opening comments, Daniel will present our financial results. I'll cover customers, products, and marketing. Then we'll open the call to questions. We issued our press release with financial results and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q in the past hour following the close of market. Links to the press release and 10-Q are available through the SEC's website, our website, and on X formerly known as Twitter. Comments we may make that relate to future plans, events, financial results or performance are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others, such factors as uncertainties related to the economic environments in the industries we serve, and risks and uncertainties related to future sales and revenue as well as the risks factors listed from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31st, 2023, as updated in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30th and December 31, 2023. Actual results could differ materially from the information provided and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements we may make. We're pleased to report strong earnings, comprehensive income, and cash flow despite decreased revenues from a record quarter a year ago. Daniel Nelson will cover the details of our financials. Daniel?\nDaniel Nelson: Thanks, Dan. Total revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2023 decreased 9% compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to a 12% decrease in product sales, partially offset by a 94% increase in contract R&D revenue. The decrease in product sales was primarily due to decreased purchases by existing customers, particularly in the defense industry and the semiconductor industry downturn. The good news is that the industry is gaining strength and forecasts for a strong industry recovery in calendar 2024. World Semiconductor Trade Statistics is forecast in the global semiconductor market to grow 13% in 2024 compared to a 9% decrease in 2023. Product sales to defense markets can fluctuate and were especially weak in the quarter. This was related to the timing of procurement cycles and we expect these sales to recover in this quarter, the March quarter. The increase in contract R&D revenue was due to new customer research and development contracts. Total expenses decreased 16% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to a 23% decrease in R&D expense or 4% decrease in SG&A. The decrease in R&D expense was primarily due to the redeployment of resources to customer funded research and development projects. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to decreased performance-based compensation accruals. Interest income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 21% due to higher interest rates. Our effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes, decreased to 16% for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 19% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily due to increase in certain tax deductions. Our effective tax rate can vary from quarter-to-quarter and may be higher in future quarters than in the past quarter. The 1% decrease in net income from the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to decreased in revenue, which was nearly offset by decreased expenses, increased interest income and a lower effective tax rate. Comprehensive income increased 8% to $4.93 million from $4.56 million the prior year quarter. It was a solidly profitable quarter with gross margins of 80% of revenue and net margin of 62%. Total revenue for the nine months ended December 31, 2023 decreased 11% compared to the nine months ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was due to an 11% decrease in product sales and a 20% decrease in contract research and development revenue. Net income decreased 8% and comprehensive income increased 3%. Net cash provided by operating activities increased 2% to $15.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to $14.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The strong operating cash flow more than cover our three dividend so far this fiscal year. And cash and cash equivalents plus marketable securities increased to $54.7 million from $53.3 million at the start of the fiscal year. Purchases of fixed assets have been only 17,000 so far this fiscal year, but we'd expect it to increase significantly in future periods. Now I'll turn the call back to Dan Baker to cover the business. Over to you, Dan.\nDaniel Baker: Thanks, Daniel. I'll cover customers, products, and marketing. We're proud to supply products to some of the world's most demanding customers, including Abbott's Pacesetter subsidiary. Abbott is the leading supplier of implantable medical devices. We recently executed an extension to our supplier partnering agreement with Abbott. The extension is through the end of 2024 and includes price increases that will help offset our cost increases. We have had a formal partnering agreement with Abbott since 2006, and this is the 10th amendment to extend the agreement. The agreement amendment was filed on a current report on Form 8-K and incorporated by reference in our just filed 10-Q. It is available via our website or the SEC's website. We do long-term research to build our technology portfolio and help advance the field of spintronics. In the past quarter, NVE, along with researchers from the University of Texas and Virginia Commonwealth University, published research on technology that could provide the energy efficiency needed to accelerate the use of magnetic tunnel junctions in memory, logic and neuromorphic computing. Magnetic tunnel junctions or MTJs are spintronics structures we help pioneer that we use in many of our products. There are links to a recent journal paper and a conference presentation on the subject on our papers and presentation webpage and our X and LinkedIn feeds. A key advantage of our technology is that our products are extremely rugged. We extended that advantage with two product line extensions in the past quarter, extended temperature isolated network transceivers and ultra-high isolation data couplers. The new extended temperature products include a transceiver that's billed as the fastest such device in the industry and allows high speed data transfer in harsh environments, such as the industrial Internet of things and power conversion modules. The new parts were requested by a customer. Isolation voltage is the key figure of merit for data couplers. It's what makes them isolators. We've long had best-in-class isolation voltage. And in the past quarter, we extended that advantage by increasing the isolation voltage rating on several of our unique V-Series isolators to 7 kilovolts. With required safety margins, this means the parts that are just three tenths of an inch wide can withstand 8.4 kilovolts for at least a second. Demonstrations of the extended temperature and higher isolation products are on our website and YouTube channel. Certifications help us compete with larger, better known companies by providing credibility and reducing perceived risk. In our previous call, we reported we had earned the prestigious CE mark for our line of the world's smallest DC to DC converters. In the past quarter, we also qualified our data couplers with integrated DC to DC converters. These devices transmit data as well as convert power in a single integrated circuit less than an eighth of an inch square. They help solve an important challenge in power conversion systems by transmitting data between the subsystems on different power supplies. Our distributors have told us the CE mark could enable additional sales in Europe. The key to qualifying for the mark was rigorous testing for radiated emissions. These emissions are a problem with conventional parts because they can interfere with other electronics. In addition to the line extensions, I just summarized new products in 2023, we began marketing products, including more products combining data couplers with isolated DC to DC converters to transmit power as well as data. Long-term product development programs in the past year included Next Generation MRAM for anti-tamper applications, Next Generation sensors for hearing aids and implantable medical devices and extremely sensitive TMR sensors as well as wafer level chip scale sensors. Trade shows are an important part of our marketing strategy. We supported distributor exhibitions at four European shows in the past quarter. AGRITECHNICA in Hanover, Space Tech in Bremen, SPS in Nuremberg, and MEDICA in Dusseldorf. We also exhibited under our own banner at the Medical Design and Manufacturing Show in Minneapolis, which was part of the Advanced Manufacturing event. Some of the trade show demonstrations are on our website and YouTube channel. Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Josh?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from [Pete Prove] with individual investor. You may proceed.\nPete Prove: Hey, Dan. On last quarter's call, I asked a question about licensing your IP, and you gave a great answer saying that you would do all manufacturing in-house and you wouldn't license it, but you would maybe manufacture under other brands. My question today is, could you talk a little bit about with all the investments you've made in equipment and facilities, what your potential revenue for the business is with your existing equipment and facilities and running two, three shifts and so forth, and maybe just give some color of what the potential could be? Appreciate it.\nDaniel Baker: Yeah, that's a great question, Pete. So in terms of our capacity, we don't have a, it's hard to give a specific number because it depends heavily on the mix and which equipment would be used for the products. But in general, we do not run, we try not to run close to our capacity. We're not like conventional semiconductor companies which need to run very close to their capacity at high utilization, or they run into, they just can't cover their fixed costs. Our cost structure is different because of the uniqueness of our technology. So our goal is to have plenty of capacity. That allows us to provide shorter lead times for our customers, and to provide more assurance with redundancies and extra equipment that in the case of a problem with our equipment, we'd be able to continue to produce the products that our customers need. So in general, we run at relatively low percentage of our capacity. We have adequate room to grow. We are looking at increasing our capital expenditures, as Daniel mentioned in the prepared remarks in the coming year, to increase our capacity further and to ensure that we don't have any bottlenecks to continue our growth.\nPete Prove: Great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Steven Lewis with Lewis Capital Management. You may proceed.\nSteven Lewis: On the previous call, you said you were pleased to report for six months in September, and I indicated I wasn't sure what you were pleased about, but then I thought you said something about there were some orders that would come in that would lapse over into the next quarter. The stock went from 80.5 to 66.5 in a day. Now here you are pleased with nine months. So when do we start talking about expectations and budget and accomplishment and forget the pleasing part.\nDaniel Baker: Well, this is Dan Baker. We were pleased with the results in the context of the markets that we compete in with a slowdown in the industry. And then as Daniel mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have a significant defense business that can be variable from quarter-to-quarter. And as he said, we expect that to recover in the current quarter, the March quarter. So we're optimistic about the future and we have an excellent order flow. The industry is strengthening, as Daniel mentioned. And so we were pleased with the results under the conditions and we look forward to better results and growth in the future.\nSteven Lewis: What were your results for the quarter versus your expectation for the quarter in October?\nDaniel Baker: Well, as you probably know, like most public companies, we don't provide forward-looking guidance, but we were --\nSteven Lewis: No. I'm talking about your expectations internally.\nDaniel Baker: Right. So we don't disclose our internal expectations for obvious reasons. We're not permitted to do so if we're not giving forward-looking guidance. So - but what we looked at was what are the conditions in the industry, what is the defense business backlog and we were pleased with the performance of our team, with our production, with our sales team under those conditions for the quarter.\nSteven Lewis: Do you think tomorrow your stock will reflect what you're so pleased about?\nDaniel Baker: We're generally not in the business of predicting our stock price. We're not very good at it and I admit to being biased. I almost always think the stock is undervalued and I have a fair amount of exposure to the company's stock, but I do that because I think it's an excellent value and an excellent investment. But that's my personal opinion.\nSteven Lewis: Thank you.\nDaniel Baker: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment for questions. Our next question comes from [Chris Makovsky] [ph], private investor. You may proceed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hello, good afternoon. I wanted to ask more about the general conditions of the industry. You said that the military industry will improve in the present quarter. Can you tell us anything about what you're seeing in the general industry and the medical industry?\nDaniel Baker: In the general industry, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are seeing a strengthening of the semiconductor market as we go into the New Year into 2024. And the WSTS, the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization is forecasting growth of double-digit growth in 2024, 13% compared to a 9% decrease in 2023. So the numbers haven't been tallied for 2023, but the latest forecast was for a significant decrease for the industry in 2023 and a significant increase in 2024. And that I think coincides with what we're hearing from our customers that the industry is starting to pick up. Obviously, we are participating in a segment of the overall industry, so it's not a perfect barometer and it's not a perfect predictor of the future for us. Nevertheless, it gives us reason for optimism and reason for being pleased with the performance that we had in the face of a downturn in the industry in calendar 2023.\nUnidentified Analyst: So you make a good point and I read the same reports, but the general semiconductor industry reports basically more or less say that the improvement in 2024 is expected to come in the second half. Are you currently seeing improvement in the other floor or are your clients also saying, well, it's probably going to be coming in the second half.\nDaniel Baker: We are seeing the same thing that while the industry seems to be improving and sequentially rather than decreases, we're seeing slight increases. So it's not a booming industry, but it's better. We're facing fewer headwinds. That is what we're seeing. And we do certainly look forward to a strong second half of the year if the industry forecasts are correct.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, it's good to hear that you're already seeing improvement. Now you have a new networking isolator. Are you getting orders for networking for factory automation equipment?\nDaniel Baker: We are and the specific new product we had extends our temperature advantage or speed advantage to high temperature products which was of interest to particular customers. It's a very harsh environment sometimes in factories. So being able to withstand high temperatures and transmit very high speed is an important advantage. And as I mentioned, we have best-in-class products that can transmit very high amounts of data, 40 megabits per second, which is just an incredible amount of data in a relatively short time through a complex network protocol. So those are important products and they serve a growing market, the industrial internet of things. So we're seeing some interest in them and we are optimistic about the future of those products.\nUnidentified Analyst: And that is a new market for you, am I correct?\nDaniel Baker: It's an existing market for us. We've always been in factory automation for a long time, but there are certain applications that we couldn't get into because of the temperature limitations. So we meet the industry standard 85 degrees Celsius temperature requirements, but we have customers who are interested in 125 Celsius, which is 257 Fahrenheit. That's pretty hot. But there are applications that require that. And even if they don't require it, it's a figure of merit that some of our customers want to be sure that our products have lots of margin and design margin and that they aren't going to fail even under extremely harsh conditions.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's good to hear. Good luck. Thanks.\nDaniel Baker: Thanks Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Dan Baker for any closing remarks.\nDaniel Baker: Well, thank you for the questions. We reported strong earnings for the quarter and an increase year-over-year in cash flow. We look forward to speaking with you again at our next earning call, which will be in early May to review the full fiscal year. Thank you again.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to Daniel Baker, President and CEO. Sir, you may begin.\nDaniel Baker : Good afternoon, and welcome to our conference call for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. This call is being webcast live and recorded. A replay will be available through our website, nve.com.  I'm Dan Baker, and I'm joined by Accounting Manager and Principal Financial Officer, Daniel Nelson. After my opening comments, Daniel Nelson will present our financial results. Then I'll cover marketing and new products, and we'll open the call to questions.  We issued our press release with financial results and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q in the past hour following the close of market. Links to the press release and 10-Q are available through the SEC's website, our website, and on X the platform formerly known as Twitter.  Comments we may make that relate to future plans, events, financial results or performance are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including, among others, such factors as uncertainties related to the economic environments in the industries we serve, risks and uncertainties related to future sales and revenue and risks of credit losses as well as risks listed from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2023, as updated in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Actual results could differ materially from the information provided and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements we may make.  We're pleased to report strong earnings and cash flow despite decreased revenue from a record quarter a year ago. Daniel Nelson will cover the details of our financials. Daniel?\nDaniel Nelson : Thanks, Dan. Total revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, decreased 33% to $7.13 million, compared to $10.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was due to a 32% decrease in product sales and a 92% decrease in contract R&D. The decrease in product sales was against a tough comparison to last year when product sales increased 59% and a reflection of the semiconductor industry downturn. The good news is that forecast are for a strong industry [technical difficulty] is projecting a 20% increase in semiconductor sales after a 12% decrease this year as demand rebounds for most application lines. The decrease in product sales was primarily due to decreased purchases by existing customers.  Product sales to defense markets were especially weak in the quarter. This was related to the timing of procurement cycles, and we expect these sales to recover in coming quarters. The decrease in contract R&D revenue was due to the completion of most contracts. But we have new active contracts and contract R&D is expected to strengthen later this fiscal year. Total expenses decreased 17% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to a $202,926 credit loss provision reversal, partially offset by a 2% increase in R&D expense. The provision for credit loss reversal was due to a reassessment of our allowance for credit losses based on payments and debt customer information as of September 30, 2023. Interest income for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 46% due to higher yields on securities purchased after September 30, 2022.  Our effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes decreased to 8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 19% for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease was due to the reversal of $202,926 credit loss provision and changes in the amounts and timing of tax deductions and credits. Our effective tax rate can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Our effective tax rate in subsequent quarters will likely be higher than the effective tax rate in the quarter ended September 30, 2023.  The 22% decrease in net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to decreased revenue, partially offset by decreased expenses, increased interest income and a lower effective tax rate. Net margin was remarkable -- was a remarkable 65% of revenue. For the six months -- for the first six months of fiscal 2024, total revenue decreased 12% to $16 million from $18.1 million for the first six months of the prior year. The decrease was due to a 10% decrease in product sales and a 68% decrease in contract R&D revenue.  Net income for the first six months decreased 11% to $9.13 million of $1.89 per diluted share from $10.2 million or $2.12 per diluted share for the first half of fiscal 2023. Net cash flow provided by operating activities increased 11% to $10.4 million for the first half of fiscal 2024 compared to $9.35 million for the first half of fiscal 2023. The strong operating cash flow more than cover our dividend so far for this fiscal year. And cash plus marketable securities increased from $53.3 million to $53.8 million.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Dan Baker to cover the business. Over to you, Dan?\nDaniel Baker : Thanks, Daniel. I'll cover products, marketing and our shareholders' meeting. NVE's line of the world's smallest DC to DC converters recently qualified for the prestigious CE mark, under an EU declaration of conformity, which includes safety, electromagnetic compatibility and reduction of hazardous substances. Our distributors have told us the mark could enable additional sales in Europe.  The key to qualifying for the mark was rigorous testing the International Standards for Radiated Emissions. Unlike most conventional DC to DC converters, our parts pass the test with no external components for electromagnetic compatibility compliance.  Also in the quarter, we officially renewed our ISO 9001 certification. The new certificate is valid until October 2026. ISO certification is a seal of approval from a third-party governing body that NVE meets the international standards of excellence published by the International Organization for Standardization, or ISO. ISO 9001 helps ensure consistent quality.  Trade shows are an important part of our marketing strategy. Our distributors exhibited at several shows in the past quarter. We exhibited under our own banner at the Medical Design and Manufacturing Trade Show last week in Minneapolis, part of the advanced manufacturing event.  Minnesota is a healthcare industry hub and medical devices are an important market for us. We have a convincing benefit proposition for medical devices with small size, low power and superb reliability. The nearby show was also a chance for some of our employees who don't usually go to trade shows to interact with customers and prospects.  We demonstrated our new high-field tunneling Magnetoresistive sensors, which have a unique omnidirectional capability and they can detect the high fields from MRI to enable MRI-tolerant medical devices. We showed our new ultra-high sensitivity tunneling Magnetoresistive sensors, which are ideal for catheter position detection and navigation. In these applications, an array of sensors on a catheter form a miniature compass using an externally generated field to determine the position of the catheter. Our sensor's small size allows them to be used in small diameter catheters and their precision improves positional accuracy, enabling more effective procedures. We also featured a new chessboard to demonstrate the wide operating latitude and power efficiency our sensors provide in medical and industrial applications. Demos are also on our website and our YouTube channel.  We held our Annual Shareholders Meeting in August at a nearby hotel. Unlike many companies, we returned to in-person meetings after the COVID-19 pandemic. Proxy advisory firms recommend in person annual shareholders meetings for good governance. All of our directors and officers attended along with our auditors. We had a chance to meet our shareholders and answer questions. Our shareholders could see and try out hands-on product demonstrations.  In the formal meeting, each director was reelected. Named executive officer compensation was approved. Shareholders voted in favor of annual say on pay votes and the selection of our independent registered public accounting firm was ratified. We filed the final vote counts in a current report on Form 8-K shortly after the meeting. There's a replay of the meeting with slides and product demonstrations on our website and YouTube channel.  Now I'd like to open the call to questions. Tawanda?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Silverberg Bernstein Capital Management. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Hi, Dan. How are you?\nDaniel Baker : Good, hi, Jeff. \nJeffrey Bernstein: So a couple of questions for you. Just wondering, have you delivered now all the backlog that had built up during COVID?\nDaniel Baker : Well, we don't formally call it backlog because backlog has a gap meaning -- but we do look at order flow and orders in the system, and we continue to have orders in the system. So while we've recovered from some of the shortages that plagued many in the semiconductor industry during the pandemic, we continue to have strong order flow and orders that we're continuing to fulfill.\nJeffrey Bernstein: So in terms of your lead times, have those changed at all?\nDaniel Baker : They have. It depends on the part, but our lead times are shorter. We have many parts in stock now that we didn't have in stock. We've always been better than most in the industry, we believe, during the pandemic because we are uniquely positioned in that we have integrated production here at NVE. We have front end, back end and control over most of our processes.  So we're in better shape than most in the industry. And now we're in even better shape because some of the shortages have abated. We've increased our capacity with capital investments. We've increased our staffing. And so we can offer shorter lead times or parts in stock in many -- for many of our parts.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Yeah. Okay. And then can you just talk a little bit about the design pipeline sort of versus pre-COVID times? Is there a significant difference in the number of designs that you guys are working on? \nDaniel Baker : Yeah, that's an interesting question. I think it's more, but I don't know that we have data that could support that. It's just a feeling that we've had more interest as companies are less worried about just getting parts then now they're looking also with new designs and longer-term things. The shortages of personnel, including design personnel, that plagued the industry during the pandemic seem to have abated, at least somewhat.  So we're very optimistic also based on the feedback that we've gotten on some of our specific products, including our DC to DC converters, some of our angle sensors and I mentioned navigation sensors that are in particular, useful in the medical business. So our design activity is high.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got you.  And then in terms of just the overall number of customers who are ordering from you versus pre-COVID, what does that look like?\nDaniel Baker : We think it's increased. Well, it has increased. We picked up some customers during the pandemic, during the shortages, and we've retained them by and large. So we have more customers than we had before the pandemic. We continue to pick up customers. But as we've said before, they sometimes came for the lead time, but they stayed for the quality product and the support that they get from NVE.\nJeffrey Bernstein: Got you. That's great. And then I'm just wondering, in terms of any design wins that you've had over the last couple of years, that you think will move the needle at some point as they ramp up? Or are the sort of individual designs just never going to be that important?\nDaniel Baker : Well, we see some especially important areas where we've had design wins. And two, that I would highlight include charging stations for electric vehicles which is a major thrust to build out the infrastructure required to support the expected increase in use of electric vehicles. And we have a design win there that we've talked about before. We also have a design win in power conversion for energy storage systems, which is important for the conversion to green energy because green energy electricity -- mostly electricity has to be stored because the wind doesn't always blow and of course, solar energy goes away at night. So being able to store that locally is important.  So these are growing markets that we see as having tremendous potential long-term potential. So those are design wins we pleased with any design win. But those, of course, are important because they address large, fast-growing markets where we have a convincing benefit proposition.\nJeffrey Bernstein: That's great. Thanks for the help today. \nDaniel Baker : Thanks, Jeff. \nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Jankosky [ph]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hello, thank you for taking question. I want to ask you on your YouTube channel you have an example for using your chips for a DFI device and for a driver for an electric bike? Do you think those -- like your prices are practical to enter these markets?\nDaniel Baker : So you said for -- I think you said for driving electric bike motors, yeah. So we have a YouTube video where we demonstrated several of our parts, our isolators and our DC to DC converters for power conversion to drive an electric motor. In that case, it was for -- it was an electric motor that was used in electric bike. And that particular market is an interesting market for us, for the power conversion there. And we do believe that we have a competitive proposition where we can improve the efficiency of those types of systems. We can decrease the size and we believe that it's cost effective.  There's a broader market for power control of all kinds of motors. So motors use a significant portion of the electricity that's used in the world, as you might expect. And increasing that efficiency can -- even a little bit, can significantly help the overall challenge of converting to electricity and to carbon-free energy sources. So we see that as an excellent opportunity, the general category of motor control.\nUnidentified Analyst: Can you give us some kind of a neighborhood figure as to how much efficiency gain you would have or kind of like an average industrial motor?\nDaniel Baker : Yeah, that's -- it's difficult to come up with an exact number because it depends on the motor and the application. As you can imagine, it's not like it's going to change from 50% to 99%, though. Those sorts of changes -- those sorts of improvements and efficiency have been rung out in the past. But even slight improvements, a percent or even less than 1% are significant because they get multiplied by a number of motors and it turns into a lot of electricity that can be saved. So it's difficult to quantify it, but we can offer higher efficiency than conventional electronics, and that's important to our target market.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's good to hear. And higher efficiencies because you -- you can say that, generally speaking, you do better current sensing than the existing systems.\nDaniel Baker : Exactly. Yeah. Part of it is current sensing. And then part of it is the efficiency of our DC to DC converters. And then the other part of it is the speed of our isolators, which provide an interface between the controls and the power switching transistors. And the reason that's important is because these transistors are very efficient when they're either on or off, but when they're transitioning they can -- they burn electricity. So that's a major source of inefficiency. So the faster that one can switch those devices, the more efficient they become and our devices are extremely fast.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That is good to hear. And are you -- and this is something I always ask, but are you making inroads in kind of like more wide broader market industrial applications like this?\nDaniel Baker : We are. So the question was broader markets. So you mean our traditional industrial control market and the industrial Internet of Things. And we continue to have a strong position there. We've highlighted -- we would highlight some of our smart sensors, which are used in robotics for industrial control and highly connected robotics. Those parts have been -- we've been pleased with the reception for those parts. We continue to make isolators that provide the nerves of those systems and the sensors that provide the eyes, if you will, of the robotics that go into industrial control systems. So that remains a strong market for us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And another YouTube video was about using your -- again, your current sensors for -- for GFI, which is kind of the safety plug you have in your bathrooms. Is that a market you can enter?\nDaniel Baker : I see. I missed your -- I missed that the first time you asked it. So what you were talking about would be GFI or ground fault interruptors or sometimes it's called GCFI ground fault circuit interruptors. And we have a demonstration on our website and on YouTube that shows how to do that.  So that's an interesting market for us. The home market, which would be in things like bathrooms and kitchens is rather commoditized. But there is an industrial market for such devices, which we are looking at. And more importantly, we're demonstrating the extreme sensitivity and very wide range of our current sensors. And as you correctly pointed out, current sensors are important for controlling motors and doing it efficiently.  So that allows motors to become more efficient in the system. And also our sensors use very little power themselves. So conventional current sensors might use a significant amount of power so to measure the current in order to control the current in order to improve the efficiency, you're spending some of that savings with the current sensor. And our current sensors use very little power.  So we see that as a demonstration for a particular application, but also of the broader applicability of those parts in low power, high sensitivity, wide dynamic range current sensing.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. And for general, just the couple of days, there's been news out of Taiwan that the inventory correction is ending clients ordering more chips. Are you -- have you seen this in the last week or so?\nDaniel Baker : We've seen [technical difficulty] until a recovery of the semiconductor industry, as Daniel alluded to in the prepared remarks, and so that gives us reason for optimism for the coming quarters.\nUnidentified Analyst: But have you seen it in your own order at your own kind of requests for inbound interest requests including…?\nDaniel Baker : So you mean purchasing from foundries.\nUnidentified Analyst: Well, I mean you're just client inquiries and client orders you seem like -- cyclical uptick?\nDaniel Baker : We are seeing some improvement. It's been gradual. It would be difficult to point to a particular week and say that we saw improvement. But in general, we've been seeing an improvement in the order flow, and that makes us optimistic about the future. \nUnidentified Analyst: All right. That's it for me. Thank you for your very detailed answers and good luck. \nDaniel Baker : Thank you, Chris. \nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Lewis with Lewis Capital Management. Your line is open. \nSteven Lewis: Good afternoon. I had a question about your bond portfolio. Have you had any change in the way it's been managed in the last three to six months? You're showing a small a small valuation difference of only $1 million plus versus cost?\nDaniel Baker : Yeah. So what we were showing for the unrealized losses in the bond portfolio, which I think is what you're referring to, is what's been happening is that in general interest rates have been increasing. And so that results in unrealized losses in our bond portfolio. So unrealized losses, meaning that while the value when we look them up and -- in the bank statement or we look them up online, the value is lower, but we still expect them to pay the face value or par value of the bonds. But the flip side of that is that interest rates have -- with interest rates increasing, is that it significantly increased our interest income, as you can see on the income statement. And that's because we've been able to reinvest our bonds as they mature in higher interest securities than the ones that they were originally invested in.\nSteven Lewis: That's what you're doing now?\nDaniel Baker : Yes.\nSteven Lewis: In the higher rate. Okay?\nDaniel Baker : Yes. So when we reinvest in a bond that matures so we have bonds that mature occasionally, and then we reinvest them and the interest rates are typically higher with the reinvestment with the new bonds than the old bonds. Some of our bonds might be several years maturity -- and so when we bought them several years ago, interest rates were lower. When we -- when those bonds mature in we can roll them over into higher interest rate bonds than our interest income increases. \nSteven Lewis: Assuming you can forecast your cash flow near term, do you think you will eradicate the difference between cost and fair value by the end of the year?\nDaniel Baker : Unlikely by the end of the year because the maturities of the bonds are longer. So we typically invest in multiyear bonds because we have strong cash flow and we don't expect to need the funds immediately. But -- so when the bonds mature, they -- we expect them to pay their proper value. So if we have $1 million bond, the book value might be lower now, but we expect it to pay off $1 million. But that will be over the term of the bond where the value will tend to converge on the par value and then the loss will decrease.\nSteven Lewis: Thank you. Regarding the average hearing aid business, there has been a lot of publicity about the ability to buy cheaper hearing aids without having to go through the doctor. I haven't checked to see but has any comments on their call today. But -- is that business holding up versus your estimates?\nDaniel Baker : The hearing aid business continues to hold up. It's an important part of our market. The broader market that you referred to about over-the-counter hearing aids and hearables is an excellent market for us. Hearing aids are a large underserved market. The estimates are that only 20% of those that could use a hearing aid seek help as you implied that many are discouraged by the cost as well as the inconvenient dispensing.  So having over-the-counter hearing aids and lower cost hearing aids, we believe, will expand the market, and we have a convincing benefit proposition in hearing aids. So we see that as a good long-term opportunity.\nSteven Lewis: Have you secured an OTC backlog?\nDaniel Baker : We have talked about some design wins in that space and the broader hearables market, which would be things that would go in once a year but may not necessarily be a hearing aid. It's a relatively small market now, but we expect it to grow.\nSteven Lewis: You said you are pleased with the solid earnings for the quarter and the six months. Does that mean that the actual results for the quarter September were within 3% to 5% of your estimate going into the quarter, so to be pleased?\nDaniel Baker : Well, we were pleased under the circumstances of the industry downturn and the -- as Daniel mentioned in the prepared remarks that we have a defense business that can be lumpy and can be somewhat volatile. And it wasn't -- it was down significantly in the September quarter, but we expect it to recover in coming quarters.  So in the context of the industry and the particular effects of the defense and the particular lumpiness of the defense business for us. We were pleased with the results. We were certainly pleased with the cash flow and the profitability that Daniel mentioned in the prepared remarks.\nSteven Lewis: So you were please that the results were what you expected earlier at least three months?\nDaniel Baker : Well, we don't provide, as you probably know, we don't -- like most companies, we don't provide forward-looking guidance, so there's not much to compare to, but we look at it and say, how did we do given the environment and given the difficulty of the fair. So yes, we were pleased with how our folks executed and delivering orders and bringing in new business. And the profitability, the efficiency and the execution that our team had for the quarter.\nSteven Lewis: You're pleased with the back log?\nDaniel Baker : We're pleased with the order flow, given the industry conditions, but the industry is improving as we touched on in other questions. And we expect the expectations are for a much stronger semiconductor market in the coming year in calendar 2024.\nSteven Lewis: Thank you very much. \nDaniel Baker : Thank you, Steven. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Pete [Indiscernible]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, Dan, with the significant patent portfolio the company has, do you see any opportunities to license some of those patents to create additional revenue streams?\nDaniel Baker : We've looked from time to time at the possibility of licensing. And in particular, we talked about licensing our MRAM portfolio. We were a pioneer in MRAM, which is spintronic memory but our target market for that technology is in high-value low-density memories where we can build the type of fab that can be used as opposed to the multibillion-dollar fabs that make large-scale memories.  So there's an opportunity for potentially licensing. It's a long-term opportunity. And then we have other ways of monetizing our intellectual property. We're very proud of our portfolio of intellectual property. And one way we can monetize that is private label sales, where we sell our products under another company's brand name. So we're still manufacturing it. We're proud of our manufacturing capability. And so licensing the technology and not making it means getting that up.  And it's also, in some cases, we've invested quite a bit in the technology and in the infrastructure, and it's not that easy for somebody else to build it. But we do explore opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio in other ways than simply selling parts under our own brand.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you very much. \nDaniel Baker : Thanks, Pete. \nOperator: Thank you. Please standby for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Collin McBirney with Topline Capital Management. Your line is open.\nCollin McBirney: Hi, Dan. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering on the -- in the past, you've talked about the lumpiness in defense. Could you maybe just comment like outside of if you kind of set aside defense, maybe either for the quarter or for the first half? Like is the business outside of defense, like flat? Or just to get a sense for kind of the run rate?\nDaniel Baker : Yeah, that's -- we don't break down precisely our defense versus non-defense business, but defense was a major influence on the most recent quarter on the September quarter. And as I mentioned in response to a prior question, we were pleased with the results, setting that aside for the non-defense business. It has been a slow industry and that affects us. But the defense was a particular -- there was a particular drag on revenue in the most recent quarter.\nCollin McBirney: Got it. And then on the defense business, are those orders placed by like the U.S. government like the DLA or something? Or are they typically placed by a prime contractor? And then maybe you could just like touch on like maybe how many like customers you have in defense, like is it one that places an order for a couple of million dollars? Or is it like 10 of them and they kind of come in lumpy -- it sounds like it's very lumpy. But is that because there's like one customer, the U.S. government or something or yeah?\nDaniel Baker : The customers are typically prime contractors, defense contractors. And it's not one, but it's not large number either. There's a relatively small number of large defense contractors. And so the lumpiness tends to be tied to defense procurement cycles and our products that we sell into the defense industry are primarily anti-tamper products, which are used to protect electronic technology in large systems.  So those tend to be tied to particular procurement systems for the large defense system. We can't say what types of systems they are, and we often don't know for obvious reasons, but they tend to be things that take a while to build and the -- so we get big orders when the systems are starting to be built and then they can sometimes drop off. And that's what happened in the September quarter.\nCollin McBirney: Got it. Okay. And then do you have a sense for -- without getting any specifics, I mean, are some of the equipment used in Ukraine and/or kind of Israel's response to your recent terrorist attacks like -- I mean it seems like the environment for defense spending over the next year is as good or better than it was a year ago. And I guess, how do you kind of triangulate that in terms of the kind of go-forward expectations versus where things have been?\nDaniel Baker : Yeah. That's a good point, Collin. We would certainly hate to have to say that those conflicts are good for business, but what the government has said publicly what the Defense Department has said is that it's important to protect electronics for systems that are going to foreign sales to allied sales because those tend to be especially vulnerable to reverse engineering and falling into unfriendly hands.  So -- in that sense, I suppose it's a positive environment for our defense sales these are relatively long procurement cycles. So it's not something where if a defense system is shipped, we're immediately gaining revenue from it. We do look at it, though, that we're proud to do our part, a small part but an important part of protecting the U.S. technology and protecting ours in our Allied war fighters.\nCollin McBirney: Okay. Great. That makes sense. And obviously, personally, I fully support the U.S. military. It is -- and maybe last one I had, just on -- I think if I -- I know it's going to serve me correctly. I think sometimes you guys said that kind of fiscal '24 -- your fiscal '24 revenue would be somewhat similar to your fiscal 2023 revenue. Obviously, the first half was kind of started a little bit lower? I mean, that would sort of imply something closer to like $11 million a quarter for 3Q and 4Q each. I mean is something like that potentially feasible? Or is there kind of a change in maybe the outlook or maybe I misunderstood previous comment.\nDaniel Nelson : Yeah. Collin, I think the comments we made before about revenue being the same was within the context of anti-tamper sales. So we were actually discussing -- talking about the lumpiness of the anti-tamper sales business, and we -- the comment we made was specifically related to that we did not expect to see a significant difference in the lumpiness of that business. And not particularly revenue for the -- for full fiscal 2024. So yes.\nCollin McBirney: Okay. Got it. And so it's presumably the kind of the positive lump in into kind of 2Q '23 and then the positive lump in 4Q '23, those were both from the defense. So assuming that comment still holds you would have kind of a couple of positive lumpiness to match last year's lumpiness?\nDaniel Nelson : We expect anti-tamper sales defense sales to increase. We expect defense sales to recover in the remaining quarter of fiscal 2024. But as far as the timing is hard to say, again, because of the lumpiness of this part of our business because as Dan mentioned in his comments, sales are tied to defense procurement cycles and defense contracts, which can be terribly difficult to predict.\nCollin McBirney: Got it, understood. Okay, great. Well, thank you guys. Appreciate it. \nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Daniel for closing remarks.\nDaniel Baker : Well, thanks, everyone. We were pleased to report strong earnings and increased cash flow despite the challenging conditions. We look forward to speaking with you again at our next earnings call in January.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to the NVE conference call of First Quarter Results. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Dan Baker, President and CEO. Please go ahead. \nDan Baker: Good afternoon, and welcome to our conference call for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. This call is being webcast live and recorded. A replay will be available through our website, nve.com. I'm Dan Baker, and I'm joined by Accounting Manager and Principal Financial Officer, Daniel Nelson. Daniel was promoted to his current position in early May and also presented on our last call. He goes by Daniel, I go by Dan to reduce confusion. Also, he's originally from Liberia, and I'm from Columbus, Ohio. So I'm the one with the bland accent. After my opening comments, Daniel will present our financial results. I'll cover marketing and new products, and we'll open the call to questions. We issued our press release with financial results and filed our quarterly report on Form 10-Q in the past hour following the close of market. Links to the press release and 10-Q are available through the SEC's website, our website, and our Twitter timeline. Comments we may make that relate to future plans, events, financial results or performance are forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including, among others, such factors as uncertainties relating to the economic environments in the industries we serve. Risks and uncertainties related to future sales and revenue and risks of credit losses as well as the risk factors listed from time to time in our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2023, as updated in our just filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Actual results could differ materially from the information provided, and we undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements we may make. We're pleased to report solid growth for the quarter compared to the prior year despite industry headwinds. Product sales increased 23% compared to the prior year quarter, and net income increased 6% to $0.91 per diluted share. Now Daniel Nelson will cover the details of our financial results. Daniel?\nDaniel Nelson : Thanks, Dan. Total revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, increased 20% compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2022. The increase was due to a 23% increase in product sales partially offset by a 50% decrease in contract R&D. The increase in product sales was despite a downturn in the semiconductor industry. The increase in product sales was primarily due to increased purchases by existing customers and new customers. The decrease in contract R&D revenue was due to the completion of certain contracts.  Total expenses increased 42% for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023 due to a 16% increase in R&D expense, a 28% increase in SG&A and $212,000 credit loss expense for the most recent quarter. The increases in R&D and SG&A were primarily due to increased staffing and compensation expenses. The credit loss expense was due to an increase in our allowance for credit losses under the newly adopted accounting standard. This resulted into a new expense line in our income statement.  Interest income for the quarter -- for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 54% due to high yields on security purchase after June 30, 2022. Our effective tax rate, which is the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes increased to 24% for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 17% for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was due to changes in the timing and availability of tax credits.  Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 6% to $4.4 million or $0.91 per diluted share compared to $4.14 million or $0.86 for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase was primarily due to increased revenue and increased interest income, partially offset by increased expenses and higher taxes. Net income as reported includes an unfavorable noncash impact of $212,000 or $0.04 per share of credit loss expense under the newly adopted accounting standard.  Net cash provided by operating activities increased 51% to $5.03 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $3.33 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The strong operating cash flow more than cover the quarterly dividend. Now I'll turn the call back to Dan Baker to cover marketing and new products and to preview our Annual Shareholders' Meeting. Over to you, Dan.\nDan Baker: Thanks, Daniel. First, I'll cover marketing. We promoted our products at three major trade shows in the past quarter. PCIM Europe and Sensor+Test in Germany reach important target markets for us. PCIM is built as the world's leading exhibition and conference for power electronics, intelligent motion, renewable energy and energy management. We coexhibited with one of our German distributors. Sensors+Test claims to be the world's leading forum for sensor, measurement and testing technology. We supported a distributor at that show. We exhibited under our own banner at Sensors Converge in Santa Clara, California, a few weeks ago. The exhibition showcases the latest sensing technologies and is claimed to be North America's largest electronics event for design engineers. We demonstrated several new products and interest was especially strong for our angle sensors and DC to DC converters. Turning to new products. It's been said that energy and data are the major currencies of our lives. We enable both currencies. Our data couplers transmit data and our DC to DC converters transfer energy. In the past quarter, we expanded our line of combination data couplers with DC to DC converters. These devices transfer data and energy from one system such as a computer to another, such as a robot.  Unlike many companies, after COVID-19, we returned to in-person annual shareholders' meetings, so shareholders can meet our managers and directors and see hands-on product demonstrations. This year's meeting is on August 3 at the newly renovated SpringHill Suites in Eden Prairie. If you can't attend, you can see product demonstrations on our website or YouTube channel. Our proxy statement for the meeting is available via our website or the SEC's website. The first annual meeting agenda item is the election of directors. We're fortunate to have a strong independent Board of Directors with two former public company CEOs, Rich Kramp and Jim Bracke; a former CFO of a public company, Pat Hollister; and an experienced Director for several successful public companies, Terry Glarner. The second annual meeting agenda item is approval of our officer compensation. This year's proxy has new pay versus performance disclosures and metrics, which show how we tie compensation to performance and shareholder value. Our compensation principles as detailed in our proxy include, we don't overpay our officers, our officers have the same fringe benefits as all employees and there are no executive perks or golden parachutes. The third agenda item is to allow shareholders to vote on the frequency of advisory votes on officer compensation. The Board recommends a say-on-pay vote every year for good governance. And the final agenda item is the ratification of our auditors for this fiscal year, the year ending March 31, 2024. Boulay has been our auditor since 2019, and we recommend their approval for our next audit. We expect our Boulay audit partner and audit manager to attend the annual meeting.  Now I'd like to open the call for questions. Beth?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is going to be from the line of Jeffrey Bernstein with Silverberg Bernstein Capital Management.\nDan Baker : Congratulations on the new firm.\nJeffrey Bernstein : Thanks very much. Appreciate that. So I had a couple of questions for you. So there's been some revenue volatility in the last few quarters in a good way. And obviously, there's some impact from the semiconductor supply chain issues, et cetera. You guys have spent some money on CapEx for testing, et cetera, in order to improve your capacity. When we think about kind of spreading the peanut butter of this lumpiness over several quarters, it sort of feels like that a $7 million to $8 million kind of per quarter run rate is maybe sort of a new norm. But can you just talk a little bit about the volatility you've seen and what you're feeling about a baseline revenue expectation.\nDaniel Nelson : Yes. I'm sorry, I was muted. So Jeff, great question. This is Daniel Nelson. And so, our revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2022, obviously, as you pointed out, was somewhat less than what we ended the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 with -- fiscal 2024 Q4 was an extremely unusual quarter. As you mentioned, we did deploy some additional equipment, which we purchased towards the end of fiscal 2024, which helped us significantly meet demands that our customers had for the fourth quarter. So we don't expect our revenue for fiscal 2024 to significantly differ from fiscal 2023. But that lumpiness, we pretty much expect to kind of wear as the year progresses. So…\nJeffrey Bernstein : That's great. And in terms of the forward-looking indicators in the business, can you say anything about book-to-bill, is that continue to be over one.\nDan Baker : This is Dan Baker, Jeff. We don't have precise book-to-bill data, but we've been pleased with the order flow. And although the industry is down, we've outperformed the industry, and our goal is to continue to outperform the industry. So we're getting new orders. There is a little bit of catch-up still in our current order flow. But we're optimistic and we're pleased that we've been able to significantly outperform the industry. As Daniel mentioned in the prepared remarks, the semiconductor industry is down 21% in the most recent report, and our product sales were up 23%.\nJeffrey Bernstein : Dan, can you say anything sort of qualitatively -- you had a kind of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with the supply chain of stress that was out there. And additionally, people really starting to think about their supply chain safety and more domestic sourcing and that kind of thing. What do you think you came away with in terms of gain of customers? I know a number of customers is not terribly indicative of anything, but anything you could say about that about sort of new designs with new customers?\nDan Baker : Yes, exactly. And you're exactly right, Jeff, that we did get some excellent opportunities to get a foot in the door during the period of shortages. And we've retained those customers. There was, as you might expect, a certain amount of double ordering and making sure that customers had adequate supplies. But we were able to -- it was priceless marketing and that we were able to reach risk-averse customers who might not have considered a smaller company like NVE prior to the shortages. So it was and continues to be a great opportunity, and as we've said before, while they probably or some of them might have come for the lead time, we're confident that they're going to stay for the excellent products and the excellent service that they get from NVE.\nJeffrey Bernstein : That's great. And then just curious, PUFs have been a source of some volatility in revenue. There's a lot of discussion about having to manufacture a lot higher volumes of armaments. I know you kind of can't tell us a lot about that business or you'll have to kill us. But could you just talk a little bit about PUFs, was their business in the quarter? Any visibility on PUFs in the next few quarters?\nDaniel Nelson : Yes, Jeff, this is Daniel. So as we did mention, we saw a considerable increase in our sensor and product sales lines. But unfortunately, did experience some decrease in anti-tamper sales. And that's not unusual because sales -- anti-tamper still very significantly and it's dependent heavily on procurement schedules by our customers. So -- but we're still positive that there are opportunities out there for more anti-tamper sales. But long story short, we did see a decrease in anti-tamper sales for the quarter.\nDan Baker : If I could just add also in addition to what Daniel said. As you point out, Jeff, there are opportunities for defense system sales. And it's -- the defense -- the Department of Defense does say that anti-tamper is -- one of the applications of anti-tamper is to protect sensitive technology that might be sold to allies or provided to allies. So of course, there's been a fair amount of that. So in the long run, it's -- there are excellent business opportunities, but it can be, as you correctly pointed out, it can vary significantly quarter-to-quarter depending on defense procurement schedules.\nJeffrey Bernstein : That's great. And then lastly, just a question on how customer behaviors around big product launches. You've got some larger customers, both in the hearing aid market and in the med tech arena. And there are some important kinds of product introductions coming. Do they generally kind of stock up in advance of launching a product or it probably doesn't cost much to stock up on sensors or is there sort of a ramp as they ramp? Or is there really no pattern around that?\nDan Baker : Yes. This is Dan Baker. That's a great question, Jeff. It actually is relatively slow in the startups because often there are regulatory restrictions. So a medical device manufacturer, particularly a life support or a Class III medical device manufacturer might have to gradually roll out a product. In many cases, products are rolled out in certain regions. First, the U.S. has a relatively long regulatory cycle through the FDA. So what we often see is long development cycles and a gradual ramp-up as the products are deployed as the regulatory approvals are met, and as the -- as more and more practitioners might use the products. So it's been, as you know, an excellent business for us. We provide a unique benefit proposition in terms of reliability, miniaturization and low power. And those are things that are very important in the medical device industry. And we've been willing to invest in it and to be patient with the regulatory cycles. And so it's a significant part of our business now, and we expect it to be a significant part of our business for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One moment for our next question. And our next question is from the line of [Hirosto Makovsky], Private Investor.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Hirosto Makovsky]. Congratulations on great results, especially as compared to the rest of the semiconductor industry. Could you talk a little bit more about any inroads you're making into more mass market applications and where you might be going into if that is happening?\nDan Baker : Yes, absolutely. So in addition to the markets that we've talked about, we have invested in markets that are longer term, some that we've highlighted include the hearables market, which includes OTC hearing aids. We see excellent opportunities there and then the broader hearables revolution, which we're engaged with hearables developers and we're developing sensors that can be used in next-generation hearables in particular, we have sensors that are compatible with rechargeable batteries that are often used in consumer wearables and hearables rather, disposable batteries generally used in traditional hearing aids. And our new parts have received positive feedback, and we have design wins in that space. The design cycles aren't quite as long as for life support medical as we talked about in the previous question, but there are still longer development cycles, but we're investing in that.  The other area that I would highlight would be the automotive market. So we've cautioned that automotive can take a while, but we've continued to invest in the development and qualification of products especially for sensors in electric and autonomous and more sophisticated safety systems for next-generation cars. Our parts are smaller, more precise, and lower power, more rugged than conventional electronics, and those are important advantages in the automotive market. We're also expanding our DC to DC power converter product lines, which I touched on during our prepared remarks, which have potential in the electric vehicle market, but also in energy conversion such as green energy and energy storage markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: Would you be able to keep your margins the same in those mass market devices or would be kind of lowering your margins, but still making more money?\nDan Baker : Yes, that's a great question. So the way we look at it is we're looking at the total contribution that a new product line might add and the shareholder value that it could create. So we don't have a specific target market, target gross margin, for example, and in markets such as consumer markets where the gross margins might be lower, but the volumes might be higher. We certainly consider that when we make investment decisions. So it's possible that these types of markets could have lower gross margins, but we also see them as large markets where we have a convincing benefit proposition. So we think it makes sense, and we're not looking at a particular margin that we have to have as a minimum. Obviously, we have to be able to demonstrate that we can make money, but we're not using gross margin as a primary metric.\nUnidentified Analyst: Have you gotten new automotive qualifications yet?\nDan Baker : So we have some qualifications. We have a letter of conformance from the IATF under Standard 16949. We look at individual products. So as you probably know, the company needs to be certified for automotive in practice, that's the IATF 16949. And so we passed those audits and then the products themselves often have to be approved. So we look at the product approvals on a case-by-case basis and -- but we certainly have gone through much of the testing involved in things like Q101 or other automotive-specific certification. So we're prepared to do that. And it's a significant -- that's part of the reason why the design cycles might be -- might take a while, but we're prepared to do that. We have people who know how to do it. And we recognize that, that's part of getting into these markets.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's good to hear. And what is your advantage in automotive because there, you can afford to have like kind of higher, bigger size than what you need in hearables and in pacemakers. But do you have a significant power efficiency advantage?\nDan Baker : Yes. That's a good point. So size is sometimes important in the automotive industry. Often, they're trying to cram more and more sophisticated electronics in an existing footprint. But you're right, it's not -- it's a lot bigger than a hearing aid, for example, or a pacemaker. But as you point out, lower power is an advantage because, particularly for our hybrid and electric vehicles, that helps determine the vehicle's range and the equivalent miles per gallon. So every little bit helps and lower power in sensors or couplers can be important and the ruggedness of our parts, the fact that they are inherently nonvolatile, that they can withstand extremes and temperature and electrical transient is important in the automotive market.  And then the final advantage I might highlight is the precision. So having a very precise sensor is important for some applications. Now some applications, one could imagine a seat position sensor, which is not extremely critical. But in many cases, things like things like motor rotation or position or current sensing for motors and batteries, precision can be an important advantage. So those are the advantages that we highlight in the automotive market.\nUnidentified Analyst: And I assume you have like no drainage current for current sensing whatsoever because you're not connected to the wire, right?\nDan Baker : Yes. So we often call that noncontact current sensing. So there aren't the losses. You appear very familiar with that. So if one puts a conventional device that's often called a shunt or resistor, in series with the device you're trying to sense, there's inherent losses there. So the way our current sensors work is -- most of our current sensors is their noncontact. And so therefore, they would go next to the wire or the circuit board, and there are no inherent losses and they can sense very high currents without having to have a resistor in series. So that's part of the efficiency advantage that I was talking about. So that would eventually ripple through to higher efficiency and longer range for an electric vehicle.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. And I assume the DC to DC converters have a similar efficiency advantage?\nDan Baker : Yes. So the advantage there is that we can drive things like high side switches for power conversion and our devices are fully isolated. So they allow more efficient power conversion either in electric vehicles, power storage or other types of energy storage markets. So the efficiency advantages that accrue there also from our couplers is that they can switch faster, the couplers can switch faster than conventional isolators. And the faster they can switch, the more efficient they are and the lower the losses because the switches that are used for power conversion are very efficient when they're on or off, but they're not very efficient during the transitions. So we've reduced that transition time.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Sounds great. And I understand all those applications require some time to get qualified and get to market. When are you going to see revenues from these? Are you already seeing revenues from this?\nDan Baker : We're seeing some small revenues. It's not enough to be significant, but we look at it as long-term opportunities. And so you asked a great question what are we looking at longer term. And we do see it as a longer-term opportunity. We don't have a particular time frame, but we want it to be as fast as possible, of course.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Thank you. Thank you for getting into the details of complicated technical details and good luck.\nOperator: And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Dan Baker for closing remarks.\nDan Baker : Well, if there are no other questions, we were pleased to report continued growth with product sales up 23% and operating cash flow, up 51%. We look forward to seeing some of you at our annual meeting on August 3 and to our next earnings call in October. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
