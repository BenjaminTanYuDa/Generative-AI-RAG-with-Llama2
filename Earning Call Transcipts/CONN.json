My name is Doug, and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. The company's earnings release dated August 30, 2023, was distributed before market opened this morning and can be accessed via the company's Investor Relations website at ir.conns.com. During today's call, management will discuss, among other financial performance measures, adjusted retail segment, operating loss and net debt. Please refer to the company's earnings release that was issued today for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures. I must remind you that some of the statements made in this call are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements represent the company's present expectations or beliefs concerning future events. The company cautions that such statements are necessarily based on certain assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, which cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated today. Your speakers today are Norman Miller, the company's Interim CEO; and George Bchara, the company's CFO. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Miller. Please go ahead.\nNorm Miller: Good morning, and welcome to Conn's second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. I'll start today's call with an update on our strategic priorities before turning the call over to George, who will review our financial results in more detail. The strategic initiatives we are pursuing to turn around our retail performance and better serve our core credit-constrained customers are taking hold and continue to perform in line with our expectations. For the second quarter, sales financed through our Conn's in-house credit option increased 4.3% year-over-year and sales through our lease-to-own offering increased 2.5%. In addition, we produced record quarterly eCommerce revenue and grew credit applications by over 30%. We also experienced a significant improvement in retail gross margin, which expanded by 230 basis points over the same period a year ago to nearly 37%. This is the highest level in almost two years and reflects the benefits of the pricing and assortment changes we have made since the end of last year. While we expect the economic environment to remain fluid over the near term, we continue to focus on improving profitability, controlling credit risk, and pursuing strategies that leverage our powerful value proposition to serve our customers and drive sales. I am confident in the progress we are making and believe we will emerge from this period as a stronger company that is well positioned to serve the growing needs of our customers. So with this introduction, I want to highlight the strategies we are pursuing, starting with our efforts to better serve our core credit-constrained customers. Since I rejoined the company in October 2022, I have consistently discussed the importance of refocusing our strategy to leverage our unique credit retail business model. I have a strong belief that our business resonates with our core customers who now more than ever need the multiple payment offerings we provide. By combining unmatched payment options across the entire credit spectrum with essential home-based product categories and an elevated shopping experience, we provide a powerful value proposition to our customers. I believe second quarter sales growth within our Conn's in-house and lease-to-own offerings as well as record quarterly eCommerce sales reflect the positive momentum that is underway within our business. This success follows two important initiatives that we have discussed over the past several quarters. First, we adjusted our marketing spend towards channels that are most effective with our credit customer and changed our marketing message to emphasize our credit-oriented value proposition. Second, we completed the launch of our new application process that makes it easier for customers to apply for our payment options with little-to-no impact on their credit score. Following the nearly 10% year-over-year growth in credit applications we experienced in the first quarter, momentum continued in the second quarter as applications increased over 30% to reach the highest level of application growth we have experienced in nine years. Credit applications are a critical leading indicator of sales and our application growth is driving sales within our in-house financing and lease-to-own segments. We have also experienced steady improvements in overall sales trends, which have improved since February as our refocused marketing efforts and strategic priorities take hold, and sales benefit from our new application process and our growing eCommerce business. Same-store sales were down 15.4% for the second quarter, which is the third quarter of sequential improvement and an over 1,000 basis point improvement from last year's third quarter. Top line trends have continued to improve and month-to-date same-store sales in August are down 13% and total sales are down 10.7%. The continual improvements in same-store sales since last year's third quarter have been driven primarily by a significant turnaround in sales financed through our in-house payment offerings as a result of the growth strategies we are pursuing. We have maintained a conservative approach to credit underwriting, which has supported stable performance within our credit segment even as we navigate a more challenging economic environment. In addition, sales within our lease-to-own segment increased during the quarter, reflecting our first positive quarter of lease-to-own sales in 1.5 years. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to achieve positive same-store sales in the coming quarters as our growth strategies continue taking hold and demand for our payment options increases. Softer sales from cash and higher credit quality customers has offset the growth we have experienced in sales through our Conn's in-house and lease-to-own offerings and we expect this trend will continue throughout this fiscal year. We believe sales to cash and higher credit quality customers are being impacted by several factors, including lower discretionary spending for home-related products following an extended period of excess consumer liquidity, pulled forward demand and tighter underwriting in general from prime lenders. Our eCommerce growth is the next strategic priority I'd like to review today. We achieved record quarterly e-commerce sales during the second quarter of $27.2 million, a 41.5% increase over the same quarter last year. In fact, second quarter eCommerce sales are higher than we achieved on an annual basis just three years ago. Year-to-date, eCommerce sales have increased 32.9% to nearly $50 million, and we believe we are well positioned to achieve over $100 million in eCommerce sales this fiscal year compared to $79 million last year. Record quarterly eCommerce sales follows multiple years of investment focused on optimizing our digital strategy and our ability to capitalize on our best-in-class logistics and delivery capabilities. I am encouraged by the continued progress we are making as we capitalize on a tremendous opportunity to scale our online business and drive annual eCommerce sales to over $300 million in the next several years. Looking at our lease-to-own payment solutions in more detail, we continue to focus on optimizing our in-house lease-to-own product known as Improvement Financial, which we believe has the potential to contribute to significant growth in both revenue and earnings in the coming years. Improvement Financial allows us to directly provide another profitable option to target a larger addressable market, including the approximately 670,000 applicants that did not qualify for Conn's in-house financing over the past 12 months. As a reminder, we started to originate our first in-house lease-to-own transactions through Improvement Financial in early 2023, and we have continued to optimize our in-house lease-to-own product. While I continue to believe that our in-house lease-to-own program will be transformative for Conn's, we are taking a more cautious approach to the expansion across our store base to ensure credit performance for this new product remains stable as we navigate an uncertain macroeconomic environment. As a result, we now expect improvement financial will be offered across the majority of our stores and at conns.com next fiscal year. Our overall assumptions remain intact and once improvement financial is mature in the coming years, we continue to believe annual lease-to-own sales can more than double from approximately $81 million last year and grow to over 15% of our retail sales. As you can see, Improvement Financial is a transformative opportunity that we believe will unlock significant value. Looking at our retail footprint in more detail. Year-to-date, we have opened seven new stores and expect to open a total of 10 new stores this fiscal year. As we have previously stated, after these stores open, we intend to pause new store openings over the next couple of years. With major investments across our credit and retail segments behind us, we believe we have a multiyear opportunity to drive retail growth within our existing locations and online without the need to open new stores or distribution centers. We believe this strategy will maximize profitability by increasing revenue per store and leveraging our fixed operating costs. Before I turn the call over to George to share more details on our financials, I want to reiterate my confidence in our business, higher sales to our core credit constrained customers, increased eCommerce sales and the expansion in retail gross margin demonstrate the success our key strategic priorities are having on the business. While we still have work to do, I believe Conn's is headed in the right direction, and I am excited by the opportunities we are pursuing to create long-term value for our customers, our team members and our shareholders. With this overview, I'll turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Bchara: Thanks, Norm. Our second quarter results demonstrate the success of our efforts to better serve our core credit-constrained customers and turn around our retail performance. I am encouraged by the progress we are making and continue to believe we have an enormous opportunity to profitably grow our business in the future. On a consolidated basis, total revenues were $306.9 million for the second quarter, representing an 11.5% year-over-year decline. For the second quarter, the company reported a GAAP net loss of $1.39 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.09 per diluted share for the same period in fiscal year 2023. As a reminder, reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are available in our second quarter earnings press release that was issued this morning. Looking at the performance of our retail segment in more detail. Total retail revenues were $246.3 million in the second quarter, representing a 12% year-over-year decline. The decrease in retail revenue was primarily driven by a 15.4% decline in same-store sales and partially offset by new store growth. Same-store sales during the second quarter were impacted by lower discretionary spending for home-related products following an extended period of excess consumer liquidity, which resulted in accelerated sales. Retail gross margin for the second quarter increased 230 basis points to 36.9% compared to 34.6% for the same period in fiscal year 2023, primarily driven by pricing and assortment changes, a more profitable product mix and normalizing freight costs. The increase was partially offset by the deleveraging of fixed distribution costs. SG&A expenses in our retail segment for the second quarter were $101.4 million compared to $98 million for the same period last fiscal year. The increase in SG&A expenses reflect the impact of new stores opened over the past 18 months, which was partially offset by a decline in variable costs and lower labor costs as a result of cost savings initiatives. Due to lower retail sales, SG&A expenses were 41.3% of retail sales for the second quarter compared to 35.1% for the same period in fiscal year 2023. For the second quarter, retail segment operating loss was $10.4 million compared to retail segment operating income of $100,000 for the same period in fiscal year 2023. There were no non-GAAP adjustments to retail segment operating income in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared to an adjusted loss of $1.4 million for the same period in fiscal year 2023. Turning to our second quarter credit segment performance. Finance charges and other revenues declined 5.6% year-over-year to $63.1 million, primarily due to a decline in the average balance of the customer receivable portfolio, partially offset by an increase in insurance commissions and late fees. As a percent of the portfolio, the 60-day delinquency balance was 11.1% at July 31, 2023, compared to 11% at July 31, 2022. In addition, this represents a 50 basis point decline from the first quarter of this year compared to a sequential increase of 70 basis points in the second quarter of last year. The balance of re-aged accounts as a percent of the portfolio was 15.9% compared to 16.1% for the same period in fiscal year 2023. In addition, the carrying value of re-aged accounts continues to improve and remains at one of the lowest levels in almost a decade. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, net charge-offs as a percent of the average portfolio balance were 15.8% compared to 13.7% for the same period last fiscal year. During the second quarter, the credit provision for bad debts was $33.2 million compared to $26.8 million for the same period last fiscal year. The $6.4 million year-over-year increase in the credit provision for bad debts was primarily driven by higher year-over-year net charge-offs and a smaller year-over-year reduction in the allowance for bad debts. The company reported credit segment loss before taxes of $4.5 million in the second quarter compared to credit segment income of $7.9 million for the same period last fiscal year. The greater credit segment loss before taxes was primarily due to higher interest expense as well as a reduction in our credit spread, which declined to 7.2% compared to 9.6% in the same period last fiscal year. Turning now to our balance sheet. At July 31, 2023, we had $611.4 million in net debt compared to $531.2 million at July 31, 2022. Net debt as a percent of the ending portfolio balance was approximately 61.9% at the end of the second quarter. To further improve our capital position and access to liquidity, during the second quarter, we entered into a $50 million 3-year delayed draw term loan. As of July 31, 2023, we had $239.7 million of cash plus availability under our revolving credit and delayed draw term loan facilities. In addition, on August 17, we completed a $273.7 million ABS transaction. Our latest ABS transaction was 10x oversubscribed, reflecting the extremely strong demand for our bonds. While the ABS market has improved over the past year, the market remains fluid and recent actions to improve our capital position demonstrate the company's ability to access the capital markets even during volatile market conditions. As a result, we continue to believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us with flexibility to support the current needs of our business while investing in our long-term growth initiatives. As our strategies take hold and continue to perform in line with our expectations, our outlook for fiscal 2024 hasn't changed since our first quarter call. We continue to expect retail gross margins to benefit from lower freight expenses this fiscal year. While we remain focused on managing costs, we continue to expect annual SG&A expenses to increase year-over-year by $15 million to $25 million, primarily due to new stores and investments in our e-commerce growth strategy. We continue to believe our annual interest expense will increase year-over-year by approximately $40 million to $45 million, and we expect our effective tax rate for the remainder of the fiscal year to be impacted by further adjustments to the valuation allowance. From a top line perspective, we expect continued improvements in total retail sales and same-store sales as we benefit from the growth strategies we discussed today. Overall, we believe our second quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year demonstrate the positive momentum underway across our business and the growing success of our strategic initiatives. Finally, I want to share my thanks to all our team members for their continued hard work, service and dedication. So with this overview, Norm and I are happy to take your questions. Operator, please open the call up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Nagel: Hi guys. Good morning.\nNorm Miller: Good morning, Brian.\nGeorge Bchara: Good morning.\nBrian Nagel: Definitely some nice positives here, so congratulations.\nNorm Miller: Thank you.\nBrian Nagel: So the first question I have -- I've got a few questions. I'll go through in succession. But the first question, so Norm, you called out the -- your comments, the improving credit application numbers. It sounds like that was accelerated here in the fiscal third quarter. So I guess the question I have there is, as you look at that metric, is it -- the consumers applying for credit or at Conn's accelerated pace? Is it the same consumer? Or are you seeing that mix, so to say, change?\nNorm Miller: What I would say, Brian, is it's certainly demonstrating demand for loan -- for lending and products. out there and increasing demand in the marketplace. Now part of that is because of our shift in marketing towards that consumer versus a year ago. But even with that shift in marketing emphasis towards the credit consumer. I would say that there's definitely an increasing demand in the marketplace as a result of banks and prime lenders as a general rule tightening which historically, if you look at economic more economic challenge times, it usually benefits our Conn's business and our LTO business. As far as the mix in it, I would say it's kind of -- it's heavily based towards the near prime and the subprime consumer.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. That's helpful. And then my second question, I guess this will be a bigger picture, but looking at the progression here, you're talking about a lot of the positives here in the second quarter, the initiatives that place Conn's really started to take hold. So as you look at this and you're recognizing your comp store sales while getting better still solidly negative, you're still on a P&L basis, losing money. How do you view the trajectory here? Is it just an ongoing benefit of these initiatives is there some type of unlocks we're going to be hitting here in the forthcoming quarters?\nNorm Miller: I think it's just steady improvement on it from an ongoing basis now in the third and fourth quarter, especially in the third quarter, we lap some tougher comp numbers. So that's an easier comp numbers. So that will make -- that will be a little bit of a benefit. But unfortunately, it's -- there's not a single silver bullet that's going to unlock and get us ultimately a positive comp. It's -- the -- as you heard, our Conn's financing and our LTO are actually positive comping those segments year-over-year. So part of it is continuing to build on those segments and then mitigating on that cash customer and the high credit quality customer mitigating there and, at the same time, continuing to accelerate that eCommerce business as well, which is, if I would highlight anything, I think, has the potential to be a material unlock to drive incremental sales here over the next 24 months.\nBrian Nagel: Got it. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nNorm Miller: Thanks Brian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Joseph with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nKyle Joseph: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So the sequential decline in delinquencies normally from a seasonal perspective, we would expect that to increase. So is that a function of underwriting changes, customer mix, a broadly healthier customer? Or what drove that?\nGeorge Bchara: Yes. And I would expand that, Kyle, to say that even into the third quarter, we've seen delinquencies remained stable, which is down a bit year-over-year. from a trend standpoint. I mean, I think as we've talked about, we've shifted our mix from a performance standpoint so that the bulk of our originations are to that higher credit quality risk Tier A and risk Tier B customer. And we've seen that customer remain more stable here this year from a performance standpoint and are encouraged with what we're seeing there from both an origination standpoint and also from a performance standpoint, even as we're operating in an uncertain and challenged macro environment. The further you go down that credit spectrum, the more stress we see with that consumer.\nKyle Joseph: Got it. That makes sense. And then, Norm, I think you alluded to some credit tightening in prime. Obviously, that's going to be a headwind for you guys in the near term on some of those prime sales. But longer term, how does Conn's do when the credit environment is tight? Or for instance, like if we do go into a hard landing, what do you expect -- what are the opportunities there?\nNorm Miller: Yes. What I would say is it actually -- you're right, if we go into a harder landing and it's more challenging from an economic standpoint, that actually creates more opportunities from us from a sales standpoint. If you go back to 2008, you go back in other economic times, that actually creates sales opportunities for us. The balance we have to have is watching the portfolio because if there's any stress, we feel during that it can be out of the existing portfolio and what happens with that consumer base. But if we're underwriting to George's point, at that higher end of it of those credit quality customers, and we've done that purposefully as we've gone into these uncertain economic times because if it does turn into a more challenging landing, we think the portfolio will weather better, and it will absolutely provide us sales opportunities as folks tighten higher up the credit spectrum.\nKyle Joseph: Great. And then one last one for me. Margins really snapped back in the quarter. Any onetime things there? Is this a good kind of run rate? And I know you highlighted that you expect some ongoing improvements there, but just give us a sense for the quick snapback and where you see it heading from here?\nGeorge Bchara: Yes. No onetime items in the quarter, Kyle. It was really driven by a number of factors that we talked about. First was some pricing and assortment changes that we're starting to see the benefit of here in the third quarter that we would expect to continue, including some pricing changes on ancillary fees that we're seeing the benefit of in the third quarter. And we would -- in the second quarter, we would expect to continue here for the remainder of the year. And then as you look forward, really, we're still seeing the benefit of now lower freight costs, impact margin on the furniture side, and there's some additional upside for the balance of the year there. The other factor, as you look longer term here, we're still dealing with deleveraging on fixed costs on lower sales this quarter. And as sales continue to improve and ultimately turn positive, you'll see another benefit from the leverage of fixed cost on margin. So we're very pleased with where margin is right now and expect levels here to sustain for the remainder of the year.\nKyle Joseph: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to management for closing remarks.\nNorm Miller: Thanks. First, I want to recognize and acknowledge all of our associates for all their hard -- continued hard work and contributions day in and day out. We are who we are because of them. So I appreciate their hard work. And I also appreciate everyone's on the call here, your interest in the company. We look forward to talking to you at the end of the third quarter. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.\nNorm Miller: Thanks, guys."

My name is Donna and I will be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. The company’s earnings release dated June 1, 2023 was distributed before market opened this morning and can be accessed via the company’s Investor Relations website at ir.conns.com. During today’s call, management will discuss, among other financial performance measures, adjusted retail segment operating loss, adjusted net loss per share and net debt. Please refer to the company’s earnings release that was issued today for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP measures. I must remind you that some of the statements made in this call are forward-looking statements within the meanings of the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements represent the company’s present expectations or beliefs concerning future events. The company cautions that such statements are necessarily based on certain assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated today. Your speakers today are Norm Miller, the company’s Interim CEO; and George Bchara, the company’s CFO. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Miller. Please go ahead.\nNorm Miller: Good morning, and welcome to Conn’s first quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. I’ll start today’s call with an update on our strategic priorities before turning the call over to George, who will review our financial results in more detail. Our first quarter results were generally in line with our expectations and reflect a challenging macroeconomic environment. Despite a difficult backdrop, we continue to position the business for a return to profitable sales growth by refocusing our efforts to better serve our core credit-constrained customers launching an in-house lease-to-own offering and expanding our e-commerce business. During the first quarter, we successfully executed against these strategic priorities, and we have started to see progress against these initiatives. This includes growing applications, improving sales trends within our Conn’s in-house and lease-to-own segments and accelerating e-commerce sales. While we expect a challenging economic landscape to continue throughout the year, we believe we are on the right track to emerge from this period as a stronger company that is well positioned to serve the growing needs of our customers. With this introduction, I want to highlight the progress we are making, starting with our efforts to better serve our core credit-constrained customers. Since I rejoined the company in October 2022, I have consistently discussed the importance of refocusing our strategy to leverage our unique credit retail business model. I have a strong belief that our business resonates with our core customers who now more than ever need the multiple payment offerings we provide. By combining unmatched payment options across the entire credit spectrum with essential home-based product categories and an elevated shopping experience, we provide a powerful value proposition to our customers. We have recently made two significant changes to drive sales to our core customers. First, we adjusted our marketing spend towards channels that are most effective with our credit customer and changed our marketing message to emphasize our credit-oriented value proposition. Second, as we discussed last quarter, we launched a new innovative application process that makes it easier for the millions of visitors to our stores and to our website to apply for our payment options with little to no impact on their credit score. These two changes are having a positive impact on applications and Conn’s credit sales, and we experienced a meaningful acceleration in application volume during the first quarter. Applications increased approximately 10%, which represents the first quarter of application growth in the past 16 months. Applications are a critical leading indicator of sales and our application growth is starting to drive sales within our in-house financing, and lease-to-own segments. We have also experienced steady improvements in overall sales trends, which have accelerated since February, as our renewed marketing efforts take hold and sales benefit from our new application process, our growing e-commerce business and our refocused strategy. In March and April 2023, monthly retail sales through our in-house financing option were positive, and this trend accelerated into May. We have maintained a consistent approach to credit underwriting and recent improvements in retail sales are being driven by the growth strategies we are pursuing. In addition, we believe demand for our payment options will continue to increase as other lenders tighten their credit standards and consumers look for solutions that spread out payments of big-ticket home-related products. Sales within our lease-to-own segment are experiencing similar improvements, which helps manage credit risk and supports the success of our refocused growth strategies. As demand from our core customer segment increases, Conn, like other retailers, is seeing evolving consumer behavior, especially from cash and higher credit quality customers. We believe this is being impacted by several factors, including lower discretionary spending for home-related products, following an extended period of excess consumer liquidity, pull-forward demand and tighter underwriting in general from prime lenders. We expect these trends to impact demand from higher credit quality customers throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. Overall, sales trends have improved or remained stable since last year’s third quarter as we refocused the business on our core credit-constrained customers. Positive momentum in both Conn’s in-house finance sales and LTO sales has continued in May, but has been offset by weaker trends to cash and higher credit quality customers. As a result, total retail sales for the month of May were down approximately 14%, while same-store sales were down approximately 17%. We believe, we are well positioned to offset the softness from cash and higher credit quality consumers later this year as we benefit from our strategic initiatives, including the recent launch of our in-house lease-to-own product known as Improvement Financial. Like other transformations the company has been through over the last 20 years, bringing the LTO business in-house has the potential to contribute to significant growth in both revenue and earnings in the coming years. Improvement Financial allows us to provide another profitable option to target a larger addressable market, including the approximately 600,000 applicants that did not qualify for Conn’s in-house financing over the past 12 months. Since our differentiated credit retail business model enables us to capture both the retail gross margin and lease income, we believe Conn’s can ultimately approve more LTO applicants and provide greater purchasing power than other providers. We also believe we have a compelling opportunity to drive repeat customer relationships by leveraging insight from the payment history of our LTO customers. We will use this information to graduate in-house LTO customers to future Conn’s credit customers, building deeper relationships and helping our customers improve their credit. As we mentioned on our last call, Improvement Financial went live in early 2023 in 3 Houston area stores. And as of today’s call, we have expanded to 46 locations. We are taking a measured approach to implementing the program to ensure its long-term success. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect Improvement Financial will be offered across the majority of our stores and at conns.com. Once mature in the coming years, we continue to believe annual LTO sales can more than double from approximately $81 million last year and grow to over 15% of our retail sales. As you can see, Improvement Financial is a transformative opportunity that we believe will unlock significant value over the coming years. Our e-commerce expansion is the next strategic priority I’d like to review today. We continue to optimize our e-commerce strategy after last year’s successful platform conversion and recent enhancements to our application process. During the quarter, we expanded our dropship program and overall assortment, launched new AI-driven technologies and improved the photography and content of our online furniture offering. The powerful e-commerce platform and strategy we have created produced record first quarter e-commerce sales of $22.7 million. In fact, after only a slight year-over-year increase in the previous quarter, e-commerce growth accelerated during the first quarter and increased in total by 24.6%. I am encouraged by the progress we are making and anticipate e-commerce sales this fiscal year can increase to well over $100 million. We have a tremendous opportunity to scale our online business, which we expect to grow to over $300 million in annual sales over the next several years. Now looking at our retail footprint. During the first quarter, we decided to end our test with Belk, as we couldn’t offer their customers our in-house financing and lease-to-own payment options, limiting our sales opportunities. While we were disappointed by the outcome of the test with Belk, we have learned valuable lessons about the strength of our unmatched payment options. In addition, our leadership team continues to promote a culture focused on pursuing innovative opportunities to reach more customers. Additionally, as we mentioned on our last call, after we opened 11 new stores planned for this year, we intend to pause new store openings over the next couple of years. With major investments across our retail and credit segments behind us, we believe we have a multiyear opportunity to drive retail growth within our existing locations and online without the need to open new stores or distribution centers. We believe this strategy will maximize profitability by increasing revenue per store and leveraging our fixed operating cost. Before I turn the call over to George to share more details on our financials, I want to reiterate my confidence in our business. The progress we made during the first quarter, growing applications, improving sales within both our Conn’s in-house and lease-to-own segments and accelerating e-commerce sales are encouraging signs that our refocused strategies are helping turnaround our financial and operating results. I have a deep conviction that our business resonates with our customers and a strong belief in our leadership team’s ability to deliver on our strategic priorities. With this overview, I’ll turn the call over to George.\nGeorge Bchara: Thanks, Norm. We are excited by the progress we are making across several aspects of our business, including growing applications, improving sales trends and accelerating e-commerce sales. We believe we have an enormous opportunity to profitably grow as we pursue strategies aimed at refocusing on our core customer. On a consolidated basis, total revenues were $284.6 million for the first quarter, representing a 16.3% year-over-year decline. For the first quarter, the company reported a GAAP net loss of $1.47 per diluted share compared to net income of $0.25 per diluted share for the same period in fiscal year 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $1.52 per diluted share for the first quarter, which excludes the gain related to the sale of a single store location, partially offset by store closure costs associated with the decision to end the store within a store test with Belk. There were no adjustments to net income in the first quarter of the last fiscal year, and reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are available in our first quarter earnings press release that was issued this morning. Looking at the performance of our retail segment in more detail. Total retail revenues were $224 million in the first quarter, representing a 17.8% year-over-year decline. The decrease in retail revenue was primarily driven by a 20.1% decline in same-store sales, partially offset by new store growth. Same-store sales during the first quarter were impacted by lower discretionary spending for home-related products following an extended period of excess consumer liquidity, which resulted in accelerated sales. Retail gross margin for the first quarter declined to 33.5% compared to 34.5% for the same period in fiscal year 2023, primarily driven by higher freight costs and deleveraging of fixed distribution costs from lower sales. We expect retail gross margin to improve over time as retail sales recover, and we realize the benefit of lower international shipping costs. SG&A expenses in our retail segment for the first quarter decreased to $95.8 million compared to $96 million for the same period last fiscal year. Lower SG&A expenses reflect the effort of our cost savings initiatives and declines in variable costs that more than offset increases related to new store growth. Due to lower retail sales, SG&A expenses were 42.8% of retail sales for the first quarter compared to 35.2% for the same period in fiscal year 2023. For the first quarter, retail segment operating loss was $19.7 million compared to a retail segment operating loss of $2.1 million for the same period in fiscal year 2023. On a non-GAAP basis, retail segment operating loss for the first quarter was $20.5 million compared to a loss of $2.1 million for the same period in fiscal year 2023. Turning to our first quarter credit segment performance. Finance charges and other revenues declined 8.2% year-over-year to $61.8 million, primarily due to a decline in the average balance of the customer receivable portfolio as well as a reduction in insurance commissions. Underlying portfolio health remains stable. However, normalizing trends, current economic conditions and a more restrictive re-aged policy have impacted overall performance. As a percent of the portfolio, the 60-day delinquency balance was 11.6% at April 30, 2023, compared to 10.3% at April 30, 2022, which benefited from excess consumer liquidity. The balance of re-aged accounts as a percent of the portfolio was 16.6% compared to 16.4% for the same period in fiscal year 2023. In addition, the carrying value of re-aged accounts continues to improve and remains at one of the lowest levels in almost a decade. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, net charge-offs as a percent of the average portfolio balance were 15.6%, compared to 11.9% for the same period last fiscal year. During the first quarter, the credit provision for bad debts was $28.8 million compared to $14.6 million for the same period last fiscal year. The $14.2 million year-over-year increase in the credit provision for bad debts was primarily driven by higher net charge-offs and a smaller year-over-year decline in the customer accounts receivable portfolio. The company reported a credit segment loss before taxes of $17.2 million in the first quarter compared to a credit segment income of $10.5 million for the same period last fiscal year. The greater credit segment loss before taxes was primarily due to higher interest expense as well as a reduction in our credit spread, which declined to 7.8% compared to 11.6% in the same period last fiscal year. Turning now to our balance sheet. At April 30, 2023, we had $570.1 million in net debt compared to $529.9 million at April 30, 2022. Net debt as a percent of the ending portfolio balance was approximately 58% at the end of the first quarter, which remains below pre-pandemic levels, and we have no near-term debt maturities. At April 30, 2023, we had $228.1 million of cash plus availability under our $650 million revolving credit facility. We continue to believe our liquidity and access to capital provides us with flexibility to support the current needs of our business while investing in our long-term growth initiatives, and we expect to complete our next ABS transaction later this fiscal year. Given the uncertain economic environment and in lieu of official guidance, I want to provide an update regarding our expectations for the remainder of the year. We expect continued improvements in total retail sales and same-store sales as we benefit from the growth strategies we have discussed today. Retail gross margins are expected to stabilize and benefit from lower freight expenses this fiscal year. We also are focused on continuously identifying opportunities to further reduce expenses. As a result, we now expect annual SG&A to increase year-over-year by $15 million to $25 million versus our prior expectation of $25 million to $35 million. This revised outlook also reflects lower expenses as a result of the decision to close all Belk locations. We are closely monitoring the current rate environment, and we believe our annual interest expense will increase year-over-year by approximately $40 million to $45 million, as we stated in our fourth quarter conference call. We expect our effective tax rate for the remainder of the fiscal year to be impacted by further adjustments to the valuation allowance. Finally, I want to share my thanks to all our team members for their continued hard work, service and dedication. So with this overview, Norm and I are happy to take your questions. Operator, please open the call up to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today’s first question is coming from Kyle Joseph of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nKyle Joseph: Hey. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to get a sense. I would say, there were a lot of headlines around tax refunds throughout the quarter, but just give us a sense for the timing and the magnitude and how that impacted both your credit performance, the size of your loan portfolio as well as demand?\nNorm Miller: Yes. Good morning Kyle. What I would say is having been around for a number of tax seasons, if you exclude the pandemic years out, that it was an average tax season from a collection standpoint. It certainly wasn’t disappointing. It kind of met in that range of expectations. What was different was we did not see the uptick to the degree on the sales side of the house that we typically see during the peak of tax season in that late February-March timeframe. We are pleased with where the portfolio performance was through the tax season and coming out of it as it normalizes to pre-pandemic, but certainly saw headwinds from a sales standpoint with the tax season.\nKyle Joseph: Got it. Thanks. And then obviously, it sounds like you have some moving parts in terms of demand by channel. Obviously, it sounds like you are seeing some improvements in your core customer and LTO. The cash customer seems like it’s definitely under pressure. But just – and obviously, there was a pull forward into ‘20 and ‘21, but do you have any sense for how far away we need to get from those years for demand to recover or what the product cycle is on average for your consumer and your product kind of selection?\nNorm Miller: Yes, couple comments on that, Kyle. First, we absolutely have seen increasing demand with our core customer, as I mentioned in my comments, both on the Conn side and the LTO side, both in-house LTO and our LTO partner. If you look at the bottom of where those sales were before – right before I came back to the company, they were down anywhere from 30% to 40% same-store sales, and we are seeing Conn’s and LTO not only become positive, but starting to accelerate. The issue is, obviously, the cash and the high credit quality customer. We continue to see headwinds there, especially in the appliance category. That was where we saw the greatest pull-forward from demand. We expect to see some easing of that with the cash and the high credit quality as the year progresses. And our challenge is how do we get that Conn’s and LTO business up at a faster pace to offset those headwinds that are going to persist, but I don’t think they are going to be as strong as the year unfolds. Now, part of that is we will lap easier comps here, the back half of the year from what the first quarter comps were from a material standpoint.\nKyle Joseph: Got it. That’s it for me. Thanks for answering my questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question is coming from Vincent Caintic of Stephens. Please go ahead.\nVincent Caintic: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just a kind of follow-up on the prior comments, but the – I guess, the attribution to the sales weakness overall being to the cash and the higher credit quality customers, but then pointing to the growth in in-house financing and lease-to-own. I was wondering if you could break out those numbers, the improvement in in-house financing and lease-to-own, just to get a sense of the opportunity there? And then for overall sales to improve, do you need to completely offset that cash weakness with in-house financing growth, or should we see kind of a recovery or an improvement in all the different categories? Thank you.\nNorm Miller: Well to answer the last part of your question, first Vincent, no, we are not – I mean both the Synchrony and the cash customer, the high credit quality and the cash customers are still very important parts of our business. And we are looking to grow those as well. It’s – so we don’t need the Conn’s and the LTO to completely make up the entire business, but the headwinds are significant, both from a macro standpoint, I think of what’s happening with that consumer from a discretionary standpoint, coupled with the pull forward that we saw there in the pandemic. Now, with the challenging economic times, as you know, Vincent, with our business, that actually creates opportunities, which we are seeing on the middle and the lower end of the credit stack with both Conn’s and with LTO. As other lenders tighten, which the prime lenders and a number, and the banks and other lenders tighten, that reduces opportunities for our customer, our core customer and that LTO to be able to finance products and not even discretionary, but the products that they need, that they were required to fill or replace. So, that’s why we are seeing growth there, which is not atypical than what we have seen in past challenging economic timeframes that actually creates sales opportunities for those elements of our credit stack. So, having said that, as I mentioned, we are still looking for strategies and working with our high credit quality partner to mitigate some of the headwinds that we are seeing in that high end of the credit spectrum. As far as the specifics, we don’t break out the sales growth on each of the categories, but we did give you an indicator we are seeing actually positive sales growth from a Conn standpoint year-over-year, which is fueled by the application growth, and that has been accelerating all the way through the month of May. And you are seeing that from the same-store sales trend. Back in quarter three, we were down almost 30%, in quarter four down 22%, quarter one down 20%. And now in May, it’s at 17%. And what I would say is that improvement of 1,300 basis points is being driven predominantly by the Conn’s and the in-house or the LTO, both in-house and AFF, not by improvements on the cash customer and the high credit quality customer.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. That detail is super helpful. Thank you for that. And then second question, just wondering if you are comfortable with your credit posture right now, I saw that the net charge-offs were down 150 basis points quarter-over-quarter, so that’s good. But just wondering if you are comfortable of where your underwriting is today or if you think you might need to tighten underwriting more or how are you thinking about that? Thank you.\nGeorge Bchara: Yes. I mean as Norm mentioned, we feel like we had a good tax season with refunds sort of in the range of our expectation. We saw a 60-day delinquency come down quarter-over-quarter from the fourth quarter. And if you look at the year-over-year difference between 60-day delinquency, it’s actually narrowed. So, we feel like we are in a good place from a credit standpoint and from an underwriting standpoint based on where we sit here today.\nNorm Miller: And what I would add, Vincent, is it’s why the leased in-house LTO is really a transformative opportunity for us, because as we get all of that business in-house later this year, we constantly look at delinquencies on a day-by-day basis of what’s happening in the buckets. And the customer – the consumer out there is still challenged. There is no question about that. We see that. And we are monitoring that very closely by having in-house LTO, it enables us on those edges if we start to see stress, to be able to move customers seamlessly from our in-house Conn’s financing to the in-house LTO, which longer term is, as I stated, I think one of the more transformative opportunities strategically that we have.\nVincent Caintic: Okay. Thank you. And last one from me, and a follow-up from the prior comment. But so underwriting seems comfortable there. I forget if there was tighter underwriting or tightening underwriting over the past year and whether or not, let’s say, as we get through the rest of this calendar year, whether we will be able to lap that tighter underwriting. And so maybe volumes improved from that point on, just if you have any comment on that?\nNorm Miller: What I would say, Vincent, is that we are always looking at and making tweaks to our underwriting policy. But if you look at the last year or so, we have not made any material changes to our underwriting policy. Having said that, Vincent, as I mentioned before, our comps were down double-digits, around 10% in the first quarter, and then they went down 20% and into the high 20s as last year evolves. So, as we lap those numbers, they weren’t driven by underwriting. They were driven by strategic shift to the business away from Conn’s and in-house LTO. But as we lap those numbers, coupled with the strategic refocus, we expect to see some tailwinds from that as the year unfolds.\nVincent Caintic: Very helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. We are showing no additional questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing comments.\nNorm Miller: Thanks. First of all, we appreciate your interest in the company. I also want to take the opportunity to reiterate George’s comments and thank all of our associates across the company for their hard work in this challenging environment. They certainly make a difference. We look forward to updating you at the next quarterly call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today’s event. You may disconnect your lines or logoff the webcast at this time, and enjoy the rest of your day."
