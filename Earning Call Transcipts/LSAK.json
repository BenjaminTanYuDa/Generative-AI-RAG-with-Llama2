As a reminder, the webcast is being recorded, and the presentation can be accessed through the webcast link as well as dialing into the Zoom conference call dial-in numbers provided. Management will address any questions you may have at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] The Webcast link, Zoom conference call dial-in numbers as well as the press release and supplementary investor presentation are available on the Investor Relations website at ir.lesakatech.com. Additionally, Lesaka filed its Form 10-Q after the US market closed yesterday, which is also available on the Lesaka Investor Relations website. As a reminder, during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and I ask you to look at the cautionary language contained in our Form 10-Q regarding the risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements. Also as a domestic filer in the United States, Lesaka reports results in US dollars under US GAAP. However, it is important to note that the operational currency is the South African rand. And as such, we analyzed our performance in South African rand. In this presentation, we will discuss our results in South African rand, which is non-GAAP. This assists investors' understanding of the underlying trends of our business. As you know, the company's results can be significantly affected by the currency fluctuations between the US dollar and the South African rand. Taking a look at today's agenda, Chris Meyer, Group CEO of Lesaka, will start with an overview of performance highlights for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and a review of Lesaka's progress against its key strategic objectives. Steven Heilbron, CEO Connect Group and Head of Merchant Division, will provide an update on the Merchant Division, followed by Lincoln Mali, CEO of Lesaka Southern Africa, who will take us through the Consumer Division's performance this quarter. Naeem Kola, Group CFO, will present a detailed overview of our financial performance for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and update you on the Q3 and full year guidance. Chris will then provide some closing remarks, after which Lesaka's incoming Executive Chairman, Ali Mazanderani, will introduce himself and outline his thoughts on Lesaka's mission and strategy. Thereafter, we will open the floor for any questions you may have. I'd now like to turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Meyer: Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings webcast and conference call. Today, we are pleased to present another quarter of continued growth and improvement in financial performance. The second quarter is characterized by higher volumes in our Merchant and Consumer divisions over the festive season, which is buoyed performance. Full marks to the whole team who have all worked so hard over this period to make sure our customer needs were met and as a result, have delivered an excellent set of results. The economic environment in South Africa remains a challenge for our merchants and consumer customers. Encouragingly, inflation has come back into SAB's target range, but interest rates are still at 14-year highs. We will hopefully see a reduction in rates during 2024, which will alleviate some pressure on consumers. Load shedding or power cuts which disrupt our merchants trading improved marginally during the past two quarters. However, we cannot as yet count on this being a long-term improvement in power supply. Overall, we do not anticipate any major change in the economic outlook for South Africa, but are optimistic that our business model will remain resilient and that we will continue to deliver on both growth and profitability. Naeem will talk to the numbers in more detail, but I would like to note one or two highlights in our group performance. As noted, Q2 is typically our biggest quarter of the year due to the festive season and we were very pleased to see a number of volume records achieved in the month of December and for the quarter as a whole. In particular, Kazang VAS delivered over ZAR3 billion in VAS throughput for the first time ever in the month of December, contributing to a VAS throughput record of ZAR8 billion for the quarter. Kazang Pay Card monthly throughput volumes exceeded ZAR1 billion for the first time in December, achieving ZAR1.2 billion for the month and exceeding ZAR3 billion for the quarter for the first time. The fundamental transformation of the Consumer division into our customer-oriented and sales-focused business is really starting to pay off, and we are seeing record number of account activations, loan disbursements and insurance policy sales since the turnaround of this business began. We have made great strides towards our vision to build the leading fintech platform, providing cash and digital solutions to small merchants and consumers in Southern Africa. M&A will play a role in achieving this vision and we continue to evaluate opportunities that will enhance our market positioning. This includes bolt-on acquisitions that will provide scale to our existing offering as well as those that will help us broaden our product offering to our clients. Our M&A focus is primarily in our merchant business. During the quarter, we made an interesting and exciting acquisition in the Kazang business, Touchsides, which Steve will talk to shortly and which will broaden our offering to merchants. From a balance sheet perspective, leverage ratios improved as we focus on reducing debt and growing group adjusted EBITDA. I am pleased to report that we continue to see improvement in our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, which reduced to 2.7 times at quarter end, compared to 3.6 times a year ago and 3.1 times at the end of quarter 1, 2024. We have exited our shareholding in Finbond during the quarter through a specific repurchase program and received a net cash flow of ZAR64 million in December 2023, which was used to pay down debt. So turning to our revenue and group adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. We grew revenue at 13% year-on-year from ZAR2.4 billion to ZAR2.7 billion, which is at the midpoint of our guidance range. On a quarterly basis, revenue increased 6%, partly due to seasonality. Group adjusted EBITDA came in slightly ahead of our guidance at ZAR181 million for the quarter and strongly up compared to ZAR130 million in Q2 2023. That's a year-on-year increase of 38%. And on a quarterly basis, group adjusted EBITDA was up 11%. In our first quarter, we achieved an important milestone in delivering a profit at an operating income level for the first time in five years. In quarter 2, operating income has continued to grow, delivering ZAR43 million for the quarter. This quarter saw another important milestone being achieved. Net income before tax, but excluding the non-operational and non-cash PPA charge, turned positive for the first time since we initiated our restructure, coming in at ZAR29 million, which we are extremely proud of. And this is further evidence that our strategy is paying off and that we are quickly moving towards our goals as we deliver continued improvement in our quarterly results. Overall, in the context of the operating environment in South Africa, I am very pleased with our quarter 2 results and the momentum we are taking into Q3. These are exciting times for Lesaka with our customers continuing to demonstrate the value they see in our products and services, which underpins the resilience of our business model. And with that, I would like to hand over to Steve to take you through the performance of our Merchant division.\nSteven Heilbron: Thank you, Chris. Quarter 2 is a very busy period for us and our merchants. This is driven by the increased spending during the festive season, which benefits our card acquiring, our supplier payments and cash digitalization businesses in particular. Our portfolio covers products and services, increasing consumer convenience and purchases in our merchant stores as well as physical and fintech solutions to assist our merchants reduce cash risk and improve working capital and business efficiencies. This comprehensive solution helps us understand our merchants businesses and cash flows better which, in turn, helps us drive an improved value proposition solving for our merchants pain points as they grow and compete. This is the source of our competitive advantage. Our merchants use our Kazang devices to sell a range of value-added services to their customers, including data, airtime, gaming and electricity. They can also use these devices for our supplier payments platform, allowing them to make electronic payments to approximately 700 active suppliers, greatly reducing both their and their suppliers' cash risk. We ended the second quarter with over 79,000 devices deployed in the informal markets, representing a 23% year-on-year and a 3% quarter-on-quarter growth rate. As mentioned last quarter, we have seen a significant change in product mix, with international money transfers reducing due to a change in the regulatory environment, which affected the industry and can be clearly seen in this graph. Fortunately, this is a lower-margin product for us, limiting the impact on profitability. Excluding IMTs, we saw a 51% growth in throughput year-on-year and 16% quarter-on-quarter. Our supplier payments platform continued its excellent growth on the back of partnerships with major FMCG suppliers, which we discussed at our last quarterly results briefing. We continue to bring new suppliers onto our platform. Our card acquiring business is operated through our Kazang Pay business in the informal markets and through CardConnect in the formal market. Our installed card-enabled devices increased to over 48,100, representing a 40% year-on-year growth and 3% quarter-on-quarter growth, now of a significantly higher base. This growth is primarily driven by Kazang Pay and demonstrates the continued adoption of card payments in the informal economy. From a throughput perspective, we saw a 31% increase year-on-year. Quarter 2 is seasonally our best quarter, and we saw our throughput grow 15% compared to quarter 1 of 2024. We are pleased with these numbers considering the economic challenges our merchants and their customers are facing. Our cash vaults or cash digitalization business is primarily exposed to the former SME market, which has been impacted by load shedding, interest rates and consumer pressures more so than the informal market. Year-on-year, we saw a 1% increase in throughput on our vaults with the number of cash vaults increasing by 4% to over 4,450. On a quarterly basis, we saw better growth in Q2 with throughput up 8%, primarily due to seasonality. We had a more than 30% year-on-year growth in Kazang vaults. This is off a low base as we extend our offering into the informal market, where we believe we can make a real difference in our informal merchants operations as we build Kazang merchant communities, enhance risk management and facilitate immediate cash availability for working capital. Our credit business has been negatively impacted by high interest rates and the challenging economic environment. There is demand for this credit product from our merchants. However, the deteriorating performance and financial strength of many of our merchants means that they do not meet our credit criteria, resulting in fewer and smaller extensions. While strict application of our credit card criteria has led to negative growth, it has protected and maintained the quality of our book through the cycle. We are cautiously optimistic that we may have reached the bottom of the cycle, and we anticipate a more favorable operating and trading environment for our merchants, which may allow for a resumption in credit growth later in the year. In February, we announced the acquisition of Touchsides from Heineken, which we anticipate closing in March 2024. Touchsides is a leading data analytics and insights merchant service business and is highly complementary to Kazang. It has a client base of over 10,000 active points of sale terminals across South Africa's informal licensed taverns and processes more than 1.5 million transactions per day. The business provides Platform as a Service and Software as a Service solutions to licensed tavern outlets, enabling the measurement of sales activity in real time, management of stock levels and informed commercial decisions such as pricing and promotional offers. The rich data and insights amassed from these terminals carry substantial value and can be monetized through relationships with a range of clients, including FMCG companies, retailers, wholesalers, route to market suppliers and financiers. Touchsides is an exciting acquisition and aligns with our strategy of adding scale and broadening our service offering in our merchant division. Our EasyPay enterprise market solution, which offers VAS, switching and bill payments in the formal merchant market through our retail partners experienced pressure over 2022 and 2023. Despite this, we deem this platform to be strategically important, and we are investing in the technology and they have improved our management structures. With over 600 billers on the platform, which are embedded into all major retail systems, EasyPay has an extensive footprint that would be very difficult to replicate. The recent performance of this business is encouraging, and it's becoming a meaningful contributor to our Merchant Group adjusted EBITDA as our interventions start paying off. We saw a 9% year-on-year improvement in throughput and 14% quarter-on-quarter. We strengthened our market position in formal market VAS distribution with throughput increasing more than 30% year-on-year, driven mainly by electricity sales volumes. The Merchant division revenue for the quarter was ZAR2.4 billion, representing a 13% increase year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter. This reflects the seasonality in our business in quarter 2. Considering the headwinds our merchants and their customers faced over this period, we are very pleased with this result. From a segment adjusted perspective, we reported a 2% increase year-on-year, with an 8% increase quarter-on-quarter. We mentioned in our Q2 results last year, that the Merchant group adjusted EBITDA included ZAR22.1 million related to a bulk order not expected to repeat in our terminal hardware sales business units. Excluding the impact thereof, our Merchant division year-on-year revenue growth is 17%, and adjusted EBITDA growth is 18%. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the top line growth and profitability achieved in Q2, especially considering the challenging environment we are operating in and the stronger comparative quarter last year. I would like to hand over to Lincoln to take you through the Consumer division results and strategy.\nLincoln Mali: Good morning and afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Steve. I'm very proud as I report on the results for the second quarter today. We started our efforts to transform the Consumer division in 2021, and it has been a very difficult journey. Notwithstanding the hard yards that we have had to work, the team's dedication and commitment to executing our strategy is not only making a real difference in people's lives, but is also delivering stronger growth and profitability each quarter. As the only financial service provider focused exclusively on grant recipients, we dedicate 100% of our resources to understanding and servicing their needs as effectively as possible through product design, fit for people distribution networks and service channels. At the last two quarters, I spoke in some detail about our initiative to grow our EPE customer base and how we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of changes in the grant distribution market. Our gross account activations continued the upward trend from approximately 60,000 in quarter 4 2023 to 76,000 in quarter 1 and now 122,000 for quarter 2. This also compares very favorably to our gross account activations a year ago of 43,000, a year-on-year increase of 188%. Churn also improved this quarter, which resulted in a net account activation of over 92,000 compared to approximately 42,000 in quarter 1, 2024 and 10,000 in quarter 2, 2023. Natural chain is a factor in the grant space as child support grant sees when 18 and as mortality impacts old age grands. We estimate the net impact to be approximately 10% to 12% per annum. It is very exciting to see the growth coming through after all the hard work and enthusiasm with which our teams have approached this task. Our EPE account base is a crucial number for us as we only provide our additional products and services to active EPE account holders, and we are very encouraged by the trends we are seeing. We ended the quarter with over 1.4 million active EPE customers, of which 85% are core permanent grant recipients, representing a 14% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter growth. It is important to maintain our EPE growth and momentum and further increase activations to provide us with the base to cross-sell and grow ARPU. Our EasyPay loan book increased 26% year-on-year to ZAR503 million. Gross advances for the quarter of ZAR447 million were up 32% compared to quarter 2 last year. Our loan loss ratio remained stable at approximately 6% on an annualized basis. The excellent momentum in the adoption of our EasyPay insurance product continued in this quarter with active policies increasing to 384,000 at quarter end, a growth of 31% from last year and 7% over the quarter 1, 2024. Our insurance book penetration increased from approximately 25% a year ago to over 30% at the end of collection. Retaining its very high premium collection rate of 96% and a low annual rate of approximately 7% compared to the industry reported annual lapse rate of over 22% per year, an indication that our clients retain their policies for longer and are less likely to replace our policies with those offered by our competitors. I get very excited when I see the quality of our loan in insurance books. For me, it confirms that our 100% focus on servicing the grant recipients of South Africa and designing relevant and well-priced products is making an impact on their lives. As we expand our EPE account base, we will continue to have a meaningful impact on financial inclusion in South Africa. On the back of our excellent loan in insurance performance, our ARPU has improved from approximately ZAR74 per month a year ago to over ZAR85 per month at the end of this quarter. With the success of our cross-selling and cost optimization efforts, we are now dedicating much of our energy into enhancing our financial service solutions to attract further EPE account holders. A key focus going forward will be the addition of relevant products and services as well as the continuous improvement of service delivery, which will also include enhancing our digital capabilities. We are also advancing initiatives with Kazang to further enhance our merchant and consumer ecosystem. The improvement in the above KPIs across the board is leading to a continual improvement in quarterly performance of the Consumer division. Revenue for the quarter is ZAR313 million, representing a 16% year-on-year growth and an 8% quarter-on-quarter growth. Consumer segment adjusted EBITDA for quarter 2 was ZAR55 million compared to ZAR46 million last quarter and ZAR10 million last year. This represents a 450% year-on-year growth and a 19% quarter-on-quarter growth. We see the impact of positive [jaws] (ph) here as our EPE account base growth and cross-selling initiatives take effect of our rightsized cost base and improve activation businesses. In conclusion, we're extremely excited about the momentum we're building in the Consumer division and the opportunity that lies ahead for us to bring true financial inclusion to South Africa's grant beneficiaries. It is at the heart of our purpose and to be able to do this in a profitable and sustainable manner is very rewarding for all of us. On behalf of the Consumer team, I would like to say a huge thank you to Chris Meyer, for his support and dedication as we turn around the Consumer business. And we now look forward to a new growth path under the leadership of Ali Mazanderani. I would like to hand over to Naeem now, who will take you through the income statement and balance sheet in more detail and address the outlook for quarter 3 and the full year results.\nNaeem Kola: our guidance range and group adjusted EBITDA exceeding the upper end of our guidance range for the quarter. As a reminder, Lesaka is a domestic filer in the United States. We report results in US dollars under US GAAP. However, our operational currency is South African rand and as such, we analyze our performance in South African rand. Looking at the consolidated income statement for the quarter, we grew revenue by 13% to ZAR2.7 billion compared to Q2 2023. Revenue increased by 6% compared to Q1 2024, partly due to seasonality. In US dollars, consolidated revenue was $144 million for the quarter, up 6% compared to $136 million in Q2 2023, negatively impacted by the 7% depreciation of the rand against the dollar over the period. Operating income increased to ZAR43 million compared to ZAR4 million in Q1 and an operating loss of ZAR38 million a year ago. Operating income for Q2 2024 includes an ZAR18 million, $1 million non-cash gain related to the release of a foreign currency translation reserve upon liquidation of a dormant subsidiary. Depreciation and amortization of ZAR109 million includes ZAR67 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles from the Connect Group acquisition. Acquired asset amortization is both a non-operational and a non-cash charge. Our net interest expense decreased 2% to ZAR81 million in Q2 2024 from ZAR83 million in Q1 2024 through further cash optimization measures across the group. Q2 2024 versus Q2 2023 is mainly impacted by the increase in the benchmark interest rate in South Africa in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023. Net income before income taxes, adding back ZAR67 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles for the quarter, is ZAR29 million compared to a loss of ZAR7 million in the previous quarter and a loss of ZAR43 million in Q2 2023. This quarter saw another important milestone being achieved. Fundamental loss per share, which excludes non-operating items, turned positive for the first time in over five years at ZAR0.26 per share compared to a loss of ZAR0.08 per share in quarter 1 and a loss of ZAR0.22 per share a year ago. Net income before tax, but excluding the non-operational and non-cash PPA charge, turned positive for the first time since the turnaround of Lesaka began, coming in at ZAR29 million. Net loss before tax narrowed to ZAR39 million for Q2 2024 compared to a net loss of ZAR110 million a year ago, representing a 65% year-on-year improvement and a 48% improvement on the net loss of ZAR74 million in quarter 1 2024. At a divisional level, merchant delivered a 13% revenue increase year-on-year and 6% quarter-on-quarter. We mentioned in our Q3 results last year that the Merchant division included a bulk order in our terminal hardware sales business news. Excluding the impact thereof, our Merchant division year-on-year revenue growth is 17%, a robust result given the challenging operating environment for merchants we serve. In the Consumer division, revenues grew 16% year-on-year. We are seeing very good momentum in EPE account activations, which is the foundation of building further annuity income in the consumer revenue base. Our lending and insurance businesses performed exceptionally well, contributing to this very encouraging result. Year-on-year, the Merchant division reported a segment adjusted EBITDA of ZAR163 million compared to ZAR160 million in Q2 2023. Excluding the NUETS bulk order impact of ZAR22.1 million, we would have recorded a growth of 18% in segment adjusted EBITDA. The Consumer division delivered segment adjusted EBITDA of ZAR55 million for Q2 2024 compared to ZAR10 million for Q2 2023, benefiting from strong goals and cost saving initiatives implemented in FY 2023. Compared to Q1 2024, the Consumer division has grown segment adjusted EBITDA by 19%. Group cost of ZAR38 million reduced by 5% compared to ZAR40 million in Q2 2023. Looking briefly at our half year results for the six months to 31st December 2023, the transformation in Lesaka's financial performance is clear. Consumer segment adjusted EBITDA for the half year was ZAR102 million compared to a loss of ZAR14 million last year, with Merchant segment adjusted EBITDA of ZAR313 million. Group costs reduced 9% year-on-year, resulting in a 71% improvement in adjusted EBITDA to ZAR343 million. The group's operating income has turned positive on a half year basis to ZAR47 million compared to a loss of ZAR118 million a year ago. Adjusting for the non-operational and non-cash PPA adjustment, we delivered a positive net income before tax of ZAR22 million for the six months. We experienced continued improvement in our financial performance in the second quarter of 2024 with the sequential quarterly revenue and profitability improving in both Consumer and Merchant divisions. As a reminder, seasonal trends lead to a slight stronger quarter 2 in both divisions due to the higher-than-average transaction volumes in December. Consumer revenue increased 8% quarter-on-quarter to ZAR313 million from ZAR291 million in Q1 2024, and Merchant revenue increased 6% quarter-on-quarter attributable to growth in both divisions. Similarly, the Merchant segment adjusted EBITDA of ZAR163 million increased 8% quarter-on-quarter and Consumer segment adjusted EBITDA of ZAR55 million increased 19% quarter-on-quarter. Fundamental earnings per share, which excludes non-operating items, turned positive in the quarter for the first time in over five years to ZAR0.26 compared to a loss of ZAR0.08 per share in quarter 1 and a loss of ZAR0.22 per share a year ago. In management's view, this is the appropriate earnings per share measure given the adjustment for one-off non-repeatable items and PPA amortization and other non-cash items. From a cash flow perspective, we saw a continued momentum in achieving positive net cash provided by operating activities at ZAR11 million for the quarter, which includes an additional ZAR64 million in interest payments using the fund bond proceeds. Adjusting for this, our net cash provided by operating activities would have been approximately ZAR75 million. We generated ZAR207 million operating cash flow before interest paid, tax paid, working capital-related items and movement in loan book funding. We define this as cash generated from business operations and consider it an appropriate indicator of our conversion of EBITDA to cash. This is an increase of 41% or ZAR16 million compared to ZAR147 million generated in Q2 2023. The ZAR54 million movement in loan book funding relates primarily to the net growth in the consumer book over the quarter. Our working capital was impacted by the quarter-end falling on a public holiday and having to find an additional two days receivables in our merchant business. We have exited our shareholding in fond Finbond during the quarter through a specific repurchase program and received a net cash flow of ZAR64 million in December 2023, which was used to pay down capitalized interest. Overall, we are pleased with the cash generation in our business this quarter. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is calculated as the net debt at a specific date divided by the annualized group adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. For Q2 2024, this improved to 2.7 times compared to 3.6 times a year ago, and 3.1 times at the end of quarter 1. Our new funding arrangement in which our lenders have agreed to reduce the margin on facilities G and H on the basis of the improvement in our net debt to EBITDA ratio was finalized effective from October 2023. Reducing our net debt remains a strategic objective for the group. Capital expenditure in Q2 2024 amounted to ZAR41 million. As we previously highlighted, this is mainly growth CapEx related to the Merchant division. Our growth CapEx delivers a strong IRR on capital invested. We are very excited with the overall performance this quarter as we are seeing the full potential of Consumer division benefiting from the revenue growth and margin expansion from expense reductions we did in FY 2023 and the Merchant division continues growth on key KPI metrics. This is a base we will continue to grow on. Turning to our guidance for the third quarter. We expect revenue of ZAR2.7 billion to ZAR2.8 billion. Our guidance range for group adjusted EBITDA of ZAR170 million to ZAR190 million for Q3 is broad given that seasonal trends indicate that Q2 is usually a stronger quarter than Q3. This is due to the higher-than-average transaction volumes in December. However, we currently expect to be closer to the upper end of this range of ZAR190 million in Q3. I would also like to reaffirm our full year 2024 revenue guidance of ZAR10.7 billion to ZAR11.7 billion and group adjusted EBITDA of ZAR680 million to ZAR740 million. We anticipate the group adjusted EBITDA to come in at the top end of our full year guidance range. However, we expect full year revenue to be at the lower end of our guidance range. This is primarily due to the change in mix between PIN and PIN-less airtime sales during the year, primarily in our Kazang business. Accounting standards require that for PIN-less airtime sales we recognize our commission as revenue, but for PIN airtimes sales, we recognize the full value of the airtime as revenue was our purchase price of airtime as a cost of sale. So PIN-less airtime sales have made up a larger percentage of airtime sales than we expected when our guidance was set at the beginning of the year, which is having a material impact on revenue recognition. Our outlook provided does not include impact of the acquisition of Touchsides or any other M&A transactions that we conclude. Thank you. I will hand over to Chris for his closing comments.\nChris Meyer: Thank you, Naeem. As detailed in our public filing in December 2023, I will be stepping down as Group CEO on the 29th of February 2024. I've dedicated all my energy over the past 2.5 years to the turnaround and rebuilding of the Lesaka platform. And in doing so, spending the majority of that time apart from my family who live in the UK. I believe I've achieved what we set out to do when we started this journey, and I will be leaving Lesaka as a strong platform poised for growth and scale. The time is right for me to return to my family and hand over to a new leader who will take this extraordinary group of people into an exciting future at Lesaka. Ali Mazanderani has assumed the role of Executive Chairman as of 1 February 2024. And Ali has been integrally involved in Lesaka since 2020 and when he presented his vision and the strategy at our results in Q4 2020. And I'd like to welcome Ali and give him the opportunity to share a few thoughts. Ali?\nAli Mazanderani: Thank you, Chris. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Chris for the excellent job he has done. He joined when the company had significant cash ban, uncertainty in the outlook of the Consumer division and the need to quickly achieve scale in the Merchant division. He leaves behind a cash-generating business with scale and further potential. On top of this, Lesaka has strong corporate governance, excellent leadership, and people passionate about our purpose of bringing financial inclusion to underserved communities. Under Chris' leadership, we have come a long way in a short period. Chris is remaining on our Board as a Non-Executive Director, and I'm delighted he is available to support me during the handover phase. I look forward to working with him in that capacity. I'm excited to take on the role of Chairman of Lesaka, and I'm very much looking forward to working with Lincoln, Steve and Naeem and the rest of the leadership team in executing our strategy. I believe they have already created the leading fintech in South Africa, and we have the potential to build on that foundation and truly establish Lesaka as the leading fintech on the continent. In 2020, I outlined our vision for Lesaka. That vision was covered by my personal and professional experience. I was brought up in South Africa on a farm in the east of the country and in Mpumalanga, the place where the sun rises, that is my emotional home. After completing Economics degrees at the University of Pretoria, I got postgraduate scholarships at Oxford University and the London School of Economics. These were subsequently augmented by an MBA at INSEAD in France and a Masters in Business Law at St. Gallen in Switzerland. I've lived and worked in many countries, experiences that have given me a global perspective, but Africa has always been close. Whether that be through my time at First National Bank, a prominent banking group in the country, or as a private equity investor, where I was intimately involved in creating the country and continent’s leading credit bureau. In the payment space, I've had the distinct privilege of helping to build multibillion dollar fintechs on four continents, leaders in their respective areas. These include in Brazil, StoneCo, in India, Pine Labs, in Africa and the Middle East, Network International and in Europe Teya, a business which I cofounded. Over the past two decades, I've been fortunate to be at the forefront of the digitization of commerce, an investment theme that I believe to be the most exciting of our generation. It is therefore a delight for me to be able to come back to the country, I was shaped by and have the opportunity to serve in the industry I know best. This is an opportunity for me and us to once more build the leading fintech on the continent, taking lessons of the past and forging a singular future. The space is open. We have a steady ship. We have the flagship and the demographic tide is at our back. Taken on the flood, it will lead to fortune. I hope you will join us on the journey. Together, I believe we'll be able to look back and say, we have to make a new world. We made a better future, and we did it for the people and places that needed it most. We'll now open up if there's any questions.\nOperator: And thank you, Ali. We're now going to open up the call for Q&A sessions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Raj Sharma of B. Riley.\nRaj Sharma: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on ongoing good results. My first question is for Lincoln and a couple other questions for Steve and then overall question -- Lincoln, the pace of adding the EPE accounts has picked up well, any specific new initiatives that you've implemented? And can we determine if they -- if we are making inroads into the SASSA account acquisition?\nLincoln Mali: Thank you, Raj. This is a continuation of all the plans we've been talking about, vetting in our people, training them, guiding them, building their relationship with SASSA, strong marketing presence on the ground, better customer service, improved digitization in how we engage our customers. All of those things have given us a competitive edge. And we now have got the fastest-growing unit as compared to other banks, except for one. So we think that, that process will continue, and we think that we can make even more in growth into that base.\nRaj Sharma: Great. Thank you. And then can you talk about the impact of load shedding? Any color on its impact going forward?\nChris Meyer: Lincoln, I'm happy to take that question. Raj, thank you for the question. Nice to hear your voice. Welcome. Load shedding, I think, has become very much a part of life in South Africa. It's something that has been built in to the business model, both ours and more broadly, our merchant customer base. And we've learned a debt. South Africa is an adaptable place, a resilient place. I think as we said over the last couple of quarters, we've seen a reduction in the number of hours of load shedding. So there has been an improvement in the availability factor, which measures electricity supply in the country, but it's still a significant constraint in the country. And we -- at this point feel it's too early to predict any long-term improvement. But as I say, I think it's very much built into the way of life, into the operating model for both ourselves and our customer base. And we always learn to adapt.\nRaj Sharma: Yeah. Thank you. And then I just had a question on the new acquisition. Is it reasonable to expect more? How did this come about this opportunity? What you -- are you hunting for little acquisitions like these? Are there more opportunities like these? And also, can you give a sense on the contribution to the top line and sort of the valuation metric?\nChris Meyer: Raj, I'll take that question as well as its broad in nature around strategy. So as we mentioned earlier in my opening remarks, M&A is an important aspect for us of building and scaling our business. We look at it in sort of broadly two buckets. One is around adding scale, and the other is around adding to our proposition for our customer base. And largely, we see it in the merchant space, most often, the Touchsides acquisition falls into the latter. It's about broadening our proposition. We're active. We look at things all the time. We're evaluating opportunities in a number of different areas. And we feel that it's an important aspect of the future growth for our business. Ali, I don't know if you want to comment at all or I think you've covered it. All right. Thanks, Raj.\nRaj Sharma: Thanks. Okay. And then for Steve, can you talk a little bit about the credit business deterioration of the merchants? What is your outlook on the strategy going forward, are you going to change credit standards? Or what are your expectations for the business -- this business going forward and this contribution -- ongoing contribution?\nSteven Heilbron: At the outset, let me say actually in January this year, the month has just passed, we probably had one of our most active months from a credit perspective. So -- as I said in our reflection on the results, we felt that things were starting to improve to some extent. Our retailers had been through a tough period we thought that credit extension could start to improve, and we're starting to see some of that come through. We didn't change our credit criteria over the last period. We simply became a lot more stringent so that we could protect any potential loss. But I'm glad to say that our retailers are resilient and our strategy remains, which is to continue to add participants to our platform, create the leverage network effect and credit is a very important part of that aspect, both in the formal and informal markets.\nRaj Sharma: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Again, excellent results and congratulations. I’ll take it offline.\nOperator: Thank you, Raj. Our next question is a live one from Theodore O'Neill from Hills research. Theo, unmute your line and you can go ahead.\nTheodore O’Neill: Thank you very much. First question for Steve is about the Touchside acquisition. Is there opportunity to leverage the analytics that come with that acquisition across the platform, across the entire merchant division? And is AI part of that?\nSteven Heilbron: So as Chris covered, we're very excited about this opportunity for a variety of reasons. Firstly, it introduces a whole new vertical for us. So the tavern space and specifically the licensed tavern space is a critical vertical in the South African informal markets. It's not an area that we have real traction in. We've been playing there for a relatively short period of time and are making good progress, but we believe this will allow us to scale significantly. We will drive very hard our card acquiring, our VAS offering as well as what this now enables us to do is to play in the Platform as a Service, Software as a Service and data monetization. So critical to this product is the fact that we see close to ZAR17 billion of value going through these terminals. We provide the merchants with a mechanism through the software to be able to track inventory, sales and promotional activity. That data is hugely valuable, and we bought it really for the data insights capability as well as to extend into the vertical with everything else that we do. And to your point, it is very much within our [gun sights] (ph) to take that particular offering across our other verticals as well. It helps us to bring in the FMCG links and monetize that data both from the consumer and to the business.\nTheodore O’Neill: Thanks. And for Lincoln, I'm curious, the year-over-year quarterly ARPU was up 15%. And I was wondering if there's any particular reason that's favorable?\nLincoln Mali: I think that if you look at both our growth in our EPE accounts, growth in our lending and growth in our insurance, all of those have been market improvements. And you've seen that a lot in December. So we have very, very good December. So this quarter really represents as Chris pointed out earlier, record numbers of sales in our EPE, in our insurance and in our loans. And that augurs very well for our ARPU growth.\nTheodore O’Neill: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you, Theo. We now are going to take a question from [indiscernible] and I'm going to read it if she submitted over the chat. Guys, does the recent acquisition of [indiscernible] earn merchant collaboration with AB InBev?\nSteven Heilbron: I actually believe it should significantly enhance our relationship with AB InBev. The reality is we are now the Switzerland of the market. Previously, Touchsides would have been owned by Heineken. You can understand this is a data insights business and the data analytics in our hands as an independent is probably very much enhancing in terms of what we can offer in that vertical to all suppliers into the tavern space. So we actually are enthusiastic about the opportunity in our hands in relation to what we can now achieve with the likes of SAB, et cetera.\nTheodore O’Neill: Thank you. That’s helpful. Next one is a strategic question. Can I just expect more acquisitions as EBITDA increases. And as you think about your M&A strategy, are you thinking bolt-on or transformational?\nChris Meyer: Thanks for the question. I think it's probably fairly similar to the one we received from Raj. I don't want to repeat, but we described the two sort of broad areas that we would focus on from an M&A perspective. M&A being an important aspect of our strategy to scale the business and build relevance with our customer base. So yes, I think it's fair to say you should expect to see further activity in those buckets. The bucket is being around scale and then relevance and we are active. We are looking at things, we're evaluating things, but we evaluate things against a very clear set of criteria with a very disciplined approach. So we want to make sure we make the right choices that can enhance this business and build the platform. Ali, I don't know if you would like to comment, give you the opportunity to maybe say something.\nAli Mazanderani: No, thanks, Chris. I mean I need to echo what you say and say that there is opportunities in both subsectors that are represented there, and each will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.\nChris Meyer: Thank you.\nOperator: Great. Last question right now, and this comes from Jared Houston of All Weather Capital. Can you guys provide an outlook for net debt-to-EBITDA post Touchside acquisition?\nChris Meyer: Naeem, do you want to address that?\nNaeem Kola: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Chris. Yeah. Look, so we're not seeing any material impact on our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio because of the Touchside acquisition. I mean, as we mentioned, the acquisition has been fully funded from our current resources, and we don't see an impact on that material impact coming from that.\nChris Meyer: Thanks, Naeem.\nOperator: Great. And this -- obviously, Raj and Theo both asked about M&A. But Jared wants to know, as you think about M&A, will equity be a part of that? Will you -- how will you fund M&A? How are you thinking about that strategically?\nChris Meyer: [indiscernible]. And one of the aspects will be how to fund a particular transaction. And so equity would play into that. So as much as debt or any other form of financing of transactions. So where it's appropriate, we would consider it, and we consider it against a number of metrics that we need to think about in that regard.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. And here's my last question from Jared. Can you provide any updates on the potential of mobile click and a status update on where that stands?\nNaeem Kola: Yeah, sure. Yeah. Look, I think as we mentioned, and it's public information that they've now submitted a rate hearing and the way to come through for an IPO in the Indian market. I mean where it stands at the moment is that, obviously, we're watching it very closely, and we're in close contact with management to ascertain how they're looking at this. And I think in terms of performance of MobiKwik, the performance of the business has been strong. And going forward, we would keep a watchful eye in terms of valuations as it comes closer to them doing and launching an IPO.\nOperator: Well, thank you for that update. And that concludes the Q&A. Those are all the questions. We appreciate everybody for participating. Thank you, management."

As a reminder, the webcast is being recorded, and the presentation can be accessed through the webcast link as well as dialing in to the Zoom conference call dial-in numbers provided. Management will address any questions you may have at the end of the presentation. For those joining us via webcast, you can ask your questions by using the raise your hand button in Zoom. And for those joining via the Zoom conference line, you cannot ask your questions live today. The webcast link Zoom conference call dial-in numbers as well as our press release and supplementary investor presentation are available on the Investor Relations website at ir.lesakatech.com. Additionally, Lesaka filed its Form 10-Q after the U.S. market closed yesterday, which is also available on the Investor Relations website. As a reminder, during this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, and I ask you to look at the cautionary language contained in our Form 10-Q regarding the risks and uncertainties associated with forward-looking statements. Also as a domestic filer in the United States, we report results in U.S. dollars under U.S. GAAP. However, it is important to note that our operational currency is South African rand and as such, we analyze our performance in South African rand. In this presentation, we will discuss our results in South African rand, which is non-GAAP. This assists investors' understanding of the underlying trends in our business. As you know, the company's results can be significantly affected by currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the South African rand.  Taking a quick look at today's agenda. Chris Meyer, Group CEO of Lesaka, will start with an overview of performance highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and a review of Lesaka's progress against its key strategic objectives. Steve Heilbron, CEO Connect and Head of Merchant Division, will provide an update on the Merchant division, followed by Lincoln Mali, CEO of Lesaka, Southern Africa, who will take us through the Consumer Division's performance this quarter. Naeem Kola, Group's CFO, will present the detailed overview of our financial performance for the 3 months ended September 30, 2023, before handing back to Chris to update you on the Q2 and full year guidance and open the floor for any questions you may have. I'd like to now turn the call over to Chris.\nChris Meyer: Good morning and good afternoon, and welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings webcast and conference call. Today, I'm pleased to present the continuation of the growth in our Merchant division, and another quarter of continued improvement in the Consumer division as both our turnaround efforts and growth initiatives bear fruit. Lesaka is a leading fintech in Southern Africa with over 1.3 million grant beneficiaries using our EasyPay Everywhere financial services platform and over 84,000 MSME merchants using our fintech solutions to grow their businesses. Our dual-sided consumer and merchant ecosystem penetrates deep into South Africa's informal markets, providing us with an opportunity to meaningfully drive financial inclusion across previously underserved communities. South Africa's economic environment remains difficult, which has made executing our strategy more challenging. Despite seeing a reduction in load shedding this quarter, the effect of high interest rates, inflation and unemployment continue to negatively impact the wider South African economy. And with this in mind, these results demonstrate not only the resilience of our business model, but also the resilience of our customers and the value they have placed on our services. We achieved an important milestone this quarter. I'm very pleased to report that at an operating income level, we did a profit for the first time in 5 years. And while it's just over ZAR 4 million this quarter, it is evidence that the strategy set by our Board to develop this financial technology platform, servicing the digital and cash needs of South Africa's consumers and merchants can generate significant shareholder value and is starting to pay off. It is also the first quarter that is directly comparable to the prior year, with the Connect Group included for the full period in both quarters. The improvement from an operating loss of ZAR 80 million to an operating profit of ZAR 4.2 million is testament to the commitment and efforts of our employees in turning around the Consumer division and growing the Merchant division. We are proud of these achievements. So turning to our revenue and group adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. We grew revenue at 19% year-on-year from ZAR 2.1 billion to ZAR 2.54 billion, which is at the upper end of our guidance range, and this was achieved through a 20% increase in merchant revenue and a 13% increase in consumer revenue. Lincoln highlighted some of our new consumer growth initiatives during our annual results presentation in September. And it is pleasing to see that they are already starting to have a positive impact on the consumer business. Group adjusted EBITDA came in at the midpoint of our guidance, and it is important to note that we incurred ZAR 6.1 million of restructuring costs, primarily in the merchant ATM business, without which, we would have exceeded our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the quarter. And Naeem will unpack the financials in more detail later. But overall, I'm very encouraged by the performance our businesses are delivering. Our vision to build the leading fintech providing cash and digital solutions to small merchants and consumers in Southern Africa is firmly in our sights. M&A will play a role in achieving this vision, and we continue to evaluate opportunities that will enhance our market positioning. And this includes bolt-on acquisitions that will provide scale to our existing offering as well as those that will help us broaden our product offering to our clients. Our M&A focus is primarily on our merchant business. We have successfully turned the Consumer division around and have recorded 4 consecutive quarters of adjusted EBITDA profitability. And we have also fundamentally transformed this business into one, which is customer-oriented and sales-focused. We are seeing early traction in improved customer acquisition and account activations, which is very encouraging and is evidence of the significant efforts made by our consumer team over the past few quarters. From a balance sheet perspective, our positive cash flow from operating activities generated ZAR 63 million this quarter compared to an outflow of ZAR 131 million in Q1 last year, demonstrating just how far we have come in 1 year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio reduced to 3.1x at quarter end with our near-term target being below 2.75x, and we expect to achieve this in fiscal 2024. We continue to focus on our noncore asset disposals, which will further improve our balance sheet strength and debt ratios when complete. As mentioned in our Q4 results, we have signed a share repurchase agreement in respect of our interest in Finbond for a cash consideration of approximately ZAR 64 million, which we will utilize to partially settle debt. In November 2023, Finbond released a firm intention announcement regarding the repurchase transaction, and we expect a meeting of Finbond shareholders to be held in December 2023 to approve the transaction. This means the transaction is expected to close in December 2023. Lesaka is a leading player in the sectors in which we choose to participate. We will be launching our quarterly Lesaka Informal Economy Index tomorrow, 9 November, utilizing our unique data sets and insights into the informal and township markets in South Africa combined with relevant thought leadership. There is very little empirical data available in this important sector of our economy, and that which is readily available is often contradictory. We hope to bring more consistency to defining the informal market and the understanding thereof through our work in this space. We are entering an exciting period at Lesaka with the turnaround of the Consumer division and an integrated Connect Group, Lesaka is poised to capitalize on its leading position in South Africa's informal markets and scale the depth and breadth of its fintech platform in the next phase of its development. And with that, I would like to hand over to Steve to take you through the performance of our Merchant division.\nSteven Heilbron: Thank you, Chris. Before I run through our Q1 performance, I will briefly outline our merchant strategy. We have a comprehensive product portfolio covering both cash and digital and formal and informal markets. Our unique position allows us to benefit from both the significant reliance on cash in the South African economy and the rapid shift to digital that is currently taking place. As I referenced at our recent annual results, this shift opens up opportunities for us to pioneer informal markets and disrupt the incumbents and the traditional ways of transacting in the formal markets. We rely on being innovative and responsive to the needs of our merchants with quick development turnaround times and the ability to get products onto the street without delay. We take calculated risks, we learn quickly, and we are adaptable. We are instilling this culture across the group as we fight for success in these competitive markets. Critical to our strategy is the holistic offering we have for our merchants. We have numerous competitors on an individual product basis, but our holistic solution is proving to be both durable and an effective differentiator. As a fintech company, our approach is unique and disruptive from cash lots and immediate digitization, quick access to capital for growth opportunities, a comprehensive VAS product suite to attract consumers to merchant stores to a supplier payment platform and industry-leading payment technologies, we offer solutions that make a meaningful difference to our merchants' daily trading, risk management and business administration. We will entrench and extend our position in the informal and formal MSME markets by continuing to embed ourselves as a critical partner to our merchants by offering real value. We offer 4 primary solutions to our merchants. Our portfolio of products result in increased consumer adoption, driving higher volumes of sales for our merchants. We provide merchants with a device linked to a digital wallet from which they can pay suppliers sell many VAS products, make bill payments for customers, take payments via card swipes or tap and pay whilst providing instant settlement. A partnership with an informal merchant usually starts with the VAS device. This drives growth across all products. By way of example, more than 60% of Kazang merchants that have our VAS device have converted to also utilizing our Kazang Pay card offering. Many of them are utilizing our supplier payment platform to improve efficiencies and reduce cash risk. These deeper relationships with our merchants increase our value and our stickiness to them and underpin our strategy. From a VAS device perspective, we have increased our stake by 34% year-on-year and by 3% quarter-on-quarter to over 77,000 devices. Focusing on device growth core to our device placement strategy is the decision to focus on quality business, which is reflected in a healthy throughput in margin per device. This drives profitability, which I will talk to shortly. In line with this strategy, we uplift unprofitable devices, which can arise from a number of factors. Two contributing factors are increased competition, which results in a drop-off in usage or the optimization of our fleet following on from a specific campaign. I mentioned at our last results that during Q1 to Q3 of the 2023 financial year, we installed a large number of devices at informal merchants in order to support supplier payments to a few major FMCG companies that we partnered with. This has resulted in a more than double year-on-year increase in our supplier payments throughput. The supplier payments platform is an important value-add service to our merchants as it significantly derisks the operations from a cash perspective and reduces admin time. We have a number of large FMCG partners on board, which is driving increased adoption and usage and is resulting in growth. We continue to bring new suppliers onto our platform. During the last 2 quarters, we have focused on optimizing this new fleet by removing devices from the low profitability sites, which has impacted quarterly device growth on a net basis. This pattern of onboarding and then cleaning up is an expected occurrence in the Kazang business when any major partnerships are initiated or cashless delivery routes on existing partnerships are expanded. Turning to VAS throughput, we saw a 20% year-on-year increase, with the quarter being flat compared to Q4 if you include international money transfers. There has been a significant change in product mix relating to international money transfers, which impacted our quarter-on-quarter growth. International money transfers have reduced 80% year-on-year and 71% quarter-on-quarter due to a change in the regulatory environment in South Africa, which has impacted the industry as a whole. Fortunately, this is a low-margin product for us, and we have not seen a material impact on overall gross profit. Excluding IMD, our core VAS throughput increased by 58% year-on-year and showed a quarter-on-quarter growth of 12% or 48% on an annualized basis. The gross profit of our VAS business in Q1 2024 increased 8% compared to Q4 2023, representing a healthy quarter-on-quarter growth. In our card acquiring business, our installed card-enabled devices increased to 46,600 units, representing a 68% year-on-year growth and a 4% quarter-on-quarter growth off a much higher base. This device growth demonstrates continued adoption of card payments in the informal economy and the frictionless process of converting VAS devices to POS devices. From a throughput perspective, we saw a 56% increase year-on-year. On a quarterly basis, throughput grew 6% or 24% annualized. These are very good numbers considering the pressure our merchants' customers are under at this present time. Our VAS and card throughput and margin growth shows good momentum that supports the growth rates we communicated to the market in our guidance. Our cash loss or cash digitization is primarily exposed to the former SME market, which has been more severely impacted by load shedding, interest rates and consumer pressures in the informal market. Year-on-year, we saw a 1% increase in throughput on our bolts with a number of cash falls increasing by 5%. On a quarterly basis, we have seen good momentum in Q1 with throughput up 3% over Q4 or approximately 12% annualized. We are effectively putting a bank in our merchant stores and positively enhance their risk profiles whilst also driving operating efficiencies. As we extend the solution across the informal market, we anticipate making a real difference in our merchants' lives by enabling them to dynamically compete and grow. High inflation, coupled with high interest rates is impacting our formal and informal credit businesses. As I mentioned earlier, we innovate and execute quickly, but if we don't achieve the desired result, we don't hesitate to change course. Our informal sector credit offering, Kazang Pay Advance is not proving effective in its current form. And as such, we have withdrawn the product and gone back to the drawing board. The reductions in origination of new loans, loan book and disbursements are primarily a result of this decision. By many accounts, we are at or near the top of the interest rate cycle and with recent inflation data showing an encouraging downward trend, we anticipate a more favorable operating and trading environment for our merchants, which may allow for a resumption in credit growth later in the year. Our EasyPay enterprise market solution, which offers VAS, switching and bill payments in the formal market through our retail partners experienced pressure during the 2022 and 2023 financial years. Despite this, we deem this platform to be strategically important, and we have invested in the technology and changed our management structures. With over 600 billers on the platform, which are embedded into all major retail systems, it has an extensive footprint that would be very difficult to replicate. Whilst this business is not a material profit contributor at this stage, we are encouraged by its recent performance with throughput increasing by 8% quarter-on-quarter, and we believe it can make a meaningful contribution in the medium term. The economic environment remains challenging and I'm pleased with the yearly and quarterly throughput and the device growth that has been achieved under the circumstances. We have a few exciting innovations in our development cycle. In this fintech-enabled environment, innovation and agility are critical to long-term success. We are in the fortunate position to have the financial strength, skill and a large installed client base across which we can continue to innovate, experiment and drive growth. The merchant division delivered a 20% revenue increase year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter. Considering the headwinds, our merchants faced over this period, we are very pleased with this result. From a segment adjusted EBITDA perspective, we reported an 11% increase year-on-year with a 3% decrease quarter-on-quarter. Our first quarter profits were impacted by a few items, which pulled us back. Firstly, as a result of the suspension of our Kazang Pay Advance credit offering to informal merchants, we provided for expected credit losses on the remaining outstanding exposures at the end of the quarter. Whilst we made a small profit overall on Kazang Pay Advance, providing for the outstanding loans in this quarter was necessary and conservative. The impact of withdrawing Kazang Pay Advance on our quarter-on-quarter segment adjusted EBITDA was approximately ZAR 3 million. Secondly, we restructured our ATM business when it was integrated with the Cash Connect business. This resulted in a one-off restructuring charge of ZAR 4.6 million this quarter. Our innovative ATM recycler is generating significant interest as an alternative to bulk VAS merchants. Adjusting for the effect of these 2 factors results in a quarter-on-quarter segment adjusted EBITDA growth of 3% in Q1. As mentioned in previous presentations, we do take advantage of bulk deals in our VAS offering from time to time, which improves our profitability. These deals can be material and Naeem separately discloses these in his slides each quarter given the impact on group cash flow. Our Q4 results included a benefit from such deals, but we had no repeat of this in Q1, which also contributed to a lower growth in segment adjusted EBITDA than we had hoped for. Whilst individually not material, the combined effect of the bug had a negative impact on the quarter-on-quarter profitability comparison. However, the underlying profitability of our business remains strong. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the top line growth and profitability achieved in Q1, considering the challenging environment. I'd like to hand over to Lincoln to take you through the Consumer Division results and strategy.\nLincoln Mali: Good morning and afternoon, everyone. Thank you, Steve. I'm pleased to report continued profitability in the Consumer Division with another increase in segment adjusted EBITDA. As the only financial service provider focused exclusively on grant recipients, we have dedicated 100% of our resources to understanding and servicing their needs as effectively as possible through product design fit-for-purpose distribution networks and service channels. At our fourth quarter results, I spoke about the various initiatives that we have implemented to address this, including increased marketing and budget, investment in our sales force with incentivization focus on active account based growth, improved onboarding systems, reducing friction on activations, incentives to promote customer switching, brand renewal and repositioning to enhance customer experience and convenience and continued engagement with SASSA in support of their programs. I'm pleased to report that we are starting to see some very encouraging results coming through. These are part of wider initiatives to fundamentally change the Consumer Division to a sales and customer-focused business. We have seen a broader step change in account openings over the past few months as our initiatives start to pay off. Our gross account activations were 76,000 for the quarter which is an improvement from the 45,000 in the first quarter last year. It was encouraging to see a reduction in churn, which resulted in a net account activation of over 42,000 compared to 2,700 in quarter 1, 2023. Natural chain is a factor of the ground space as child support grant cease when a child turns 18 and as mortality impacts old aid grant recipients. We estimate this to be approximately 10% to 12% per annum. I'm excited about the growth we have seen coming through, which evidences the persistence our teams have shown over the past few quarters. I've already referenced our EPA account growth, but it is important to maintain this momentum and further increase activations, which provide us with a base to cross-sell and grow up. We ended the quarter with over 1.3 million active EPE customers, of which approximately 85% are core permanent grant recipients. This represents a 13% year-on-year growth. Our EasyPay loan book increased 20% year-on-year to ZAR 423 million at quarter end. Gross advances for the quarter of ZAR 353 million were up 22% compared to quarter 1 last year. Our loan loss ratio remained stable at approximately 6% on an annualized basis. Our insurance product continued its good growth. increasing to 359,000 active policies at quarter end, a growth of 34% from last year. Our insurance book penetration increased from below 25% last year to approximately 30% at the end of quarter 1. Our insurance offering to grant beneficiaries we serve continues to grow well above the key industry statistics, demonstrating the value based on our funeral insurance offering by customers. We've grown our in-force funeral policy holder book by 18% compared to the funeral policy industry as a whole, which has contracted. Furthermore, the industry reported an annual lapse rate of over 22%, whereas our annual lapse rate is around 7%, an indication that our clients retain their policies for longer and are less likely to replace our policies with those offered by our competitors. We are pleased with the quality of both our lending and insurance books as we are managing to maintain the low loss ratio and high collection rate despite the increasingly tough economic environment. On the back of efficient cross-selling, our ARPU has improved from approximately ZAR 74 per month last year to over ZAR 83 per month at the end of this quarter. For quarter one, we saw a 13% increase in revenue to ZAR 291 million compared to last year. Our primary profitability measure, segment adjusted EBITDA continued to show excellent improvement, achieving a ZAR 46 million profit for this quarter from a ZAR 24 million loss last year. Compared to quarter 4 2023, EBITDA was flat. However, if adjusted for restructuring and one-off expenses of ZAR 2.9 million, quarter 1 EBITDA would have been 6% higher. The improvement in our revenue and rightsized cost base see the positive jaws delivering improved profitability. In conclusion, I'm very pleased with the first quarter results, especially the increase in EPE account openings that we have seen during this period. The improvements in our products, distribution and technology are bearing fruit, and we are well placed to quickly and sustainably expand our share of the grant recipient market in South Africa. I would like to hand over to Naeem now, who will take you through the income statement and balance sheet in more detail.\nNaeem Kola: Thank you, Lincoln. As Chris said, the first quarter of fiscal 2024 year reflects positive operational momentum in both divisions translating into financial performance despite the challenging trading environment. We again delivered against what we set out to do with revenue reported at the upper end of our guidance and group adjusted EBITDA within our guidance for the quarter. The Consumer Division is seeing signs of increased momentum in our key revenue drivers and the overall trends in our merchant division remain positive. It is also important to note that we incurred ZAR 6.1 million of restructuring costs mainly in the merchant ATM business without which we would have exceeded our EBITDA guidance. As a reminder, Lesaka is a domestic filer in the United States. We report results in U.S. dollars under U.S. GAAP. However, our operational currency South African rand and as such, we analyze our performance in South African rand. This is the first quarter that is directly comparable to the prior year with Connect Group included in full for both periods. Looking at the consolidated income statement for the quarter, we grew revenue by 19% to ZAR 2.54 billion compared to Q1 2023 and 2% compared to Q4 2023. In U.S. dollars, we reported consolidated revenue of $136 million for the quarter, up 9% compared to $125 million in Q1 2023 which is reflective of the 9% weakness in the ZAR against the U.S. dollar over the period. At an operating income level, we achieved an important milestone for this quarter, reporting a profit of ZAR 4.2 million for the quarter compared to a loss of ZAR 80 million in Q1 2023. Depreciation and amortization of ZAR 109 million for Q1 2024 include ZAR 67 million related to the amortization of acquired intangibles. Related to the Connect Group acquisition, acquired asset amortization reflects the accounting treatment for acquired assets, which is both a nonoperational and a noncash accounting charge. In September 2022, we sold our interest in carbon, a noncore equity accounted investment, the second tranche of the equity payment of ZAR 4.7 million fell due in the quarter and has been received, and thus, we reversed the allowance for doubtful loans receivable of ZAR 4.7 million created in fiscal 2023 upon the sale of the interest. This reversal is included in the caption, reversal of an allowance for doubtful EMI loans receivable in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. Our net interest expense decreased to ZAR 83 million in Q1 2024 from ZAR 86 million in Q4 2023 through further cash optimization measures across the group. Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023 is mainly impacted by the increase in the benchmark interest rate in South Africa in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023. In the prior period, we reported progress made in the rationalization of investment in Finbond, another noncore investment. We have entered into agreement to exit this position and receive a cash consideration of approximately ZAR 64 million in December 2023 when this transaction is expected to close. The loss from equity accounted investments in the income statement relates to the impairment loss on Finbond investment of approximately ZAR 22 million recognized during the quarter. The impairment arises because we are required to eliminate the foreign currency translation reserve held against the Finbond investment due to the expectation that the position will be sold by the end of December 2023. Overall, we expect no impact on the net asset value. Fundamental loss per share, which excludes nonoperating items, continues to narrow, improving 94% compared to Q1 2023 to ZAR 0.08 per share. In management's view, this is appropriate earnings per share measure given the adjustment for one-off nonrepeatable items and PPA amortization and other noncash items. As mentioned, at an operating income level, we hit an important milestone in this quarter, reporting an operating income of ZAR 4.2 million compared to a loss of ZAR 80 million in Q1 2023, which is largely attributed to the improvement in the Consumer Division's operating performance. After adjusting for amortization of acquired intangibles of ZAR 67 million and nonoperational and noncash accounting charge, we have delivered an ZAR 84 million improvement to operating income compared to Q1 2023. At a divisional level, merchant delivered a 20% revenue increase year-on-year and 5% quarter-on-quarter, a robust result given the challenging operating environment for merchants we serve. In the Consumer Division, revenues grew 13% year-on-year. We are seeing very good momentum in EPE account activations driven by our new consumer growth initiatives highlighted by Lincoln earlier. This is a positive indicator as it is the foundation for building further annuity income in our consumer revenue base. Year-on-year, the Merchant Division reported a segment adjusted EBITDA of ZAR 150 million for the quarter to September 2023 compared to ZAR 135 million in Q1 2023. The Consumer Division delivered segment adjusted EBITDA of ZAR 46 million for Q1 2024 compared to a loss of ZAR 24 million in Q1 2023. I will unpack the sequential quarterly results at the division level on the next slide. Group cost of ZAR 34 million reduced 14% compared to ZAR 39 million in Q1 2023 mainly due to lower external audit, legal and consulting fees. Group adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased 126% to ZAR 163 million and came in at the midpoint of our market guidance for group adjusted EBITDA. Consumer revenue decreased 6% quarter-on-quarter to ZAR 291 million from ZAR 309 million in Q4 2023. Adjusting for ATM revenue related to third-party acquired transactions, which are reported in the Merchant Division for this quarter, consumer revenue would have increased by 4% in the quarter. Merchant segment adjusted EBITDA of ZAR 150 million increased 11% year-on-year, although decreased 3% compared to ZAR 154 million in Q4 2023. Steve addressed this in detail in his Merchant overview, but the primary reasons are restructuring costs in the ATM division, provisions related to the Kazang Pay Advance product and the lower revenue of bulk VAS deals and resale of airtime vouchers during Q1 2024. Excluding the impact of the restructuring costs in the Kazang Pay Advance withdrawal, Merchant segment adjusted EBITDA would have increased 3% quarter-on-quarter to ZAR 158 million. In the Consumer Division, we anticipate the momentum in EPE account activations to translate into continued improved segment adjusted EBITDA as we scale our consumer financial services platform. Fundamental loss per share continues to narrow improving 94% to ZAR 0.08 per share compared to a loss of ZAR 1.36 per share in the first quarter of 2023. Quarter-on-quarter, this is an 89% improvement from a loss of ZAR 0.76 in Q4 2023. From a cash flow perspective, we saw continued momentum in achieving positive net cash provided by operating activities of ZAR 63 million in Q1 2024 compared to net cash used for operating activities of ZAR 131 million in 2023. Q3 2023 and Q4 2023 after adjusting for bulk VAS purchases will reflect a similar cash generation of between ZAR 50 million to ZAR 60 million per quarter. Looking further at how our net cash utilized in operating activities per cash flow statement compares to cash generated from business operations. We generated ZAR 184 million operating cash flow before interest paid, tax paid, working capital-related items and movement in loan book funding. We define this as cash generated from business operations and consider it an appropriate indicator of our conversion of EBITDA to cash. In Q1 2003, we generated ZAR 73 million, an increase of ZAR 111 million in a year. In our merchant card acquiring business, working capital requirements are relatively small. We estimate that approximately every ZAR 100 million in throughput growth requires ZAR 3 million in additional working capital. The negative ZAR 51 million working capital in Q1 2024 relates to month end falling on the weekend, and this requires mainly Kazang business to prefund VAS purchases to ensure we meet volume requirements over the weekend. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio is calculated as the net debt at a specific date divided by the annualized group adjusted EBITDA for the quarter. For Q1 2024, this improved to 3.1x due to improved EBITDA performance in the quarter compared to 3.2x in Q4 2023 and 5.9x a year ago in Q1 2023. As mentioned in Q4 2023, we are very pleased with the conclusion of our new funding arrangements, which are now finalized. Our lenders have agreed to reduce the margin on facilities G&H by 75 basis points on the basis of improvement over a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Reducing our net debt remains a strategic objective for the group. If we achieve a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, as defined in our loan agreements of below 2.75x, this will result in a further 100 bps reduction in the margin on facilities G&H. Capital expenditure in Q1 2024 amounted to ZAR 53 million. As we previously highlighted, this is mainly growth CapEx related to the merchant division. Our growth CapEx delivers a strong IRR on capital invested. In conclusion, Q1 2024 is evidence of the continued improvement in operational and financial performance and delivering against the guidance we set out for the quarter. Thank you. I will hand over to Chris for his comments on the outlook for Q2 and the full year results.\nChris Meyer: Thank you, Naeem. Turning to our guidance. I would like to provide our quarter 2 revenue guidance of ZAR 2.65 billion to ZAR 2.75 billion and group adjusted EBITDA of ZAR 170 million to ZAR 180 million. I would also like to reaffirm our full year 2024 revenue guidance of ZAR 10.7 billion to ZAR 11.7 billion, and group adjusted EBITDA of ZAR 680 million to ZAR 740 million. Our outlook provided does not include the impact of any M&A transactions that may occur. Thank you for attending the presentation of our first quarter results for the period ended 30 September 2023. And I would like to invite you to ask any questions you have at this stage. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question is going to be a live question from Raj Sharma of B. Riley.\nRajiv Sharma: Yes. I wanted to understand, first of all, on the consumer side, what are the consumer dynamics of adding the EPE accounts in -- can you talk a little bit about the immediate opportunity set that's available for customer acquisition and also the cadence of the churn going forward. I believe it can be pretty up and down in the last several months. But could you talk a little bit about the natural/deliberate churn on the accounts and where do you see that going? And then I have a follow-on question on the Connect side.\nChris Meyer: Thanks, Raj. I'll take the question on churn. And then I'm going to ask Lincoln maybe to speak a little bit about the growth opportunity in the market as we see it. So we'll take it the other way around, if you don't mind. So just in terms of churn away, we think about it as, firstly, there's what we would call natural attrition in the grant space. And that really is to do with in the old-age grant category, firstly is if a grant recipient passes away. And then the other natural -- piece of natural attrition is in the child grant beneficiary space where the child achieved the age of 18, and therefore, the parent no longer qualifies for that grant. Those natal attrition categories account for approximately 10% to 12% churn -- natural churn in the grant space each year. And if you look at our numbers, that is generally the churn that we are seeing. We're seeing about 10% to 12% churn in our numbers at the moment per annum. In Q4, we did have a spike in churn, and that was mainly to do with some cleanup that we did in the account base with some dormancy, which we do from time to time. So that was a decision on our part. It was an action we took at the time. But that -- and that is why we saw some spike in churn for that quarter. This quarter, we back to what we would consider sort of the normal ranges. Lincoln, if you want to pick up the question on the growth opportunity and the immediate focus in that regard.\nLincoln Mali: Yes. So Raj, if you remember the conversations we've had over the previous quarters. The first phase of our turnaround was on us taking out cost out of the business, training our staff, repositioning our brand, improving the relationship with SASSA and stakeholders. And as we indicated, those -- that part we've been able to complete. We now focus on growth and we've got 2 growth opportunities. The first one is that every month, you have customers or grant recipients who getting a new grant and we are always positioning ourselves to be one of the key financial institutions that are able to attract that customer base to come to us versus going to somebody else. The second one are those customers that are leaving the post office. And so those two combined opportunities are giving us the opportunity to be able to position ourselves to take advantage of those. So if you look at this quarter, we've been able to have gross activations of 76,000 for the quarter and the net number is 45,000. And we're starting to see that momentum because of our sales initiatives, our rebranding exercise, our communication and marketing, we think we are well poised to be able to grow our customer base much more than we had done in the previous year. So those opportunities are there for us, and we are able to take advantage of them.\nRajiv Sharma: Great. And could you also talk a little bit about this on the Connect side, Steve, the Kazang Pay Advance pulling it back. Is it -- was it competitive pressure? Could you give more color on that? Was it a competitive product? Or was it purely just your own product that needed to be revamped?\nSteven Heilbron: Sure. Raj, so I think as I mentioned in our presentation, we have a philosophy of experimenting with product. The -- on the back of our Kazang Pay product, our advanced product is something that we brought to market last year. We had a number of vintages based on certain algorithms that we launched, and we were not happy with the performance of those loans. Now as I mentioned, on an overall basis, we made a small profit but we decided to pull the product back into the warehouse. We're going to make some tweaks and relaunch the product into what is a healthy Kazang Pay base, but we need to tweak some of the data points and some of the learnings in the credit piece. So we were just not happy with the response that we were getting. So we felt to pull back, reengineer and we will relaunch. But we are excited today, if I can just say, I think we're still quite excited about the opportunity. And we see an experiment like this not as a failure, but as part of the learning, which is true to really the culture that we've been talking about present -- from each quarter presentation to the next.\nOperator: Our next three questions we have came over the Q&A widget. So I'm going to go one by one. Guys, can you give us a sense of the time line for potential M&A, your thoughts on the market and how you would go about funding any potential transactions, what you're looking for?\nChris Meyer: Steve, do you want to take the question? M&A time line and thoughts on the market?\nSteven Heilbron: Yes. So I think timing is always very difficult to talk to. I think at this particular point, it's fair to say that we are engaged with specific targets. These are very real opportunities. We're making very, very good progress. We would -- we are expecting and hoping that we will close on transactions within the Q4 financial -- sorry, within the FY '24 financial year. In terms of funding those transactions, again, this will be a combination really of really using our own equity, raising equity and a combination of debt. Some of the transactions we are looking at will involve a straight share swap.\nChris Meyer: I think if I could add to that, for us, we have a number of important parameters that we put around the funding strategy, the capital market strategy pertaining to M&A, we've spoken about a focus on our debt levels and EBITDA to debt ratio. So that's an important thing. Secondly, value will always be a key determinant. And thinking about relative value to our shareholders and the relative value of our share at any point in time. So we're very mindful around accretive opportunities and disciplined M&A underpinning anything that we might bring to the table.\nSteven Heilbron: If I can maybe just add to what Chris is saying is besides being accretive, the core thrust is either bolt-on to create scale in the areas that we currently pay -- play, but also critical to this is the addition of merchant services in new product offerings to our existing client base in terms of focus on the merchant space. And I think we did say the majority of our focus from an M&A perspective is on the merchant business.\nOperator: Thanks for that color. Moving to the Consumer business, how much of consumer growth is coming from Postbank?\nChris Meyer: So I'll start to maybe approach the question and I'll maybe bring Lincoln in. So there's no empirical evidence of exactly where growth comes from. We have anecdotal evidence speaking to our customers as we onboard them, and we can see what's going on in the market. we can see the significant reduction in numbers in terms of Postbank's customer base, that is public information. So yes. I think Lincoln talked about 2 categories. Category 1 is new grant recipients entering the base. And that is about a 10% number per annum coming into the universe of grant recipients. And then there's this trend moving away from the Postbank post office. I think on the whole, that trend is -- of moving away from the post office is the biggest trend, and that is the opportunity that is most present for us. And that is something that we're obviously very well focused on and positioned for.\nLincoln Mali: Yes, if I could just add to that. What's important for us is how we become competitive and how we have a value proposition that appears to customers, so that we're not just relying on something goes wrong with the post office. We want customers to be attracted to us to want to see a very proposition that speaks to them. And we want them to want to come to us. And we're getting a lot of referrals from our existing customers to other customers because of the services that we provide. We're also getting a lot of traction from our engagement with community leaders and all of that. So all of that work helps us to position ourselves well. So if there are troubles in the post office, obviously, it will count in our favor. But our focus is making sure that we are relevant and we give a proposition that makes sense for customers. Because if we just only rely on problems in the post office, if the post office fixes this problem, then we don't have our room to grow. So there is a competitive market out there with banks and retailers, and we want to be one of those that are preferred by customers because of our value proposition.\nOperator: Next question was submitted from David Garrity. Congratulations on a solid quarter and the good news on the reduction of funding costs. On the midpoint revenue guidance that you've given, you indicated about 12.5% year-over-year growth. This is lower than previous year's growth. What are the factors leading to this?\nChris Meyer: So I think -- David, thank you very much for the question. I think firstly, you must remember that prior year -- so the growth between FY '22 and FY '23, you need to take into account the inclusion of the Connect Group for a partial period. So the addition of the Connect Group into our numbers last year make it very difficult to make a like-for-like comparison when we look at FY '24 and beyond. And that is why we gave guidance at the start of the year, so last quarter, around expected revenue growth, medium-term targets of around -- I think we said 18% to 20%. So that would be our full year sort of expectation around guidance where we said our full year revenue expectation of between ZAR 10.5 billion to ZAR 11 billion. And we also gave, if you recall, an indication of a medium-term outlook beyond that. So we believe the guidance we're giving today in terms of next quarter is consistent with that medium-term outlook and full year guidance. And I also think what's important is to highlight is we're coming into Q2 and Q2 for us is seasonally an important time. Seasonally, it's our busiest time, particularly in our merchant business. And you would have seen that highlighted in the slides in the presentation earlier. So I think we need to look at the revenue guidance within that context as well.\nOperator: The next question is going to come in from the phone from Theodore O'Neill at Litchfield Hills Research.\nTheodore O'Neill: Congratulations on the good quarter. My question is about ARPU in the consumer segment. You're showing a 12% growth year-over-year in ARPU. And I was wondering a couple of questions around that. Should we expect that number to slow given the economic headwinds? And then as we think about that number going forward, do you target a growth rate for that or an absolute number to achieve in ARPU? Just wondering if you could talk about those issues.\nChris Meyer: I'm happy to take the question. Theodore, thanks for the question around ARPU. So for us, yes, we're happy with the growth that we've seen in ARPU. For us, the focus is actually around penetration into our customer base in terms of the ancillary products that we provide. So just to remind the primary base, our focus is around the EPE account and where we were -- and transactional fees on the account. And from there, we look to offer both insurance and credit to our customer base. And our focus is growing the penetration levels. And the growth in ARPU has come from moving our insurance penetration levels from -- we spoke about moving from 25% to 30%. If you look back 18 months ago, that number was around 20%. So we've seen very good growth in penetration and insurance. And we've maintained a penetration of around 40% on our loan book, even with the growth that we've seen in the customer base. So those are the drivers. We haven't set a target, if you like, in terms of overall penetration. I think it's too early for us to set that out, but that should give you a sense of what's been -- what's underpinned the overall increase in revenue primarily.\nLincoln Mali: Can I maybe also add that in these difficult times, we are also watching the quality of our businesses. And even during this difficult time, the loan loss ratio has remained stable but we continuously watch the quality of our book, and we have not seen any material deterioration in that regard. And also in the insurance side, we still have high collection rates in that space that are above industry norms and even our lapse rates are well below what's happening in the industry. So therefore, for us, we are watching not just growth, but also quality of that growth. And therefore, as Chris was saying, and ARPU that is resilient during these difficult times.\nOperator: A few more here that have been submitted over the chat. How does the removal of Kazang Pay Advance impact growth in the Merchant Division in the next few quarters on other revenue lines?\nChris Meyer: Steve, do you want to pick that up?\nSteven Heilbron: Yes. So I think let me start off by saying that essentially, the momentum and numbers that we have disclosed support the guidance that Chris has given in terms of Q2 and FY '24 guidance. So we have factored all of that into the numbers that we've presented. I'm hoping, and we are hoping that we can bring Kazang Pay Advance back to the table. We would like to try and do that in Q3 or early Q4. The impact of that from a profitability perspective, though, I think will be enjoyed more in FY '25. So as we mentioned earlier, we pulled the product. It's more or less P&L neutral over the period. We -- as I mentioned in our presentation, we made a provision on a conservative basis in Q1 of ZAR 3 million, which affected the Merchant segment adjusted EBITDA. We believe that we are adequately provided at the end of that quarter and we look to -- we're now tweaking the product and we'll bring it back.\nOperator: Great. And our final question today. Can you offer an update on MobiKwik performance and its listing plans?\nChris Meyer: Yes, we'll do. I'm happy to take that. Maybe quick. So I think overall performance in the business continues to be good. They have reported positive EBITDA for, I think, at least 2 consecutive quarters and the cash generative. So the focus in the MobiKwik business, when we talk to management and founders is building a track record of EBITDA positivity and cash generation to put them in a position to list the business. We spoke to them recently. They reaffirmed to us their intention is to look to IPO the business. The expected range that we understand it is in the second half of calendar 2024. So somewhere after June, probably around September, that is their focus. And so we remain positive in terms of the overall -- our overall exposure to MobiKwik and the direction of travel of the business.\nOperator: Well, great. Thank you, everyone. We've hit our hour mark. So we're going to wrap it here. And a reminder to everyone after you disconnect, there will be a replay of this webcast on the Lesaka Investor website. If there were any remaining questions, someone from the IR team will reach out to you shortly to answer them. We thank you, everyone, for your participation."
