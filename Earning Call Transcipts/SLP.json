A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Lisa Fortuna from Financial Profiles. Ms. Fortuna, you may now begin.\nLisa Fortuna: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to the Simulations Plus second quarter fiscal 2024 financial results conference call. With me today are Shawn O'Connor, Chief Executive Officer, and Will Frederick, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer of Simulations Plus. Please note that we updated our quarterly earnings presentation, which will serve as a supplement to today's prepared remarks. You can access the presentation on our Investor Relations website at www.simulations-plus.com. After management's commentary, we will open the call for questions. As a reminder, the information discussed today may include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Words like believe, expect, and anticipate refer to our best estimates as of this call. There can be no assurances that these will actually take place. So, our actual future results could differ significantly from these statements. Further information on the company's risk factors is contained in the company's quarterly and annual reports and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Shawn O'Connor. Shawn?\nShawn O'Connor: Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. Results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 played out as expected. Our team delivered solid revenue growth of 16%, with strong performance in both our software and services segments and reported diluted earnings per share of $0.20. Given our strong first half results, we are confident we will meet our full year guidance. Our market continues to show encouraging signs of strength. In the first calendar quarter of 2024, biotech funding has been strong, especially for companies that have drug candidates in the clinic. Biotech companies of this profile can benefit from our full portfolio of modeling and simulation capabilities. For large pharmaceutical companies, funding continues to vary depending on their near term direction, drug program stability, and business outlook, but the overall market is healthier compared to a year ago. For the balance of 2024, we remain cautiously optimistic that demand for our comprehensive suite of modeling and simulation software products and services will continue to gain momentum as market conditions improve. Before turning to our segment performance, I want to spend a few minutes on our topic of artificial intelligence as it relates to drug discovery and development. As I've noted previously, Simulations Plus was an early developer of AI technology and tools to optimize our predictive technologies. As AI technologies continue to develop, we keep pace by improving our use of AI technology to enhance our modeling and simulation solutions. Additionally, AI accuracy is only as good as the data sets used for training and our access to accurate public and private data is a true competitive edge and a barrier to entry in our business. Our longstanding partnerships and collaborations with both industry leaders and regulatory agencies have granted us significant access to both private and public data, essential for perfecting and refining predictive algorithms. This access to key data is critical to advancing our capabilities in AI-enabled biosimulation well into the future. When you look broadly at the digital economy, our business, rooted in science and data, stands to meaningfully benefit from evolving AI applications. Moving on to our software segment, software revenues increased 11% in the second quarter and were up 16% for the six-month period with good renewals, upsells and new logo activity. Overall, we are seeing solid demand in our key markets except for Asia, which continued to lag overall market growth. Our Cheminformatics business unit delivered 14% revenue growth in the second quarter and 10% for the fiscal year-to-date. This quarter's growth was due to higher revenues from ADMET Predictor, which continued to gain adoption and added another new AI biotech customer. Additionally, there were eight new customers and 18 upsells during the quarter. Our Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetics, or PBPK, business unit had a modest 2% revenue increase in the second quarter and 11% for the fiscal year-to-date. The PBPK business unit added six new customers and booked nine upsells for existing customers. Momentum is strong for GastroPlus and our expectations for full year growth are strong. Our Clinical Pharmacology & Pharmacometrics, or CPP, business unit delivered the strongest performance with revenue growth of 38% for the quarter and 21% for the fiscal year-to-date. Monolix continues to take market share from its primary competitor and saw another large pharma client commit to transition to the platform. During the quarter, we added 7 new customers and had 10 customer upsells. Revenue in our Quantitative Systems Pharmacology, or QSP, business unit decreased 6% for the quarter and increased 77% for the fiscal year-to-date. As a reminder, quarterly results can be lumpy for QSP based on the high price per license and a small pool of end users. Turning to our services segment, revenues increased 27% during the second quarter and 22% for the six-month period, with solid bookings and a healthy pipeline of active opportunities. Clients are being cautious about spending, but we're seeing a pickup in RFPs, which is a positive sign. There's still lingering volatility associated with start and stop decisions on drug programs and data delivery disruptions related to the completion of clinical trials. So we are managing through this volatility quite well to maintain a steady flow of projects, activities, and utilization of our scientific staff. Total backlog at the end of the second quarter was $18 million, which is strong as we enter the second half of our fiscal year. Services revenue in our CPP business unit were solid, up 10% in the second quarter and 11% for the full fiscal year despite the impact of volatility. In our QSP business unit, service revenues grew 78% in the second quarter and 89% for the full fiscal year, benefiting from immunology and cancer model projects. Services revenue in our PBPK business unit increased 39% for the second quarter and 11% for the full fiscal year, delivering strong growth after a sluggish first quarter performance. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will.\nWill Frederick : Thank you, Shawn. To recap our strong second quarter performance, total revenue increased 16% to $18.3 million. Software revenue increased 11%, representing 63% of total revenue, and services revenue increased 27%. On a trailing 12-month basis, software revenue increased 22% and services revenue increased 14%. As we communicated last quarter, the business unit reorganization we implemented in the first quarter to improve our focus on customers also allowed us to evaluate our departmental structure with a focus on continuing to improve operational performance and profitability, while providing our investors improved visibility to our progress. As a result, we moved all services personnel into cost of revenue departments. This has no impact on our total costs or net income, but does impact the services gross margin trend compared to prior periods. Accordingly, Q2 total gross margin was 72% compared to 83% last year, with software gross margin at 88% versus 92%, and services margin at 44% versus 66%. Approximately $1.3 million of the increase in cost of revenues corresponds to a $1.3 million decrease in G&A expenses. Turning to software revenue contribution by business unit for the quarter, PBPK was 54%, CPP was 24%, Cheminformatics was 18%, and QSP was 4%. For the trailing 12 months, PBPK contribution was 55%, CPP was 20%, Cheminformatics was 19%, and QSP was 6%. For the trailing 12 months, our customer renewal rate increased to 93% based on fees and increased to 84% based on accounts. For the trailing 12 months, average revenue per customer increased to $95,000. Shifting to our services revenue contribution by business unit for the quarter, CPP was 43%, QSP was 27%, PBPK was 25%, and REG was 5%. For the trailing 12 months, CPP contribution was 43%, QSP was 30%, PBPK was 22%, and REG was 5%. Total services projects worked on during the quarter was 176, a slight decrease from 183 last year, and quarter-end backlog increased to $18 million compared to $15.4 million last year. Anticipated revenue from backlog within 12 months increased to approximately 90%. Turning to our consolidated income statement for the quarter, R&D expense was 7% of revenue compared to 8% last year, sales and marketing expense was 11% of revenue, same as last year, and G&A expense was 30% of revenue compared to 38% last year. Total operating expenses were 48% of revenue compared to 58% last year. Income from operations was 24% of revenue compared to 26% last year. And income before income taxes was 29% of revenue compared to 32% last year. Year-over-year increases were primarily due to the acquisition of Immunetrics, compensation-related increases due to headcount additions, increases in stock compensation, and general annual salary adjustments for existing employees. Other income was $0.8 million this quarter compared to $1 million last year, primarily due to an increase in interest income of $0.4 million, partially offset by an increase in the fair value adjustment of the Immunetrics earn-out liability of $0.4 million. Net income for the second quarter was $4 million or 22% of revenue compared to $4.2 million or 27% of revenue last year. Diluted earnings per share was the same as last year at $0.20, reflecting a decrease in diluted shares outstanding as a result of last year's share repurchase. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased to $7.1 million compared to $6.2 million last year, and both were 39% of revenue. We calculated adjusted EBITDA by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, stock-based compensation, gain or loss on currency exchange, any acquisition or financial transaction related expenses, any asset impairment charges, and any tax provisions or benefits related to these items. The reconciliation of this non-GAAP metric to net income, the relevant GAAP metric, is in our earnings release and on our website. Income tax expense for the second quarter was $1.2 million compared to $0.9 million last year, and our effective tax rate increased to 23% from 18% last year. The increased tax rate was primarily the result of changes in prior-year estimated taxes and foreign tax-related differences we benefited from last year. Now that we're halfway through our fiscal year, our current effective tax rate estimate for the full fiscal year is 20% to 23%. Finally turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $117.5 million in cash and investments. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy and corporate development initiative as we continue to seek opportunities for strategic acquisitions, investments, and partnerships. I'll now turn the call back to Shawn.\nShawn O'Connor : Thank you, Will. Our second quarter results reflected strong performance in both our software and services segments. Market conditions have improved, but these changes require time before they translate into actual bookings and revenue. We remain cautiously optimistic. With our strong first half performance, combined with market improvement, we're well positioned to meet our stated fiscal 2024 guidance targets, which include total revenue between $66 million and $69 million, year-over-year revenue growth in the range of 10% to 15%, software mix between 55% and 60%, services mix between 40% and 45%, diluted earnings per share of $0.66 to $0.68, year-over-year diluted earnings per share growth of 35% to 39%. Before turning to the Q&A, I'd like to take the opportunity to reinforce key differentiators of our story. We're a clear leader in software and consulting services in a large and growing biosimulation market. Simulations Plus is a leader in biosimulation technology, leveraging AI tools since the company's inception to optimize drug discovery and clinical development through to and beyond regulatory approval. We have a compelling customer value proposition and strong competitive position with high barriers to entry. We have an attractive financial profile with a strong balance sheet and no debt. And finally, we have a seasoned management team with scientific leadership and significant expertise in modeling and simulation. Thank you for your time today. And with that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum.\nMatthew Hewitt: Congratulations on the second good quarter here in a row. Maybe first up, to follow up a little bit on the macroenvironment, obviously, you're starting to see some improvement on the biotech side. You commented on that. I'm wondering, on the large pharma side, how much of that is the funding versus some of the reprioritization and some of the other items that have hit that market over the past few quarters? Is it more just that or is there maybe some funding on the large pharma side as well?\nShawn O'Connor: During the last couple of years, the environment, biotech versus pharma, has been a little different. Certainly a funding issue on the biotech side. On pharma side, it's been less funding as it has been circumstances related to the individual company, their outlook in terms of patent exposure, on revenue streams, resorting their drug programs and investments there, their access – or acquisition, I should say, of new programs have created a turn there. You've got a wide range of scenarios from Novo Nordisk at one extreme and other companies. Pfizer is an example that's announced significant cutbacks this year. So most everyone is obviously in between those two extremes, but there's still a lot of churn and consciousness and sorting out of drug programs that are going to be invested in or not invested in. Catch all funding of those companies has been less of an issue in terms of their situation.\nMatthew Hewitt: Regarding the biotech funding, obviously, it has been – I think everyone's kind of seen the strong start to the year, but how quickly do you start to see that from a bookings perspective? Is it pretty quickly or is there a little bit of a lag? So when we're seeing the IPOs and the secondaries hit, is there a quarter or two lag historically or does that show up in your revenues right away?\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, we'll see. It's anecdotal depending on where their drug candidates are when they get the funding, where are those candidates in terms of the cycle of drug development. Typical sales cycles in our industry can range to I need a new seat and I need it tomorrow, I just hired somebody to prolong the budgetary activities. So I know I'm dancing around in answer to your question because I can't give you a it's a two month, it's a three month sort of lag. It runs across the spectrum in terms of timing. But, certainly, within the first quarter or thereabouts of funding activity, you're not going to see a quick turn in terms of market volume. But in the six to nine month range, I would anticipate many of these companies that are getting funded are going to be advancing their candidates, especially those that are getting funding with drugs in the clinic looking to go to the next level, close their protocol on the next clinical trial. Those are decision points that drive purchasing decisions.\nMatthew Hewitt: Maybe one more for me and I'll hop back in the queue. But, obviously, a big pop in ADMET. I think you quadrupled the number of customers versus last quarter, the new wins, I should say. Your upsells were up 3X versus last quarter. Maybe a little bit more color in what drove the strong pop there.\nShawn O'Connor: The technology is getting more acceptance in the marketplace in terms of what we're doing. The questions and the companies we're focused on, new generative AI solutions, the recognition that that which is in ADMET Predictor and the contributions we make there are not displaced by many of the new technologies that are being brought to the market. I'm extremely pleased yet another AI startup, biotech company, licensed our ADMET Predictor tool to supplement what they are building separately. I think that endorses that we're not being displaced or replaced in terms of many of these technology builds, AI technology builds, and the value of what we've built and brought to the market for many years here and continue to enhance and improve has its place and value in the lead optimization process.\nMatthew Hewitt: Well, congratulations again on the strong quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with BTIG.\nDavid Larsen: Hey, congrats on the very good quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the sequential increase in GastroPlus revenue? It looked very good to me, especially given that you had the harmonization process last year. Is there any more color or thoughts around that would be great?\nShawn O'Connor: Growth in the specific quarter here, year-over-year comparison was not tremendous, but this was our step up quarter as the harmonization process that completed last year set in motion a little bit different seasonality pattern to the year. First quarter to second quarter jump was an even larger jump sequentially for us and GastroPlus performed quite well. The harmonization process complete doesn't mean that there aren't licenses that slip from one quarter to another quarter based upon their closure at the end of any given quarter and whatnot. So, we had some impact from that. I referenced in the prepared comments with regard to softness in the Asian market where we're seeing, especially in China, some pullback in terms of spending related to well0known issues taking place there. So momentum is very good on GastroPlus. We're performing to our expectations for the year and look for that to continue to grow at a steady pace and continue to drive overall revenues.\nDavid Larsen: IQVIA, in their research business, they showed tremendous growth. It was, I think, one of their best quarters they've ever printed. I think it was second or maybe third best for IQVIA. I'm seeing a very good increase year-over-year in Monolix. Is there any correlation to that? How tied is MonolixSuite to clinical trial activity? Can't it create virtual clinical trials? I guess what's all that huge increase there over 30% year-over-year or 38% year-over-year growth?\nShawn O'Connor: Monolix is doing quite well. Made it through its harmonization process last year. It, since our acquisition of that product line in 2020, has been a fast grower, our fastest growing software platform these last few years and continues to perform nice in the marketplace, displacing the incumbent, the leading market share product there. This past quarter, we had yet another large pharma company that made the commitment to displace entirely the competitive product and go 100% to a use of Monolix for their needs there. So its momentum and progress continues quite strong into the future. It's tied to clinical trial activity? Yes, not quite so direct, but, hey, we've got 10 clinical trials this quarter. We need an extra copy of Monolix. But generally, there's a strong indirect correlation between development programs, clinical trials and the amount of modeling and simulation work that is being performed and therefore leads to growing staff and our clients that need Monolix on their desktop. But it's not quite so immediate quarter-to-quarter.\nDavid Larsen: And then the pricing, the average revenue per customer, I think it came in at like $113,000. That's up from $79,000 in 1Q. That looked very good to me. The fee retention, though, 94%. I mean, you had a great quarter, but it was down from 100% in 1Q. Anything going on there? What's sort of driving that?\nShawn O'Connor: We've more typically operated at a mid-90s level, 95%, 96% in terms of fees. Our performance last quarter was quite extraordinary. Not that I'm complaining about it, but it created a peak for which we'll always be compared to [indiscernible]. So the revenue renewal rate, I should say, this quarter was kind of the norm, , even though, as I mentioned, there were a couple of renewals that slipped out of Q2. So I think we're in good shape there. The components of the renewal, the number of accounts that are renewing, the stickiness of our price increase as implemented, all of those seem to be performing well at this point.\nDavid Larsen: You recently announced a new corporate development effort. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about what that is? Have you actually made any investments yet? And it's my understanding that this may enable you to capture some of the upside. If you work with a pharma client and you help them launch a successful drug, you could potentially capture some of that very significant revenue stream long term. Is that how it works? Is there any color there, would be great?\nShawn O'Connor: They've announced the program this year and certainly looking at a number of opportunities, as we speak here. It was really borne out of our acquisition strategy, which remains, first and foremost, number one priority in terms of the use of our capital in terms of identifying additional acquisitions to add to the Simulations Plus product and service portfolio. But in that effort, we encounter a number of situations with companies that have good technology capabilities, but for a whole host of reasons may not be acquisition candidates at this stage of the game. And yet, their technology that they've built might have some very positive go-to-market strategies, technological linkage, integration into our existing technology, all things that we could get benefit from more quickly as to waiting for them to mature and become an acquisition target down the road. So a number of those opportunities are being assessed, as we speak, and hope to find some candidates to make our first investments of this nature. One profile of investment in these companies may be companies that their use of our technology, their charge mission maybe include drug development processes by which our investment in them would allow us to play in the success of their drug programs as well. Our first and foremost sort of filter, though, will be their technology and its value in terms of our business model, which would be software license revenue and/or service revenue, but it does present an interesting scenario where we might be able to benefit from their drug development program success in the long term.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of François Brisebois with Oppenheimer.\nFrançois Brisebois: I was just wondering. Has there been a little bit of a misunderstanding maybe of what differentiate you from these newer AI drug development plays? And in terms of data, you guys have been around for a while and you have very strong data to build the algorithms on and that data has evolved, but is that something that anyone else could kind of shorten or accelerate the path to getting to product or is that always going to be an edge for you guys just based on the time that you guys have been in business?\nShawn O'Connor: We always get questioned in terms of the impact of some of the new AI technology ventures in the marketplace that garnered great attention and funding. So the question is abound. And our perspective here is one in which we participated in the development of AI technology for some time ourselves, very focused with our ADMET Predictor product and its use in terms of property prediction and think that we've got best of class product out there for that purpose. The technology ventures that have received this spotlight and funding are typically focused in other areas, biomarker identification, lead generation of some nature. And as I mentioned before, I'm quite pleased endorsing our perspective that we are best of breed in what we're doing and not being displaced by these other investments in technology development is the fact that yet another one of them became a customer this quarter and are using our best-in-class property prediction tool to supplement what they're developing. So, yeah, in the context of AI, certainly feel comfortable with our position and the success we have and will have in our focused use of that technology. In terms of data, second part of your question, yeah, we've obviously been in the game for an extended period of time. Public and private data are the obvious sources. The public data has improved tremendously both in terms of its volume and accessibility, but its curation is still a challenge. So we've got a leading edge in terms of years of developing a means to curate that data into a meaningful format that can be used in terms of the work that we do. On the private data side, we've got years of working with collaborative clients and/or partnerships with regulatory agencies that allow this access into data that is not readily available out there to anyone. Others can make partnerships, others can improve in curation. There is always a need on our part to stay running hard in terms of keeping our advantage in this regard. And I believe we have the capability to do that. And again, I come back to where we apply that data in terms of our predictive capability in ADMET Predictor as ongoing evidence of our ability to stay ahead of the curve now.\nFrançois Brisebois: Lastly, in terms of – it's been talked about a little bit by previous questions here, but in terms of large pharma versus biotech, do you ever get help kind of selling the program to biotech from large pharma just because a lot of these patent cliffs are coming and so much of the revenue generation and so much of the growth with large pharma comes from acquisitions of these biotechs? I'm just wondering if, for them, when they're looking at biotechs, if it would help them if the biotech was actually using this software as well to compare notes. So has that ever happened where large pharma helps out with biotech clients or are they really, really separate pieces here?\nShawn O'Connor: I'm searching for an example where it's not a separate piece, Franc. We've never been introduced and strong armed into a biotech as a result of a large pharma relationship. Our tools may be being used internally at large pharma in assessing some of – in their due diligence process and assessment of their acquisition targets that could be happening out there. We occasionally get involved in evaluating investment opportunities, but it's not a great frequency. But, no, I don't know that there's a lot of leverage. Probably the biggest impact is as funding goes into the biotech companies, they look to hire people. They hire people from large pharma that are pre-existing SLP product users and that creates an opportunity more quickly in terms of sales cycles we were talking about earlier. In terms of sales cycles as to funding leading to an acquisition, probably in between there is their hiring of an individual and then that hiring leads to a knock on our door in terms of filling his toolkit to undertake the efforts internally at the newly funded biotech.\nFrançois Brisebois: That makes sense. If I can just squeeze the last one in, the funding was tough for a long time with biotech and it's starting to turn definitely with the start of this year. But do you ever see – ultimately, if your guys is – one of the big advantages with your software is to cut costs and let go programs that don't necessarily have a good chance of success. Ultimately, do you expect lower funding if this was to happen in the future to not really impact you at all because the thesis is to actually cut costs or is this too far, further distant future here, I guess?\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, you're getting pretty far out in the columns on the spreadsheet of predicting the future there a little bit. I don't know that efficiency will lead to less funding. The funding ratio between funding and successful drug programs, I think it's still remaining somewhat static there. Hopefully improves them in the long run and will certainly take any lead that you can provide. We can help those biotechs be more efficient in their programs. I think it's a couple steps removed in terms of the linkage that you're describing.\nFrançois Brisebois: Yeah, I just meant, like, less dependent on the funding environment sort of thing for future, maybe downturns or whatnot.\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, we certainly have impact in terms of a more efficient spend on the funding that takes place, more efficient spend of that. But the drug program, depending on the circumstances of that entity, may or may not require – even efficient spend may lead to more funding for further development.\nOperator: Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of David Larsen.\nDavid Larsen: I wanted to ask, Will, a question about his new sort of expanded role, I think, of chief operating officer. Just, Will, what are you seeing from that perspective? Maybe can you talk a little bit about the reclassification of some G&A costs up into COGS? Why did you do that? Just any color would be very helpful.\nWill Frederick: I think one of the things it definitely allowed us to do as a company is look across the entire organization at the way that we're running our operations, both services operations and software operations. So, as we've progressed since we've done the acquisitions, we've always tried to have a one-company focus, I'll call it, that drives further synergies, leverages best practices throughout the organization. And this was one more step in addition to the most recent ones were sales and marketing consolidation. Certainly, the reclass that we did this year, as I mentioned, no impact on our total costs in the way that we've reported them. But given a little bit more clarity, and we've tried to incorporate that into the script on our cost as a percentage of revenue and really looking at what's our services organization costing us, where can we improve in utilization rates or allocations of effort to development, sales and marketing, what's our sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenue, what's our G&A spend? So really helping the company focus on areas that we can drive future profitability, get the leverage out of the business. And most importantly, we continue to have a focus on future M&A, so having this infrastructure in place that allows us to bring in new companies and keep layering on that infrastructure should hopefully allow us to see some nice synergies in the future.\nDavid Larsen: What I just heard you say was you had a better look at the earnings per individual in each department in the organization, and that's exactly what I like to hear, quite frankly. And then just last one, can you just talk a little bit about your sales organization? How many FTEs do you have in sales? How many are quota carrying? And then, you mentioned integration of sales force. Who was integrated into what? Was it Immunetrics or were there other integrations that happened recently? Just any sort of color there will be helpful. Sales is obviously very important.\nWill Frederick: Certainly, with the Immunetrics acquisition, we do have an earn-out, so there are certain constraints within where we can fully integrate it, but we've made strides in the direction to leverage our existing sales force. You've heard us talk about the cross-selling, where can we leverage customers that we have to sell services, software from the different business units, continue to work up that value chain within the organization, hire decision makers. We still got about the same amount of sales and marketing folks. So there's, I want to say, about 12 sales people, quota carrying, about 6 or 7 folks that are in marketing. And, certainly, a great addition, just recently, this last quarter with Dan Szot as our chief revenue officer. Shawn, anything I missed?\nShawn O'Connor: That sounds good. The consolidation process really started a couple of years ago. And at that time, before Immunetrics was pulling the resources from the divisions at the time, the previous acquisitions and consolidating them together into one sales and marketing organization that internally creates some efficiencies, but, more importantly, it was a focus in terms of our go-to-market presentation to our clients as one company. All of that leads to support to upsells and cross selling across platforms and across services to our existing customers. And I think that's been accruing benefits here for a while.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand it back to Mr. O'Connor for closing remarks.\nShawn O'Connor: Very good. Well, I appreciate everyone's attention today and hope all was well on your side and look forward to speaking again soon. Take care all.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does include today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. Results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 played out as anticipated. We delivered solid revenue growth of 21% and diluted earnings per share of $0.10, in-line with our guidance for the full year. Our team performed very well in what is still a softer environment for our biotech and pharmaceutical clients. A few notes on the background behind the results. As our clients closed out their fiscal years, we saw the usual spend before you lose in 2023 activity, a rush to use allocated budgets before the year-end. Even though the spend fell short of previous year-end highs, we were encouraged that it was greater than what we saw last year. We also gained insight into our clients' budgets for fiscal 2024. Some have more aggressive budgets, while others have more cautious as the industry's portfolio of drugs that are going off patent looms on their horizon, causing them to be more conservative on spending. Funding for biotech continued to show signs of life, but again, was still well below the funding levels of two to three years ago. Importantly, our leadership in AI and predictive analytics continue to accelerate discovery efforts and improve clinical outcomes for our clients. For context, we have been utilizing AI techniques and approaches in our solutions since our beginning. As AI technologies have evolved, we have enhanced our AI solutions and experienced the benefits that can be harnessed with better data access, algorithm training, and predictive accuracy. Our tenure in serving the drug development industry has provided significant access to private and public data necessary to perfect and refine predictive algorithms. Our partnerships in collaborations with industry leaders and regulatory agencies is unmatched and provides us with ongoing means to continue this into the future. Moving to our Software segment's performance, Software revenues increased 25% for the quarter, reflecting good renewal activity and converting an active and strong pipeline. Our Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetics, or PBPK, business unit had a strong quarter. Revenues increased 27% for the quarter, reflecting some spillover from the fiscal fourth quarter 2023 and a diminishing impact from small biotech client renewals that previously weighed on results. GastroPlus was referenced in 21 peer-reviewed journal articles and the PBPK business unit added six new customers. The team also booked nine commercial client upsell. In our Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacometrics, or CPP, business unit, revenues declined 1%. Biotech churn still exists in CPP, where we lost eight customers whose total revenue was only $120,000. In total, CPP added nine new customers and had 10 customer upsells in the quarter, with one renewal shifted to the second fiscal quarter. Our Cheminformatics business unit saw revenues increase 3% in the first quarter. There were two non-renewals, one from a small biotech and one renewal that was delayed for renewal later in calendar 2024. The team booked five upsells during the quarter and added two new customers. In our Quantitative Systems Pharmacology, or QSP, business unit, revenues increased 219%, reflecting a new license to an existing customer for the QSP oncology modeling platform. No new customers were added during the quarter and the team booked one upsell. We were pleased with this quarter's results, but given the large per license dollar amount and smaller client volume associated with this business, quarterly outcomes can be lumpy. Looking at our Services segment, revenues grew 17% during the first quarter. Services had a good start to the fiscal year as the momentum out of fiscal 2023 continues. Overall, services saw more choppiness than usual in project flow due to data and other client-related delays that impacted project deliveries. Services revenues in our CPP business unit were up 12% in the first quarter, a good outcome. CPP completed 67 projects in the quarter and continued its momentum from the end of the fourth quarter with excellent bookings. In our QSP business unit, Services revenue grew 100% for the first quarter, including the benefit from the Immunetrics acquisition. The team completed 27 projects during the quarter, with one cancellation from a large client that negatively impacted overall backlog. Services revenue in our PBPK business unit declined 12% in the quarter as revenues were negatively impacted by client-related data delays and affected project deliveries and milestones. During the quarter, the team completed 63 projects. Given the pipeline, the outlook for PBPK looks solid for the year. The Immunetrics integration continues to go well. Immunetrics has an active pipeline, reflecting inherited leads and new leads sourced in the SLP client base post acquisition. Overall, the QSP team is executing very well and is collaborating on projects. Before turning the call over to Will, I'd like to call your attention to a separate release that we issued simultaneously today announcing four key leadership appointments, each effective today. First, Will Frederick is assuming the additional role of Chief Operating Officer. Will has been with Simulations Plus since 2020 and has demonstrated excellent operational leadership over this time. In his new role, Will now oversees operations for all of our business units. Second, we're pleased to welcome Dan Szot to the Simulations Plus team in the new role of Chief Revenue Officer. Dan has over 20 years of enterprise sales experience across all phases of drug development in large organizations. In this key role, Dan oversees the sales and marketing teams to identify collaborative cross-selling opportunities and enhance productivity. Third, Josh Fohey is transitioning to Senior Vice President of Operations and will leverage his customer insights to provide client-focused leadership across all business units. And finally, Dr. Sandra Suarez-Sharp has been promoted to President, Regulatory Strategies. Sandra is responsible for expanding our Regulatory Strategies business unit, a critical fast-growing component of our overall services offer. These appointments recognize the experience and proven contributions of each of these leaders. Importantly, we share a common vision of always putting our clients first as the best possible way to ensure long-term sustainable growth. I'd also like to take a minute to thank those of you who attended our first Investor Day in November. We had a great turnout and the feedback has been positive. In addition to a deep dive into our business, we also outlined our new organizational structure. With this new structure, we reorganized the companies we acquired over the years into five business units that correspond to the scientific domains in the drug development process in which we have expertise. This structure aligns with how our clients do business with us and encourages cross-selling and collaboration. Our team continues to deliver tremendous value to our clients, providing customized services and easy-to-use software offerings, each of which is at the core of our business model. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Will.\nWill Frederick: Thank you, Shawn. We had another strong quarter, with total revenue increasing 21% to $14.5 million, with Software revenue up 25% and Services revenue up 17%. Software revenue represented 52% of total revenue for the quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, Software revenue increased 21% and Services revenue increased 9%. As we've mentioned in the past, our first quarter tends to be our lowest revenue quarter due to seasonality, and this year is no different. We are anticipating that we will see seasonally higher revenues in the remaining quarters of fiscal 2024 as we have had in the past, resulting in higher profitability in the remaining quarters of our fiscal year. Total gross margin for the quarter was 68%, reflecting higher cost of revenues in the Services segment as a result of updated reporting changes. Software gross margin increased to 87% from 85% last year, while Services margin decreased to 47% from 70% last year, primarily due to a shift from previously reporting multiple cost items in SG&A expense before the reorganization and now separately reflecting them in cost of revenues for Services. Gross margin for the trailing 12 months through this quarter were approximately in-line with the trailing 12 months ending first quarter of fiscal 2022. I'll go into more detail on how our reorganization impacts our expense reporting in just a few minutes. Turning to Software revenue by business unit for the quarter, PBPK represented 52% of Software revenue, CPP was 20%, Cheminformatics was 15%, and QSP was 13%. For the trailing 12 months, PBPK represented 57% of Software revenue, CPP was 18%, Cheminformatics was 18%, and QSP was 7%. For the quarter, our customer renewal rate increased to 100% based on fees and increased to 84% based on accounts. For the quarter, average revenue per customer increased to $79,000 from $68,000. For the trailing 12 months, our customer renewal rate remained at 93% based on fees and decreased to 83% based on accounts. For the trailing 12 months, average revenue per customer increased to $93,000. The lower account renewal rates are still primarily driven by non-renewals from smaller biotech customers, but we've been able to maintain our fee renewal rate consistently above 90%, even with this headwind. Shifting to our Services revenue by business unit for the quarter, CPP represented 46% of Services revenue, QSP was 30%, PBPK was 19%, and Reg was 5%. For the trailing 12 months, CPP represented 45% of Services revenue, QSP was 28%, PBPK was 22%, and Reg was 5%. Total Services projects worked on during the quarter was 179, same as last year, and quarter-end backlog increased to $18.9 million compared to $15.8 million at the end of the first quarter last year. Anticipated revenue from backlog within 12 months increased to slightly over 80%. As we previously discussed, the addition of Immunetrics has led to a healthy pipeline of activity, including new accounts sourced from our client base, helping to increase our overall Services backlog. Turning to our consolidated income statement for the quarter, total R&D costs remained relatively consistent at $2.1 million, with R&D expenses flat at $1.2 million and capitalized R&D at $0.9 million. With our recently announced transition to business units to improve our focus on customers, we also took the opportunity to evaluate our departmental structure with a focus on continuing to improve operational performance and profitability while providing our investors improved visibility to our progress. In performing this process, we looked at personnel in the following departments: services, R&D, sales and marketing, and G&A. This was done during Q1 to support the recently announced leadership changes and consolidation of company-wide operations. To better measure and report our operational performance, we made the following changes. We moved all services personnel into cost of revenues departments. We moved all R&D personnel into research and development expense departments. We moved all sales and marketing personnel into selling and marketing expense departments. And we moved all G&A personnel and all company-wide overhead and administrative costs into general and administrative expense departments. This still allows us to leverage the broad skill sets of our employees to perform activities in other departments and accordingly move their expense to those departments. For example, a services employee who spends time working on sales and marketing activities would have their expense related to this activity reflected in selling and marketing expense in our financial statements. If the same person also spends time working on R&D activities, their expense related to this would be reflected in research and development expense in our financial statements. These movements completed the final step towards standardizing reporting for the various acquired companies, including Immunetrics last quarter, to a company-wide business unit structure reporting. We believe investors will now have even greater insight to our cost structure and can compare future performance trends when they review our financial statements. We will continue our objective to reduce G&A expense as a percentage of revenue over time while maintaining our investments in R&D and sales and marketing. And as we've always done, we plan to continue driving increases in both our Software and Services gross margins. Selling and marketing expense for the quarter was $2 million, up from $1.5 million last year. G&A expense for the quarter decreased to $5.7 million from $5.8 million last year. Combined selling and marketing and G&A expenses accounted for 53% of total revenue compared to 60% of total revenue last year. This comparison reflects the shift this quarter for expenses that were previously bundled together in SG&A and are now separately reflected in cost of revenues for services personnel. Expenses generally grow each quarter with additional headcount added throughout the fiscal year. Income from operations remained consistent at 7% of revenue, and income before income taxes increased to 17% of revenue. Other income was $1.4 million this quarter versus $0.7 million last year, primarily due to increased interest income of $0.5 million driven by rising interest rates. Net income for the quarter was $1.9 million, or 13% of revenue, up from $1.2 million, or 10% of revenue. Diluted earnings per share increased to $0.10 from $0.06 last year. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $3.4 million, or 23% of revenue, compared to $3 million or 25% adjusted EBITDA margin last year. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by adding back interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, stock-based compensation, gain or loss on currency exchange, any acquisition or financial transaction-related expenses, any asset impairment charges, and any tax provisions or benefits related to these items. We provide a reconciliation of this non-GAAP metric to net income, the relevant GAAP metric, in our earnings release and on our website. Income tax expense for the quarter was $0.5 million, up slightly compared to last year, and our effective tax rate decreased to 19% from 23% last year. Now, turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $113.9 million in cash and short-term investments, and we continue to be well capitalized, have strong free cash flow, and seek opportunities for strategic acquisitions, investments, and partnerships. I'll now turn the call back to Shawn.\nShawn O'Connor: Thank you, Will. Our first quarter results provided a successful start to the year. We saw good performance from both our Software and Services segments. That said, the underlying assumptions regarding our outlook remain the same as client funding and budget cycles remain softer than historical levels. Following our fiscal 2023 revenue growth of 11%, we set fiscal 2024 revenue guidance with a range of 10% to 15%. Given our first quarter results, we're cautiously optimistic that the market for model-informed drug development could improve and return towards mid-teens growth, but it's too early to change our outlook. With that context, we are well positioned to meet our stated fiscal 2024 guidance targets, which include: total revenue between $66 million and $69 million, year-over-year revenue growth in the range of 10% to 15%, Software mix between 55% and 60%, Services mix 40% to 45%, and diluted earnings per share of $0.66 to $0.68. The atmosphere of collaboration is strong here at Simulations Plus, as is the drive to innovate and serve our clients to help develop safer and more effective drug solutions. We have a long history of innovation in biosimulation that is transforming drug development in R&D and a rich future for growth opportunities. We continue to grow revenues, deliver profitable growth, and generate cash. Thank you for your time today. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Hewitt with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Hewitt: Good afternoon, and congratulations on the good start to the year. Maybe first one, I'm hoping we could get a little bit more color on what you're hearing from clients and customers. It sounds like the very small end of the spectrum continues to have some maybe budgetary or balance sheet issues. But what are you hearing from the larger customers? Are they starting to feel a little bit more comfortable with the environment and maybe they're coming in and buying more and setting up more services?\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, Matt, I want to be more positive than I can be. We've seen some good discussions in terms of some of our larger clients engaged, very good renewal rates this quarter, very good uptake in terms of this year's price increase, very positive signs in terms of some of those accounts in their budget setting for 2024 calendar year. At the same time, you've got the Pfizers of the world announcing 2024 cutbacks in this environment in terms of patent fall off, in terms of some of their revenue producers. There are a good segment of those large pharma that are being relatively cautious as they enter their 2024 fiscal year. So, a little bit of a mixed bag, Matt. We certainly see some very positive signs. But, I'd say compared to a year ago today, better. Compared to years past, not quite there yet.\nMatt Hewitt: Well, we're on the right path at least. Maybe another question regarding the Services gross margin and some of the reporting changes that have occurred. So, if I'm hearing you correctly the Services gross margins will stay kind of in the upper 40%s. They're not going to bounce back into the 60%s here in Q2. Is that correct?\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, the reorganization and the resulting accounting reclassification of certain people and expenses, that will carry forward as we proceed into the next year. Our margins are good in the Software business. We sort of reset them with this reclassification of expenses. I'm not going to go back to where it was before, but should maintain in the ballpark at where it's at. And with these changes, the reorganizations, I anticipate seeing improvements, efficiencies that come as a result of that moving forward into the future. Our profitability overall unchanged in terms of the model if you will, but a reallocation of some of those expenses that showed up previously, primarily in the G&A part of SG&A up into the gross margin line, that'll continue going forward.\nMatt Hewitt: That makes sense. All right. And maybe one last one, and then I'll hop back into the queue. It sounds like the Immunetrics acquisition integration is on track. You talked -- I think you mentioned a couple of different times regarding some of the cross-selling synergies. Maybe just a little bit more color there on what this new addition has meant as far as opening up some new doors, creating some new conversations, anything along those lines? Thank you.\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, Matt, yeah, it's gone very well from an internal perspective. First, the teams, the QSP team pre-acquisition combined with our new team members from Immunetrics have come together and are working well. We're already seeing cross-pollination there in the sense of some of our team working on their projects. So, very good effort internally. Externally, yeah, the pipeline they brought to us upon the acquisition has continued to develop and it's been supplemented with the ability to put their models, their expertise, their therapeutic areas of expertise in front of more clients than they were able to do as a standalone entity introducing them to the SLP client base and that's generated a host of new opportunities and a very busy sales effort on that side. So, very pleased. Acquisition was closed not that long ago, in July. And I'd say as we hit the six-month mark here soon, the first half year has been very good in terms of the post-acquisition activity both internally and externally.\nMatt Hewitt: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Larsen: Hi. Congrats on the good start to the year. I was pleased with the revenue number that you reported. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about on the Software side, the kinds of price increases you're able to realize heading into calendar '24 that will impact 2Q? I'm trying to get sort of the sequential progression in revenue for Software as we head into fiscal '24. And then, also I see, I think, it was 100% fee retention, which seems to suggest to me that you can take price. So, thanks, yeah.\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, Dave, yeah, couple of questions embedded in your question there. In terms of anticipating sequential Software revenues, I'd point to the seasonality of our business coming out of fiscal year '23 last year. We operate with a Software revenue seasonality profile that is on an absolute dollar level. Our first quarter is the lowest quarter for Software revenue. And then, it steps up in second, third and fourth quarter, and to be more comparable in terms of the absolute dollar level. So, on a year-over-year basis, our growth now, if you recall, we had a harmonization process taken place last year, which changed that seasonality. That process is done. And as we enter into this year, our revenue growth Software-wise should be relatively consistent on a quarter-to-quarter basis. It doesn't say that there isn't going to be a renewal that slips from one quarter to the next. And in this quarter, we had some renewals that slipped out of the fourth quarter and came into the first quarter. With regard to price increase, our price increase we announced and we put that in effect in the fall timeframe. So, the price increase is already affecting this first quarter result to the extent that those renewals occur in the first quarter. But not necessarily a jump up from first to second quarter. It's a year-over-year jump up in terms of the price increase, anticipating your question there. Now, we were certainly more aggressive last year in fiscal year '23 versus '22 in the price increase that we implemented last year than we were this year. Economics have changed a little bit, macroeconomic environment. And so, our initiated price increase is not quite as large as it was last year, but it's a good contribution as we go into next year. 100% renewal on fee this year, yeah, reflective of a very good renewal rate in comparison to the renewal on accounts, which is and always is lower. The accounts that closed out and did not renew were all relatively small accounts, so their impact on fees was marginal. And the price increase came in and basically on a renewal on fees calculation offset those few accounts that did not bring in. Hope that answers the aspects of your question there, Dave.\nDavid Larsen: It does. Thanks very much. Can you just remind me, with regards to seasonality, what causes the uptick in Software revenue from fiscal 1Q to fiscal 2Q? Thanks.\nShawn O'Connor: Well, it's just the buying pattern. Keeping in mind that our Software revenues, generally speaking, are in any given quarter 80% renewal, 10% upsells and 10% new logos. So, from a -- dating back to our origins when a client signs up, typically their revenue -- because it's all 100% recognized up front in the 12-month license window, forevermore their licensed revenue falls in the quarter in which they initiated that business with us. In the first quarter, typically the quarter ended in November is not a new license window. December picks up as you close off some licenses at the end of our clients' calendar year. January, February are more active, new budgets allow me to license another [seed] (ph) of the application, and hence the step up from first to second quarter and then more consistency through the remaining quarters of our fiscal year.\nDavid Larsen: Okay, great. And then, just in terms of your own COGS and inflation, in terms of like the price increases that you're providing to your own scientists, has that level of, I guess, inflation sort of moderated a bit, which would obviously be a benefit to margin?\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, it's certainly in comparison to last year, the compensation profile in terms of the marketplace for our scientists have and has settled. It settled early in the last fiscal year. Really our big jump up in terms of compensation packages took place when you looked at our fiscal '23 versus fiscal '22, where we had a pretty significant step up that post-COVID timeframe, some remnants of the biotech flurry of funding that led to their hiring, which increased competition in the marketplace for this scarce resource. That's settled down relatively early in our last fiscal year. And so, as you roll forward from fiscal '23 to '24, yeah, no, there is wage inflation that takes place, but not nearly as dramatic as it was '23 versus '22.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. And just one more from me. With regards to Immunetrics, if I heard you correctly, the revenue being generated from Immunetrics is expected to gain momentum and continue to increase, and the cross-selling and expansion to your existing books should only grow as we head through '24 and into fiscal '25, and that would obviously benefit, I think, the QSP/QST line item for Service. Is that right?\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, absolutely. Good benefit here already in the first quarter where we saw 100% growth in QSP services revenue. That's indicative of the contribution of Immunetrics there already. They are working towards an earn out. That earn out is framed in calendar years, not our fiscal year. So, they just recently completed the window of their first earn out. The calculations are being made as to where they fell out there, we'll know that soon. Momentum is good, and they will contribute to our QSP business unit quite nicely, anticipate, through the end of -- through this fiscal year and beyond.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. And just one more for me. I'm sorry. China, up 51%. Anything to highlight there? And can you just remind me what percentage of revenue is coming from China?\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, it's a small contributor. Our revenue is about 20% in terms of the Asian market to which we would include Russia in that bucket. So, it's good growth on a small number. The growth is entirely Software. We don't have consulting on the ground in that region. And so, yeah, we've been pleased. I think this has been a good sequence of two, three, four quarters in that [region for us] (ph).\nDavid Larsen: Okay. I'll hop back in the queue. Congrats on a good quarter.\nShawn O'Connor: Thanks, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of François Brisebois with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nFrançois Brisebois: Hi, thanks for the question. Congrats on the quarter, too. Do you share what you consider aggressive in terms of price increase percentage-wise, or what you've done there, or any color on how -- what kind of percentages those are?\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, I mean, we haven't gotten to specific there, Frank, but from a ballpark point of view, 5% price increases have been sort of the norm in the industry in this past year that could have doubled. And this year, we've turned to historical patterns.\nFrançois Brisebois: Okay. And when you say that the space -- we're hoping that it goes back to mid-teens growth in terms of the space here, where would you consider the growth now?\nShawn O'Connor: Where is the growth now? I mean, our guidance of 10% to 15% tells you that my outlook and the growth of the business is in that lower half of the teams as we remain pretty cautious given the sluggishness of the market. In terms of expected long-term growth out of this market segment, that would be in the 15% or above sort of range.\nFrançois Brisebois: Okay. I guess what I'm trying to get at is for you to pass -- kind of get by the growth of the market, would that -- is that doable organically or does that require M&A?\nShawn O'Connor: My view has always been that we can grow at or above market growth. And the basket of goods and services that are included in most of your computational biology research reports, we don't play in all of the markets under that umbrella. So, there are some differences in terms of how you slice the pie there. But generally, if you look back historically, we've been able to grow at or above the market and supplant that with acquisitions that then become part of our organic growth in the long run.\nFrançois Brisebois: Okay. And in terms of the ratio there, the Software to Services, obviously, the Immunetrics kind of gives a little more of a push on the Service side. What would you ultimately -- down the road, can you help us understand where you would like to be in terms of that ratio?\nShawn O'Connor: Well, 60-40 has been our mantra pretty consistently, and I hold to that at this point in time. I think it's important to -- that is the input to top-line revenue growth and bottom-line profitability. Obviously, the mix of Software revenues and Service revenues can contribute to that profitability number, those two revenue sources, in different ways. So, we've always targeted that sort of split to maintain the profitability. Service opportunities arise, and service opportunities are good ways for us to broaden our support of our clients, I mean, if it fits right into that and create top-line growth opportunities that didn't exist in the company before. So, there's always going to be a trade-off over time, but our commitment is to maintain good, high, and above market revenue growth at the top-line and good profitability profile out of the model.\nFrançois Brisebois: Great. That's it for me. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen with BTIG. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Larsen: Just a quick follow-up here. It seems like in the deck, some of the divisions maybe were renamed. I just wanted to make sure that that's the case, like PBPK is Gastro; CPP, Monolix; Cheminformatics, ADMET; QSP, other; and then, CPP would be PKPD; and reg is other. Is that correct or not?\nShawn O'Connor: Yeah, you've got two forms of presentation in there, Dave. The business units are the PBPK, the Cheminformatics, the CPP, Clinical Pharmacology Pharmacometrics, and the Regulatory Strategies of the business units. When we report the Software underlying details, GastroPlus is the primary software product in the PBPK business unit. Monolix is the primary software product in CPP, and ADMET Predictor is the primary product in Cheminformatics. So, we're presenting information that is summarized by business unit as well as summarized by product.\nDavid Larsen: Okay. Fantastic. Thank you. Congrats again.\nShawn O'Connor: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Shawn O'Connor for closing comments.\nShawn O'Connor: Very good. Thank you, operator, and thank all of you for your attention today. Good start to the year by Simulations Plus, and I look forward to reporting continued results next quarter. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
