        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Peloton Interactive Q2 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a few brief opening remarks, we will begin immediately going into our Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Peter Stabler, Head of Investor Relations. Mr. Stadler, the floor is yours.\nPeter Stabler: Thanks, Sherry. Good morning, and welcome to Peloton's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. Joining today's call are CEO, Barry McCarthy, and CFO, Liz Coddington. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today only and will include statements related to our business that are forward-looking statements under federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could impact our actual results, please refer to our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter, both of which can be found on our Investor Relations website. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's shareholder letter. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for our first question.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our first question. And that will come from the line of Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDouglas Anmuth: Great. Thanks so much. Hi, Barry and Liz. A couple of questions. You called out that the Treadmill market is 2x that of Bikes. Can you just help us understand how you're going to lean into those products more going forward? And if Tread+ demand is strong, why isn't that helping free cash flow more in the back half of this year, just given the considerable existing inventory that you have? And then secondly, can you just help us understand the current mix of sales or perhaps sub additions across Peloton direct and third-party and Bike rental and any thoughts on how this could trend going forward? Thanks.\nBarry McCarthy: Let me take the first part of the question, maybe Liz can take the second part, Doug. Thanks for joining today. The demand for Tread has been stronger than we anticipated, both for Tread and for Tread+. I think that interest in Tread+ has makes the Tread look even more attractive in comparison because of the price point differences. So that would be category one. The other exciting thing about the Tread and the fact that we're seeing real growth year-over-year in units is that for as long as I've been associated with the business, we've been largely dependent on the Bike business. And now it appears that we have at least an important second leg of the stool to help support growth. Now with respect to Tread+, we do have a substantial number of units in inventory. The good news is we've paid for them. So each sale is quite helpful to cash flow and initial demand was quite strong. But we have limited sales experience, and we have limited even more limited sales experience at full price. And so a little bit uncertain about what the demand will be coming into Q4. We're also a little bit uncertain about our ability to fulfill the demand. So our first obligation is to retrofit the existing units in the field with the Rear Guard. And to the extent that we are manufacturing more Rear Guards than we have capacity for installs and retrofits than they're available for us to retrofit existing inventory and ship to new purchasers. So that's the perspective on Tread+. There was a mixed part of the question, Liz, I was going to kick over to you.\nLiz Coddington: Yes, sure. In terms of the mix, I think the question was about what are we thinking in terms of our mix going forward into the back half of the year. As far as kind of the hardware sales piece of the business, from a Bike rental perspective, we are leaning into that. So we do expect to continue to see our mix shift toward the Bike rental or the FaaS rental. In terms of third party, for the back half of the year, our third-party business is impacted by a lot of key moments in those third-party channels. And so we'll lean into those and depending on how well those actually do that, that may result in some mix shift into third-party at certain moments, but we don't expect it to be a significantly higher portion of our sales in the back half of the year versus the first half of the year.\nBarry McCarthy: One additional comment about Tread. I am pretty excited about some of the content that we're going to bring to the platform. It will be oriented towards more of the performance athletes particularly marathon training. We entered into a partnership with New York Road Runners, I'm super excited about that, and we filmed in 3D, the Marathon course, the New York Marathon course this year and that will be available on our platform for runners who are training for the marathon. And we also captured the metadata and so the elevation on the Treadmill will automatically change as you progress down the course. And we hope to expand that to other leading marathons in the world and continue to lean into that segment of the marketplace, which I think helps to reposition the brand in important ways.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Your line is open.\nRonald Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Hi, Barry. Hi, Liz. I wanted to ask on engagement, Barry. It was up 6% year-over-year. Just curious, can you tell us how engagements evolved on the platform over the last several years with Peloton offering more content across more devices. Of course, the app, or are we seeing members adopting more of a hybrid style, or is it one or the other is question one. And then Barry, you mentioned in the letter, you've disappointed the team can improve performance in the current quarter as you did in the second quarter. Just talk to us about some of the improvements you saw in 2Q that helped numbers come in better than expected. Thank you.\nBarry McCarthy: I was having trouble hearing during the second quarter improvement in what?\nLiz Coddington: What helped us beat Q2, I think.\nBarry McCarthy: What helped us beat Q2. Is that the question?\nRonald Josey: Yes. And I think you said you'd be disappointed if the team can't improve performance in the quarter similar to 2Q. So curious what happened in the last quarter to maybe do better here going forward?\nBarry McCarthy: Yes. I'll do part of it and Liz will take part. Well, as you mentioned, engagement was up 6%. The Connected Fitness engagement was up 4% year-over-year, and the app was up 7% year-over-year. We have not really made significant progress yet in personalization. I should say it differently, we've made good progress, but we can run a lot faster and we can do significantly better. And I am tremendously excited about the work that we are doing now and the insights that Nick Caldwell brings to the table. And I think a year from now, we're going to be in a significantly better place and it will have a really positive impact on engagement, and we know that engagement is a big driver of churn. So churn was down in the quarter and engagement was up. And I think there are opportunities to continue to broaden engagement plus we're doing some really interesting things in the content team on different platforms that are contributing to the overall improvement in the user experience. I'm thinking by a way of example, in entertainment with YouTube Video and the NBA League Pass. Just by a way of example, and we've seen a very substantial increase in engagement in that content amongst Tread users by a way of example. So we've come a long way, but we're going to come a lot further faster in the foreseeable future. And certainly, AI will play an important role here.\nLiz Coddington: Yes. A few things to add about our outperformance in Q2. So some of the areas that really worked well for us were our Bike rental and FaaS, the third-party and our refurbished inventory sales or Bike sales. Those all outperformed our internal expectations in the quarter, which is great. And our Bike rental also benefited from the fact that we've had -- we had lower churn, so that helped with subscribers. And also, we launched self-service buyouts on our platform, which was a really great win because we saw 11% of our rental members buy out in the quarter, which also contributed to some of the outperformance. There are other -- there are some other factors that are impacting our subscriber growth for the quarter. As we mentioned, our hardware demand was a bit lower overall than we forecasted, but we had some offsetting tailwinds that benefited us. First, our supply chain team did a great job and outperformed in terms of delivery efficiency. That means we had a bit of a pull forward in our deliveries into Q2 that we had expected to have in Q3. We also had faster subscription activations in the quarter than we expected. Sometimes over the holidays, people lag a bit with activating their subscriptions. And we saw that was faster than we expected too, so that helped with subscribers. And then another benefit that we had is we had lower new subscription passes in the quarter and higher-than-expected reactivations from a pass state than we expected. So that helped overall retention and is one of the drivers of our better-than-expected Q2 churn results. Another thing that is also really important to understand about our performance in the quarter is the secondary market. That continues to outperform our expectations and was a key contributor to subscriber growth in the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Boone: Thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about the increase in media spend that you guys called out in the letter. As we get further away from the re-launch of the digital app, how should we think about marketing, especially as you just mentioned, the pullback in overall demand for hardware. And then, Liz, is there anything you can call out in terms of Connected business gross margins going forward, that stepped up in the quarter. How do we think about that for the back half of the year and then going forward? Thanks so much.\nLiz Coddington: So to the first question, it sounds like it was about increase in media spend that we saw in Q2. So we always generally are typically see an increase in our media spending in Q2 because it is our holiday quarter and we use that as a way to drive leads and demand for our hardware products and our app on all of our products. In the back half of the year, we do expect to spend less in media just seasonally. So we do expect lower quarterly media spending going forward. Now remember, another thing to understand about our business, I would really come back to this on these calls is to talk about LTV to CAC. And so we're trying to optimize for that for the business. And so when we look at our media spending, we are trying to make sure that our media spending is efficient and drives an efficient LTV to CAC, definitely over one. Ideally, we want to be in the 2x to 3x range. We were not there for Q2, but we were above one, and our goal is to move towards more increasing media efficiency. Now on the Connected Fitness gross margins, we do expect -- we don't guide specifically to Connected Fitness gross margin, but we do expect some improvement in the back half of the year, in part because our Tread+ deliveries which actually just started will benefit gross margin in the back half. That -- that will be -- we do see a little bit of pressure from areas like Bike rental as that continues to take share, that will put a little bit of pressure on our Connected Fitness gross margin, but we do expect sequential quarterly improvement. Now it is important to note, though, with gross margin coming back to the LTV to CAC feet piece. Gross margin and promotional activity, obviously, that affects gross margin. And so we're optimizing for LTV to CAC. And if we see the opportunity is better to reduce our LTV by reducing our gross margin and optimizing our media spend accordingly, we'll make that trade-off and evaluate it as we go.\nBarry McCarthy: I would say at a high level, I'm pretty optimistic about our ability to try to bring more efficiency out of the marketing spend, and we're making some structural changes in the way that we run the business that will help contribute to increased operating leverage. And I'm being -- I realized I'm being vague, but I'm being intentionally vague, but it's among the reasons why I have some optimism about the go-forward performance.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nShweta Khajuria: Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I have two, please. One, Liz, could you please talk about the free cash flow. So your guidance now calls for lower expectations than what you talked about last quarter, you expect to be positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter and not for the full year. So help us think about why the change and what drove that? And then the second question is on how to think about the impact from TikTok and lululemon. Is $10 million a quarter that you quantified last time, did it come in better than expected? How should we think about it going forward? And then the impact of TikTok on P&L, please. Thank you.\nLiz Coddington: Sure. So let's start with the free cash flow question. Why is our free cash flow outlook lower than we had previously expected. So, for Q2, while our paid subscriptions for Connected Fitness outperformed our expectations, our hardware sales, as I mentioned earlier, were a bit softer than we expected. So we're projecting that softness from a trend perspective to continue into Q3 and Q4, and that creates a bit of a cash headwind for us. We're also continuing to see that mix shift into Bike rental or FaaS and that puts pressure on our cash because, again, we don't collect all of that hardware revenue upfront. And then if you put that together, it means we have a bit of a cash headwind from inventory compared to our prior forecast. And that's mainly coming from our Bikes. We also had a few payment timing benefits that pushed from Q2 into Q3 that helped Q2 cash flow, but will impact us a bit in Q3. Now the other question was about TikTok and lululemon. I can probably take the lulu piece, Barry, I don't know if you want to talk about that.\nBarry McCarthy: She was anchored on $10 million and I think wanted confirmation on that.\nLiz Coddington: Oh, yes. So, yes, our lululemon partnership, at least we're talking about the Studio -- the Studio All-Access Members that have the, what was firmly known as the Mirror hardware product. That performed as expected, actually a slightly bit better than we expected. So that is on track. And then TikTok, that is really a marketing relationship with TikTok that we -- it's early days. We don't have a lot of explicit assumptions around how that is going to provide upside to our financials going forward in Q3 and Q4.\nBarry McCarthy: Yes. We're in the third week of the TikTok deal, and we've seen a very substantial increase in the number of pieces of content in those three weeks. If we compare to week one, I think it was about a 50% increase, and we've seen a 3x increase in total views, but it's much too early to know where that's going to land. We're excited, our first live class had over 130,000 views, which is a pretty good start, but I'm sure we can do much better than that. The important thing to note is we're reaching a demo that's much younger and TikTok is proving to be an enormously effective platform to help us do that. So we want to lean into that. I think that if we do it well, it has implications for growth in app. But it's way too early to have any meaningful insights yet. The other thing I'd say is, for those of you who saw the headline yesterday that TikTok squared off with Universal over music rights, but I want you to know that doesn't implicate our marketing agreement, our content on TikTok is fully licensed with the labels.\nLiz Coddington: There is one thing I wanted to comment on with regard to the $10 million from lululemon for the Studio All-Access Members. That was just reflective of November and December. So that was just two months in Q2, and it will be obviously a full quarter in Q3 and beyond.\nBarry McCarthy: Coming back to the cash flow thing here is what I would say. Let's remind ourselves what the two objectives for the business, one is stop the bleeding. The other is grow the business. I'd hope that we would generate more cash flow in the second half of the year than we currently think we're going to. But the important thing is we still think we will cross the finish line and get cash flow positive in Q4. And if you look at our balance sheet, that the business is not going away, which for a long time was a systemic threat. So because of that, we're able to focus on renewed growth. Now what have we accomplished in the last two years to assist with that. Well, there's been very little product innovation. We reintroduced an existing product, Tread+, and we launched the Row, which mostly we sell to existing subscribers and a little bit to new members. So not much on the product side, a lot of innovation with respect to the business model, different go-to-market strategies, 3P and FaaS, being to note were the examples. I think what you're going to see in the next two years is a significant product innovation and which I'm very excited about because I think we have a real shot at changing in a meaningful way at the growth trajectory of the business.\nOperator: And one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nAneesha Sherman: Great. Thank you. Barry, you've talked about the seasonality of the business with more growth clustered in the winter months. Can you square that with your view of flat growth in Q3, which is a winter quarter, especially in the light of all the successful initiatives you've highlighted in your letter? And then on the other side of this, you're lapping a weak Q4 this year, and you expect positive growth. Are you comfortable with having fully lapped the seasonality effect at that point. So from Q4 onward, you're basically like-for-like on seasonality?\nBarry McCarthy: Well, our view on -- maybe we've communicated poorly, but our view on seasonality hasn't changed, actually. It is Q2, the holiday season, which drives 40 plus percent of the annual volume. And there's not much seasonality in the rest of the year, slows in the summer months a little bit. But that would be the only other qualifier I would mention.\nLiz Coddington: And I also think it depends on what you're looking at. If you're looking at subscribers, we do expect to grow subscribers in Q3. So both on the Connected Fitness side as well as the app side.\nBarry McCarthy: Now we did deal with the seat post recall beginning in May of last year, and that certainly caused a lot of softness for the B1 Bike. But we've been living with that softness for B1 Bike ever since. So it's not like consumers suddenly rediscovered a love for that product in the aftermath. We see significantly different trajectory for unit growth for Bike+, by the way, but.\nLiz Coddington: And also our Treadmill products, we're seeing growth there.\nBarry McCarthy: Sorry, I didn't mean to imply that wasn't the case. I just meant to say that if you're expecting sort of resurgence in demand post the seat post recall for B1 Bike that really hasn't -- that hasn't happened.\nAneesha Sherman: And if I can ask a quick follow-up. Do you believe at this point, you're kind of huge inflection in growth your 2020, 2021 cohorts. Have those COVID users now sort of normalized in terms of churn and your churn level is now back to normal across cohorts, including the COVID cohort?\nLiz Coddington: Yes. I would assume that's the case. Yes.\nBarry McCarthy: I think there was a short thesis that maybe they came in with COVID and they're all going to fly out the door afterwards, and that just -- that's just flat wrong.\nLiz Coddington: If you look at our churn profile, our churn rates and you look at them on a cohorted basis, like a 12-month churn rate by cohort, it's not coming down substantially in any way. The only factors that are influenced just to add one more comment, the only factors that do influence our churn are the mix into the Bike rental, which we have talked about in prior quarters, where our Bike rental subscriptions do have a higher churn rate than our regular All-Access Members, although we are working to bring that down, and it did improve quarter-over-quarter in Q2, which is great. And then also, I think we've talked about in prior calls, the secondary market, which is the people who buy a Bike not through us, but through someone else like from a marketplace of some sort that those do have a slightly higher churn than people who buy directly from us. And so as that increases, that will put some pressure on our churn as well. But our underlying churn for our All-Access Members that come through -- is pretty stable.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nEdward Yruma: Hey, guys. Two quick ones from me. I guess, first, Barry, a bigger picture question. You've been at this for some time and certainly had some success in turning the business around. But I guess as you step back and think about Connected Fitness and growing it. It seems like you had most success we're able to lower the cost of ownership. So I'm trying to understand it, it is further growth predicated on continuing to drive down cost of ownership to things like rental? Or is it still a marketing issue. And then as a follow-up, just so I'm clear on the POP sale, was that aligned with the impairments you've taken? And are there further impairments that are necessary when you close that? Thank you.\nBarry McCarthy: Let me acknowledge that you're quite right that the go-to-market innovations that have resulted in lower cost of entry like FaaS like refurb have been enormously successful. I mean FaaS is now a $100 million run rate business from zero and we grew not quite 300% year-over-year in the quarter. And we see very fast growth in the secondary market north of 40%. So value matters. Now lots of ways to deliver value. And one of the ways to do it, which we had great success with at Spotify and Netflix was by investing in the product and the user experience. And I think there's a tremendous opportunity for us going forward to lean into the performance aspect of the market with premium priced products in order to drive new growth for us, meaningful growth. And I think an existence proof that there's an appetite amongst consumers for that kind of positioning is the Tread+ by a way of example. So if you give people something they want, they'd be delighted to pay for it, but it has to be a uniquely compelling user experience. And which is why we're leaning heavily into investing in product innovation. And now we have to have the right talent in the building to pursue that. We had some pretty interesting talent walk into the building last quarter. And I'm pretty optimistic based on what's being discussed in the building today.\nLiz Coddington: And then just really quickly on that question about POP and impairments. In Q2, we did book an impairment charge of roughly about $2 million to bring our -- the value of POP in line with what we sold it for and that gets closed in early Q3.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nYoussef Squali: Great. Thank you. So a couple of questions. Maybe starting with Bike rental, that's one of the positive developments that you had in the business. Can you maybe just remind us about maybe the size of it today, but more importantly, kind of the unit economics. I think in the letter, you mentioned attractive unit economics. How have they kind of performed over time. Where are we now relative to maybe the rest of the business? And then on Q4 guide, Q4 is typically one of the weaker quarters that you're guiding for an inflection point to growth there. Can you maybe just help us with the puts and takes as to what needs to happen for you guys to hit that milestone? Thank you.\nBarry McCarthy: I'm going to let ask Liz to take most of that, but I just want to make one observation about FaaS linking back to a previous question. We had about seasonality. So the one thing we learned last year about FaaS and saw again this year FaaS, it's not very seasonal. The demand seems to be pretty consistent across the calendar year. Now we did see accelerated growth in FaaS this quarter, but that's because of some work we've done on landing pages and the way we're merchandising it to members to make it more easily discoverable and put it on level footing with a sale rather than bearing it down in the footnotes where it had previously lived and allowing it to service on Google Search by a way of example, rather than bearing it. Liz, do you want to talk about the Q4?\nLiz Coddington: Yes. So let me first -- let me talk -- I do want to provide a little bit of information about FaaS around the unit economics. So our unit economics for FaaS are improving. Our churn was better than it was in Q1. It's -- as I mentioned, it's still higher than it is for those who buy our Bikes out right. And we're continuing to work on closing the gap between that rental churn and purchase churn. But it did improve quarter-over-quarter. It was slightly under 5%, and we've talked about it being around 5%.\nBarry McCarthy: 100 basis points quarter-over-quarter.\nLiz Coddington: Yes, 100 basis points of improvement quarter-over-quarter versus Q1. With that -- part of that -- as a result of that, we have -- our average payback is now averaging around 16 months for FaaS, which is also an improvement over Q1. But one thing to note about that is that we are still using pretty rich mix of refurbished units. And as we lower our churn going forward and continue to make improvements there and also continue to provide the right incentive structure for folks to buy out their rentals, we expect to be able to shift to a richer mix of new Bikes at some point in the future as we continue to sell down sell through that refurbished inventory while achieving an attractive payback results. So that's all good news. Now there was a question about the Q4 inflection, and I think that, that is really looking at revenue growth. Q4 is -- from a subscriber perspective, our guidance is that we'll end the year for Connected Fitness subs just slightly -- if you look at our implied guidance has us ending just slightly above where we started the year. So it is a seasonally tough quarter for growth. And part of the revenue growth that you see in Q4 is driven by the fact that we will be continuing to deliver Tread+ and so again, our Tread+ mix to date so far, maybe that -- hopefully that will shift over time, skews a lot towards existing subscribers rather than new ones. And again, that makes sense because we just re-launched it. And so that will help bolster revenue in Q4 on a year-over-year basis.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Simeon Siegel with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nSimeon Siegel: Thanks. Hi. Good morning, everyone. So congrats on the strength of third-party retailers. Can you remind us what the unit level revenue and margins look like for a Bike sold or any equipment sold via third-party retailer versus when you sell it directly. And then you called out and I think you've spoken a few times encouragingly about the continued growth in the secondary market sales. Can you just let us know roughly what percent of the current CF subscriptions are on their second or life or so? Thank you.\nLiz Coddington: So the first question sounded like it was related to unit economics for a third-party. So our -- from a gross margin perspective, the unit economics for selling through a third-party channel like a Dick's Sporting Goods or an Amazon are lower because, obviously, there is that margin that we have to give to the wholesaler to that third-party retailer. Where we sort of make up the difference on that is in our market -- our sales and marketing spend. So we expect our customer acquisition costs through those channels to be substantially lower, and that's what we optimize for as well as driving as much of that those units have incremental units through those channels as we possibly can. And so that's the key difference. So you see the gross margin pressure from third-party and it should be offset, and that's how we model and that's how we run those channels with more efficient sales and marketing spending. Now the other question was what percentage of our Connected Fitness subs are coming from the secondary market, I think. It's increasing quarter-over-quarter. In Q2, it was actually slightly down as a percentage of our total gross additions versus Q1, just under 30% coming from that channel.\nBarry McCarthy: Let me come back to 3P for a minute and let's talk about FaaS in the same -- the rental program in the same context. It only makes sense to give up margin if the customers you're acquiring are -- if a large percentage is incremental. And it's relatively easy to do the math to figure out what the crossover point is where you're economically advantaged by making the lower margin trade-off. Now in Q4, we had explosive growth with the 3P partners. And it cost us an incrementality. And so it was really -- it was a really important lesson. And once we were into the quarter, there was no way to undo the sales of inventory that to our third 3P partners that were competing with us during the holiday season. So what we learned is there are periods that are sort of uniquely special. We're just those partners individually Prime Day by a way of example are on promotion, and we can move a lot of units. And there are other times of the year when you could come to us, you could go to them. Consumer might be indifferent, but we're not. And we need to be more thoughtful about our sell-through to those partners during those periods of time. I think we talked about the incrementality on FaaS, it's north of 60% in the more like 63, 62 pretty consistently since we started. So even though economics as compared with at least the cash flow aspects of it or less attractive than the sell-through. We're absolutely able to attract a significant audience that we wouldn't otherwise be attracting.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of John Blackledge with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJohn Blackledge: Great. Thanks. Just on Tread+, Liz, kind of just addressed it. My question is, is demand more so from existing members? Or is it a mix of existing and new members. I think she said more so from existing members now. But I guess as we get through the second half and into next year, would you see -- would you expect to see more demand from new members given the market is two times bigger than the Bike market. And then my second question on paid apps. The high end, it looks like the high end of paid app subs is down a little bit. Just how should we think about trajectory of paid app subs kind of into the back half and kind of into fiscal '25 and beyond? Thank you.\nBarry McCarthy: I think we'll probably comment here, John. Thanks for the question. I think you're absolutely right that we -- it's reasonable to expect that we would see a shift in the mix from existing members to new members because, of course, today, really the only members who know what the Tread+ represents are the existing members.\nLiz Coddington: Also our Tread+ is actually just reviewed as the best overall Tread in 2024 by CNN, which is -- which should also help grow the awareness of the product.\nBarry McCarthy: And with respect to the app, I think in the past, we've referred to it as the best product we have that nobody knows about. The unaided brand awareness, which was down 1% is the unaided brand awareness is 6%.\nLiz Coddington: There was a question about the range. So I can take that part. So --\nBarry McCarthy: Sorry, hang on a second. Yes. I just wanted to talk about sort of the momentum and where we are in the learning curve and because I think it important us about our go-forward view. So it's at a very high level, I think, your question is, okay, so we restructured our app pricing model. Is the business better off for having done it? And the answer is, today, not yet. But we think the crossover point happens in June, and we're pretty optimistic about the trend line we're on now. We foot-faulted early when we focus primarily on free. We struggled with that for several months and then we pivoted to focusing on the paid piece. And ever since we focused on the paid piece, we have seen significant progress. And we continue to make important steps in improving the overall user experience. And by the way, this is where the work we're doing in personalization. We'll be having its biggest impact and where some of the partnerships we've struck like TikTok, by a way of example will help drive significant growth, I think. Okay. Sorry, Liz, over to you.\nLiz Coddington: And I was just going to point out that if you look at our guidance, what it implies is that Q2 was sort of the low of our paid app subscriber base. That makes sense because we just completed the time frame that our legacy paid app members were able to receive the App Plus level of content for the App One price. And we were actually quite in a positive way surprised that on the retention level of those subscribers given the expiration of their legacy period. So we feel like we've sort of bottomed in Q2. And now the question is how quickly can we grow the sub base from there over the next couple of quarters. And as Barry pointed out, there's a lot of great things that we are working on and that those features will continue to roll out over the coming quarters. And so there is some uncertainty on how quickly we'll be able to grow it. And then there's also things like as we talk about our Peloton for business offerings and our corporate wellness space, that's a great opportunity for us. We are -- those deals, they're negotiations, and they do take time. And so there's a lot of uncertainty on when those deals and negotiations will close. And those could be a great accelerant and app subscription growth for us. But there isn't a whole lot contemplated in our guidance in the next couple of quarters for that to happen. So there's a lot of upside potential. It just reflects the uncertainty of how quickly we will be able to accelerate that over the next couple of quarters. But we're -- as Barry said, we're super optimistic about it. There's lots of great signs, particularly on the lower churn front and the engagement front that suggests that the app could be a great opportunity for us to accelerate growth.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question for the day will come from the line of Lee Horowitz with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nLee Horowitz: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Barry, you talked in the letter about outgrowing the overall Connected Fitness market. Subs growing sort of marginally year-on-year, which would suggest that the overall market sort of remained depressed at this point. I guess how do you think about sort of what's holding the market back and growing more meaningfully at this point? How do you think about the conditions that maybe allow some of those headwinds to abate and sort of what do you think about the sort of long-term sort of growth rate of this overall market at a steady state? Thanks.\nBarry McCarthy: I don't really know what the long-term growth rate of the market is. It's got to be at least population growth. I would think with a couple of accelerants. The more you age, the more important it is that you invest in your health and the more likely you are to have disposable income available to make that investment for one. Two, no question that product innovation drives growth. And there's a lot of really interesting technology coming into the marketplace to help drive that. In our case, we really only scratched the service and gamification. That's going to be a vector for growth for us. Liz mentioned, corporate wellness, that is having a moment in corporate America for sure, where companies are investing at the margin increasingly in fitness, nutrition, mental wellness by a way of example. And I think we're well positioned to participate in that. And then lastly, it's pretty clear from the introduction of Row and the introduction of Tread+ innovation drives growth. And we've been busy saving ourselves for the last two years. And now we're positioned to invest in innovation. Again, it's innovation that put us on the map in the first place. There's a lot of talent in the building. It's a matter of getting it organized and focused in a really productive way. I think Nick is going to be an impactful player there. I think Lauren is going to be quite impactful with respect to our approach to marketing as well, plus there are a bunch of product innovation drives growth, geographic expansion drives growth. The unaided brand awareness for the product in the US is 55%. Okay, anybody now by a way of comparison what the unaided brand awareness is for Starbucks or Coke. They're north of 90. So there's still a lot of untapped potential even in the US and by a way of comparison, the unaided brand awareness in the UK is 37%. And in Germany, it's in the 20s. And so -- and I don't know what it is for LatAm, but it's got to be significantly lower. And we've got a lot of strength in the Latinx community from a content perspective. So product innovation, geographic growth and product relevance in commercial and corporate wellness should all be vectors for -- to drive an acceleration in sales in the next couple of years.\nOperator: And Mr. Stabler that was our final question. I'll turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.\nPeter Stabler: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Peloton Interactive 1Q 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised today's conference being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Peter Stabler, Head of Investor Relations.\nPeter Stabler: Thank you, Ken. Good morning and welcome to Peloton's first quarter and fiscal 2024 conference call. Joining today's call are CEO, Barry McCarthy; and CFO, Liz Coddington and Chief Marketing Officer, Leslie Berland. Our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today only and will include statements related to our business that are forward-looking statements under federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could impact our actual results, please refer to our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter, both of which can be found on our Investor Relations website. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's shareholder letter. I'll now turn the call over to Barry McCarthy.\nBarry McCarthy: Morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. In a break with tradition, I invited Leslie Berland to join us, knowing that growth is on everyone's mind. And this begins a process whereby in future calls from time-to-time, you can expect me to invite into the room other operating executives so that you have an opportunity to gain exposure to them and they have an opportunity to gain exposure to you. And you can hear firsthand from them about different aspects of how the business is being operated. And with that, we'll open the phones to questions, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking questions. I have two. First, the number of different growth initiatives going just as you think about your forecast for revenue growth and positive EBITDA and substantial free cash flow in the back half of the fiscal year. Can you just help us rank the two to three biggest drivers across these various initiatives? And then secondly, how do you think about timing for the Lululemon partnership to benefit the business just given access to their large membership base? Thanks.\nBarry McCarthy: Well, let's see. From my perspective, with respect to the drivers, a couple things. One is we're going to reintroduce the Tread+ this quarter and begin taking pre-orders. And that will be, if we're successful, that will be a big driver of incremental cash flow and revenue for us. Remember, we have all of that inventory in warehouse already and fully paid for and have sent before I walked in the door. So that would be thing one. Thing two is continue success growing app-related subscribers. And I'm sure we'll have more questions about how we're thinking about that opportunity on a go forward basis. And then we need to continue to have success with the core all access membership. I think our growth projections are reasonably conservative in that regard. So that's how I'm thinking about the growth initiatives. In terms of Lululemon, that's live. And we are benefiting from it as we speak. So, actually nothing more to say about the economics of that on a go forward basis.\nLiz Coddington: Yes, the one thing I can add on Lululemon is that we just started having our content available for the Lululemon studio members who have a mirror that actually went live yesterday on November 1st. And so, as far as receiving the revenue sharing benefit from that agreement that we have with Lululemon, that started effective in November. And we expect roughly give you a sense of the size for the quarter, roughly about $10 million of revenue for Q2 coming from that subscription revenue for us.\nBarry McCarthy: Yes. There is an apparel component to it. It started phenomenally strongly. And it's kind of inarticulate. Then an initial launch in Chicago, we drove a tremendous amount of store traffic for them, a huge increase in apparel sales for us. And we'll be working on a more complete integration of that opportunity. And that will be a little slower to develop over time.\nDoug Anmuth: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Shweta Khajuria with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nShweta Khajuria: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Could you please talk about the promotion environment this year versus last year and any change in your strategy in terms of running promotions this year? Length of time, the depth of promotions, any comments on that, please? And then the second is, how should we think about your guidance for the quarter and for the full year? Puts and takes that are baked into or the assumptions that are baked into your guidance and any potential, what impact from these new partnerships are you accounting for in your guidance for the full year? Thank you.\nBarry McCarthy: Let me say just a brief intro. I'll turn it over to Leslie to talk about her thoughts about the promo environment for the current quarter. And Liz will take the last part of the question. So I think I'm right on a Q-over-Q basis for the quarter completed. We had a higher AST and we're less on promotion than we were a year ago. We were higher by 3% something like that. And so that reflected in the improvement in gross margin on a year-to-year basis and the 31% increase in gross profit that helps deliver in the quarter. You want to talk about the holiday?\nLeslie Berland: Yes, absolutely. Happy to be on the call. I think we're very excited as we embark on holiday and we always bring exciting value to both our members and new customers as well. I think what's interesting to also mention is how we bring these promotions to life. So we've really learned a lot over the past couple of months around digital and social media marketing and specifically creator and influencer marketing, which really reframes and contextualizes both this value as well as the promotion. So we're seeing really strong traction in all of our work in this space and you will absolutely see this come to life during holiday. The other part I'll mention is you read in the shareholder letter around our partnerships. Much of our partnership work is starting to take form at the exact same time and being in sample Michigan as well. So there's a great sort of coming together of all these initiatives in the next few months.\nLiz Coddington: Okay, So I'm going to go ahead and take the question about guidance for Q2 and the full year. So our Q2 guidance reflects what I believe to be a balanced view based on the macroeconomic outlook and the fact that there is some uncertainty around the performance in the holiday season. But it does reflect a few things. So I want to call out that it does reflect seasonality of our hardware sales, the fact that Q2 is a heavier hardware sales quarter for us. This is the link given all the holiday promotional activity. It's also a quarter where we expect to see, surprisingly, an improvement in, maybe not surprisingly, improvement in our connected fitness growth margin. And some of the reasons for that and our overall growth margin is coming down seasonally as you would expect. But connected fitness is actually going to be up in part because of fixed cost leverage that we expect to have from the higher connected fitness unit sales. And we also expect a slight mix shift away from our bike rental relative to Q1 because we expect our rental take rates to be a little lower, driven by the fact that we will have the high promotional activity in the quarter. And then in addition to that, and that is offset by some holiday promotional activity, but net-net, we expect it to be slightly higher. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects the fact that we will have seasonal marketing spend to support the holiday season. It's important to understand that that media spend actually supports growth in both Q2 as well as Q3. So the timing of that is reflected in the adjusted EBITDA guidance. Now you had asked about partnerships. The way that we are thinking about these partnerships is they are just getting started. So there's not really an explicit benefit baked into our guidance for subscribers directly as a result of a lot of these partnerships in Q2. The one thing that I called out earlier about Lululemon would be the exception to that. And so, as we build out these partnerships and the structures start to take shape and we gain more traction, we'll be incorporating more of that into perhaps future quarters of guidance. Now for the full year, I want to call out a couple of things. Our back half of the year forecast reflects the fact that we expect to see revenue growth acceleration in Q2 and Q3. If you also look at our growth margin that we're targeting for the full year, that also reflects the fact that our Q3 and Q4 growth margins are expected to be higher. And a lot of that is driven by the fact that, you know, in addition to the mix shift between subscription and hardware sales, we do expect to see some benefit. It's very called out earlier from the reintroduction of Tread+, but I do want to call out that we, you know, that is a new launch for us. There is some uncertainty baked into our guidance around it and the performance of the back half of the year.\nShweta Khajuria: Okay, thank you. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Ron Josey with Citi. You may proceed.\nRon Josey: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I want to ask a little bit more about engagement trends. As Barry in the letter, you talked about an increase in monthly subscription engagement in the quarter and members engaging with longer classes. Do you think that has to do with more of a seasonal usage pattern or just felt on the strategy of being everywhere, anywhere and everywhere, and with longer and more types of classes that are coming out? And I'm curious how you use this trend of greater engagement to just improve overall brand. And with Leslie here, maybe you can help us a little bit more just about brand perception and what we're doing to increase that over time? Thank you.\nBarry McCarthy: Well, the 6% increase in engagement amongst the all access subscribers is year-over-year. So it's not a seasonal trend. And Liz, correct me if I'm wrong, I think it's 12% year-over-year for app engagement as well. So I think it reflects some progress on personalization. We continue great execution like Jen Cotter and her content team and the preferences of the members. So if we're programming our classes well, and if more people are taking longer classes, it's because they're choosing to and we're producing enough of them and enabling them to discover them on the platform in a way that better serve their interests.\nLiz Coddington: I do want to correct one thing really quick. The 6% includes both the connected and the app subscribers total for app engagement.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question goes from Aneesha Sherman with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nAneesha Sherman: Thank you. Two questions from me, please. The first one is on inventory. So as you're continuing to clear inventory, what is the normalized level of hardware gross margins you think the business can get to? I know you've talked about double digit underlying margins. Does that view change now with the growth of FAS in the mix? And then I have a quick question on POP. You took an impairment of 31 million. Can you give us an update on the work being done on that and what you're expecting as the outcome? And are you still expecting a sale? Thank you.\nLiz Coddington: So, I can take the question on POP first. In the quarter, we actually took an impairment of only $15 million in this particular quarter. So we are still looking to sell POP. We are talking to a variety of interested parties and, you know, we hope to have a -- hope to be able to sell it as soon, but we are still working on that. On the other question, which was related to inventory and normalized hardware gross margin, we do expect to see, you know, so we are moving into a more normalized inventory position. We've been purchasing inventory as we prepare for the holiday season. And I did want to comment about the fact that in Q1, it was a use of cash and in Q2 to Q4, we expect to have a bit of a tailwind on inventory. But by the end of the year, we expect to be pretty normalized with regard to inventory and the seasonal cash flow that the business is accustomed to or has been historically accustomed to. Now, in terms of gross margins, we are seeing some benefit on the fact that, we are moving into that more normalized inventory position. We don't expect to have any more write offs of inventory. We're being able to better manage our reserves. And then, we do have on a unit economics basis, excluding promotions, all of our skews are a double digit gross margin positive, aside from the guide.\nAneesha Sherman: Okay. And can you talk about how the impact of FAS might change the normalized gross margins going forward?\nLiz Coddington: Yes, so a little bit about FAS. So in terms of the impact on gross margin in Q1, FAS was less than 10 basis points impact on our overall gross margin. So relative to the size of FAS compared to the overall size of our business, it's a bit of a drag, but not a huge drag on gross margins. The reason that FAS impacts our gross margins is because of maybe because of the fact when people join FAS, they pay a fee for the delivery and we are cost to deliver that hardware is more expensive than the actual delivery charge that we charge the customer. And so as we grow that part of the business, you see that impact to gross margin in the first month of the FAS subscription.\nAneesha Sherman: Really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much for taking the questions, maybe two if I could. In terms of FAS, has there anything you've learned so far on the subscription side that we might see you extend out subscription options into other connected fitness hardware products over time? I'm thinking around, elements of relaunching, Tread and trying to come back to market with that with maybe a new messaging. That would be number one. And then I just want to make sure we understand the messages on the app strategy and what you're seeing. In terms of applying marketing dollars and ROI, how would you characterize the success you've had in terms of the free tier of the application layer versus the paid tier and elements of how the conversion funnel continues to sort of evolve for the application strategy? Thanks so much.\nBarry McCarthy: Let me jump in on FAS and I'll say a few words about app strategy and then ask Leslie to join. And I think it's unlikely that we will extend FAS at least to treads and treadmills because that installation is more complex than bike. Is it possible that we might extend it to row possibly, but it's still quite early in the life cycle of that product and I think we have more to learn before we would consider doing that. So I think that -- and then lastly, I would say, we have our hands full with the growth opportunity that FAS currently presents at 90 plus percent year-over-year and having just opened up Germany where it right out of the box, very small numbers, but right out of the box going really fast, much faster than we were forecasting. So there's plenty for us to chew on FAS with just the current business model, I think is the macro point. As it relates to the app strategy, the marketing team was enormously successful in driving huge volumes into free. We were not successful at seeing conversion of those free into the paid funnel, which is why we pivoted in the quarter back to focusing on the paid app and the on ramp there is free trial and there we have had terrific success. And we're seeing higher price points. Then, we were forecast to significantly higher take rates of the app plus, so that 24 bucks and then we were -- and we were expecting a heavier mix of the 1299.\nLeslie Berland: Yes. And I'll just jump in a little bit to provide context on the strategy and some of the interesting data points that we saw. So again, the goal, including the app is to energize our core member base and to attract new and under penetrated demographic that has historically not been, as I said, as penetrated for Peloton and app gave us an amazing opportunity in the free app message gave us an amazing opportunity when we rebranded the company and relaunch the brand. What we thought to Barry's point was obviously a massive volume of downloads. And what's interesting about that tied to the objective is we brought in new demographics. So we brought in lots of people who represented what you would consider our core member base, but you saw movement and significant uptake both in free and paid for demos including men Gen Z plus and others. So these are the areas and again going back to our partnership where you will see us continuing to invest and to drive relevance and engagement both on our current members that represent those demographics but also new for growth.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question goes from Lauren Schenk with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nNathan Sheldon: Hey everyone, this is Nathan Sheldon on for Lauren. I guess can you give us an update on how rental churn has progressed and are you seeing that decline as we anticipated few months ago? And then how should we think about the range of outcomes you're now considering for the kind of steady state of term there? Thank you.\nBarry McCarthy: The question.\nLeslie Berland: I can answer the first part of your question, Nathan, but we missed kind of the last part of your question about a little bit garbled if you wouldn't mind repeating that.\nNathan Sheldon: Yes, just how can we think about the new range of outcomes to the steady state of churn rate kind of over the long-term? Thank you.\nLeslie Berland: I can take this one. So, in terms of churn for our rental subscription model for FAS. We actually in Q4 we talked about the fact that we had an up to churn with regard to the seat post we call and we saw that for FAS as well but we have seen it come down substantially from the high in Q4 roughly by 100 points. But it is still higher than our all access regular member of churn. Now, your other question I think was about just churn in general. And what we did see if you remember, you know, we, we did see an uptick in churn regardless of regard to the bike seat post with the increase in pause numbers. We are seeing our, you know, we saw our churn come down as people are unpausing and then also with regard to seasonality and we expect to see our churn rate come down in Q2 and Q3 as well.\nBarry McCarthy: Let me spend a minute and talk about the changing mix of the sub base rejoins and then the core all access members and growth in rental, so that as the mix changes over time people can.\nLeslie Berland: Yes, so, so overall, we do see slightly different we see different churn rates for these different types of Peloton subscribers. So we've got our regular all access members who purchase new hardware from us. Then we've got the bike rental model for our rental subscribers. And then we have a third group which is secondary market, which is people who decide to buy their hardware from someone else on a marketplace that we are not facilitating that sale and it's generally it's used. We use hardware. So for our regular all access member base, we see the lowest churn rate in the low. It obviously varies a bit seasonally, but it's the lowest closer to one point. I don't have the exact number in front of me for that group. This last quarter, yeah, probably 1.4, 1.5-ish little, little less. Then we have the secondary market group, which actually has a higher churn rate. They are more in the 2, 2.5-ish range. And then we have the bike rental group, which is more in the five to six-ish range over the seasonal seasonality of that group.\nBarry McCarthy: It’s been a minute talking about secondary market that has grown pretty dramatically. And what's the source? It's a Peloton all access member who canceled. So they showed up in our churn numbers on average within six months a bike is sold. Let's use a bike. A bike is sold in the secondary market. Someone purchases that bike and they come to us and become an all access member. And so, as our core business continues to grow, the secondary market is growing even faster. It means that the, let's call it 1.4% churn rate on all access members actually really on a net basis is lower. And it means that one, two, it also means that our average churn rate, the reported average churn rate is going to go up. If the secondary market continues to grow faster than the new sales market, even if the individual cohorts are behaving the way they have historically. Meaning, even if the long-term churn for all access members remain steady, and even if the all access, excuse me, even if the turn rate for secondary members remains steady. And so you want not to be alarmed if you see it increase gradually because of the mixed change. If the cohorts deteriorate we'll let you know that."
