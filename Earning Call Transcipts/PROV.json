At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Provident Financial Holdings Second Quarter Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Donavon Ternes, President and CEO. Please go ahead.\nDonavon Ternes: Thank you, Aaron. Good morning. This is Donavon Ternes, President and CEO of Provident Financial Holdings. And on the call with me is Tam Nguyen, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I have a brief administrative item to address. Our presentation today discusses the company's business outlook and will include forward-looking statements. Those statements include descriptions of management's plans, objectives or goals for future operations, products or services, forecasts of financial or other performance measures and statements about the company's general outlook for economic and business conditions. We also may make forward-looking statements during the question-and-answer period following management's presentation. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and that actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information on the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from any forward-looking statements is available from the earnings release that was distributed yesterday, from the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023, and from the Form 10-Qs and other SEC filings that are filed subsequent to the Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements are effective only as of the date that they are made, and the company assumes no obligated to update this information. To begin with, thank you for participating in our call. I hope that each of you has had an opportunity to review our earnings release which describes our second quarter results. In the most recent quarter, we originated $20.2 million of loans held for investment and earnings from $18.5 million in the prior sequential quarter. During the most recent quarter, we also had $17.8 million of loan principal payments and payoffs, which is down from $23 million in September 2023 quarter and still at the lower end of the quarterly range. Currently, it seems that many real estate investors have reduced their activity as a result of higher mortgage and other interest rates. Additionally, we are seeing more consumer demand for single-family adjustable rate mortgage products as a result of higher fixed rate mortgage interest rate. We have generally tightened our underwriting requirements and increased our pricing across all of our product lines as a result of higher funding costs, the current economic environment and tighter liquidity conditions. Additionally, our single-family and multifamily loan pipelines are similar in comparison to last quarter, suggesting our loan originations in the March 2024 quarter will be similar to this quarter and at the lower end of the range of recent quarters, which has been between $19 million and $85 million. For the three months ended December 30, 2023, loans held for investment increased by $3.6 million when compared to the September 30, 2023 ending balance sheet with small increases in single-family, multifamily, commercial real estate and construction loan categories. Current credit quality is holding up very well, and you will note that non-performing assets increased to just $1.8 million, which is up from $1.4 million on September 30, 2023. Additionally, there is just $340,000 of early-stage delinquency balances at December 31, 2023. We are aware of the mounting concerns regarding commercial real estate loans, but are confident that our -- the underwriting characteristics of our borrowers and collateral will continue to perform well. We have outlined these characteristics on slide 13 of our quarterly investor presentation. You should also note that we have just nine CRE loans for $5 million maturing for the remainder of 2024. We recorded a $720,000 recovery of credit losses in the December 2023 quarter. The recovery was primarily the result of a decrease in the average life of the loan portfolio, stemming from the rapid decline in mortgage rates in the December 2023 quarter and higher prepayment estimates. The allowance for credit losses to gross loans held for investment decreased 5 basis points on December 31, 2023, from 72 basis points on September 30, 2023. Our net interest margin declined by 10 basis points to 2.78% for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to the September 30, 2023, sequential quarter as the result of a 13 basis point increase in the average yield on total interest-earning assets at a 24 basis point increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. Notably, our average cost of deposits increased by 19 basis points to 99 basis points for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, compared to 80 basis points in the prior sequential quarter. And our cost of borrowing increased by 18 basis points in the December 2023 quarter compared to the September 2023 quarter. The net interest margin this quarter was not impacted by the net deferred loan costs associated with loan payoffs in the December 2023 quarter in comparison to the average net deferred loan cost amortization of the previous five quarters. New loan production is being originated at higher mortgage interest rates than recent prior quarters and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio are adjusting to higher interest rates in comparison to their existing interest rates. We have approximately $116.8 million of loans repricing upward in the March 2024 quarter at a currently estimated 87 basis points or a weighted average rate of 7.71% from 6.84% and approximately $86.2 million of loans repricing upward in the June 2024 quarter at a currently estimated 90 basis points to a weighted average rate of 7.82% from 6.92%. Also, for multifamily and commercial real estate loans, the loans are adjusting above their existing floors. However, many adjustable rate loans in all categories are currently limited in their upward adjustment by the periodic interest rate caps. I would also point out that there is an opportunity to reprice maturing wholesale funding downward as a result of market conditions, where current interest rates have moved lower in 6 months and longer terms. All of this suggests that the current pressure on the net interest margin may soon subside. We continue to look for operating efficiencies throughout the company to lower operating expenses. Our FTE count on December 31, 2023, increased to 160 compared to 161 FTE on the same date last year. You will note that operating expenses increased to $7.3 million in the December 2023 quarter, somewhat higher than what we described as the stable run rate of $7.2 million per quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefits expenses resulting from higher expense accrual adjustments for the supplemental executive retirement plan. For fiscal 2024, we continue to expect a run rate of approximately $7.2 million per quarter as a result of increased wages and inflationary pressure on other operating expenses. In fact, the actual run rate for the fiscal year-to-date has been $7.1 million per quarter. Our short-term strategy for balance sheet management is somewhat more conservative than last fiscal year. We believe that slowing the loan portfolio is the best course of action at this time as a result of tighter liquidity conditions. We were successful in execution of this strategy this quarter with loan origination volumes at the low end of the quarterly range and loan payoffs also at the low end of the quarterly rate. The total interest earning assets composition improved from last quarter with a small increase in the average balance of wounds receivable and a decrease in the lower-yielding average balance of investment securities. However, the total interest-bearing liabilities composition deteriorated some with a decrease in the average balance of deposits and an increase in the average balance of borrowing. We exceed well-capitalized capital ratios by a significant margin, allowing us to execute on our business plan and capital management goals without complications. We believe that maintaining our cash dividend is very important. We also recognize that prudent capital returns to shareholders through stock buyback programs is a responsible capital management tool and we repurchased approximately 63,000 shares of common stock in the December 2023 quarter. For the fiscal year-to-date, we distributed approximately $2 million of cash dividends to shareholders and repurchased approximately $1.2 million worth of common stock. As a result, our capital management activities resulted in an 82% distribution of fiscal year-to-date net income. We encourage everyone to review our December 31 investor presentation posted on our website. You will find that we included slides regarding financial metrics, asset quality and capital management, which we believe will give you additional insight on our solid financial foundation supporting the future growth of the company. We will now entertain any questions that you may have regarding our financial results. Thank you. Aaron?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Liesch with Piper Sandler go ahead.\nAndrew Liesch: Hi, good morning. Question on the margin outlook here. If we get a series of Fed rate cuts, I guess, what sort of effect do you think that could have on the margin going forward? It sounds like you're already seeing some relief on the funding side, at least on the wholesale accounts.\nDonavon Ternes: Yes. I think, Andrew, as we think about the balance sheet, we probably have a longer tail than many on our assets or our loans repricing upward because they are hybrid arms tied to SFR or multifamily or even commercial. And so as the indices have moved upward in many cases, that upward repricing loan has been capped by the periodic cap or there is also the situation where the loan is in its fixed period and will not adjust upward until it moves out of the fixed period. So I think there's a tremendous opportunity with respect to the loan portfolio to continue to adjust upward with a longer tail on that others may have with C&I lending, for instance. So even if we see the Fed beginning to move interest downward, I think our earning assets, particularly the loan portfolio can reprice upward. Conversely, as you point out, the funding side of the balance sheet probably is towards the higher end of the range, and we can see some relief there. The note in our earnings release that we described the amount of brokered CDs that we have in portfolio. And that group CDs balance is $122.7 million. The weighted average cost of those brokered CDs was 5.26%. This is at December 31. We have recently seen a decline in brokered CD rates. And in fact, the most recent CD that we put on the books to replace a maturing CD came on at 4.70%. So there is about 56 basis points of relief between the weighted average in the portfolio of those funds and what the current funding costs may look like. So I think as you point out, calendar 2024 looks to be a little bit better with outlook as it relates to net interest margin, certainly, where we began in calendar 2023.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks for that detail. And then you mentioned in the release 2024, maybe having possibility that more -- a better opportunity, more favorable environment for growth. Are you seeing anything right now? Or are you still just waiting to see on how the Fed's reaction and their monetary policy plays out?\nDonavon Ternes: Sure. The thing that we think about with respect to opportunity for growth is what the liquidity environment looks like in the industry. Thankfully, as a result of the Fed comments in the subsequent to their December meeting, they essentially confirmed that they're thinking about lowering rates in calendar 2024. And as a result of that, we did see interest rates move down essentially across the curve except for the very short end of the curve. And that, I think, will provide some relief to deposit gathering or gathering funding from other sources in contrast to what we saw in 2023. And if we see that there is some relief and we have the ability to gather deposits and funding at more reasonable prices because liquidity is in a better situation in the banking environment, that will trigger our thinking to populate growth onto the balance sheet. We run a relatively high loan-to-deposit ratio. Historically, we have done that because of the nature of the loans that we have, 30-year mortgages. And we're sensitive to that, and we don't want to populate even higher loan-to-deposit ratios in a poorer or poor liquidity environment. So that's really what we have to see. We think that there's opportunity right now to grow if that's what we were choosing to do. As we mentioned in the prepared comments, we have tightened our underwriting standards beyond where we normally have them, and we've priced ourselves up with respect to the loan products, essentially to slow production to match what is coming in the form of payoffs, such that we're maintaining our loan portfolio.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. That's very helpful, thank you for the thoughts there, I'll step back.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions, Andrew. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Tim Coffey with Janney. Tim your line is live.\nTim Coffey: Thank you. Good morning, Dan and good morning, Tam.\nDonavon Ternes: Good morning.\nTim Coffey: As we got to go through this year with the outlook for modest loan growth for all the items you discussed already, I'm wondering, do you have any sense of how much cash you'll start to carry on the balance sheet? Or do you anticipate rolling that back into securities?\nDonavon Ternes: Well, I'm not certain that our preference would be to roll it into securities. We would prefer to see an environment where we are populating loan growth on the balance sheet. And only when we get to a position where we're running in loan-to-deposit ratio concern where then we somehow have excess cash on the balance sheet, would we consider investment securities. Another situation that could develop as we roll through calendar 2024. As mortgage rates come down, I expect that there may be more prepayments and payoffs. If you think about some of the mortgages that, not just us, but the industry put on the books in calendar 2023. Some of those mortgages are probably now in the money with respect to refinance activity. So as we think about balance sheet, our preference first is to populate loan growth to the extent that we accumulate more than too much cash on the balance sheet. There are other things we could do perhaps paying down brokered CDs, wholesale advisor borrowings or even, I suppose, look to investment securities to take care of that excess cash. But that's not something we see in our immediate future.\nTim Coffey: Right. Okay. And you kind of led into my sent question, which was look at demand for mortgages or even the payouts, as you mentioned, how much do rates need to come down to really start to ignite that activity?\nDonavon Ternes: Well, I think totally, we're starting to hear that activity has increased certainly from where we were in the December quarter. Now part of that could be entering a new fiscal year, the holiday calendar year, the holidays are over. And just generally, activity picks up in the March quarter historically. But I think as well, interest rates have come down 70, 80 basis points maybe from where they kind of peaked out before the Fed's comments in middle of December, and they started reversing. So I think activity has already picked up. But certainly, if we see it's begin to move down with their first rate movement, even though the market is kind of already forecasting that, I think that wakes up the consumer a little bit more than where they're currently at and perhaps that denotes more refi activity and then ultimately, more loan activity.\nTim Coffey: Okay great those are my questions. Thank you very much.\nDonavon Ternes: Thanks for your questions, Tim.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. I am not seeing any other questions. So Mr. Ternes, I'll turn it back over to you for any closing remarks.\nDonavon Ternes: Well, thank you very much, Aaron. I appreciate the help on the call, and thank you to the participants, and I look forward to speaking with you all next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Provident Financial Holdings First Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. And I will now turn the conference over to our host, Chairman and CEO, Mr. Craig Blunden. Please go ahead, sir.\nCraig Blunden: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. This is Craig Blunden, Chairman and CEO of Provident Financial Holdings. And on the call with me is Donavon Ternes, our President, Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I have a brief administrative item to address. Our presentation today discusses the company's business outlook and will include forward-looking statements. Those statements include descriptions of management's plans, objectives or goals for future operations, products or services, forecasts of financial or other performance measures and statements about the company's general outlook for economic and business conditions. We also may make forward-looking statements during the question-and-answer period following management's presentation. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those discussed today. Information on the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from any forward-looking statements is available from the earnings release that was distributed yesterday from the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023, and from the Form 10-Qs and other SEC filings that are filed subsequent to the Form 10-K. Forward-looking statements are effective only as the date they are made and the company assumes no obligation to update this information. To begin with, thank you for participating in our call. I hope that each of you has had an opportunity to review our earnings release, which describes our first quarter results. In the most recent quarter, we originated $18.5 million of loans held for investment, a decline from the $24.3 million in the prior sequential quarter. During the most recent quarter, we also had $23 million of loan principal payments and payoffs, which is down from the $25.1 million in the June 2023 quarter and still at the lower end of the quarterly range. Currently, seems that many real estate investors have reduced their activity as a result of rising mortgage and other interest rates. Additionally, we're seeing more consumer demand for single-family adjust rate mortgage products as a result of higher fixed rate mortgage interest rates. We have generally tightened our underwriting requirements and increased our pricing across all of our product lines as a result of higher funding costs, the current economic environment and tighter liquidity conditions. Additionally, our single-family and multifamily loan pipelines are similar in comparison to last quarter, suggesting our loan originations in the December 2023 quarter will be similar to this quarter and at the lower end of the range of recent quarters, which has been between $19 million and $85 million. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, loans held for investment declined by $5.5 million when compared to the June 30, 2023, ending balances with declines in multifamily and commercial real estate, partly offset by growth in the single-family and construction loan categories. Current credit quality is holding up very well, and you will note that nonperforming assets increased to just $1.4 million, which is up slightly from the $1.3 million on June 30, 2023. Additionally, there's just $74,000 of early-stage delinquency balances at September 30, 2023. We are aware of the mounting concerns regarding commercial real estate loans that are confident that the underwriting characteristics of our borrowers and collateral will perform well. We have outlined these characteristics on Slide 13 of our quarterly investor presentation. You should also note that we have no CRE loans maturing during the remainder of calendar 2023 and have only nine CRE loans for $5 million maturing in calendar 2024. We recorded a $545,000 provision for credit losses in the September 2023 quarter. The provision was primarily the result of an increase in the average life of the loan portfolio, stemming from the higher – highest mortgage rates in approximately 23 years and lower prepayment estimates. The allowance for credit losses to gross loans held for investment increased to 72 basis points on September 30, 2023 from 55 basis points on June 30, 2023. You will note that we adopted CECL on July 1, 2023, resulting in a $1.2 million increase in the allowance for credit losses, an $824,000 decrease in equity, a $346,000 increase in deferred tax assets and a $28,000 decrease to the mark-to-market adjustment on loans held at fair value. Our net interest margin was unchanged at 2.88% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to the June 30, 2023, sequential quarter as a result of a 17 basis point increase in the average yield on total interest-earning assets and an 18 basis point increase in the cost of total interest-bearing liabilities. Notably, our average cost of deposits increased by 18 basis points to 80 basis points for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, compared to 62 basis points in the prior sequential quarter. And our cost of borrowing increased by 7 basis points in the September 2023 quarter compared to the June 2023 quarter. Net interest margin this quarter was favorably impacted by approximately 1 basis point as a result of lower net deferred loan costs associated with loan payoffs in the September 2023 quarter in comparison to the average net deferred loan cost amortization of the five previous quarters. New loan production is being originated at higher mortgage interest rates than recent prior quarters, and adjustable rate loans in our portfolio are now adjusting to higher interest rates in comparison to the existing interest rates. We have approximately $88.8 million of loans repricing upward in the December 2023 quarter at a currently estimated 82 basis points to a weighted average rate of 7.35% from 6.53%, and approximately $102.8 million of loans repricing upward in the March 2024 quarter at a currently estimated 102 basis points to a weighted average rate of 7.79% from 6.77%. Also, for multifamily and commercial real estate loans, the loans are adjusting above their existing floor rates. However, many adjustable rate loans in all categories are currently limited in their upward adjustments by their periodic interest rate caps. We continue to look for operating efficiencies throughout the company to lower operating expenses. Our FTE count on September 30, 2023 decreased to 158 compared to 160 FTE on the same date last year. You will note that operating expenses decreased to $6.9 million in the September 2023 quarter, somewhat lower than what we described as the stable run rate of $7.2 million per quarter. The decrease was primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefits expenses resulting from no quarterly or annual bonus expense accruals in the September 2023 quarter since the company missed the threshold bonus targets for the quarter. For the fiscal 2024, we expect a run rate of approximately $7.2 million per quarter as a result of increased wages and inflationary pressure on other operating expenses. Our short-term strategy for balance sheet management is somewhat more conservative than last fiscal year. We believe that slowing the loan portfolio growth is the best course of action as a result of tighter liquidity conditions. We were successful in execution this quarter with loan origination volumes at the lower end of the quarterly range and loan payoffs also at the lower end of the quarterly range. The total interest earning assets composition was very similar to last quarter with a decrease in the average balance of loans receivable and a similar decrease in lower yielding average balance of investment securities. However, the total interest earning liabilities composition deteriorated some with a decrease in the average balance of deposits and a small increase in the average balance of borrowings. We exceed well capitalized capital ratios by a significant margin, allowing us to execute on our business plan and capital management goals without complications. We believe that maintaining our cash dividend is very important. We also recognize that prudent capital returns to shareholders through stock buyback programs is a responsible capital management tool. And we repurchased approximately 36,000 shares of common stock in the September 2023 quarter. For the fiscal year-to-date, we distributed approximately $981,000 of cash dividends to shareholders and repurchased approximately $495,000 worth of common stock. As a result, our capital management activities resulted in an 84% distribution of fiscal year to date net income. We encourage everyone to review our September 30th investor presentation posted on our website. You will find that we included slides regarding financial metrics, asset quality and capital management, which we believe will give you additional insight on our solid financial foundations supporting the future growth of the company. We will now entertain any questions you may have regarding our financial results. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Tim Coffey with Janney. Please go ahead.\nTim Coffey: Great. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.\nCraig Blunden: Good morning, Tim.\nDonavon Ternes: Good morning.\nTim Coffey: First, Craig, congratulations on your retirement. I’ve covered the company a long time. You’ve always been a real pleasure to work with, and even though you’re not going to be an executive anymore, just on the Board, I hope that we can still catch up from time to time.\nCraig Blunden: Well, thanks, Tim, I appreciate your comments. And absolutely I’ll be available whenever.\nTim Coffey: Great. If I can ask about the provision and just in general, the higher for longer environment, if that does take place, we are higher interest rates for longer. What impact is that going to have on the provision going forward?\nDonavon Ternes: So, Tim, this is Donavon. You did see that we increased our provision this quarter in comparison to prior quarters. And that was generally a result of the longer estimated live in the loan portfolio. And because we are estimating an allowance for the life of the loan, to the extent that the estimated life increases, the provision will increase. I’ll note that I think from June 30 to September 30, the MBA Mortgage Index increased by – for a 30 year fixed increased by 68 basis points during that quarter. It was a significant increase and as a result of that, we would expect prepayment speeds to come down and we would expect the average life of the loan portfolio to increase. The second component of that for us is the fact that we primarily make 30-year term mortgage loans in single-family and multifamily. So any decline in prepayment speeds in those two categories, which probably makes up about 90% of our loan portfolio is going to have an impact with respect to our provision. As we go down the timeline, it’s very difficult to forecast what those prepayment speeds are going to do from one period to the next, although you can get somewhat of a sense of it, I suppose, by understanding that the MBA mortgage index went up by 68 basis points for the current quarter, and that resulted in the provision that we populated for this quarter on a relatively flat balance sheet with respect to the amount of loans outstanding. So that gives you some guide, I suppose, to assume what could happen if mortgage interest rates increase so substantially during a given period.\nTim Coffey: Okay. And then also higher for longer, the impact on the servicing part of revenues because this is going to slow, as you mentioned, prepayment speeds as well, correct?\nDonavon Ternes: It will. But the servicing that we have right now is down significantly from what we once had. So I forget the exact balances, but we’re talking in the small hundreds of thousands of dollars of servicing asset. So there’s going to be limited impact with the slowdown in prepayments on that asset.\nTim Coffey: Okay. And then deposit cost increases look like they slowed this quarter. Is that – is one quarter a trend? Or is it too early to tell?\nDonavon Ternes: Well, I think it’s too early to tell. I’ve been hearing from many others and reading many analyst reports with respect to earnings season that other banks are experiencing a slower rise in deposit costs. We’re also experiencing probably a slower rise in deposit costs. But really for us, it gets down to what the balance sheet is doing, both on the asset side and the liability side and what occurred this quarter. Our earning asset yields went up about the same as our interest-bearing liability costs and that kept our net interest margin flat. We would expect the same type of behavior as we look out the timeline for this fiscal year because we have approximately the same amount of assets and liabilities repricing in any given period, we’re relatively neutral-positioned, maybe a little bit liability sensitive with respect to balance sheet. And so there’s certainly pressure on deposits and the cost of deposits. There’s certainly pressure on the cost of borrowings with respect to where current interest rates are and it gets down to higher for longer for us means what is the balance sheet doing repricing-wise, and it looks like it’s repricing very similar.\nTim Coffey: Okay. And then just one question on kind of emerging credit quality trends. There was another institution that reported a couple of nonaccrual loans in the Southern California marketplace, other office loans. The problem wasn’t that they were office loans. The problem was they were in lease-up and they couldn’t get the new tenants in the building. I’m wondering, are you seeing any lease-up issues across your commercial real estate portfolio?\nDonavon Ternes: To date, we’re not seeing that really. But when we think about our portfolio, we don’t have downtown office high-rise or urban center locations on the collateral. It’s typically suburban markets, and those markets seem to be doing better than some of the urban centers seem to be. Just on kind of an ancillary note, this quarter, one of our nonperforming loans at September 30, went into foreclosure and we were bid-out for a full recovery at the foreclosure sale. So there still seems to be a great deal of equity in some of these properties, not so much commercial real estate. The market is not very good there. But for a single-family, we’ve not had a foreclosure in quite a few years and the one we just resolved, we had a full recovery at the foreclosure sale.\nTim Coffey: Okay. The investor deck has really good information on your loan to values. So those are really low, so that’s good to hear. And then one final question for you, Donavon. Now that Craig is retiring, what’s the number one thing you plan to change?\nDonavon Ternes: Well, I don’t know that there’s a dramatic or drastic change coming, Tim. The one thing that is true about Provident is that we are a community bank. We are serving a customer base in the Inland Empire for a number of years. And I don't see that changing in a radical way. We always have challenges and opportunities with respect to how we operate the company. There's new technologies that one can potentially adopt to improve efficiencies. There are things with respect to our loan portfolios and underwriting standards that we can potentially determine to make some changes given market environment. But by and large, I don't see dramatic change, Tim.\nTim Coffey: Okay, sounds good. Those are my questions. Thank you very much for your time.\nOperator: Thank you. We'll go next to Andrew Liesch with Piper Sandler. \nAndrew Liesch: Hey, good morning, guys. And congratulations to you both. Craig on your retirement and Donavon to the CEO promotion. Great to see. \nCraig Blunden: Thanks. Thank you. \nAndrew Liesch: Of course, the commentary on the expense run rate, $7.2 million a quarter for this year. Is that going forward? Or could there be a step up, so the full year average of $7.2 million.\nDonavon Ternes: Yes. I don't believe there's going to be a step up. That's about what we believe our run rate is going to be. Although this quarter, it was a little bit better than that. But as Craig mentioned in his comments, we didn't meet some of our bonus targets for the quarter. And as a result of that, there weren't salary and benefit expenses related to those bonus accruals. So we came in at $6.9 million rather than the $7.2 million. And if we just contrast it to what occurred in the June quarter, June was elevated as well from bonus accruals as well as the vesting of restricted stock and stock options that carry some income statement ramifications upon vesting, which were all trued up in that quarter. So a significant decline from the June quarter, of course, because of unusual items. And this quarter is closer to a standard run rate except for the bonus accruals.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. All right, that's helpful there. Thank you. And then the – just a commentary on the – what you have maturing on the loan side or with the recent paydowns and production in the pipeline, still safe to assume that the portfolio is going to hold relatively steady, just muted growth?\nDonavon Ternes: It's going to be muted growth. I think as we get down into our current fiscal year, we might populate with some growth because I think the environment has certainly stabilized from the March quarter, the June quarter, better environment than the March quarter. I think September quarter was a better environment than either of those two quarters. And if we continue to see that, we would be more interested in perhaps populating some loan growth. I think loan growth is out there. We've tightened our underwriting standards from where we were, and we've raised our interest rates on the loan products that we're offering. And as a result of that, origination volume has come down. I'm hearing from our origination staff that we could do more if we chose to do so. So I think it's really a question of what we see the environment doing and primarily liquidity environment. It doesn't make much sense, I suppose, to put a loan on with a 200 basis point spread or 175 basis point spread if we're funding that growth at the margin. So that's essentially how we view it. So it would be, I think, slow growth, but it's not necessarily flat.\nAndrew Liesch: Got it. All right, that's very helpful. Thanks for taking the question. \nOperator: Thank you.
