At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Neal Nackman, Chief Financial Officer.

I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Morris Goldfarb.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Neal, and thank you, everyone for joining us. Full year 2024 was an important year for G-III. I am proud of the strong results that team delivered. We've accelerated our long term strategic priorities and developed new opportunities as we transition out of our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses. The strength, relevance, and recognition of our brands, along with our powerful corporate foundation, enables us to deliver a product that inspires and creates exciting brand experiences for consumers. We successfully navigated through another year in a tough, dynamic retail landscape. We believe the consumer environment continues to remain under pressure as we enter the new year, but have a strong plan in place to drive our business. We're investing for the future, and I'm excited about our path forward as a global leader in fashion. Now, I want to share a few significant highlights from the year. In fiscal 2024, we grew the sales penetration of our businesses, excluding Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, by 7%. As a result, our go forward brands represented approximately 60% of our total company’s sales in fiscal 2024 and we anticipate this penetration to further grow closer to 70%, increasing our top line by over 3% in fiscal 2025 while we continue to scale down Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. We successfully launched Donna Karan, one of the most iconic American brands, which has just hit retail selling floors. With a fantastic collection supported by the largest marketing campaign ever for G-III and a new fragrance launch, the response from customers has been incredible. This validates our belief that the brand has a significant run way ahead. We solidified and went to market with three additional growth initiatives with Nautica, Halston and Champion, all of which are highly respected brands. We're investing in talent for our future growth and hired Dana Perlman in the newly created role of Chief Growth and Operations Officer as part of our executive leadership team. Now, let's review our full year and fourth quarter 2024 financial results. Full year non-GAAP net income per diluted share increased 42% to $4.04 from $2.85 in the prior fiscal year and 85% to $0.76 compared to $0.41 in last year's fourth quarter, both above our guidance. Net sales for the full fiscal year were $3.1 billion compared to $3.23 billion last year and $765 million for the fourth quarter compared to $854 million last year. The fourth quarter top line relative to our plan was impacted by warm weather as well as a consumer environment, which remains challenging. Gross margins expanded by over 600 basis points for the full year. This was driven by disciplined inventory management, moderation in freight, a greater mix of our own brands and AUR improvements. We believe current gross margin levels is sustainable into the future and we further strengthened our credit profile, ending the year in a net cash position compared to last year's net debt position of 1.6 times. This is after having paid down $125 million in outstanding debt and repurchasing $26 million of our own stock. Currently, we have over $1 billion in liquidity. Now let's review some of the key results. We're a partner of choice and have strong relationships with a diversified retail network. A data driven approach not only prioritizes the consumer at the heart of everything we do, but also enables us to create collections in over 20 categories across our 30 plus brands with a broad range of fashion. Categories that drove the quarter included outerwear, dresses, sportswear, handbags, and suit separates across our key brands. The team Sports division had a good quarter and year. We again renewed our NFL and Major League Baseball licenses. Nautica Jeans just launched this spring and over 200 doors and online with our retail partners and is off to a great start. In addition, we're also selling to the brands global distribution network and we will expand into a broad range of additional categories over the next few years. We believe Nautica can predominantly fill the void of our current Tommy Hilfiger business. Halston is coming to life as designers extensively review the archives which helped develop our sophisticated and modern take on the collection, which was very well received in fall market. As the master licensee, we can sublicense to expand into additional categories and share in the revenue, generating another income stream. With full control of the business, we see the annual net sales potential of over $500 million. Our new Champion outerwear had a good first market with deliveries available for fall of 2024. For fiscal 2024, our go forward brands, excluding Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger registered high single digit growth, while our total sales declined 4%. In fiscal 2025, we're expanding into new lifestyle categories to extend their reach and see a tremendous opportunity to capture market share, particularly internationally. Specifically, we're working with new distribution partners to grow into new categories. We believe the overall sales and profitability for the go forward brands have a runway for expansion and we are investing to deliver outsized growth. These go forward brands will account for almost 70% of our revenues in fiscal 2025. One of our most important initiatives this year was the development of Donna Karan, which just launched at retail in the U.S. Inspired by the archives, we've designed a collection centered on empowering women that captures the brand's ethos, timeless elegance and accessible luxury tailored to meet the full lifestyle needs of today's customer. We invested heavily to support the launch in several ways. First, with an incredible marketing campaign featuring eight iconic models spanning several generations, all of whom have a connection to the brand. I'm thrilled we have some of the biggest names in fashion, including Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, Carolyn Murphy, Amber Valletta, Karlie Kloss, along with renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz. Second, we enhanced the Donna Karan website with a new look and feel where consumers can better experience the power of the brand. Third, with our fragrance partner Inter Parfums, we launched the Cashmere Collection to complement the brand's iconic Cashmere Mist Fragrance, which will extend the brand's presence. I'm extremely pleased at the reaction to the new Donna Karan collection. Our marketing campaign received major excitement and global attention with over 5.5 billion impressions in the United States and growing. We're already seeing the results with the initial product. Our Donna Karan product commands higher AURs than most of our other brands and is resonating with consumers and selling through almost immediately. Retailers have already increased their buys for the second half of the year. This launch is just the beginning of a new era of fashion for Donna Karan and we're committed to building a lasting brand equity. We plan to expand the brand globally and now see a $1 billion annual sales opportunity over time. DKNY is well established in the contemporary fashion space and is known for merging modern tailoring with sophisticated ease. Celebrating the aspirational and practical spirit of New York. In North America, DKNY grew high single digits and we saw strength across most of its core categories. The total brand grew low-single digits. As we repositioned our international presence, we pruned some of our non-core accounts and product offerings. In Europe, we're focused on elevating our wholesale presence through capsule collections and pop up experiences to expand the brand. In addition, we're also accelerating our digital footprint with Zalando and other key pure player partners. We brought renewed energy to DKNY with new investments this spring by designing contemporary styles that are fashion forward for younger consumers that complement our core offerings of the collection. We launched a new, highly relevant spring marketing campaign with supermodel and actress Kaia Gerber, Cindy Crawford's daughter, as the global face of the brand. This campaign taps into the younger appeal of DKNY and generated over 626 million press and social media impressions. Additionally, at the end of the month, we're activating a new capsule collection, Heart of New York with Kaio, which will create buzz and excitement around DKNY. These initiatives will all drive global awareness and are focused on energizing the brand to connect with consumers. We see many untapped growth opportunities, particularly internationally, and believe there's $1 billion annual net sales potential for the brand over the next few years. As a reference point, when we launched the brand in 2017, it did virtually no sales in North American wholesale channel. As a result of our team's execution, DKNY sales approached $650 million and if you include our licensees, our global retail sales to consumers were over $2 billion for fiscal 2024. With a full year of owning Karl Lagerfeld, we're pleased with the brand's performance. Karl was an icon in the fashion industry. The international business experienced mid teen growth in fiscal 2024 as we expanded its reach in Europe through wholesale and retail store openings, entry into new markets and categories. Here in North America Karl Lagerfeld Paris also performed well, growing in high single digits with ample runway as we expand into additional categories. This year, we'll launch suit separates and expand sportswear and dresses into additional doors. Karl Lagerfeld as the theme of the Met Gala, received global recognition and exposure, which was complemented by capsule collections along the many global activations. Further, we opened its first five star luxury hotel in Macau and have six projects in the works. We're leveraging the power of the Karl Lagerfeld name and his vision to extend the lifestyle appeal and global awareness of the brand while delivering incremental licensing revenue. In fiscal 2024, the brand approached $500 million in reported net sales, including our licensees global retail sales to consumers were over 1.5 billion. In fiscal year 2025 Karl Lagerfeld is expected to grow solid double digits. We see greater than $1 billion in annual net sales opportunity for the brand. Vilebrequin, our luxury brand inspired by the Sea and Saint-Tropez lifestyle, experienced double-digit increases in fiscal 2024, driven by growth into new markets through distribution partners and new stores. The newly opened location in Paris, Rue de la Paix, which offers a higher penetration of our luxury line enabled us to increase our store AURs by double digits. We will incorporate this luxury product into wider range of our stores and distribution channels. We're very pleased with the first ever beach club and restaurant for Vilebrequin In Cannes bringing the brand to life on the water. We've quickly leveraged the concept to additional initiatives. In fiscal 2025 we have a newly opened beach club in Abu Dhabi and a few more in the works. Going forward, we're focused on expanding the lifestyle product assortment to extend our consumer reach and now believe there's an annual net sales potential north of $500 million over the long term. As we transition from Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger over the next few years, our brands Donna Karan DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Nautica, Halston, and Vilebrequin will be our core brands. They have significant opportunities across the board, including internationally, where they're underpenetrated. Digital remains an important priority and we made significant investments to grow our capabilities this year. We've put an increased focus on rapid expansion with a pure play channel where we've added dedicated talent to support these platforms. Pure play sales for the year increased 10% and our Amazon business further outpaced this performance. These efforts helped offset the moderation in traditional retail partners digital channels. The speed at which pure play sales have grown makes clear the market share opportunity we have with this channel. Our European brands have built successful digital businesses with Zalando and other third party digital marketplaces, and we're leveraging these capabilities across our portfolio to build the digital business of our other brands. We're also accelerating our dropship and partner programs to further provide tailored brand assortments on our third party marketplaces and we're also upgrading our own digital websites to enhance consumer engagement, conversion, and site performance. In our Retail business segment, we were disappointed in the results. We're already executing on plans that include management changes, reducing our store footprint, and more importantly, rebasing the merchandising strategy for the Retail business to present a better brand experience to consumers. We expect these changes will enable us to significantly reduce losses from fiscal 2024 levels. In conclusion, we ended our fourth quarter and full year delivering non-GAAP earnings that beat our expectations. We've laid out the foundation for our path forward. Our team's versatility, best in class design, and merchandising experience and retail relationships have allowed us to move quickly to develop our new initiatives and bring them to market. Looking ahead, we're optimistic about fiscal year 2025 with our new launches and continued growth of our own brands. As we build new brands this year, we will invest in high impact global marketing to continue excitement, storytelling, and momentum for these fashion collections. And we'll also invest in infrastructure and talent to expand our operational capabilities to deliver our long term strategies. As we've entered fiscal 2025, we continue to believe that the consumer environment will remain under pressure. We expect net sales to be approximately $3.2 billion, a growth of over 3% compared to this past year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $3.50 to $3.60, which reflects the investments I just spoke about. Our objectives are clear: leverage our unique culture and continue to grow on a global scale, focus our investments on key brands to drive long term growth as we transition out of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger., invest and involve how we operate by leveraging technology and data while identifying efficiencies across our organization to support our global growth, implement and execute the retail business segment around the plan. We believe our strong financial position provides us flexibility to invest in our growth, explore strategic transactions, and opportunistically return capital to our shareholders. I'm confident in G-IIIs future as a global leader in fashion. I'll now pass the call to Neal for a discussion of our fourth quarter and full year financial results, as well as our fiscal 2025 outlook.\nNeal Nackman: Thank you Morris. Net sales for the fourth quarter ended January 31, 2024 were $765 million compared to $854 million in the same period last year. Unseasonably warm weather and a challenging consumer environment were significant headwinds to the quarter. Net sales of our Wholesale segment was $729 million compared to $822 million in the previous year. Net sales of our Retail segment were $51 million for the fourth quarter compared to net sales of $49 million. Our gross margin percentage was 37.1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 33.2% in the previous year's fourth quarter. The Wholesale segment's gross margin was 35.6% compared to 31.4% in last year's comparable quarter. The gross margin percentage in the current year's period was positively impacted by improved sourcing costs, primarily from lower freight costs compared to the previous year. In addition, the gross margin percentage in last year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by the significant one-time demurrage charges of approximately $10 million. The gross margin percentage in our Retail Operations segment was 44.2% compared to 45.8% in the prior year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $218 million compared to $236 million in last year's fourth quarter. We had strong warehousing efficiencies compared to our expectations and actually had lower warehousing costs compared to the prior year. Our current warehouse capacity is now well aligned with our current and planned inventory levels. As a percentage of sales. SG&A delevered in the quarter as a result of the higher penetration of sales from the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business, which has a higher percentage of expenses to sales than the rest of the company. Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $36 million or $0.76 per diluted share compared to $20 million or $0.41 per diluted share in the previous year's fourth quarter, driven by improvements in gross margins and less interest expense. Now let us review results for the full fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Net sales for the fiscal year 2024 were $3.1 billion, a decrease of 4% from $3.23 billion in fiscal 2023. Incremental sales from the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business for five additional months this year added $95 million to net sales. Net sales of our wholesale operations segment decreased to $3.01 billion, or 4.6% from $3.16 billion last year. Net sales of our Retail Operations segment for the year were $148 million compared to the previous year's $137 million. Full fiscal year 2024 gross margin percentage increased 600 basis points and was 40.1% compared to 34.1% in the prior year. The Wholesale segment's gross margin percentage was 39% compared to 32.6% in the previous year. The gross margin percentage in fiscal 2024 was positively impacted by improved sourcing costs, primarily from lower freight costs compared to fiscal 2023. The gross margin percentage in the prior year was negatively impacted by the significant one-time demurrage charges of approximately $42 million. Finally, the inclusion of the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business for a full 12 months positively impacted our gross margin percentage by approximately 100 basis points. The gross margin percentage in our Retail Operations segment was 48.1% compared to 49.9% in the prior year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses for the year were $917 million compared to $843 million last year. The full year's non-GAAP SG&A as a percentage of sales was 29.6% compared to 26.1% last year. SG&A expenses increased as a result of the inclusion of $72 million associated with the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business. SG&A delevered as a result of the added Karl Lagerfeld business and the inflationary pressures we incurred throughout the year. Full year non-GAAP net income was $190 million or $4.04 per diluted share compared to $139 million or $2.85 per diluted share in the previous year. The increase is driven by improvements in gross margins and interest expense. Our lower interest expense reflects interest income on the significant cash flow generated this year and reduced debt from the paydown of the seller notes related to the Donna Karan acquisition. Turning to the balance sheet. We made good progress with respect to our inventory levels. Inventory decreased 27% to $520 million at the end of the quarter from last year's $709 million. We made strong progress right sizing our inventory levels as we had appropriately adjusted our inventory purchases to account for the higher than usual inventory we carried over from the previous year. Our inventory levels are now better aligned with future sales. We ended the year with a net cash position of approximately $90 million compared to a net debt position of $428 million in the prior year. This swing from a net debt to a net cash position is primarily a result of cash flows from operations, which includes the large decrease in our inventory levels. We had cash and availability under our revolving credit agreement of over $1 billion at the close of the year. This is after the repayment of $125 million of debt outstanding under the seller's notes. We believe that our liquidity and financial position provide us the flexibility to invest in our future growth and take advantage of strategic opportunities in the marketplace. As for our guidance, we are very optimistic about fiscal year 2025 as we launch our new brands and continue to grow our owned brands. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect net sales of approximately $3.2 billion, a growth of approximately 3%, driven by our owned brands and the launches of the new initiatives. This growth is happening as sales of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger continue to decrease as we transition away from these brands. In the upcoming fiscal year 2025 we anticipate sales of these two brands will represent approximately 30% of our total net sales, down 10% from fiscal 2024 when they represented 40% of our net sales. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect net income for fiscal 2025 of between $167 million and $172 million or between $3.50 and $3.60 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $190 million or $4.04 per diluted share for fiscal 2024. Full year fiscal 2025, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $290 million and $295 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $324 million in fiscal 2024. Our fiscal 2025 guidance includes approximately $60 million in incremental expenses primarily associated with the launches of Donna Karan, Nautica, and Holston. Approximately 65% of these expenses are related to marketing initiatives to support the Donna Karan and DKNY brands. The remaining expenses are primarily related to technology and talent to expand operational capabilities. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, we expect net sales of approximately $615 million compared to $607 million in the same period of fiscal 2024. We expect a non-GAAP net loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 to be between a $5 million loss and breakeven, or between a negative $0.10 loss per share and $0.00 per share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $6 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The first quarter's expected results include approximately $20 million of the incremental expenses, which is driving the decrease in net income in the quarter. Let me provide some additional context around modeling. For sales we expect the first half of the year to be relatively flat to last year. In the second half of the year, we will see outsized growth as we continue to expand and launch our new brand initiatives. As for the gross margin rate, we expect full fiscal year 2025 to be similar to fiscal year 2024. Gross margins in the first quarter are expected to be slightly higher. Regarding SG&A, as I mentioned, we plan to make several investments to support the growth of our business for the long term. On the quarterly cadence of the SG&A spend, we expect the marketing spend to be skewed towards the first and third quarters in line with the spring and fall marketing campaigns. We expect interest expense to be approximately $23 million for the full year as compared to fiscal 2024, we expect a much larger benefit in the. The first half of the year, where we expect to continue to earn interest income on the significant cash balance we are carrying into fiscal 2025. In the second half of the year, in line with our increased seasonal working capital needs, we expect interest expense will still be better than last year, but closer to last year's levels. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $50 million. This is higher than our spend in previous years, principally driven by the build-outs of shop-in-shops for our new brand launches and new technology to support our business. We are estimating a tax rate of 28.5% for fiscal 2025. We have not anticipated any potential share repurchases in our guidance. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Morris for closing remarks.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Neal, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm proud of what the team has been able to achieve this past year and look forward to seeing the success that lies ahead. I'd also like to thank the entire organization, our many partners and all our stakeholders for their continued support. Operator we're now ready to take some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nEdward Yruma: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. A few for me. I guess, first on outerwear industry inventory. Obviously, I know you ended up clean on your books. So I'm just kind of curious, how much outerwear do you think got packed away and how did this influence your upcoming fiscal year guide? And then as a follow-up, thank you for the color on the performance -- or the projected performance or contribution of the -- of Calvin and Tommy. I guess, how do you think about the profitability of those businesses relative to the -- to your acquired brands? How that'll be for this fiscal year? And how we should think about that changing over time? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thanks for your questions, Ed. Our coat inventory is in really good shape. The -- unfortunately, we had an unseasonable season. We do have some carryover, but it's in core basics, it's not high risk. Coats for this company has never been high risk. We've been in the coat business for over 50 years. We know how to manage inventory and we know how to sell through inventory at a reasonable profit, even in carryover product. The industry, I really can't speak to, not certain of how everybody else sits, but my assumption is that there is an increased level of inventory sitting either in pack-away or sitting in warehouses that are yet to sell their product. But, again, I have a high confidence level that our inventory is in good shape and will provide profits for the company in the coming year. As it relates to -- go ahead, Neal.\nNeal Nackman: Yeah. In terms of your second question, Ed, as far as profitability of the owned brands versus Calvin and Tommy, so to start, look, the Calvin and Tommy businesses have been strong drivers of our business in the past. They've generated a high operating margin for us. But one of the beauties for us as we go through this transition is that we will be moving to brands that really don't pay a royalty or pay a reduced royalty, and that should significantly impact our operating margins go forward. In addition to that, we've got licensing income that comes off those businesses, that's purely profitable business for us. So, we see, as these portfolios change and keep evolving towards a more owned brand, that we'll have improvement in both gross margins as well as operating margins. In terms of the marketing spend that we might do for these businesses, the way we look at that is we're really sort of comparable. We would have been paying our marketing spend to the licensor. Instead, we'll do our own marketing. So, in some ways we'll have more control over that. We'll be able to direct it. Of course, our owned brands, we can distribute worldwide. So, in addition to having a broader distribution base, full control, we think the operating margins of the business will slowly improve as we shift to the owned brands.\nMorris Goldfarb: Let me add a little bit to that, Ed. Our owned brands are generally higher AURs than our licensed brands. Our margins are significantly better today with DKNY. We're buying better. We're positioning it differently. And our new launch of Donna Karan is significantly higher. Our AURs are significantly higher than Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. It's the early stage. We don't have a huge business plan for our first year out. We're careful on distribution. The sell throughs are stellar. We have a high demand for more inventory. We don't have the ability of servicing all of the demand for the first half of the year. We're working hard for the back end of the year to accommodate the demand that's there at, again, much higher AURs than we currently have.\nEdward Yruma: Got it. Maybe one other follow-up for me. I know the retail business has been problematic for many years. I guess, how much of the soft results in the quarter were kind of these legacy outlet stores versus maybe costs associated with some of the owned brand, kind of, I'm going to call them flagship, but kind of high street locations? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: So, we don't have any real high street locations. Most of our fleet of stores is outlet. They're being managed a little bit differently go forward. We believe we've trimmed the non-performing stores. We still are burdened with corporate overhead that feeds into the stores. We're adjusting that, and I think we'll see a significant difference this year. And maybe, maybe for the first time next year, we'll see a profit in our retail fleet. There's always been a thought of retaining the retail business. There's a need for it. The environment really tells us that we need to get better at retail to sustain real estate, to enable us to showcase and sell product. As store counts reduce in department store sector, we need a hedge. So, we need to get better at retail. Our universe of competition, and I would guess you follow all of them, their business is much more vertical based than ours. Ours is skewed on wholesale. So, we fight hard to get better on our own retail distribution. And with that, as we expand our European footprint, retail is better for us there. We are profitable in our retail venues in Vilebrequin and DKNY, and we're exploring opportunities to expand those retail footprints.\nEdward Yruma: Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Ashley Owens with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nAshley Owens: Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions. So, first, could you just update us on the order book and kind of how you're feeling going into this next year about the wholesale environment? And what's driving the confidence in the back half acceleration you alluded to in the guide? And then, just secondly, if the portfolio continues to grow and you look to expand, are there categories or products you're specifically looking to focus on with this initiative, or where do you think the most opportunity lies? Thanks.\nMorris Goldfarb: Ashley, I didn't hear the back end of your second question, the follow-up. What was that? Was it Europe? Was the question skewed toward Europe?\nAshley Owens: Just new categories or products and where you think the most opportunity lies within those?\nMorris Goldfarb: Okay. So, our order book is strong. And as I inferred a few minutes ago, it's growing in Donna Karan. We're working hard and trying to accommodate what the order book could look like if we're able to service the demand. There's -- our budgets are basically based on our order book, and the timing is toward the back end of the year. We believe we've got a strong business in place. We have inventory that -- we have sufficient inventory to service part of our coat business. We're careful on how we're buying into it. So, we're looking at a good year. The forecast is good, barring the unforeseen. And unfortunately, in the last few years, there have been a bunch of unforeseens. Everything we can control really tells us that we're in the middle of a reasonably good year. As far as the categories, we're expanding suit separates into Karl Lagerfeld, which is an important category for us throughout the company and we anticipate that's going to turn out good. Everything we're doing in Karl Lagerfeld, including the door count expansion, leads us to believe we're going to have a very good year with Lagerfeld. DKNY is stronger than it's ever been, and the launch of Donna Karan has been great. So, there's -- there aren't additional categories that we're exploiting. We're expanding the penetration of the handbag business, the footwear business, the suit separate business. So, there's a good deal of opportunity there. And I'd say, the one lumpy that's a little bit outside of what we generally talk about, our team license business is expanding in categories. We have Starter as a brand, and Starter is growing significantly. We've added distribution. We have a great cooperation with our licensing partner. So, that appears to have opportunities for the first time in a long time to expand.\nAshley Owens: Great. Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Ashley.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Will Gaertner with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nWill Gaertner: Hi. Good morning, Morris and Neal. Thanks for taking my question. So, maybe, you could just start by framing how big your owned brands are now as far as revenue goes?\nMorris Goldfarb: Sure. Thank you. Thanks for your question.\nNeal Nackman: We're at about $1.5 billion now on the owned business, Will.\nWill Gaertner: Is there any way you could parse out by brand, or where those brands are now?\nMorris Goldfarb: We really don't do that yet. I can tell you we're just beginning to ship Donna Karan. So, Donna Karan, in pure dollar revenue, is not going to be the driver. It'll be the growth stimulus for the future. We've never seen a launch this successful. We're positioning it well. We're -- the product -- I encourage you to be conscious of the marketing and the product that's in the stores, and I think you'll understand the potential of the brand. The DKNY business is growing strong double-digits. It's forecasted to do that this year. Lagerfeld will grow even bigger as a percentage than DKNY. So, we were very comfortable with what we have in place and we see amazing growth. We're shrinking the scale of Calvin and Tommy by design and by dilution of our ability going forward of delivering categories. But we're doing a sensational job of building our owned brands to accommodate the misses on Tommy and Calvin. We've given up about $0.5 billion of Tommy, Calvin top-line sales over the last two years, and we're forecasting a 3% growth going forward. I'd say, that's a major achievement in an environment that's difficult.\nNeal Nackman: Will, let me just add -- I guess, let me add a little bit of framing for you. We're at about $1.5 billion today. It's about half the total business. We expect significant growth into next year, strong double-digit growth into next year. We could be as much as 55% of our owned businesses next year. But I think the thing to take away is if you look at the opportunities that we've talked about over the new initiatives, we see over $3 billion of opportunities. Between Donna Karan, we've called that as $1 billion; DKNY, we've also called that as $1 billion; Karl Lagerfeld, we think the total opportunity is $1 billion. We got Halston and Nautica, both at $0.5 billion. And let's, for the moment, not even get into the Vilebrequin growth, which we think is also strong. So, I think if you look at all those opportunities, without giving you the specifics of where we're at on each specific brand today, we've got about $3 billion of potential opportunity. We've got to replace about $1 billion of Calvin and Tommy business. So, we've got plenty of runway to more than replace it. And of course, we expect to do that in short order. I think, if anything, we've sort of showed the last year and our projection into this next year is that we're really able to replace significant chunks of declining Calvin and Tommy business really without a bump. And our hope is to be able to continue to do that.\nMorris Goldfarb: We can't forget your question keys in on our owned brands, we do have several licenses that are important. All our team licenses are important. We have a Levi's license that is of scale. We have assets outside of our owned that are going to participate in the growth of the company. And one might consider the opportunity that's out there of acquiring other assets and signing other deals. We've done a great job of integrating assets into our operating companies, our talent pool, just as good as it gets in our world, and we're -- well, our world being North America, and we're going to achieve the same in Europe in the coming years. We have a mission. Our mission is to expand our footprint, our capabilities globally. And the globe is a big place. There are opportunities that we never focused on. We didn't have the ability to with the licenses that we had. Today, we have the opportunities, we have the desire, we have the capital, and there's recognition in Europe of who we are. We've done a nice job of positioning. And now, it's time for the growth period internationally.\nWill Gaertner: Got it. Maybe just one more for me. You touched on Europe, Morris. Just any color there? It sounds like you guys are performing pretty well. What's the retailer holds for you guys? The appetite for -- we've heard a slowdown there, and just curious what you're seeing on your end there.\nMorris Goldfarb: So, slowdown usually implies companies that of scale. We're not going to slow down. We're going to grow. We're at the early stage with an appetite for our product, regardless of what economies look like. This is a fashion business. What we do is create fashion that's in vogue. We service it well. And there's no doubt in my mind that we're going to grow in spite of the economic headwinds that might come our way.\nWill Gaertner: Got it. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Mauricio Serna with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMauricio Serna: Great. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to maybe reconcile. I think, you mentioned that the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger would roughly represent 30% of sales this year, down from 40% last year. I think that's, like, roughly implies, like, those revenues are going to be down, like, almost $300 million. And I just want to make sure, like, I think, like, this year, you're only losing $50 million from the -- driven by the Denim license. So, I just wanted to first check on that, like, if the rest is just like winding down of the business? And then, maybe, I know, like, you have, like, several initiatives going underway this year. Maybe if you could parse out, like, how much of the growth is coming from the -- like, organically from the brands that you already have, and that you just continue growing versus the new initiatives? And then, just lastly, maybe if you could give, like, us some puts and takes on the gross margin, because it sets flat year-over-year, just how are things, kind of, like the -- how are things, like, the Red Sea, disruption freight, promotions, how are the -- like, what are the big drivers there that take us maybe to a flat gross margin? Thank you.\nNeal Nackman: Yeah, Mauricio. So, just to help you work out some of that math. Yeah, I think, that if you look at what we're forecasting from '24 to '25, we are looking at about $240 million of fall off in the Calvin, Tommy business. That's slightly less than fell off in the previous year. So, obviously, we're going to be up about $100 million. That means that the growth in the rest of the portfolio is about $340 million. That growth is fairly evenly split between the new initiatives and growth on the current business that we're performing. In terms of the flat gross margin percentage, I think you hit it on the head. We are a little bit concerned about the Red Sea. It has not impacted us just yet outside of our European distribution, which it has impacted already. We do anticipate that that will be a little bit of a headwind for us. Hopefully, it doesn't become too great. While gross margin plan has being flat, we're pretty pleased with that kind of result in this current environment.\nMauricio Serna: Great. Thanks for that. Good luck.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Mauricio.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question will come from the line of Janet Kloppenburg with JJK Research Associates. Your line is now open.\nJanet Kloppenburg: Hi, everybody. And I got on a little bit late, Morris. So, if I'm asking a question that's been asked or that you discussed, I apologize. But I wondered what you were thinking and embedded in your guidance for Macy's planned store closings and what effect that may have on your business in the next three years as they close roughly 150 stores? And with respect to the new launch of Donna Karan, which is beautiful, by the way, I wondered if that was going to be a drag on earnings this year because of the marketing investments, or if we should expect a contribution? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you. Janet. Let me deal with the Donna question first. Thanks for noticing the campaign. It's -- we're...\nJanet Kloppenburg: Very beautiful.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you.\nJanet Kloppenburg: Yeah.\nMorris Goldfarb: We've been celebrated for it. There was just an event by Time magazine on the West Coast that we got well recognized, and we're very excited by the campaign. I think I'd like to call out Trey Laird for all the wonderful work he's done. And I have to attribute a lot of success to his talents. Internally...\nJanet Kloppenburg: I didn't know Trey did it. I didn't know it was Trey. He's fantastic. Yeah.\nMorris Goldfarb: So, he's -- we took the best that we could get, the best that there is out there, whether it was the models, the photographer, the brain trust of Trey and his team and our own team, which also should get recognition for what they've done. So, the -- and it will be a drag because of everything I just described. We're spending a disproportionate amount of money on the advertising campaign and the media purchases. It's positioning the brand to the future. It'll pay dividends next year. And we're not a one year show. We're here for over 50 years, and hopefully, we'll be here for another 50 years. So, we're comfortable with the investment in the future. As your question on...\nJanet Kloppenburg: Macy's.\nMorris Goldfarb: Macy's, we can only guess. We're -- as Macy's has said, the door count is projected to be fairly aggressive. But the dollar value on the door count is approximately 10% of their sales. And there's nothing that says we can't further penetrate the remaining good doors. We're looking at a possibility of 5% to 10% dilution should the door count decrease. But that's over time. I don't believe they will shut 150 doors within this fiscal year, and they're projecting smaller door growth. The smaller doors are projected to grow, and I believe we'll play an important role in that as well. Our brands are important to Macy's. We represent a significant share of Macy's Fashion business, not just for the brands, for who we are and how we accommodate the needs of Macy's. We understand it better than anybody in the world. I'd be very fast to say we understand the Macy's business. Cooperation is great, and it's not a major concern for us. So...\nJanet Kloppenburg: One more question, if I could squeeze it in. On the contrary, the off price retailers are doing very well, seem to be taking market share, and I wondered how you viewed your opportunity there as we move through '24 and '25? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: We respect the off price channel. We are very important to them as they are to us. We choose the brands -- we collectively choose the brands that are appropriate for them. And we look to protect our brands to -- in distribution. Yet, we know the significance of the off price channel. We know its growth potential. We've seen it, we've been part of it. And we do products specific for them as well as they help us when needed in moving product. They've been an essential piece of our business. We don't underplay it. We're not embarrassed by it. It's the enabler for department stores to get service the way they do by us. So, we like the off price business.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Kearney with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nPaul Kearney: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. As the licenses come off and with the need to grow the owned business for the next 50 years, can you talk about some of the initiatives the company has to improve the capabilities on owned brands, whether it's operational changes, building a digital platform, bringing in retail expertise, or investing in marketing capabilities? Thanks.\nMorris Goldfarb: Well, two things. It's not written that we have to grow. It's written that we have to be profitable and more profitable, so we can run a smaller business with significantly better margins and accommodate the profitability concern that we have as paramount. So, it's not -- we're no longer going to be a top-line driven company as the key focus. The key focus is going to be profitability. The tools that we need, we have. We don't need any more tools. We have the best talent in the industry and maybe in the world operating in our company. Most of those people will be transitioned from Tommy, Calvin into our owned brands, which is absolutely wonderful. We don't have to go out to the market, hire people, train them and integrate them into the G-III culture. They're here. They are G-III. And there's an entire team here that carries the flag of G-III, not the individual brands. So, we're working on enhancing our data platforms. Technology is key. We're going to optimize our logistics capabilities. We have some weaknesses that we're shoring up, and that's part of the expense of this year. And we're investing in Europe. We're investing in space and in talent. And again, there'll be a media spend, that'll be targeted towards Europe in the coming months. We've got it -- I think we have it all. It's not a start-up company. It's not a company that is going from base zero, projecting out what you're seeing. We're there. We don't need anything and we have the capital to sustain it and support it. Paul, thank you for your question.\nPaul Kearney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from the line of Rob Rosenhaus with the Telsey Group. Your line is now open.\nRobert Rosenhaus: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions here at the end. We touched on the international business a couple of times here, but maybe can you dive a little bit deeper into the go forward opportunity abroad there, particularly with the increased focus on the owned brand penetration and maybe talk about what the profitability profile looks like versus the domestic business? And then, just secondly, one last question on M&A. Obviously, it has been a big part of the business in recent quarters and recent years. Is there anything of interest right now in the current environment? Or do you guys kind of see your hands full with what you have and the focus is just on the current portfolio for the time being? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: So, I guess, I'll answer your last question first. Yes, there are opportunities that we like a lot in Europe. We have identified some. We're working through it. We do our diligence, we do it carefully. And there's a good bet that there's an acquisition opportunity or an investment opportunity at hand. Hopefully, we get it accomplished soon. As far as our European initiatives, again, this is not new. Lagerfeld started out as a European company. We took on an equity stake for North America and eventually bought the entire company. So, the origins are European, the heritage is European, and the operating company really sits in Europe, and they kind of steer the ship. So, what hasn't happened is, there's never been a significant investment in the growth of the European business for Lagerfeld. We're there getting our arms wrapped around what's needed, and we're going to invest in the future of Lagerfeld going down the road. There's an extremely talented group that's spearheading it now. No changes need to be made in management. We had the time to get acquainted with them, with our relationship at North America. So, again, the transition and the acquisition really didn't complicate the lives of the international piece or the American piece. And Vilebrequin, same feature. Vilebrequin is a European brand, born in Saint-Tropez, spear headed by a group out of Geneva and Paris. And again, for the first time in years, we're making significant investment in the growth of Vilebrequin. We have initiatives to open beach clubs more on the franchise side than the operating side. I don't think we're that company that's going to grow food and beverage, but there are many extremely talented companies that want to use our brand to grow. And we're in the middle of signing deals and finding opportunities that will impact the profitability of, again, our brands, not necessarily the top-line, because we like the licensing side of life. And that doesn't always constitute top-line growth, it's bottom line that it contributes to. So, I believe we've got -- and let me touch on DKNY. DKNY, when we bought it, was European in distribution more so than it was American. So, we're now shoring up that entity. We've spent a lot of time on evaluating what's essential for the future in DKNY. And we -- there's an appetite for the brand, a serious appetite for the brand that we're going to try to fill. There's a newcomer, which is Donna Karan, which we haven't even broached that opportunity in Europe or anywhere else in the world. And we've had phone calls based on this campaign and the knowledge of the sell throughs (ph) at retail for bringing that brand to life everywhere in the world. So, it's an exciting period of time for G-III. There's -- we're redoing showrooms. We're here to stay. We're here to grow. And I think we've proved out that we can. We have a team that will. So, it's a good place to be. We're feeling good about the times for G-III.\nRobert Rosenhaus: Great. Thank you. Best of luck.\nOperator: Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Rob. Thanks for your question.\nOperator: And this concludes our Q&A portion. I'll turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you all for your interest and we hope you enjoy the spring season, and we look forward to speaking to you in June. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Neal Nackman, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nNeal Nackman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements made on today's call and in the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results of operations or the financial condition of the company to differ are discussed in the documents filed by the company with the SEC.

In addition, during the call, we will refer to non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA, which are all non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures in our press release, which is also available on our website. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Morris Goldfarb.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Neal, and thank you everyone for joining us. We recorded strong profitability in the third quarter, well-exceeding our bottom-line guidance. Our strong year-to-date results showcase G-III's ability to successfully navigate challenging market conditions. Over the years, we have a proven track record of evolving to drive our business and to meet the needs of customers in an ever-changing landscape.  Before I review our third quarter results, I want to take a moment to recognize all that we have done over the last 12 months since we announced the staggered license terminations of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands. We noted that this change will allow us time to accelerate our long-term strategic priorities. Since then, we've delivered, we move quickly to develop four new initiatives and have made significant progress with our existing business. Our new initiatives include the repositioning and expansion of Donna Karen, which will launch this spring in over 200 doors. We will build 150 branded shop-in-shops and develop new licenses to extend the brand's new positioning and reach.  Our long-term license for Nautica in North America, beginning with jeans and expanding to a broad range of additional categories is set to launch early next year in over 200 doors. We will quickly install 60 branded shop-in-shops. A master global license with the option to purchase Halston is expected to launch in the fall of 2024 with new positioning across a broad range of categories. We will also be a licensor of the brand, creating another income stream for us, and a multi-year license to produce outerwear for champion that fits seamlessly into our already. Well-developed outerwear operations with first deliveries available for fall of 2024.  We've been able to secure these new initiatives rapidly as we're a vendor of choice for retailers with a strong balance sheet. Importantly, these plans are already underway and will result in new sales starting this spring because of the hard work of our design and merchandising teams led by Sammy Aaron. Sammy and his teams have done an incredible job capturing the DNA of each of these brands and authentically translating that into full collection by category in such a short period of time. The product looks great.  Additionally, Jeff Goldfarb and his teams have successfully enabled us to quickly identify and develop new opportunities to expand our reach and impact. He's secured a number of deals for the business, developed our global distribution partner network, and significantly grown our digital business. All this work demonstrates our ability to deliver to our shareholders, our partners, and our associates. I'm confident that we're moving in the right direction.  As we continue to focus on new opportunities to evolve our business model, I'm pleased to announce that we've hired Dana Perlman as Chief Growth and Operations Officer. In this newly created role, she will bring her impressive experience to drive innovation, optimize operations, and help identify new opportunities for G-III. I'm confident that Dana's 20-year career with a strong track record of success in our industry will help us execute our go-forward plans. The team and I look forward to working with her when she joins us in January.  Now turning to the results of the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $2.78 compared to $1.35 per diluted share last year, well-exceeding our guidance by $0.70 at the midpoint. Our outperformance was a result of several factors, including gross margins which were meaningfully better than last year, exceeding our internal expectations. We moved through our inventory more profitably than planned, and benefited from further moderation in freight costs. We also lapped the bulk of last year's one-time logistics cost. As we work through our inventory, we were able to obtain warehousing efficiencies faster than we expected. Our warehousing is now well-aligned with our current and planned inventory levels. Importantly, we were able to avoid expected deleverage in SG&A, which as a percentage of sales is now comparable to last year's third quarter. As a result, we delivered strong operating margins of 18% in the quarter, as compared to 9% in the third quarter of last year. Net sales were $1.07 billion, compared to $1.08 billion last year. While the retail environment has been challenging across the board with consumers facing inflation as well as unseasonable warm weather, we feel good about our decision to focus on profitable sales. We did not need to chase additional promotional sales, as we exceeded our bottom-line profit expectations. The combination of these factors resulted in missing our top-line guidance, yet we well-exceeded our bottom-line guidance.  We ended the third quarter in a significantly better inventory position with total inventories down 34% to $592 million, compared to $900 million last year. With pressures on supply chains having eased, we are placing inventory buys closer to need. This, combined with our lower inventory levels, are enabling us to turn inventory more efficiently and chase favorable sales trends. Looking ahead, this will enable us to realize additional warehouse cost efficiencies. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $840 million in cash and availability. This is after we utilized $100 million to pay down $75 million of debt and $26 million to repurchase shares. We have 10 million shares available in our buyback program. Now I will provide an update on our strategic priorities. Our first priority is to drive our power brands across categories. Our performance this quarter continues to be led by outerwear, sportswear, dresses, and suit separates across our key brands: DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger as well as Levi's. We also saw a nice pickup in handbags and team sports. We are a significant global supplier with a diversified distribution network across stores and digital channels from luxury and better department stores, specialty stores and the off-price channel. We continue to be able to make quick transitions where necessary and manage inventory to deliver the right product at the right time to maximize profits along with sales.  As we continue planning our transition with Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, our new Nautica and Halston brands, along with newly repositioned Donna Karan, we'll join DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld as Power brands. We're comfortable that they will replace the top line and our bottom line as key growth drivers of our portfolio. They each bring a distinct point of view to our portfolio for a wide range of consumers with tailored distribution strategies and dedicated design teams. We continue to seize opportunities to expand these businesses and bring in additional brands that fit our long-term strategic vision.  Shifting to our next priority, growing our own brands. Our own brands represented $1.3 billion in annual revenue last year, and they are on track to reach $1.5 billion this year. We believe we can grow these brands to over $3 billion in annual revenue over time and continue to direct more resources to this area. They are the most profitable businesses in our portfolio as we do not pay royalty fees, and they provide highly accretive licensing income opportunities.  For the third quarter, our own brands, DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Donna Karan, and Bergan registered another period of solid double-digit year-over-year growth as collections are resonating with customers.  We're on track to earn $75 million in royalty income this year, which is a highly creative revenue stream. We'll have four new fragrances with our partner, inter Parfum, Karl Lagerfeld, DKNY, and Donna Karen will launch new scent next year. This past August, we introduced a brand extension for DKNY's be Delicious, which has performed exceptionally well. Additionally, DKNY expanded into new license categories, including men's underwear and loungewear, rugs, and tech accessories, and we resigned our South Korean territory license.  Our marketing efforts this past quarter for DKNY highlighted the brand's inherent connection with New York City across multimedia campaigns. We acquired the total Karl Lagerfeld brand over a year now and are extremely pleased with its performance, which has been accretive from the beginning. The Fall Campaign focuses on a new icon K handbag, and last month, we launched a new holiday campaign featuring Karl's beloved --. Further, we brought the world of Karl Lagerfeld to life during European Fashion Weeks through some high-impact global activities in Paris, Milan, Dubai, and Bangkok. These events resulted in over 200 social stories and 90 million impressions.  Extending our global reach is an important priority. This year, our key international brands have registered solid sales growth. Karl Lagerfeld is expanding into new lifestyle categories with jeans, which targets a younger consumer and is a natural fit for the brand. The collection embodies Karl's confidence, self-awareness, and the independent spirit of street art for both men and women across ready-to-wear, accessories, and footwear. We just opened our first Karl Lagerfeld jeans store in Madrid, and it is off to a good start. To support the launch and engage with younger consumers, we took over nightclubs in Paris, Berlin, and in Madrid. We now have six unique Karl Lagerfeld branded lifestyle projects with more in the works. In addition to two hotels, one of which opened this year, we have agreements for four residential properties in Dubai, Lisbon, and two in Spain. Vilebrequin further expanded its reach with franchise partners having opened two new stores in prominent beach vacation destinations, one at the Atlantis Hotel in the Bahamas and the other in Costa Navarino, Greece. The brand now has a total of 104 company-operated stores and 88 franchisee operated stores. Further, Vilebrequin has three lifestyle projects, a beach club in Cannes, which opened this summer and is becoming a major success. Our Boca Raton Beach Club that opened last year, and today, we are excited to announce that, we just entered into a multi-year licensing agreement with the developer of a luxury lifestyle hotel in Florida. Expected to open in spring 2024, Vilebrequin has designed the approximately 15,000 square feet combined indoor and outdoor rooftop, pool deck, and restaurant, and will open a retail store.  These beach clubs demonstrate the brand's power and the versatility to adapt our lifestyle concept to owned, franchised or licensed opportunities for clubs, restaurants, and even hotels in the future. For both of these brands, hospitality has become a new opportunity for us. These initiatives provide additional income, drive significant global awareness, and enhance the status appeal of the brands. We have also laid a strong foundation for DKNY's international expansion with new partner stores. Thus far, five have opened this year, and we expect to open seven more by the end of next year. In September, DKNY introduced the first European design collection, which will launch in September 2024. The collection will feature a range of iconic streetwear and sports-inspired women's pieces. We hosted an exclusive press preview during Milan Fashion Week, and garnered rave reviews, delivering over 18 million global press and social impressions. This line will launch in key European cities with exclusive partners like Harrods, Flannels in the UK, Renaissance [ph] in Italy's Orlando will also become a key digital partner for the brand in Europe. Digital and omnichannel growth remains an important priority. We have continued to invest in our capabilities, including an increased focus and rapid expansion with the pure play channel, which has helped to offset the moderation in traditional digital channels, now that customers are returning to stores. This work has paid off with those sales increasing by 30% this year. Our Amazon business alone is up over 80% to last year. The speed at which they have grown makes clear how much runway we have with this channel.  In conclusion, we ended our third quarter delivering non-GAAP earnings that exceeded our expectations and have done a great job successfully executing our strategic priorities. We feel it prudent to take a cautious view of our forecasted sales. We now expect fiscal 2024 net sales to be $3.15 billion based on the strong outperformance in the quarter, which resulted in higher operating margins. We have a confidence to raise fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS outlook. We're raising our non-GAAP net income or diluted share guidance to be in the range of $3.90 to $4 compared to our prior guidance of $3.20 to $3.30. This compares to do $2.85 in fiscal 2023.  I'll now pass the call to Neal for a discussion about third quarter financial results as well as guidance for the full year of fiscal 2024. \nNeal Nackman : Thank you, Morris. Net sales for the third quarter ended October 31, 2023, were $1.07 billion compared to $1.08 billion in the same period last year. Net sales of our wholesale segment were $1.05 billion compared to $1.07 billion last year. Net sales of our retail segment were $33 million for the third quarter compared to net sales of $29 million in last year's third quarter. Our gross margin percentage was 40.6% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 32% in the previous year's third quarter. The wholesale segment's gross margin percentage was 39.6% compared to 30.7% in the previous year's comparable quarter.  The gross margin percentage last year was negatively impacted by significant one-time demurrage charges of approximately $27 million, which we incurred in the third quarter of last year. The gross margin percentage in the current year’s period was positively impacted by lower freight costs compared to the same period last year. We have been forecasting higher gross margin percentages throughout the year, and they came in even better than we had anticipated. The gross margin percentage in our retail operations segment was 49.1% compared to 54.9% in the previous period.  SG&A expenses were $236 million compared to $240 million in last year's third quarter. We were able to achieve strong warehousing efficiencies compared to our expectations and actually at lower warehousing costs compared to the prior year. These reductions offset the inflationary pressures we have incurred throughout the current year. Our current warehouse capacity is now well aligned with our current and planned inventory levels.  Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $130 million or $2.78 per diluted share compared to $66 million or $1.35 per diluted share in last year's third quarter driven by improvements in gross margins, SG&A, and less interest expense. Our non-GAAP net income per diluted share was significantly above the midpoint of our guidance of $2.08 per diluted share.  Turning to the balance sheet, we made good progress with respect to our inventory levels. Inventory decreased 34% to $592 million at the end of the quarter from last year's $901 million. We made strong progress rightsizing our inventory levels, as we had appropriately adjusted our buys to account for the higher-than-usual inventory we carried over from the previous year. We expect to have lower comparable inventory levels at the end of the year as well.  We ended the quarter with a net debt position of approximately $265 million, compared to $729 million in the prior year's quarter end. This decrease in net debt is primarily a result of cash flows from operations as well as the large decrease in our inventory levels, offset by $26 million used for stock repurchases. We had cash and availability under our revolving credit agreement of approximately $840 million at the close of the quarter. Last week, we repaid the remaining $50 million of debt outstanding under the seller's note related to the Donna Karan acquisition. We believe that our liquidity and financial position provide us the flexibility to invest in our future growth and take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. As for our guidance. Based on our performance in the third quarter and our current view of the fourth quarter, we are raising our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share guidance. We expect non-GAAP net income for the full fiscal year 2024 of between $182 million and $187 million or between $3.90 and $4 per diluted share. This is substantially above our previous full fiscal year guidance of net income in the range of $152 million and $157 million or between $3.20 and $3.30 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $139 million or $2.85 per diluted share for fiscal 2023. We now expect fiscal 2024 net sales to be $3.15 billion. Full-year fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $317 million and $322 million, up from our previously guided range of $284 million to $289 million, and compared to adjusted EBITDA $266 million in fiscal 2023. Let me add some context around modeling. We expect continued gross margin improvement in the fourth quarter, however, at a more moderated pace than we saw in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had started to realize the benefits from decreasing freight rates, and we lap a much smaller amount of one-time logistics costs. We anticipate ending the year with gross margin percentages up approximately 600 basis points compared to the fiscal 2023 rate. We anticipate SG&A will delever in the fourth quarter as a result of inflationary pressures on costs. We expect non-GAAP interest expense to be approximately $38 million for the full year. We are estimating a tax rate of 28% for the balance of the year. We have not anticipated any potential share repurchases in our guidance.  That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Morris for closing remarks.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Neal, and thank you all for joining us today. The past 12 months are a testament to our ability to thoughtfully adjust, quickly create and bring to market new opportunities for our business. I feel great about our product, strength across our wholesale segment, digital increases, our prudent inventory management, and our financial discipline. We have strong plans in place to drive G-III with our focus on our strategic priorities and these new growth drivers.  The strength of our balance sheet affords us financial flexibility to invest in our business and consider additional opportunities. I'd like to thank our entire organization for all their hard work. I'm proud of what the team has been able to achieve this year. I'd also like to thank our many partners and all our stakeholders for the continued support.  Operator, we're now ready to take some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Edward Yruma with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi guys, it's Abby on for Ed. Thanks so much for taking our question. You touched briefly on the timeline for Halston and Champion. Can you just contextualize how big that revenue opportunity could be? And then as a follow-up what investments will be required to really maximize the potential of both of those brands? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb : The Champion brand is for us is a coat license. So, I would say the brand would probably mature be between $80 million and $100 million in sales, and that would probably go out three to four years. The Halston brand as we described, we're going to classify that as a power brand for us, and the opportunity is significant. We believe there's an opportunity to bring that north of $500 million just on product that we will create, produce, and ship. And alongside of that we're going to create an income stream that's derived of licensing income that probably could be north of $20 million in the next three years.  And the expense attached to these, they're very modest. There -- one is an option to buy, which is Halston. And the cost of that option is nominal. And alongside of paying for that option, it's a discounted licensing rate that we pay to the current brand holder, which is Excel. And as far as the cost of entry for champion, it's a license, it's a guaranteed sales number or a guaranteed royalty that we must pay, which is nominal. So, the CapEx expenditure or the acquisition cost of both of these brands is very nominal. \nOperator: The next question comes from Will Gaertner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nWill Gaertner: Thanks, for taking my question. So, I guess first just maybe talk a little bit about what drove the upside to gross margins in SG&A, and then on that, how do we think about the puts and takes into next year? Any big callouts when we're thinking about modeling these two lines?\nMorris Goldfarb : So, the thank you for your question, Will. Thanks for joining. The margin enhancements occurred as we were developing and further maturing our brands. We found that, the pricing power of our brands were underestimated. And as we tested pricing, the consumer accepted it. Sales were good and we stayed on course. There was no need to take markdowns to move inventory. It was not a promotional period, and it worked out absolutely great. We were able to move through, just millions of units of inventory that we carried over. And we would assume that, when you do that, you need to take a markdown to achieve it. We didn't take markdowns, as you see in our results.  So, it was a great, great picture, the new canvas that was really created for us. We are now liking the margin format versus top-line sales. So, we feel the same way. As you see, our Q4 forecast shows margin enhancement as well. And we are adjusting top-line. We were adjusting top-line down. Yet at bottom-line, there are enhancements due to margin improvements, as well as buying a little bit better, as well as some freight costs coming down, but we are in a margin business. Neal?\nNeal Nackman: Yes. As far as the look, Will, as far as the SG&A, I'd say, the most significant category that we had great success in was our warehousing costs, really based upon a couple of different factors. Certainly, helps when you can drive inventory down. And as Morris mentioned, the strength of the inventory and being able to move it. And look, we have been looking very hard at every aspect of our third-party warehousing from space utilization, the negotiating rates to moving inventory as properly as possible. So, we were very, very fortunate and efficient in the warehousing spend. The last item I would call out to is our advertising spend. I think we have been prudent in terms of placing that where it has been most effective.\nWill Gaertner: Got it. And then any color into... go ahead. I was just going to say any color into next there, anything that we should be thinking about, puts and takes?\nMorris Goldfarb : It is a little bit early. What I do like is, the percentage of business that we are forecasting on our owned brands versus licensed brands, our own brands are going to derive, as they do today, better margin than our licensed brands. So, it is really kind of cool to focus on better margin businesses, our distribution is going to change a little bit in our own brands. So, we are seeing some good things. I can't really speak to the stuff that I can't control. There is a lot going on in the world. We all see it. We all read it. We all live it. And that makes us a little bit, conservative in our outlook for the future. But short of that, our company is in great shape. We have a talent pool that has been here for years. Consistency and talent that we measure is as an important factor in how we grow and how we recreate businesses or create new businesses. Our people know how we think, they respond immediately, and there's no learning curve. So, this is a great time and a great company to transition new assets. \nWill Gaertner: And then maybe just one more for me, the hire of Dana. How are -- it sounds like you're thinking about M&A a little bit more going forward? What, I mean, what's is out there? I mean, is there any attractive opportunities that you guys have identified? I know you don't have to speak specifically to any, but just maybe talk to sort of the M&A environment and how you're thinking about that? \nMorris Goldfarb : Our culture has always been to acquire companies. We've done a really good job of that -- before Dana. That's -- we continue looking at opportunities, whether it's licensed or owned. We shop globally. We're astute buyers. It shows up in pretty much every acquisition we've made since the nineties. This turned out to be a good acquisition. There's nothing that sits in my mind that was poorly calculated and didn't perform. We made use of every acquisition we made. It's one of our company's strengths. So, enhancing it and putting somebody from the financial world on our team can do nothing but improve what we have. And Dana is a known commodity to us.  We've dealt with Dana for many years at that PVH. PVH was a great partner for years. And Dana is an important part of communication and helping us understand PVH and how we work with PVH. And she'll do the same for G III and Apple with our partners. So, we look forward to coming to the company. \nOperator: The next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS. Your line is open.\nMauricio Serna : Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the result. I just wanted to ask about the sales guidance. Maybe I missed it, but maybe you could comment a little bit what you're seeing from your wholesale partners. I'm curious just because I think it was lowered and just want to see what are the dynamics there. And maybe if you could remind us, like, I know you're not guiding next year, but if you could give us a little bit detail on how we should be thinking on when the new licenses and new like business initiatives will be materializing in your company's P&L that will be very helpful. \nMorris Goldfarb : The outlook, as we all look at retail earnings and forecasts is conservative for the future. For all the same reasons, the consumer is not out there buying aggressively. Traffic is down. The economy is not on spending mode. Housing costs are up mortgage rates are up and we have the never-ending college dilution issues. So, there is a lot that's impacting the consumer that's not in our control. Everything that we are controlling is doing well. It is difficult to forecast, how deep the consumer is going into their pocket. We also have another element that we consider. We are still a large outerwear company. And when weather doesn't work our way, we are impacted.  But the good news is the recovery is quick. Holding over deliveries on coats doesn't necessarily initiate a markdown. So, it is timing and it is amazing how you get a couple of days of cold weather and the pain of warm weather is gone instantaneously. So, it is hard to forecast that, but we saw it, as the weather changed last week, our business in the code area got very good. So, it is a good place for the pieces that we control. The pieces that we don't, again, it's hard to give a read for. And it's a little bit early for us to forecast next year. But we are the same company with more assets, with a consistent talent pool, with our balance sheet being stronger than it has ever been. So those factors all make me comfortable that we are down a good path for the coming year.\nNeal Nackman: Mauricio, this is Neal. Just to add to the specific timing, Nautica Jeans, as well as the Donna Karan launch will be in spring, so you can expect those to start hitting in our first quarter. The Halston is launched for fall as well as the Champion outerwear businesses. So, I would expect that both of those are hitting primarily in the third -- starting in the third quarter of next year.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. Our next question comes from Paul Kearney with Barclays. Your line is open.\nPaul Kearney: Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the results. My first question is on the margins, a bit of a follow-up. So just looking at the model, it looks like, margins are at a multiyear high. I guess can you maybe help us to think about what in here is a structural improvement, what's more transitory? And anything you can kind of help to parse out on the year-over-year drivers? How much was pricing? How much was lower cost? How much was better distribution? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nMorris Goldfarb: Sure. So, Paul, look, I think the margins are structurally in place. While the increase to the prior year has some one-time benefits, the actual achieved margin, I think, and our ability to maintain it goes back to what Morris said before about the ability for us to price strong and maintain those prices. We did have lower freight this year. We don't really anticipate that, that scenario will change dramatically on us. I think that we can continue to maintain pricing. In terms of input costs, we are not seeing anything structurally that to give us pause that this is somehow a unique one-time high for us. So, we will certainly endeavor to maintain these kinds of margins go forward, and that will be based significantly on our ability to maintain price. I think we have always really been able to do a good job in terms of managing the cost side of that equation.\nPaul Kearney: Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up is on price. And I guess trying to swear with the comments on the pressures on the consumer inventory purchases are still conservative. I guess what gives you confidence that as costs come down, prices won't have to soon follow in the intermediate term? Thanks.\nMorris Goldfarb : Now, we don't really sell commodities. We're a fashion business. We sell fashion, we create demand. And when fashion is in demand and you do your job appropriately, you get paid for it. If you don't, you need to take the markdown and move product. We have a history of doing the right thing. As far as the creative side, we add amazing quality to our product, and the consumer always sees value in our pricing. It's not arbitrarily just raising your price and saying, we're going to get $10 more for this dress because we can, we add value whether it's accessory value, whether it's branding value, where we're spending a good deal of money on marketing going forward.  And that generates demand and demand don't generate sales. And if all the pieces are all put together and done appropriately, you get the price that you're trying to achieve. We have a history, we have a long history that it's a consistent, it's a consistent thesis. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ashley Owens with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nAshley Owens: Thanks for taking my question. Just on Karl Lagerfeld, you've seen good momentum this year and have several initiatives in place there. Would just like to hear your thoughts on how you're sizing the opportunity within that brand for next year. And then any additional color on how the other brands are currently performing internationally versus domestically and how that's progressing would be helpful. \nMorris Goldfarb : We have a big internal bet on, Lagerfeld. The bet is it's going to be our biggest percentage growth brand. It's doing great. It had a good year. It's having a good year. And the guidance that we're getting from our retail partners is, there's an amazing amount of growth opportunity with the brand door count and penetration with indoors product is selling, all the categories are working. It's a brand that makes you smile when you see it. They're -- it's got unique attributes.  And we love that acquisition and we're expanding licensing opportunities as I spoke to the lifestyle opportunities that we have in hospitality, food and beverage, and unique situations. It was really originated by Lagerfeld. There's a high demand for unique situations. So, we'll also, other than the demand for our product is a demand for opportunities with the brand. I think, sooner or later, and I'm going to bet this sooner, within the next 90 days, we'll probably announce a hotel development in New York City.  So, there is some really exciting things, that are going on with the brand. And as far as global, the weather was tough throughout Europe. From what I understand, it is the warmest weather in 150 years. And in spite of that, we are growing DKNY. We are growing Lagerfeld and we are growing, Vilebrequin. So, the weather impacted parts of our business. Our feet business is soft, our coat business is soft, sweater business is soft, but the fast-moving fashion pieces worked well. So, we are learning how to operate globally. We are not having the same success in China, but Europe and the Far East has been really good markets for us.\nOperator: Please stand by for our next question. The last question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.\nDana Telsey: Good morning, everyone. And so nice to see the progress, and congratulations on the hiring of Dana Perlman. I think that will be a terrific addition. And Morris, you used one of my favorite words grow and growing. When you think about the strength that you had this quarter and certainly the discussions about wholesale even with more cautious or conservative orders, how do you break down the wholesale strength whether by brand, whether by Channel a wholesale department stores off prices or whatever it may be and what are you seeing there? And do you see that strength continuing? Does it continue because of categories? Does it continue because of pricing? How do you think of the levers moving forward? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: It continues because of many factors, primarily, the underlying talent that makes it happen. It is an aggressive group that discovers opportunities that most people just overlook. We are beyond just a brand. I think we are proving that out now. Give our company a start-up situation with, putting a focus and putting our people on the focus of building it. We can build a start-up and make it effective, very quickly. We are proving that out. Our brands were underachievers in the hands of the competition or other people, and we take them on. We embellish them. We give them love and care, and put a little money behind it. Relationships that we have with retailers are amazing.  We get support. The moment we pivot a brand, the first question is, well, what do you want us to do? We are in. And that's really not the norm. That comes with many years of building that trust. And I would venture to bet that, if you spoke to any major retailer in the United States, they are aware of us, they trade with us, and they are happy with the relationship. We put, as a paramount focus, the profitability of the retailer with without there being able to be profitable, we have no shot. So, our first focus is understanding what they need to be profitable, build around it retain the DNA of what we're marketing. And there's a huge payback. There's loyalty, there are orders, there's cooperation. So, it's not a practice that everybody follows, and it comes from continuity of culture. Same management team running the company for decades. It's not a bait-and-switch situation.  It's a great place to be. It's been fun building it. This phase there aren't many companies that could survive looking at giving up 50% of their top-line sales and forecast increases and be more profitable, and in a period of time when they're looking at maintenance and growth at the same time. I'd say, it's an amazing story. \nDana Telsey: Just one other thing. When you think about other additions to the licensing portfolio, is there a cap on how many you could do or do you think of it as size or number? \nMorris Goldfarb: Yeah, there certainly is a gap. We're not in the business of the days of us looking at a license, a random license, and creating just revenue. To the extent that $20 million, $30 million is really not us. It's got to be an important brand for us to either acquire it or license it. There are some unique situations. Champion is a little bit unique. It's a relationship, but we needed another coat brand to shore up what we ultimately give back. And Champion turns out to be just a great solution for part of what we're giving back. But we're not out there shopping for a multitude of brands. We need scale, we need focus, and each brand has an entire management team. It doesn't cost our company much more to build a billion-dollar brand as to maintain a $100 million brand. So, the focus is large. \nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb : Thank you, Dana. Thanks, for your question. With that operator, I think, we are done. And thank you everyone for your interest and support. We wish you and your families a wonderful holiday season, and a happy, healthy New Year. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the G-III Apparel Group Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Neal Nackman, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nNeal Nackman: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements made on today's call and in the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results of operations or the financial condition of the company to differ are discussed in the documents filed by the company with the SEC. The company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, during the call, we will refer to non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share, and adjusted EBITDA, which are all non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures in our press release, which is also available on our website. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Morris Goldfarb.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Neal, and thank you everyone for joining us. We registered another strong quarter well exceeding our top and bottom-line guidance. The second quarter caps off a strong first half for G-III, demonstrating our ability to navigate what remains a dynamic environment. This gives us confidence as we look ahead to the balance of the year and accordingly, we’ve raised our full year guidance. As a global leader in fashion, we remain focused on strong execution of our business while pursuing our many opportunities for growth. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, net sales were $660 million, an increase of 9% from $605 million last year, well above our guidance by approximately 10% or $65 million. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.40, exceeding our guidance by $0.40. Similar to what we experienced in the first quarter, second quarter gross margins were better than last year's second quarter. Our freight costs have moderated and we're now beginning to anniversary last year's significant one-time logistics costs, which primarily occurred in the third quarter. We are very pleased with the progress we've made to rightsizing our inventory, which was $805 million, down 23% compared to $1.04 billion in last year's second quarter. We remain disciplined in our approach to future inventory buys and have appropriately adjusted our warehousing needs as our inventory levels have aligned. Our new inventory purchases are coming in at much lower freight cost. We are well-positioned for the second half. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with $825 million in cash and availability, which is after repaying $75 million of debt. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares, returning $26 million to shareholders. Further, our Board replenished our stock buyback capacity to 10 million shares. The strength of our balance sheet continues to remain a top priority and provides us with the flexibility to invest in the future growth of our own and new businesses -- our own brands and new businesses. Let me begin by discussing the development of our three recently announced growth opportunities, all of which remain on track to launch with first deliveries next year. These include the repositioning and expansion of Donna Karan, which will be more widely distributed in better department stores, digital channels, and our own Donna Karan website in North America and internationally. We will launch in over 200 partner doors and we will build 150 branded shop-in-shops. The new collection has been well received. Our long-term license for Nautica in North America, which will begin with the jeans category and follow with a broad range of additional categories. Our jeans will launch in over 200 partner doors and we will build 60 branded shop-in-shops. Orders are already in from retailers who think the product looks great. Our 25-year agreement as the master licensee of Halston for a full range of products across our global distribution network. The brand is globally well-recognized but currently has limited North American distribution and almost no international distribution, presenting multiple avenues of growth. We also have the ability to act as a licensor for additional categories, creating another income stream. The agreement also includes an option to purchase the brand. Additionally, this morning we announced our new multi-year license with HanesBrands to produce outerwear for Champion, an iconic American brand that has wide global recognition. We will create quality heritage pieces that expand Champions' lifestyle offering. This license aligns perfectly with our core competencies and will fit seamlessly into our already well-developed outerwear divisions. The product will be distributed through our diverse channels in North America as well as Champions' global network with first deliveries available for fall of 2024. We remain steadfast in our focus on expanding our owned and licensed brands as well as bringing in additional brands that fit our long-term vision. Supporting this growth is our well-developed corporate foundation, which consists of our high-performing forward-thinking team and experienced senior leadership, our strong merchant expertise in product development, our dominance across a broad range of product categories, our well-developed sourcing and supply chain infrastructure across diverse geographies and our diversified distribution network of retail partners to reach an even broader range of consumers. This foundation has enabled G-III to unlock the value of more than 30 licensed and owned brands in our portfolio, including some of the most sought-after names in global fashion. We've built entirely new product lines for our brands across a diverse range of core categories. Our work has enabled them to reach wider audiences, realize tremendous sales growth and is essential to elevating their lifestyle appeal. Our demonstrated track record continues to make G-III a partner of choice for brands and for retailers. Over the years, our entrepreneurial and nimble culture has always enabled us to deliver results. Agility is at the heart of everything we do at G-III, and we continue to evolve regardless of external factors. Since announcing changes to our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses in December, we moved quickly to create the four new strategic initiatives I just discussed with more to come. In doing so, we're creating additional shareholder value. Now let me update you on some of our progress this quarter against our strategic priorities. Our first priority is to drive our power brands across categories. Our results continue to be led by strength in outerwear as well as dressier categories including sportswear, dresses, and suit separates across our key brands DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Levi's. We also saw strength across denim, footwear and team sports. Looking ahead at our third quarter, the order book looks good and our inventory is aligned appropriately. We're well-positioned for the important fall and holiday season. As we look to the future, we think about several key brands as being important growth drivers for our business including DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, Vilebrequin, Nautica and Halston, each of which have unique propositions. The varying aesthetic appeal to wide range of customer segments and lifestyle needs, creating opportunities across an even greater number of retailers. DKNY is inspired by the energy and attitude of New York. This brand provides a modern wardrobe to carry you from day to night that attracts the younger consumers looking for contemporary products. While Donna Karan is a modern system of dressing created to appeal to a woman's senses on every level, it addresses the full lifestyle needs of women in search of sophisticated products from one of the most recognizable American brands. Karl Lagerfeld, an iconic name in fashion, embodies the aesthetic of its namesake fused with a contemporary forward-looking spirit. The product features Parisian-inspired classics with a rock-chic attitude for high fashion. Vilebrequin, our status swimwear brand, cultivates a spirit of refinement and fantasy, staying true to the casual charm with perfectly tailored and always-in-style product for a top-tier clientele. Grounded in classic Americana, Nautica is a lifestyle brand with nautical-inspired designs that's iconic and modern with a casual fit, feel and function, which appeals to shoppers in search of a more relaxed style. And Halston, our most recent key license, stands for simple and classic elegance that will offer an easy modern approach to dressing and appeals to consumers seeking aspirational style. Our brands offer a range of price points, have tailored distribution strategies and dedicated teams that design for their specific positioning. Each of our core brands complement one another and bring a distinct point of view to our portfolio which broadens our distribution opportunities. Growing our owned brands including DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Donna Karan, and Vilebrequin remains a key strategic priority as they represent an important longer-term profit driver by generating higher operating margins and providing licensing income for G-III. They also enable us to further extend our global reach. This year, with the ownership of the whole Karl Lagerfeld brand, our international sales will be up 20% to last year. With $1.3 billion in annual revenue last year, we believe we can grow this business to over $3 billion in annual revenue over time. Our DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld businesses registered solid year-over-year growth in the second quarter. It has now been a year since our acquisition of the full Karl Lagerfeld brand. The integration of this business was seamless and it had a great transitional year. We launched Karl Lagerfeld jeans in Europe, a new key growth category for the brand. We will have two stores dedicated to just the jeans line, one in Paris and the second in Madrid. DKNY's fall marketing campaign will be focused around the same DKNY For You, which explores the uniqueness of New York from a number of perspectives. This campaign will be amplified through a robust mix of media, including digital, premium outdoor placements as well as social and influencer partnerships across the US and key international markets. Coming off the momentum of the Met Gala, Karl Lagerfeld's fall campaign will be brought to life through high-impact marketing activities around the globe. The campaign will roll out across channels with a focus on digital, including innovative NFTs, augmented reality filters, creative collaborations and more. We continue to capitalize on opportunities to leverage our own brand's recognition through highly profitable licensing arrangements. This quarter, we secured renewals from some of our key licenses, which is another good indicator of our brand strength. Additionally, we are in the process of adding licenses in entirely new categories, exposing our brand to a wider audience. Extending our global reach is another important priority. We have unique partnerships for Karl Lagerfeld that drive notable international exposure. Last month, the brand officially opened its first five-star luxury hotel in Macau, with 271 opulent guestrooms and a restaurant featuring a Michelin-starred chef. This project represents Karl's design vision as he personally worked on it for six years prior to his passing. The grand opening was hosted with Academy Award winner Michelle Yeoh, and attended by other internationally renowned VIPs and 2,000 other guests. This hotel is a sophisticated luxury endeavor, creating another major brand experience and attracting a global audience. In June, we announced a second Karl Lagerfeld Hotel Tower at The Sail development in Malacca, Malaysia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is rapidly emerging as an international tourist destination. It will feature the tallest nine-tower linked structures in the world and resemble a ship. The official summer opening of Vilebrequin's new beach club, La Plage, has been a major success, offering guests an elevated beach experience. This summer, the club quickly became a destination for international vacationers as the brand hosted several high-profile celebrity and corporate events at the beach club during The Cannes International Film Festival. This concept has enabled us to rapidly replicate the model to franchise and licensing opportunities for beach clubs. We're actively working on additional opportunities as we continue to create more Vilebrequin experiences, which will increase global awareness, enhancing the status appeal of the brand. The brand also opened two new international stores during the quarter, one in the Bahamas and a second on Paris' Rue de la Paix, which will offer a higher penetration of our luxury line, enabling us to increase our store AURs by double digits. We continue to build our DKNY international business. In Europe, our Milan office has been working to expand the brand's presence. Our franchise partners continue to open stores and have already opened three to date with additional openings to follow. We continue to invest in resources in our digital and omni-channel expansion, which remains an important priority to drive growth for our brands. Our North American digital business with our pure-play partners and our owned DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris sites was up over 60%. Our work with Amazon, Fanatics, and many sites operated by them as well as other digital-only retailers is paying off, and these investments have created digital capabilities that we are leveraging across our entire portfolio. We're excited about the opportunities ahead with these partners and believe this is just the beginning of the digital growth that we can create. Our brick-and-mortar business across our department stores and our wholesale accounts is key. As customers continue to shop in-store, our teams have done an incredible job of getting the right product and the right channels at the right time to maximize sales as evidenced by our strong performance in the quarter. We've created a differentiated business model to support our success at wholesale. Our teams are uniquely comprised of strong planners and merchandisers who partner with our designers to create data-driven designs, which deliver desirable products. And on the sales side, they work hand in hand with our retailers to plan their buys, again, informed by our data, ensuring the appropriate product is in their stores and is well positioned on their floors on a timely basis. Our investments in analytics enable us to design and continually revise our lines to capitalize on the needs of the retailer. Additionally, our proven formula for building each category line creates a strong mix of products that meets consumer demand, creating some of the strongest sell-throughs that ensure we drive our retail partners and our business successfully. This makes us a best-in-class partner to retailers. Lastly, I'm pleased with our Board refreshment efforts, which -- with three new Independent Directors having just recently joined us. Overall, we've added six new Independent Directors over the past four years. Our impressive list of new Board members includes Bob Johnson, Founder and Chairman of RLJ Companies and Founder and Former Chairman of BET; Victor Herrero, the CEO of Australian brand Lovisa and Former Chief Executive Officer and Director of Guess?; Patti Ongman, Former Chief Merchandising Officer of Macy's and currently a leading fashion consultant; Dr. Joyce F. Brown, President of the Fashion Institute of Technology; Michael Shaffer, recently retired Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of PVH Corp and an external advisor to a number of fashion businesses; and Andrew Yaeger, Global Head of Jefferies’ Strategic Equity Transactions Group. Each of them along with our current Board members and management team provide independent, diverse and valuable perspectives to G-III. Having new points of view during this time in our company's evolution is important to better position us for the future. In conclusion, we've done a great job successfully executing our strategic priorities, and I feel great about our product, strength across our wholesale segment, digital increases and our prudent inventory management, financial discipline and enthusiasm of our team. Based on the strong second quarter performance and our order book, we have confidence to raise our fiscal 2024 outlook. We now expect fiscal 2024 net sales of $3.3 billion. We are raising our non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30 compared to $2.85 in fiscal 2023. I will now pass the call to Neal for a discussion of our second quarter financial results as well as guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2024.\nNeal Nackman: Thank you, Morris. With respect to our results of operations, the comments I'm about to make are on a non-GAAP basis. A full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results are included in our press release issued this morning. Net sales for the second quarter ended July 31, 2023, increased approximately 9% to $660 million from $605 million in the same period last year, and were approximately $65 million above our guidance. Included in our sales for this quarter was $38 million of additional sales of the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary on June 1, 2022. Accordingly, the results of the Karl Lagerfeld business were included in our results commencing with the last month of the prior year's second quarter. Net sales of our Wholesale segment increased approximately 9% to $639 million from $588 million last year. This segment now includes the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business results. Net sales of our North American Retail segment was $34 million for the second quarter compared to net sales of $31 million in last year's second quarter. Our gross margin percentage was 41.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, compared to 37.8% in the previous year's second quarter. The Wholesale segment gross margin percentage was 40.6% compared to 36.2% in last year's comparable quarter. As we have stated before, the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business operates at a higher gross margin percentage than the rest of our Wholesale segment. Their inclusion in the quarter resulted in increased wholesale gross margin percentages of approximately 150 basis points. The remainder of the increase in gross margin percentage is a result of a decrease in inflationary pressures in product and transit costs. The gross margin percentage in our Retail Operations segment was 50.5% compared to 51.6% in the prior year. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $237 million or 36% of net sales compared to $186 million or 30.7% of net sales in last year's second quarter. SG&A grew by approximately $29 million, primarily related to the inclusion of the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business in our results for the additional two months in the quarter. In addition, we had increases in compensation and warehousing costs as well as overall inflationary pressures. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $19 million or $0.40 per diluted share compared to $19 million or $0.39 per diluted share in last year's second quarter. Driven by the higher sales we achieved and the associated gross margin flow through, this was significantly above the midpoint of our guidance of a breakeven quarter. Turning to the balance sheet, we made good progress with respect to our inventory levels. As compared to last year's second quarter, inventory levels were $805 million, decreasing approximately $236 million or 23% from last year's $1.04 billion. We have tempered our buying this year and are well set up for the fall and holiday shipping season. We expect our lower inventory levels this year as compared to the prior year at both the end of the third and fourth quarters. We ended the quarter in a net debt position of approximately $268 million compared to $424 million in the prior year. This decrease in net debt is primarily a result of cash flows from operations as well as the large decrease in our inventory levels, offset by $36 million used for stock repurchases. We had cash and availability under our revolving credit agreement of approximately $825 million at the close of the quarter. This was after we repaid $75 million of debt in the quarter. We expect strong positive cash flows this year that will continue to reflect our normalization of inventory levels. We believe that our liquidity and financial position provide us the flexibility to invest in our future growth. As for our guidance, I will provide non-GAAP guidance. Again, a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is available in the press release we issued this morning. Based on our performance in the second quarter and our current view of the second half of the year, we are raising our guidance. For the full fiscal year 2024, we now expect net sales of approximately $3.3 billion. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect net income for the full fiscal year 2024 of between $152 million and $157 million or between $3.20 and $3.30 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $139 million or $2.85 per diluted share for fiscal 2023. Full year fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $284 million and $289 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $266 million in fiscal 2023. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we expect net sales of approximately $1.13 billion compared to $1.08 billion in the same period last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect net income between $96 million and $101 million or between $2.03 and $2.13 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $66 million or $1.35 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. As a reminder, last year's third quarter included significant one-time demurrage charges of approximately $27 million or $0.40 per diluted share. We do not expect to anniversary these costs in this year's third quarter. Let me add some context around modeling. We expect continued gross margin improvement during the balance of fiscal year 2024, and anticipate ending the year with gross margins up approximately 450 basis points compared to the fiscal 2023 rate. The second half of fiscal 2024's gross margin will benefit from a few factors. As I just mentioned, we do not expect to repeat significant one-time logistics costs and additionally, freight costs have significantly moderated. While we are anticipating improved operating margins in both the third quarter and fourth quarter, we anticipate SG&A will de-lever as we continue to expect elevated warehousing costs as well as continued inflationary pressure on costs. We expect non-GAAP interest expense to be approximately $45 million for the full year. We are estimating a tax rate of 28% for the balance of the year. We have not anticipated any potential share repurchases in our guidance. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Morris for closing remarks.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Neal, and thank you all for joining us today. We're seeing the results of our performance. Closing out the second quarter, well exceeding our top and bottom-line guidance and our order book gives us confidence in our raised outlook for the full year. The strength of our balance sheet affords us tremendous financial flexibility to invest in our business and consider additional opportunities. Our diversification is a testament to the stable business model and solid foundation we've created, enabling us to navigate any environment. I'm very excited about the new opportunities we've secured, which our team is working hard to bring to market. We have strong plans in place to drive G-III with our focus on our strategic priorities and these new growth drivers. I'd like to thank our entire organization, our many partners, and all of our stakeholders for their continued support. Operator, we're now ready to take some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Will Gaertner with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nWill Gaertner: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe we could talk a little bit about the guidance. So you guys beat by $65 million, but the flow-through was only $10 million on the top-line. Can you just -- is that just a matter of being conservative or can you just kind of put some more color on that?\nNeal Nackman: Yeah, Will, that's -- so looking at the order book, we go through a very thorough process throughout the company in terms of the future forecast. We speak to every division. Again, we look at the order book that's in place. So those are just refinements, most of that really came out of our internal fourth quarter expectations.\nWill Gaertner: Got it. And just one more follow-up. On Champion, is this going to be similar economics to the other licenses you had previously? And maybe just frame out how big you think that this licensing deal could be for you.\nMorris Goldfarb: So, yeah, the framework of the Champion licenses is very much the same as our other coat license. The added feature is -- for Champion, there is demand in the athletic stores for the brand in the outerwear sector. DICK's and Foot Locker are potential opportunities for us, where our fashion brands really don't have that audience in those venues. So -- and it is not -- it won't be our largest business, but it will be an important business in our portfolio, and it will function alongside with approximately the same sales volume as our other brands that include Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Levi's and DKNY, and Karl Lagerfeld. So it's in this same scope, same scale. That's the plan.\nWill Gaertner: Just the economics are the same from like a -- from an EBIT margin perspective? Is it similar economics?\nMorris Goldfarb: It is, and we reported yet another -- I'm sorry, what I left out is, Hanes has agreed to give us exposure in most of their global venues. So hopefully, we can build an international business out of that whereas Calvin, Tommy, we were limited to just North America.\nWill Gaertner: Got it. Thank you. I'll pass it along.\nOperator: Please standby for our next question. The next question comes from Mauricio Serna with UBS. Your line is open.\nMauricio Serna: Great. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on -- I think like the implied growth for the second half of the year is around 5%, 6%. Just want to understand, like, how much of that is driven by Wholesale versus Retail. And in general, like, during this quarter, like, what can you tell us about the performance of the key brands, like, which one had, like, a stronger performance which one is maybe you saw some underperformance? And I don't know if you mentioned this, but did you provide any, like, long-term expectations on how much the Champion business could reach over time in the long-term? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Mauricio. Thanks for your question. I'll start with the last one. We generally don't provide a dollar value or dollar number for classification brands. But it fits right in the mix of our other brands and with additional opportunity. But we're planning it similar to all our co-brands. Your question on the growth, the growth is primarily through the wholesale distribution that we have, which are department stores and the typical distribution that we have. It is not -- it doesn't have an aggressive retail plan. Retail will be flat to last year and we have a very small retail business. As it relates to your question on brand's performance, we're -- we don't have any losers. We have -- a standout might be considered Karl Lagerfeld. Karl has gotten great exposure. We're growing it very well in the United States as well as in Europe. We have opportunities that still haven't surfaced. Door counts have increased, product has gotten better, and the consumer has gotten more interested in the brand. So we're seeing great appeal digitally, our own retail, and the distribution that we have for the product. The rest remains pretty much the same. Our brands are operated with amazing teams that Bob and we, relative to the market needs, and I do not have a brand today that is under -- that I would classify as underachieving.\nMauricio Serna: Got it. Very helpful, and congratulations on the results.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Mauricio.\nOperator: Please standby for our next question. The next question comes from Paul Kearney with Barclays. Your line is open.\nPaul Kearney: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I think just to ask a little bit differently, relative to 90 days ago, what brands or categories drove revenue upside in the quarter compared to your expectations? And then could you comment on what you're seeing on channel inventory levels, whether you're seeing continued conservatism in wholesale ordering? Or are you starting to see them need to replenish their inventory levels? Thanks.\nMorris Goldfarb: So what we have really in category callouts, our coat business as we shipped it, responded very well. We shipped -- historically, we shipped coats in late June, early July. As soon as coats dropped into the stores, we got immediate reorders, which helped our inventory levels. We're doing well in the athleisure performance side of our business. The belief early on was that the pendulum was going to swing all the way to the right and our business would suffer. As creativity generally got distributed, all the wonderful product that was created that's new and appealing, that business grew quite rapidly. Our suit separates business is kind of a sleeper, but it generates amazing profits for the company as well as amazing reorder activity. And our dress business came back stronger than ever. Those are rather -- I guess, I'd make those the callout features. On the footwear and handbag side of the business, we were over-skewed on canvas footwear. We've corrected that. We've improved on our canvas leisure footwear and that's working better. And our handbag business is not as good as I would like, but we've moved designers and sourcing locations and we see it improving drastically. So -- but the quarter itself was not a standout in handbags and footwear. In channel reorders, we're getting our reorders from our typical customers. We're department store driven and that's where our reorders are coming from. And our support is consistent. Our new brands are getting all the support we expected. We're dropping products soon. We're building out shops as they've been allocated to us. The real estate is prime real estate that we've negotiated for and we're on our way. You haven't seen the impact of Donna Karan yet, Nautica, Halston or Champion, and they're soon to come.\nPaul Kearney: Thank you.\nOperator: Please standby for our next question. The next question comes from Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. This is Ashley on for Noah. I guess, just curious on how you see the promotional environment playing out relative to three months ago when you were looking out and maybe how your expectations have shifted. And then if you could provide some additional color on what is driving your holiday expectations, that would be great. Thanks.\nMorris Goldfarb: So, as far as promotions, there are fewer promotions in retail today than they were pre-COVID, quite honestly. Everybody has found that the right product is accepted by our consumer. If you design it appropriately, put the right quality into it, present it appropriately, the consumer is willing to pay. There are less promotions around, whether it'd be Macy's or Dillard's or Belk. The belief -- the common belief is, if you're sitting with an aggressive amount of inventory, you're going to have to take monstrous markdowns to move it. As we proved out, our inventory is down 23% and our gross margins are up and that's a testament to we're not giving it away where our inventory has got great value, our retailers are appreciating it and the consumer is buying it. So as it relates to -- I can't speak for the future. The political environment, the economic environment is something that we're not in control of. But as it sits today, we don't have a concern for an aggressive markdown cadence that would be unexpected. And our order book as it sits, is in line with our guidance. We sit with our order book similar to what it's been historically as a percentage of our budget. And the holiday expectation is actually a good one in our categories and in our product mix. We're seeing everything all of you are seeing. As far as guidance coming down, we are comfortable with where we are today. We are adjusting guidance. We've got appropriate inventory. We've got great partners that support our needs and we're looking at what we believe is a really good year and a good future. Thank you for your question, Ashley.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks so much. Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Please standby for the next question. The last question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.\nDana Telsey: Hi. Good morning, Marcus -- good morning, Morris, Neal and Priya. Congratulations on the nice progress. As you think about the portfolio that is continuing to evolve and grow, are there categories that you want to focus on in adopting new licensing deals that we should be thinking about? And then as you think about the current wholesale environment with the improved order book, what's changed? Is -- how's AURs? What's happening with the promotional environment? And how do you envision holiday? And then I have one last follow-up.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Dana. Thanks for your question. We don't have a need for new licenses or new acquisitions. As you listened to our story, we have sufficient tools to build a huge business. We've got not just classification licenses where the company sat in the '90s and the early 2000s. We have brands that afford us the ability of producing all categories and they are major brands that are recognized globally that we have an audience that is hungry for the launch of these brands as well as the brands that we continue with. The -- I guess the elephant in the room is PVH. We're not concerned. We might not be happy but we're not concerned about the future of this company. I think we have the tools to do better than we have done historically with the licenses. Owning is far better than renting. And we are in control of our own destiny, which is an amazing luxury. And on top of it, we're getting the expected support from our business partners, our trading partners with the knowledge that we don't have to produce product and it's not necessarily the brand that drives it. It's a talent pool underneath it. It's the culture of the company and we're transitioning to where we need to bring prosperity to ourselves as well as our stakeholders. So we're quite happy with where we are and it's amazing that our margins are increasing. Our staff -- an easy way to get Wall Street excited is to make an announcement that we're eliminating 20% of our staff and saving money. With this transition of PVH and all the new brands, it's amazing to me that we have stable SG&A. We've not added people. We've not fired people. We believe that the talent pool that has built G-III and not just an individual brand remains on and brings their talent to whatever brand they work at. That's great. It's not a new culture that has to be indoctrinated to new employees. So, we're really -- I hate to get off on a tangent but I always feel that's the elephant in the room and let me address it. So, we -- our AURs are up pretty much in all of our brands, which would even include, as I said in our presentation, Vilebrequin, which is a high AUR. We're even taking an approach where we have EUR400 and EUR450 swim chart that we will concentrate on for a handful of doors to see how well we do with it. It's a nice percentage of our business but we're opening stores that will have that as the biggest percentage of their business. So that's working well. And our retailers' AUR in all classifications have gone up. They've gone up somewhere around 10% and performing well. We don't see any slippage because of price increase. So we're really, really doing nicely. And if you look at -- go back to our presentations, probably our last half a dozen presentations, we speak about our desire to grow Europe because Europe is the golden territory if you listen to our competitors speak about their performance. And the US is a nonperforming area for -- or a poorer performing area for our competition. We prosper in the US. We do a great job of tending to the needs of the US retailer and our numbers show it and they have historically. But the opportunity for us is Europe and we grew our European business somewhere around 23% this year compared to the last year. So we're on every tentacle there is to find the best opportunities for this company for the future. I'm not sure I answered all your questions, but I probably answered some, Dana. If I missed one…\nDana Telsey: You answered most.\nMorris Goldfarb: Okay.\nDana Telsey: Just a last thing, what's your outlook on holiday? How you're thinking about it? And given the diversification of wholesale accounts for Champion, how do you see wholesale evolving? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: So, the remainder of the year, I guess, our guidance tells you how we feel. We're not aggressive on inventory ownership. We kind of learned our lesson. We weren't able to manage as well as I would have liked the logistics crisis that occurred, and money is more expensive today than it was yesterday. So our inventory levels will be adjusted fairly dramatically. We'll manage a different type of business which doesn't give us the upside opportunity. If you own the inventory, you have a good opportunity to sell it. So our guidance has got -- it's got some upside opportunities, but not as huge as they had been historically because their inventory is managed differently. As far as what occurs for the future, there is -- that's political, it’s economical, it’s the economics of our country and our world. It's not all targeted as to whether we have the right fashion at the right price. We have all that embedded in our business. We're doing all the right things. Not in control of what we can't control. So…\nDana Telsey: Thanks.\nMorris Goldfarb: And we do consider the inflationary issues and the politics that evolve around us when we do give guidance. So there is some level of conservativism that's factored into our guidance that considers what we can't control.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: And Champion, Champion is wholesale. It's not retail for us. We -- believe it or not, our license was just signed, negotiations have been in place for a couple of months. But there was a confidence that -- confidence level that we would get there, and there is a complete collection ready to go. And there is excitement that surrounded it. We previewed with some of our customers including Hanes for their own needs for their own global distribution and were applauded for just creating this amazing product with a politically-inspired, athletic-inspired attitude that really doesn't exist in the form that we created it. And in the timeline, just amazing that this company achieved it. And that goes for everything we've done. There is -- where do you get notified that you're losing half of your business six, seven months ago and you have replaced collections that are applauded the way our new collections have been, that would be Donna Karan, that would be Nautica, that is not yet Halston, but we're very close to getting Halston ready for market and Champion. That's not imaginable and this company has achieved it. We're armed and ready to go with assets that are in our eyes going to replace everything we lose and more efficiently and more profitably.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you. Thank you all. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the G-III Apparel Group First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Neal Nackman, CFO. Please go ahead.\nNeal Nackman: Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements made on today’s call and in the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results of operations or the financial condition of the company to differ are discussed in the documents filed by the company with the SEC. The company undertakes no duty to update any forward-looking statements. In addition, during the call, we will refer to non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income per diluted share and adjusted EBITDA, which are all non-GAAP financial measures. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures in our press release, which is also available on our website. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Morris Goldfarb.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Neal, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. We had a good start to the year. In the first quarter, our team worked hard to successfully navigate what remains a challenging environment where we exceeded both our top and bottom line guidance. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, net sales were $607 million, above our guidance by approximately $45 million. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share was $0.13, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by $0.23. As expected, gross margins were significantly better than last year’s first quarter. We made strong progress rightsizing our inventory position by reducing future buys to account for the product that we’re carrying. We sequentially decreased inventory from last quarter by $80 million and ended with balances up approximately 15% to last year or up 8%, excluding the acquired Karl Lagerfeld inventory. Further, as port congestion and lead times have normalized, we adjusted our warehouse space appropriately. Importantly, we expect this trend to continue throughout the year, driven by freight costs moderating and not needing to anniversary significant logistical costs, primarily incurred in last year’s third quarter. We ended the quarter in a strong financial position with approximately $800 million in cash and availability, including returning $17 million to our shareholders through stock repurchases. Our balance sheet continues to provide us with the flexibility to invest in future growth. Last quarter, we announced two new substantial opportunities, which include the Spring 2024 repositioning and global expansion of Donna Karan and a long-term license for Nautica in North America. We’ve already begun executing against them. Today, we are pleased to announce a new licensing agreement for the Halston brand as the third new initiative. We have entered into a 25-year agreement with Xcel Brands to design and produce all categories of product with the option to buy the brand at the end of the licensing term. As the master licensee for Halston, we have the ability to sublicense additional lifestyle categories that we do not produce, providing another share of licensing income. First deliveries are expected for fall of 2024. Halston is an American heritage brand with a rich legacy of glamorous designs across a range of price points. Currently, the brand is sold through a number of distribution channels, with a focus on top-tier department stores and live streaming. With our best-in-class design and merchandising teams, retail relationship and distribution expertise across stores and digital platforms will make the brand more widely available to consumers across a broad range of touch points. At G-III, we are known for our success with American heritage brands and believe there is tremendous opportunity to grow Halston by leveraging our proven model to unlock its potential. I look forward to sharing updates with you as we make progress on bringing this exciting brand to market. Development for Nautica and Donna Karan is well underway. We’ve spent time studying the archives of these brands to ensure we create lines with authentic brand messages while broadening their appeal. Product development and merchandising are foundational strength of our company and our experienced teams are moving quickly. For Nautica, we’re hard at work bringing the Spring 2024 jeans line to life. Having built highly successful and differentiated jeans businesses for Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and DKNY, we’re confident in our approach to Nautica jeans. With a strong understanding of the architecture of this category, we’re creating a line that we believe will be successful from the start. With Donna Karan, we’re leveraging the brand’s classic, contemporary, and elevated feel and working to broaden its appeal to a wider consumer base. The collection looks incredible and the initial response from our retailers has been positive. The new Donna Karan, Nautica and Halston opportunities, along with our focus on our strategic priorities will continue to drive growth for the company. Our strategic priorities remain, drive our power brands across categories, further expand our portfolio through ownership of brands and their licensing opportunities, extend our global reach, maximize omnichannel opportunities by leveraging data and continue to scale our private label business. Now let me update you on some of our progress this quarter. Our power brands, DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger outperformed our expectations. Our results were led by dressier categories, including dresses, sportswear and suit separates. Consumers are responding to our latest product offerings across all of our distribution channels. Our diversified expertise enabled us to pivot quickly to these categories from athleisure, which has declined in demand. We continue to be able to make quick transitions where necessary to deliver the right product at the right time. Owned brands are a key strategic priority for us. This includes a focus on DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, Donna Karan and Vilebrequin as well as our other owned brands, which continue to perform well and represented an aggregate of $1.3 billion in annual net sales last year. This year, our owned brands are expected to generate approximately $1.5 billion in annual net sales. Our team is focused on these businesses through expansion across categories, distribution channels, geographic regions, digital penetration and new licensing opportunities. These brands have strong resonance and significant potential to grow while generating higher operating margins than the company’s historic averages. Our North American DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris businesses exceeded plan and are off to a good start to the year. DKNY has shifted much of its marketing efforts to a digital-first approach, focusing on both performance and brand awareness campaigns. The brand continues to build relationships with influencers across all key social platforms and participated in the second annual Metaverse Fashion Week in March. Last month, Vogue and the Metropolitan Museum of Art hosted the Annual Met Gala, the largest and most prestigious event in global fashion. The event celebrated the opening of the museum’s new exhibition, Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty, which revisits Karl’s extraordinary career at Chanel, Fendi, Chloe, and his own Lagerfeld brand to explore his impact on fashion and culture. It’s a great honor for Karl Lagerfeld and we are thrilled that our brand is central to all of the activities. The celebrity-studded Gala was widely watched with spectacular red carpet arrivals. Many celebrities wore Karl Lagerfeld, including Academy Award actors, Michelle Yeoh and Jared Leto, in addition to Amber Valetta, Cara Delevingne and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy. To capitalize on the significant Met Gala press and activities, we focus on our marketing investments on brand-building strategies that connected with customers. We rolled out our largest global marketing campaign for the brand to date, which included dedicated windows at Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s flagship stores in New York City. We also launched capsule collections, events, media partnerships, pop-ups and metaverse engagement. These activities resulted in an impressive 5.1 billion impressions. This is global and created an increased demand for the brand. Our largest retail partners and our own retail sites saw significant spikes in the period around of the Met Gala. The branding halo from the Met, coupled with the strong performance we’ve seen as a result, reinforces the power of having Karl Lagerfeld as part of our portfolio. Additionally, we’re looking forward to the Karl Lagerfeld movie with Jared Leto, who is starting in and co-producing with us. We expect that these investments will increase long-term brand affinity. Extending our global reach is another key priority. In addition to Karl Lagerfeld and DKNY, Vilebrequin continues its positive sales trend and opened 3 new stores this quarter. The brand is known for exciting collaborations that drive newness, excitement and differentiated product. Last week, we officially opened the Vilebrequin La Plage, our first Beach Club in Cannes, signaling the brand’s association and ability to grow all things vacation. Having just returned from the grand opening, I can tell you that it embodies his spirit of the brand. It is clear that there are many more opportunities to broaden the Vilebrequin experience and further solidify our position as a leading luxury resort brand. Our focus on developing sales across multiple distribution channel is yielding good results. In particular, our digital business had strong growth of over 20% and increase that outperformed the industry overall. This is primarily attributed to our focus on building our Amazon business, which was almost triple last year’s first quarter, led by outerwear, dresses and shoes. Our growth with pure-play digital retailers offset traditional digital channels, which as expected, have moderated with customers returning to stores. This diversified mix is serving us well as we continue to invest in expanding our digital distribution channels, including our own sites, retail partner sites and pure plays and ensuring that appropriate product is also available in stores. The replatform of our own DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld Paris e-commerce sites are boosted by a new look and feel, new loyalty programs, enhanced CRM capabilities and upgraded technical operations. These are powerful consumer engagement tools that are resulting in strong increases in traffic as well as strong double-digit increases in sales and increased average order value. We are unlocking data in more effective ways than ever before to acquire new customers, drive incremental conversion and foster a more seamless shopping experience for our brands. This work has resulted in the strong performance of our digital business. We continue to take on initiatives to enhance our operations, which will further improve our profit margins in the future. This includes hiring a consultant to help us optimize our warehousing infrastructure. Lastly, I am pleased to mention that we had a good start to the first – to the new fiscal year. We beat our top and bottom line guidance. We made solid progress aligning our inventory to forward demand, and we signed a new long-term global licensing agreement for Halston. Furthering our focus on developing new opportunities. Based on the strong first quarter, we’re raising our fiscal 2024 outlook. We now expect fiscal 2024 net sales of approximately $3 million – excuse me, $3.29 billion, slightly up to last year and including a full year of the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business. We’re raising our non-GAAP net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.80 to $2.90 compared to $2.85 in fiscal 2023. In conclusion, I am pleased to mention that our Board has nominated three new directors, Dr. Joyce Brown, Michael Shaffer, and Andrew Yaeger, who will stand for election at our Annual Shareholder Meeting this Thursday. We look forward to having their expertise and valuable perspectives in supporting the future of G-III. I will now pass the call to Neal for a discussion of our first quarter financial results as well as guidance for the second quarter and full year – full fiscal 2024.\nNeal Nackman: Thank you, Morris. With respect to our results of operations, the comments I’m about to make on a non-GAAP basis. And again, a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP results are included in our press release issued this morning. Net sales for the first quarter ended April 30, 2023, decreased approximately 12% to $606 million from $689 million in the same period last year and approximately $45 million above our guidance. Included in our sales for this quarter were $60 million in sales of the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business, which became a wholly-owned subsidiary on May 31, 2022. Accordingly, the results of the Karl Lagerfeld business were included in our results commencing with the last month of the prior year second quarter. Net sales of our Wholesale segment decreased approximately 14% to $587 million from $681 million last year. This segment now includes the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business results. Net sales of our Retail segment was $30 million for the first quarter compared to net sales of $28 million in last year’s first quarter. Our gross margin percentage was 41.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 compared to 35.7% in the previous year’s first quarter. The Wholesale segment gross margin percentage was 39.9% compared to 34.1% in the prior year’s comparable quarter. As we have stated before, the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business operates at a higher gross margin percentage than the rest of our Wholesale segment. Their inclusion in the quarter resulted in an increased wholesale gross margin percentages of approximately 250 basis points. The remainder of the increase in gross margins is a result of a decrease in inflationary pressures in product and transit costs as well as increases in our prices. The gross margin percentage in our Retail Operations segment was 50.9% compared to 49.9% in the prior year’s quarter, also benefiting from a decrease in inflationary pressures in product and transit costs. Non-GAAP SG&A expenses were $226 million or 37.3% of net sales compared to $183 million or 26.6% of net sales in last year’s first quarter. SG&A grew by approximately $43 million, primarily related to the inclusion of the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business in our results for the quarter. In addition, we had an increase in warehousing costs as a result of our higher inventory levels and increases associated with overall inflationary pressures. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $6 million or $0.13 per diluted share compared to $35 million or $0.72 per diluted share in last year’s first quarter. This was significantly above the midpoint of our guidance of a net loss of $0.10 per share. Turning to the balance sheet. We made good progress with respect to our inventory levels, which sequentially decreased by $80 million from last quarter. As compared to last year’s first quarter, inventory levels were up approximately 15%. Approximately half of the inventory increase is attributable to the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business. The remaining increase is related to increases in outerwear that we carried into this year and expect to ship in the fall and holiday season. Just as a reminder, we have tempered our buying this year in all categories to account for our existing inventory levels and expect our levels to be down significantly compared to the prior year at the end of the second quarter and continue to normalize our inventories as we go through the third quarter. We ended the quarter in a net debt position of approximately $250 million compared to $83 million in the prior year. This increase in net debt was impacted by the $170 million in net cash used to complete the Karl Lagerfeld acquisition and $44 million used for stock repurchases. We had cash and availability under our revolving credit agreement of approximately $800 million at the close of the quarter. Post quarter end, we repaid $75 million of the $125 million note outstanding to LVMH. The remaining $50 million of this note will be repaid on December 1st. We expect strong positive cash flows this year that will be enhanced as our inventory levels normalize. We believe that our liquidity and financial position provides us the flexibility to invest in our future growth. As for our guidance, a full – based on our performance in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance. For the full fiscal year 2024, we now expect net sales of approximately $3.29 billion, slightly ahead of last year. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect net income for the full fiscal year 2024 of between $132 million and $137 million or between $2.80 and $2.90 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $139 million or $2.85 per diluted share for fiscal 2023. Full year fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $267 million and $272 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $266 million in fiscal 2023. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2024, we expect net sales of approximately $595 million compared to $605 million in the same period last year. The prior year second quarter reflected only 1 month of the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business. On a non-GAAP basis, we expect operating results of between a loss of $3 million and net income of $2 million or between a loss of $0.06 per share and net income of $0.04 per diluted share. This compares to non-GAAP net income of $19 million or $0.39 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Let me add some context around modeling. As Morris mentioned, we expect gross margin improvement during fiscal year 2024 and anticipate ending the year with gross margins up approximately 350 basis points compared to the fiscal 2023 rate. This is driven by a few factors: First, freight cost have significantly moderated, and we expect this benefit throughout the year. Second, we do not expect to repeat significant one-time logistical costs, primarily incurred in the third quarter of last year. Lastly, the first 5 months of this year will benefit from the inclusion of the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business, which positively impacts our gross margin percentages. The results from the acquired Karl Lagerfeld business were reflected commencing June 1, 2022. We anticipate SG&A will de-lever as we continue to expect elevated warehousing costs associated with higher inventory levels this year as well as continued inflationary pressure on costs. Further, the addition of the Karl Lagerfeld business in the first 5 months of this year will increase the percentage of net sales represented by SG&A expenses. We expect non-GAAP interest expense to be approximately $50 million, and we are estimating a tax rate of 28% during the year. We have not anticipated any potential share repurchases in our guidance. That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back to Morris for closing remarks.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Neal, and thank you all for joining us today. G-III continues to successfully navigate what is – what has remained a challenging operating environment. We’re off to a good start in the new fiscal year. We remain focused on driving our key strategic priorities and continuing to develop new opportunities. We have the financial flexibility to invest in our business and take advantage of appropriate opportunities that may come our way. I’d like to thank our entire organization, our many partners, and all of our stakeholders for their continued support. Operator, we’re now ready to take some questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Yruma from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nEdward Yruma: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. I guess, first, Morris, on Halston, exciting news. Can you talk a little bit about the white space now that you have a couple of owned brands in that space and licensed brands, kind of how does it fit in relative to DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld? And then as a follow-up, Neal, I know you have lots of excess demurrage costs in the back half of last year, kind of are they already rolling off? And could you just maybe remind us the modeling purposes kind of when they were – when they fell in last year and how we should model appropriately this year? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thanks for your question, Ed. Halston, for us, is a brand that we will have full control of and basically servicing the demands of where the consumer wants to be. We’re developing a collection of a little bit more glamorous than we historically have done product. We’ve staffed it with talent that is premier in our organization. We didn’t have to go outside to find new talent. We have talent that follows basically the beat of G-III, does it well. Sourcing is not a problem, and we’re excited about the opportunity of building a global initiative with Halston. It’s a brand that very much is classified as an owned brand. And as much as we will share some licensing royalty with Xcel. They seem to be great partners, and we’ve got – we’ve got a strong plan for this in the coming years. The white space that your question refers to, in product, I assume you’re asking is more existing in our portfolio than out there in the world. It’s a brand that partners well with Lagerfeld. In a sense, they are contemporaries. One has got European appeal and the other is more of an American heritage brand that we’ve proved out to be quite proficient in developing brands such as Halston. We’re not so concerned about filling white space or we’re a little bit more concerned about filling our own space. And as most of you do know, we’re in a process of exiting both Tommy and Calvin. So this is a shore up to our assets. And as I said before, we’re excited by the opportunity and the great partners that we have.\nNeal Nackman: Ed, on the logistical costs, we incurred about $40 million in total last year, about – just under $30 million was in the third quarter and about $10 million was in the fourth quarter. And you could pretty much exclude those figures almost entirely as we roll this year.\nEdward Yruma: Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Ed.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Will Gaertner from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nWill Gaertner: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Neal, maybe you could just talk a little bit about inventory levels that and Morris too, I guess, what you’re seeing at retail partners? Are they still heavy with inventory? Are they beginning to order or receipts coming back? And then secondly, maybe can you speak to the work stoppages in the West Coast ports and how that might impact your business? Thanks.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you for your question, Will. The inventories are a major issue for our customers today. There is a clear focus on managing their inventory differently than they have historically. Turn on product is a focus there, which isn’t natural. If you’re not turning your inventory, you have no need to buy it. Fortunately, for us, we’re on the good side of that. Our inventory is turning well. Our inventory is in demand. We’ve – our fashion and our inventory is in demand. And what we’ve done is adjusted our inventory into the in demand categories that we have. We – we’re in a good position on the performance or athleisure side of our business. We have a fair amount of orders that go forward that support the initiative. The space is not being given up. There is an overabundance of product in the marketplace. We’re adjusting our flows to accommodate that. And the areas that are flourishing at retail are our specialty, suit separates and dresses are areas of demand that we dominate. So it’s not necessarily how the retailer is managing their inventory. It’s how we’re managing fashion and the right product for our retailers to create demand in our classifications. So we don’t see a problem. Our orders support that, reorders support that. But there is a focus on coming in with low inventories by quarter. We have done an amazing job of bringing down our inventory levels to at least what you’re seeing is Q1, which was not a problem quarter for us last year. Our problems came in Q2 and Q3. In spite of the fact that you’re seeing an 8% increase in inventory levels, it’s at a period of time that our inventory levels were not an issue at all. You’ll see major, major decreases in inventory levels for Q2 and Q3, which will enhance our cash, and it will mitigate some of the logistical issues that we had last year. So inventories are very much in control. As far as the West Coast, we’re not incurring any issues, not at all. Nothing forewarn that we have a potential issue. We’re flowing our inventory appropriately. We have inventory in-house to support a good percentage of what we need going forward. So there is no crisis on our horizon.\nWill Gaertner: Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Will.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a question from Mauricio Serna Vega from UBS. Your line is open.\nMauricio Serna: Great. Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about the Halston brand agreement. So just following on the previous question, what kind of revenue potential do you see in the long-term from this brand? And also, I noticed like in another release, press release was mentioning that there was like an upfront payment in May 2023 for this an advanced payment. Is that like an amount? Could you share the figure for that and how meaningful it is for your guidance this year? And then lastly, on the gross margin, how should we think about the rate of expansion in upcoming quarters compared to what we saw in Q1? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Mauricio. Addressing the Halston question, I am not free to give you the cost of buying or giving enough payment to Xcel. It’s not my decision to – my own decision to give it to you. It was a minor payment in the scope of G-III. It doesn’t affect us in any way at all. It gives us freedom. It gives us growth. And if I were to put a target on it, I would tell you within 4 years, it’s a $250 million business. It is global. It is in demand. We didn’t just pick the brand without doing our diligence. We have customer support for it globally, quite honestly, I was a little surprised after the fact that it has the global appeal, particularly in Europe. So, we are excited by the opportunity. We have an added feature. We share licensing royalty and licensing income that comes to us when we license categories that we choose not to do or are not able to do for any reason. So, besides our own income, we get licensing income. And it’s long-term at a discounted royalty rate as well as a nominal purchase 25 years from now, should we care to purchase the company. It’s all – it’s not a major event from a financial output story. As far as gross margin, what we have told the Street and what we are experiencing is and you can see it. There is a margin enhancement when you get to ship your own brands without paying a serious royalty on it. The royalties all in that we pay for a product is somewhere between 10% and 12%. And eliminating that and spending our own money on advertising and maybe a little bit of added infrastructure, we still have a significant margin enhancement in our business by shipping our own brands versus licensed brands.\nNeal Nackman: And Mauricio, just to help you with some of the phasing, we expect pretty strong increases compared to the prior year for the second and third quarter. And then of course, in the fourth quarter, that will probably tail up, but still be ahead of the prior year.\nMauricio Serna: Great. Thank you very much. Congratulations on the results.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Mauricio.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Janet Joseph Kloppenburg from JJK Research Associates. Your line is open.\nJanet Joseph Kloppenburg: Good morning everyone and congratulations on a good quarter. I got on a little bit late, so forgive me if you have answered this. I was wondering with the addition of the Halston brand and the development of DK, and bringing on Nautica, if you now feel that the revenues that will eventually diminish from Tommy and Calvin have been recouped. I just wondered how that outlook looked. And I know Halston will be a license plan, and I wondered about the margin profile about and how it may impact your business next year. Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: So Janet, the prior question, we addressed on Halston, and I will give it to you again.\nJanet Joseph Kloppenburg: Thank you. I am sorry for the repeat.\nMorris Goldfarb: No, quite alright, I like telling the story. Halston is a great fit for us. It was not a major cash output, and it’s signed as a global initiative. It’s signed as a discounted royalty rate, and it’s signed as an opportunity to buy the brand at termination of the license which goes out, should we choose to go out. It’s got the kick-out periods, but should we have this brand in 25 years, we buy it or we buy the entire brand for a nominal amount. So, great acquisition for us, it fits into our portfolio. We know how to produce American heritage brands, and we have built-in demand for the brand. And we have built in space as we wind down our Calvin and Tommy licenses. And I believe within 4 years, this is a $0.25 billion business for us with enhanced margins.\nJanet Joseph Kloppenburg: Thank you. Okay. Could you also talk about the career wear business? It seems to be leading your strength. And if you look for that to continue for the remainder of the year, or if you think there will be some reversion back to casual? Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Yes. Good question. Career wear is performing very well. We dominate that sector at the wholesale level. Our business is very good. Our margins are good. Our inventories, if I were to cite an area where we have low, low inventories, it would be the career wear side of our business. Demand was high. Sell-throughs were very strong, and we see it continuing as it always has to the future. As far as the athleisure business, that’s not gone away. There was an overabundance of inventory in the marketplace. Everybody during pandemic decided that, that was the area to address. They either expanded their offerings, initiated new collections or bought brands and classifications that they thought they could build. So, all of a sudden from a small business, it became a giant business. So, now it’s correcting itself. It’s an important business. And as the inventory – the old inventory clears out, new offerings are given to the consumer, where we are just fine. We believe that, that business does come back, and it comes back appropriately. The woman is not giving up on athleisure apparel. It’s a way of life. So – and I don’t see that way of life changing at all. And it’s pretty much all demographics, and it’s pretty much every age. So, we have got the two initiatives that you speak about are both incredibly strong in different ways in different timeframes. Thank you, Janet. Thank you for your questions.\nJanet Joseph Kloppenburg: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Kearney with Barclays. Your line is open.\nPaul Kearney: Hey good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is on kind of the SG&A cadence through the year. I think relative to where we had you and consensus was, 2Q looks a little higher than we were thinking. I am wondering just if there is anything behind why SG&A will be higher in 2Q, or how we should think about it through the year? And then second, as we lap the Karl Lagerfeld acquisition in this coming quarter, can you just give us a sense or just remind us the organic underlying growth of that business and how we should model that going forward? Thank you.\nNeal Nackman: Yes. So Paul, as far as SG&A, pretty comfortable with the first quarter a little more advertising spend. So, I think maybe the models were a little bit light. But if you look compared to what we are doing in the first quarter for our volumes, nothing too unusual there. Like I have said, we will have challenges for the year in terms of even the core business with respect to warehousing costs and inflationary pressures in general. With respect to the Karl Lagerfeld acquired business, on a comp basis, we see nice double-digit growth in that business. And as Morris said in his prepared remarks, just lots of exciting things happening around that brand that will inure to the benefit in both the current year and the future year for that brand.\nPaul Kearney: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Noah Zatzkin with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nNoah Zatzkin: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Now that you’ve got Nautica and Halston signed up, just wondering how you are thinking about additional opportunities moving forward? Would you look for an owned opportunity versus licensed? You are kind of agnostic there? And then second, just hoping you could speak to your level of comfortability with the order book today as it relates to the decision to raise full year guidance. Thanks.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thanks for your question, Noah. We are consistent. And our first choice is to acquire brands, the features of owning brands are almost self-evident today. The risk of losing a license after you have developed it for the years that we have with Calvin and Tommy have taught us a lesson owning in this case is better than renting. The margin enhancements are incredibly important to us and being able to guide all our people as to where the brand goes, how it’s marketed, and the attributes that we care to impose in an owned brand are different than our ability to have an influence on licensed brands. So, we like – in this case, we like owning better than renting. As far as what are we out there looking for brands, we are. In the last few months, I have traveled the world to have meetings on opportunities that we believe are actionable. None has surfaced to a must buy today, but we do have the availability and bank support and as much as cost of money is a little richer than I would like to pay. If the opportunities are there, we have the ability of buying a major acquisition. So, we have not put that to the side because we have Nautica, Donna Karan and Halston, we are still searching for an important acquisition.\nNeal Nackman: And then Noah, with respect to the order book that is coming along nicely, obviously this time of the year, we don’t have – we have not shown all of the seasons that we will ship during the year. So, probably about 75% of the year looks like it’s pretty well reflected, and we feel it’s pretty supportive of the – of our forecast.\nNoah Zatzkin: Thanks a lot.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Noah. And our last question?\nOperator: Yes. Our last question comes – and one moment. Our last question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is open.\nDana Telsey: Hi. Good morning everyone. As you think about Karl Lagerfeld and the significant press that you have had over the past quarter, what – was there any additional contribution to revenues or margins that you saw as a result of it? And for the balance of the year, is there any additional uptick that we should be expecting from the Karl Lagerfeld brand as you move forward? And then, Morris, just your view on the wholesale channel right now, what you are seeing in terms of promotions and what the setup looks like for fall and for holiday would be helpful. Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thanks for your question, Dana. We – as it relates to Karl, we have a spike in business. Margins were good going in. We have positioned the brand in an area where it just can’t get too deep into the customers’ wallet. It’s an affordable brand. It is not top tier luxury, yet we are – there is pricing power left in that brand. We have got great demand. I was amazed when I was giving a number yesterday that there were 5.1 billion eyeballs on the brand during the Met Gala. So, it’s clearly a brand building that you don’t get the immediate – I can’t tell you that we had an immediate impact that was as glorious as 5.1 billion eyeballs. But clearly, there are eyeballs that are now paying attention to it. So, the future is bright. The present business is very good. The future is better than the business today, although other business is at the top tier of what we are doing at G-III, both internationally as well as domestically. So, we are excited by the ownership of the brand. There is so much more to come, whether it’s retail, whether it’s wholesale distribution, whether it’s licensing and licensing and classifications that were unexpected. So, the calls and the curiosity of where to take this brand are just mind-boggling. So, we are more than thrilled to own it all. And as far as wholesale, wholesale is going through its difficult periods. There is a hate to do this and everybody says the same thing. Weather has had its impact for Q1. It was unseasonably cold. So, spring inventory didn’t move nearly at the rate that we all expected it to. I am expecting markdowns to be – I am not going to say aggressive, but there is a need to mark down product to make room for appropriate seasoned goods and the retailers are recognizing that. I don’t think you are going to see a crazy amount of markdown product. I think everybody for the last six months has been focused on inventory corrections. So, nobody is really top, top heavy on inventory. So, I think we are all okay and it takes a little time to course correct with all that’s going on in the world in the last couple of years. And I think we are on that path.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nMorris Goldfarb: Thank you, Dana and thank you all and speak to you soon. Have a good day.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
