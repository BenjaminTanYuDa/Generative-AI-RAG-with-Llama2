All participants are in a listen only mode. After the speakers presentation there will be a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Munjal Shah, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMunjal Shah: Thank you, Josh. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today on Synaptics' second quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. My name is Munjal Shah, and I'm Head of Investor Relations. With me on today's call are Michael Hurlston, our President and CEO; and Dean Butler, our CFO. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the company's website at synaptics.com. In addition to a supplemental slide presentation, we have posted a copy of these prepared remarks on our Investor Relations website. In addition to the company's GAAP results, management will provide supplementary results on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes share-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, and certain other non-cash or recurring or non-recurring items. Please refer to the press release issued after the market closed today for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results, which can be accessed from the Investor Relations section of the company's website at synaptics.com. Additionally, we would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, Synaptics will make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. Although Synaptics believes our estimates and assumptions to be reasonable, they are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control and may prove to be inaccurate. Synaptics cautions that actual results may differ materially from any future performance suggested in the company's forward-looking statements. We refer you to the company's current and periodic reports filed with the SEC, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on Form 10-Q for important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Synaptics expressly disclaims any obligation to update this forward-looking information. I will now turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Hurlston: Thanks, Munjal. I'd like to welcome everybody to today's call. Synaptics delivered earnings that were largely in line with expectations, a small achievement in a period marked by industry-wide uncertainty, reduced overall demand and an accumulation of inventory. We recognized these issues about a year ago and took actions to align ourselves to the market environment. While that resulted in significantly lower top line revenue, we intend to use the downturn to position ourselves for the future by investing in our Core IoT products. In fact, we can now see a path to sustained growth in Core IoT, particularly in wireless. We continue to believe we're at the bottom of our cycle and do not foresee further decreases from this point forward. However, the shape and timing of the recovery remains uncertain. Turning to the December quarter, revenue was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range and flat compared to the prior three months. Our gross margins were at the midpoint of our guidance despite an unfavorable product mix, headlined by mobile performing better than initially forecast. Our spending was lower than we originally expected, resulting in non-GAAP EPS toward the high end of the guidance range. For the past few quarters, we've been consciously working down inventory throughout our supply chain. As a result, in our PC, wireless and mobile product areas, stocking levels are at or very near historic norms. On the other hand, we still have some work to do in enterprise, where inventories are moving slower than expected. We continue to attribute this to a slowdown in enterprise IT spending, which has impacted higher-margin areas of our business such as docking stations, enterprise telephony and high-end headsets. As we outlined last fall, we are focusing our investments in Core IoT, which contains our wireless and processor products. We're seeing the first signs of success in our wireless area with the normalization of channel inventory. We now expect to see consistent sequential revenue growth in wireless, starting with the nearly 20% growth reflected in our March guidance. While processors will be a longer road to measurable success, we are coming off CES where we had increased customer engagement around both our general-purpose low-end MCUs and higher-end MPUs, both of which feature AI engines, which enable customers to deploy their own computer vision use cases. Our wireless success is driven first by a return to normal inventory levels and a resumption of shipments to existing customers, but should be further bolstered by new design wins. For example, our lead module partner has begun shipping our first wireless automotive design win for in-car infotainment systems. While initially hesitant about automotive as an end market for Core IoT products, we're getting pulled into customer engagements and see perhaps more opportunity than we thought. Our wireless sales funnel continues to increase, and we have new wins for our high-performance products in audio equipment, consumer security and action cameras. On the product front, our new cost-effective, high-performance 1x1 device, the 43711, is enjoying initial success in home appliances, smart speakers, industrial qualified modules and security cameras. We remain on track to sample both the first Wi-Fi 7 device for IoT applications and our first broad market chip by the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, we have ramped our second module partner, one that we discussed on the last call, and they have already begun taking product from us and are shipping pre-production quantities to their customers. In Core IoT processors, we recently announced our Astra platform. Astra encompasses a family of processors ranging from high-end MCUs to octa-core embedded MPUs. The platform also offers a full-featured software toolkit, designed with the intent to simplify AI adoption in various IoT devices. It accepts commonly used customer frameworks to speed developers' AI integration in IoT products. At CES, there was tremendous interest in Astra, particularly from customers and partners that want to deploy simple AI use cases at the edge of the network rather than relying on models running in the data center. We are extending our customer reach beyond our core processing customers and into deeply embedded applications such as appliances, industrial and video conferencing. Near term, our processor products are seeing traction in our traditional operator space, and we expect those wins to translate to revenue in fiscal year 2025. As stated earlier, our enterprise products have been largely characterized by persistent inventory and weaker-than-expected IT spending. As we look at the different products that compose enterprise, two are worthy of further discussion. In our historic touchpad and fingerprint devices for client PCs, we have worked through customer and channel inventories and believe we are shipping on par with end demand. While the notebook PC market has normalized, predicted growth has yet to materialize. There is some optimism around both a 4-year COVID refresh and AI PCs driving market increases in the second half of the calendar year. We have yet to see anything that would indicate strong resurgence but continue to control what we can by driving share, particularly at the high end of the market. The second area to touch on is our user presence detection technology. Some of you were able to see this in action at CES and its potential for ease of use, privacy and power savings. We are set to deliver our first chip for this application, which is specifically designed to drive our differentiated suite of AI algorithms at extremely low power levels. With both the tuned device and the latest set of algorithms, we expect to increase share at our current lead customer, penetrate additional PC OEMs, and drive the application into accessory devices. Automotive products are continuing to do reasonably well as the transition from discrete touch and legacy DDICs to TDDI plays out. Adoption of TDDI-based solutions is still a tailwind, but we're seeing a sharper fall-off in legacy DDIC products than initially forecast. Our aggregate automotive revenue will likely be choppy as the two curves cross over in the next couple of quarters. We continue to do well with our TDDI products, having recently won at multiple OEMs, including new models at Toyota and Porsche. Although early in the design cycle, our new SmartBridge product is central to our automotive strategy, adding a second product to the portfolio, giving us additional differentiation and delivering system cost savings, while also helping defend our TDDI position. Our mobile products had a strong quarter, driven by improved demand across our Chinese customer base, as well as the ramp of our new design win for the Samsung Galaxy S24. With the GS24 win, we solidified our leadership position in touch controllers for the high-end Android handset market. As we look into the future, we see opportunities to maintain our differentiation at the high end. Customers are looking to introduce new displays that are even thinner, driving higher signal-to-noise ratios, which our precision analog circuits can resolve. In addition, we are seeing opportunities for our touch products in areas outside handsets such as gaming. In general, we believe our mobile inventories have normalized, and we expect our shipments to align and track end market demand. As we said last quarter, our business has hit the bottom of the cycle and continues to stabilize. To a large extent, inventory has now cleared, and we believe some of our businesses are at or near steady state. However, enterprise spending has been significantly reduced, which presents a new impediment to our higher-margin products, keeping our overall top line revenue flat and margins below our outlined targets. Near term, we will see puts and takes in enterprise and automotive before it returns to steady state and tracks to sustained growth. The good news story was our Core IoT business, led by our wireless product line, which will increase nearly 20% quarter-on-quarter and should show sustained growth from this point forward. Overall, we're still confident in the long-term targets we outlined at our Analysts Day in September. Now, let me turn the call over to Dean for a review of our second quarter financial results and third quarter outlook\nDean Butler: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon to everyone. I will first review the financial results for our recently completed quarter and then provide our current quarter outlook. Revenue for the December quarter was $237 million, which was slightly above the midpoint of our prior guidance. Revenue from Core IoT, enterprise and automotive, and mobile were 16%, 58% and 26%, respectively. Year-over-year, consolidated December quarter revenue was down 33%, but more importantly, we continue to stabilize the business sequentially. On a consolidated basis, our distribution channel inventory continued to decline in the quarter, although some products continue to experience high stock and slower inventory turns, while other products are beginning to see new restocking orders. Core IoT revenue was roughly flat sequentially and down 46% year-over-year. Over the last three quarters, we have worked tirelessly to deplete excess inventories where possible and believe we are finally reaching the point where we can expect to return to growth in our third quarter fiscal 2024. In enterprise and automotive, December quarter revenue was down 12% sequentially and down 40% year-over-year. Here, many customers began their slowdown two to three quarters after we began experiencing declines in our Core IoT products, which leads us to believe that enterprise may require some additional patience. Mobile product revenue was up 42% sequentially in the December quarter and up 10% year-over-year. This marks one of the strongest mobile quarterly sequential increases since our fiscal 2022. We are experiencing strength across the Android ecosystem in China, as well as ramps from new flagship smartphones. At this point, it's unclear whether the strength is due to fundamentally strong end market demand or if it's merely channel restocking ahead of the Chinese New Year. We continue to expect our mobile sales to remain subject to normal seasonality patterns. During the quarter, we had two customers greater than 10% of revenue at approximately 13% and 10%. For the December quarter, our GAAP gross margin was 46%, which includes $14.4 million of intangible asset amortization and $1.1 million of share-based compensation costs. December quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 52.5%, which was the midpoint of our guidance range. GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter were $126.9 million, which includes share-based compensation of $28.1 million and intangible asset amortization of $3.9 million. December quarter non-GAAP operating expense of $92 million was down $4.7 million from the preceding quarter and below our guidance range. We continue to maintain vigilant expense control. And given our expectations that return to a more normal sales level will likely take longer than previously expected, our cash bonus program now reflects a reversal benefiting operating expense in the December quarter. During the quarter, we recorded a GAAP tax benefit of $15 million and maintained our expected non-GAAP tax rate of 17% or $4.6 million expense. December quarter GAAP net loss was $9 million or a GAAP net loss of $0.23 per basic share. Non-GAAP net income in the December quarter was $22.5 million, an increase of 11% from the prior quarter and a 75% decrease from the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.57 was near the high end of our guidance range. Now turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $849 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, a 3% sequential increase. Cash flow from operations was $39 million. Capital expenditures were $10.4 million, and depreciation for the quarter was $6.8 million. Receivables at the end of December were $126.6 million and days of sales outstanding were 48 days, an increase of six days from last quarter. Ending inventory balance was $125.1 million, down $6.6 million as we continue to cautiously reduce our inventory purchases. Our calculated days of inventory on our balance sheet also declined to 99 compared to 105 at the end of the prior quarter. Now, let me turn to our March quarter outlook. We are seeing stabilization at the current levels and plan to further reduce distributor inventories, particularly in enterprise-focused products, given the slow corporate IT spending. While we remain hopeful of a return to higher and more normalized run rates, the timing and shape of recovery remains uncertain. At a consolidated level, we anticipate the revenue in the March quarter to be in the range of $220 million to $250 million, similar to the December quarter. Inventory appears to have largely bottomed for our Core IoT products, and we expect the March quarter revenue to be up nearly 20% sequentially. Enterprise and automotive products have not yet fully bottomed and we believe will continue to decline into the March quarter. Mobile is expected to decline due to seasonality and lack of customer ramps in the coming quarter. Given these dynamics, we expect our revenue mix from Core IoT, enterprise and automotive, and mobile products in the March quarter to be approximately 19%, 57% and 24%, respectively. We expect GAAP gross margin in the March quarter to be in the range of 43.5% to 46.5%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 52% to 54%, a small improvement from the December quarter. We expect GAAP operating expenses in the March quarter to be in the range of $130 million to $135 million, which includes intangibles amortization and share-based compensation. We expect non-GAAP operating expense in the March quarter to be in the range of $94 million to $98 million. GAAP net loss per basic share for our March quarter is expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $1.10, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share is anticipated to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.65 per share, on an estimated 40 million fully diluted shares. We expect both GAAP and non-GAAP net interest expense to be approximately $6 million in the March quarter. This wraps up our prepared remarks. I'd like to now turn the call over to the operator to start the Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. You may procees.\nQuinn Bolton: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for all the detailed sort of segment by segment in terms of where you think you are in the inventory process. I guess, first question, trying to get a sense of, in a number of your product segments, you've said you think you have kind of reached normalized inventory levels, and you'll start to ship in line with consumption. I guess my question is, do you think you're currently shipping at end consumption? Or does that return to end consumption imply growth over the next some number of quarters as you come back to shipping in line with consumption? And I guess a sort of related question is, just as you look across all of your businesses, do you still think you're under-shipping consumption rates by, say, much as $100 million a quarter down here at the roughly $230 million, $235 million a quarter revenue level?\nDean Butler: Yes. Quinn, good question, and I'll take a stab and let Michael to add on. I would say, in general, there's -- it's actually a mixed bag across the different product groups. Look, I think, overall, we're probably still under-shipping overall consumption. However, it differs across the different groups. For example, Core IoT really was plagued with a lot of inventory. We've been working that for three straight quarters. This is our fourth quarter now. Guiding into the March quarter up. It looks like we've depleted a large portion of that. There's still pockets within individual products even within Core IT. For example, in mobile and kind of PC-related customers, largely that inventory is resolved. Now we're just shipping back to end demand. As you know, PCs may be a little choppy, mobile seeing more recent strength, and then probably enterprise, which is the most unclear at this point, is there's certainly still inventory in channel. We're probably under-shipping. But I think the demand has sort of fundamentally shifted there, just given corporate IT spending is down, and it looks like -- at least in the near term, it's unlikely to come back up in any sort of rapid pace. I hope that helps, Quinn.\nQuinn Bolton: Yes, it does.\nMichael Hurlston: Go ahead, Quinn. I don't have a lot to add to what Dean said.\nQuinn Bolton: I was just, I guess, going to ask, it sounds like, especially on the enterprise side of things, that if demand has sort of softened with a slow corporate IT spending environment, that prior thoughts that you may be under-shipping demand by as much as $100 million. It sounds like we may need to temper that, just given the sort of weaker macro environment as we think about where the revenue run rate might normalize as you finally clear the inventory in enterprise. It sounds like that's probably the way we should be thinking about it.\nMichael Hurlston: Yes. I think that's -- generally, that's right, Quinn. Look, I think we're -- there's two factors in enterprise. One is that there is still inventory. I mean, we're still seeing inventory in pockets. And then two is, as we've kind of worked through the inventory, we realized that the demand is lower than perhaps we thought. So those two factors are kind of leading us to where we are. I still think that demand is going to return, and obviously, we're going to clear out these inventory levels. So I think the statement remains consistent, but it's tied to that increase in enterprise spending. And once that happens, I think we're back in business.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Understood. And then, you guys, I think in the script, said a couple of times, you think you've reached the bottom for revenue, which is great to hear. I understand that the pace of recovery is uncertain. But I think at least you've put the line in the sand that you don't think sales go down from here. So we've got the bottom in revs. But gross margin also looks like you may be bottoming your 52.5% in December, guided to 53% in the March quarter. Can we also sort of infer that you think you've probably hit the bottom in gross margins in this range of, call it, 52.5%, 53% that you saw December-March?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, I think that's right, Quinn. Look, at 52.5% we ended December. We're guiding up into March. So we do think that, that even on the margin front hit its low point. It should work up from here. Again, as enterprise sort of recovers, it may take a little bit longer. But I think the worst is behind us on the margin front.\nQuinn Bolton: Excellent. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. You may proceed.\nChristopher Rolland: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. You had some nice commentary on wireless IoT. And so, I’d like kind of your thoughts more longer term here. Is this really -- this kind of snapback we’re seeing, is this kind of inventory-related? Or is there -- through your visibility on design wins or engagements, is this a bona fide bottom? And would you expect a strong, sustained rebound from here?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, Chris, we think we bottomed and we think that we have a sustained rebound. So the snapback, I think, is almost entirely due to getting the inventory out. We're not all the way there. There are actually -- Dean said it in one of his comments. There's still even pockets in wireless, but I think we're largely through that. So the snapback that you characterized is largely a resumption of shipping to end demand. I think on top of that, as I said in my remarks, we are seeing a bunch of design wins. We've characterized at Analyst Day, the size of the funnel. The funnel is very, very strong here. And we've actually converted a bunch of design wins, one of which we alluded to in the prepared remarks around automotive. So we feel like there's going to be another layer here, right? We're building toward this $1 billion target in wireless. And I think that there's -- right now, it's almost entirely just return to normal demand. But I think we're going to start soon seeing a layering in of all the design activity that we've had for the last year to 18 months.\nChristopher Rolland: Thank you, Michieal. And then, mobile, obviously, a great quarter here. It looks like it takes maybe a small step-back next quarter. But longer term, are we getting something going here? Can you broaden it? Samsung, beyond the GS24, how are the other OEMs and engagements there? I think Novatek has been talking up this market a little bit. I don't know if you have a similar kind of thought for the rest of the year.\nMichael Hurlston: Yes. I would say, we -- not a lot of upside opportunity. We are -- one of the things, I think, that I alluded to is sort of areas outside mobile. We've done a good job, I think, capturing the high end of the market. We do see, Chris, some opportunity in mid-tier, and we're looking at that to see what we can do. And we think we can do that at appropriate margin levels. But I'd say, generally speaking, we don't see a heck of a lot of upside in mobile from where we are today.\nChristopher Rolland: Understood. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for question. Our next question comes from Peter Peng with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nKaykin Peng: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the enterprise and automotive, so just based on the mix guidance, it's kind of implying a low-single digit Q-on-Q decline. So if we kind of factor in the PC seasonality, your traditional enterprise, that seems like it's kind of bottoming or declining at a slower pace. So do you think that we're kind of at the bottom for the March quarter, and so it's more stability going forward? Or how should we think about the puts and takes in that?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes. I think you actually got it right. We're forecasting the PC market to be down sort of high-single digits. So that's the biggest contributor. The other areas are coming back a bit. I mean, I think you've got it right, that's a couple of percent. So I think we're at the bottom. I think we're still trying to figure out when we see increases in that business. And I think it is tied, as Dean said, to the enterprise IT spending. But we feel pretty good, I think, for the second quarter in a row about declaring absolute bottom, and numbers are starting to reflect that.\nKaykin Peng: And then, for -- just kind of on Chris' comment on the snapback and the Core IoT [indiscernible] wireless portion, that was a $200 million revenue run rate kind of business. Do you think that you can kind of get back to those levels some time in this calendar year? Or is this more of a first half 2025 calendar year kind of trajectory?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes. Look, we feel very good about it. I think that the line of sight to getting back to par here is much closer. I don't think we have necessarily perfect visibility on the timing, but we feel very good that that's closer in than some of these other things in terms of the inventory levels. And then again, we are expecting to layer design wins on top of that. So our wireless business feels very good. Our confidence is generally very high.\nKaykin Peng: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowan. You may proceed.\nKrish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. Michael, just on the last question and your answer, it looks like you're guiding the wireless Core IoT growing 20% sequentially. And I'm not looking for guidance, but is it fair to assume that kind of a growth rate is sustainable through the remaining quarters this year?\nMichael Hurlston: Again, we feel pretty good about the business. And I would say, certainly, we're going to see double digits sequentially from here quarter-over-quarter. So I think we feel really, really good about where that business is. We're really just trying to get it back, as I think the previous questioner asked, to the $200 million level, and we think that that's relatively close in, and then growth from there. So I think it's fair for us to say that this level or somewhere in the kind of the double digits sequentially is very, very possible over the next few quarters.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. And then, a follow-up for Dean. When I look at your March quarter guidance, you guys kind of gave the product mix. And it looks like 3/4 of your products are more -- should be in the high 50% gross margin range, if you're guiding more to like 52% to 54%. So I'm kind of curious. I understand enterprise and auto has still inventory. But what are like the one or two biggest overhang on the gross margin side now? Is it volume? Is it foundry pricing? Any color on that would be helpful.\nDean Butler: Yes. There's obviously many variables in that, Krish. There's absorption at current revenue levels. There's always some prices improving on the supply side. There's some actually going the opposite way. But more than any of that actually happens to be the product mix. Generally, our enterprise bucket tends to have a higher gross margin mix of its own products, even sort of within products. And I think Michael sort of touched on it a little bit in his prepared remarks. Some of our sort of best gross margin applications that go into like docking stations or high-end audio headsets are seeing some of the most sort of hesitation from corporate IT buying. And so, that sort of contributed on to where we are on the margin mix. However, we're starting to see upside into IoT. And as Core IoT grows, that is actually also helpful [indiscernible] everything else moving around.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks a lot Dean.\nDean Butler: Yes. No problem, Krish.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question come from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nGary Mobley: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. If I'm hearing you guys correctly, it sounds like perhaps structurally, the market size or revenue potential in enterprise might be a little bit smaller than what you were thinking at your Analyst Day. At least the minimum pushed out further to the right. And therefore, the question is, is that causing you to sort of reevaluate the long-term gross margin target of 57%, which I believe is highly contingent on that very healthy margin mix from enterprise?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, Gary, I think you got one phrase of the question right in that, we see it as a push-out, nothing more. So I think that we feel good about the market sizes for our enterprise business. I think that we certainly realize that behind some of the inventory, there is a current depressed demand environment due to the enterprise IT spending. But we actually don't substantively believe that the demand profile in those long term has changed, right? We've actually gone out in a huge way to the enterprise customers to sort of assess and feel out, hey, what is the long-term demand in these businesses? And that has not changed. So everybody is still bullish about docking station consumption, enterprise telephony. In fact, we've got a bunch of new refreshes coming on both of those areas, both in dock and enterprise telephony, that will be kicking in, in the second half of this year, and enterprise headsets. So all three of those segments, which are definitely pronounced down due to the enterprise IT spending, big drivers of our margin line. I don't think that there's any change. Dean, you can correct me if I'm wrong, in sort of our view of the overall markets.\nDean Butler: No. Yes, I don't think there's a market destruction, if that's what you're sort of going for, Gary. The second part of your question was dependence on that enterprise mix to drive 57%, which is the long-term target for the company on gross margin. We are dependent on enterprise actually performing well and coming back to a more normal level. I think what you will see is we're going to continue to be dependent on it. And that means the timing to achieve 57% is probably a little bit longer and really is predicated on the enterprise spending sort of coming back.\nGary Mobley: Got it. Thank you guys for that. Dean, you underspent on the OpEx side in the December quarter by roughly 6%. Sounded like that was more variable versus structural in terms of OpEx reduction. Correct me if I'm wrong there, but I'm most curious about how we should model and think about the OpEx when revenue normalizes, when you actually start to ship in aggregate to end demand, let's call it, $300 million per quarter plus in revenue.\nDean Butler: Yes. So first On the December quarter, you picked up exactly right, Gary. It was under our guidance and actually under the prior quarter, really from a one-time on variable expense. We're guiding into the March quarter that that doesn't reoccur, it sort of goes back to where sort of run rate spend level is. As you know, our committed level on operating expenses has been $100 million a quarter or below and we've done a pretty good job to sort of keep it maintained inside that range. Now if you start to think about, hey, what does the company look like at a higher revenue base? We do anticipate that we would likely need to spend a bit more than that from here, But I wouldn't say that it's monumentally more. The way I think about it, Gary, it's probably something like a 5% adder on operating expense, kind of this mid, maybe high single digits that we would likely go up as revenue comes in. I mean, you will see in the beginning of our fiscal year, every year, there's sort of a little bit of resets on variable comp, the merit cycles, et cetera. Just a reminder, we're a junior end, so that's kind of starts to hit in the September quarter for us. So, I hope that helps, Gary.\nGary Mobley: It does. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. You may proceed.\nVijay Rakesh: Yes. Hi, Michael and Dean. Good to hear businesses bottom. So I'm just wondering, just looking at the rest of 2024, just wondering how the seasonality plays out for you through 2024. Do you expect to get back to kind of that $300 million level exiting the year or something?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, Vijay, good question. The one thing I would say is, kind of calendar 2024, it's really tough for us to tell like what is going to happen from here. Look we're sort of bottom, we're coming up, Core IoT is growing nicely. However PC and mobile type applications are very seasonal. I think actually industry-wide people are trying to get a handle on, hey, how did the sequential sort of move from here? I think the most comfort I have is, we're likely to move higher. We're almost unlikely to go lower. So it's higher and I think you'd see more sequential growth sort of continually led by core IoT. Enterprise is less clear for us. It's just tough for us to confirm, Vijay, on exactly seasonality and what that pattern will look like. Core IoT right now is what we probably have the most confidence behind.\nVijay Rakesh: Got it. And then on the AI PC side, any thought on how many PCs you expect with -- I know you had a pretty good demo at the HCS, but with the Astra and that family of products into the AI PCs. How many PCs do you think we see in 2024 with Synaptics on it?\nMichael Hurlston: Look, I mean, on our PC line, Vijay, we're forecasting very, very modest growth in the number of units. We certainly hear all this stuff about AI PCs, our customers keep talking about AI PCs, and our customers are also talking about a pretty pronounced refresh in the back half of the year given everybody bought new PCs four years ago with COVID -- the onset of COVID. Our numbers are much more muted. We certainly don't -- we're not baking any of that in, any of that enthusiasm. If it hits, look, it'll be very helpful, because I think what we've done and what we're focusing on over the next couple of quarters is share. Where we are continuing to be excited, you touched on it, it's a slightly different area, is the whole user presence detection that we have with one of the PC customers that's very AI-centric and we intend to take that product and make it more of a general purpose product that will enable us in the Astra area to have a general purpose MCU with AI capability. So our customer is pretty excited. I mean they've seen the sample we talked about in the prepared remarks, they've seen the sample of this AI MCU. They like it and they think it's incredible in terms of the level of performance and differentiation it brings. It'll start shipping at the end of the calendar year and into next year. And if things go well for us we expect to see a pretty big bounce on that product that adds to what we're currently selling into the PC platform.\nVijay Rakesh: Got it. And one last question if we can sneak it in. On the handset side, you had a pretty good pick up last quarter, obviously, a big win with this 2024 as well. I missed one of your comments, but were you thinking that handset business mostly flat through the year or how are you looking at that trending? Thanks.\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, I mean, I think it's seasonal. I mean, there's going to be some seasonality. Dean talked to that in one of the questions. I'd say for where we are, there's limited upside. I don't think there's a lot of downside where we are from a share, just given the performance of the IC and things of that nature. But our attach rate is very high in China and at Samsung at this point. We said we think we can get some more handsets in the mid-tier at Samsung. That's definitely possible given the work that the team has done. But on balance, on balance, I think we're going to kind of track Android handset shipments at this point, and significant, significant share gains will be more difficult.\nVijay Rakesh: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Rosenblatt Securities. You may proceed.\nKevin Cassidy: Yes, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the results. Just -- there's been a lot of weakness in IoT and you're calling the bottom and seeing it coming back. Can you talk about the design activity? Maybe try to relate it to the past cycle. Is this activity up tremendously? And then also, what are your MCUs and Wi-Fi getting combined in these designs? Or are you getting some leverage on your Wi-Fi parts? Thanks.\nMichael Hurlston: Yeah, Kevin, I mean -- so first, thanks for the nice words. On Core IoT, yes, we are excited. I mean, I think that we've talked to a lot of you about design traction, and now it's starting to hit. Again, very early innings, right? We're still not happy with the overall revenue numbers because, as previous questioner pointed out, we're still well below the $200 million mark. But we think we get there just based on what we had before and then these design wins start to layer in. And we're doing well across the ecosystem with our wireless products. We highlighted a new area for us, which is automotive. As we think about the processors, those ones are kind of a longer road. So they are, yes, they are pulling through our wireless. In every instance, we're trying to package up our wireless and our processors. And Astra, which we had kind of a very, very soft launch before the end of the calendar year, we've definitely lumped in our wireless drivers in that software offering so it pulls through. What we have seen is slower than expected customer ramps. All of these new wins we have are taking more time than before, largely because our customers have kind of cut their engineering budgets, and so the ramp up time has been slower than we've historically seen. We're baking in now in our thinking and our numbers, generally slower ramp times, Kevin, than we saw before -- than we've historically been used to. But we don't think that any of these are losses at this point in time. We just think it's ramping a little bit slower than we'd initially forecast.\nKevin Cassidy: I see. Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nMartin Yang: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I have one question on enterprise and automotive. Have you started speaking with our customers regarding this year's annual budget cycle for enterprise spending? Do you get a feel that adjusting for inventory differences, 20 -- calendar 2024 will be flat, down, slightly up on a yearly basis?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, Martin. I mean, I think 2024 is generally better than 2023. So it's still an issue. We're obviously, early in the year we're staying close to the customers and their customers are giving forecasts. So we're one step removed from both, let's say, Dell and HP. Everybody's hopeful for the second half. I mean, I think there's a lot of optimism built into the second half. We see that. I think as we said in the prepared remarks, I think we're working through the inventory situation. Although it's still there in pockets, as Dean said, generally now it's going to be what's the demand? What's the demand in enterprise? Definitely optimism in the second half. We think that the signals we're getting, but we're one step removed, as I said, so it's still -- the picture is still a bit cloudy.\nKevin Cassidy: Got it. Thank you. That's it for me.\nMichael Hurlston: Thanks, Martin.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Michael Hurlston for any closing remarks.\nMichael Hurlston: I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. We certainly look forward to speaking to you at our upcoming investor conferences and again next quarter. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Synaptics expressly disclaims any obligation to update this forward-looking information. I will now turn the call over to Michael.\nMichael Hurlston: Thanks, Munjal. I'd like to welcome everyone to today's call. I'd like to start by thanking our team in Israel for their continued effort during this difficult period in their country. Our team continues to work tirelessly in the face of worry for their families and colleagues. In the last few years, we've been fortunate enough to establish a meaningful presence in Israel, and our thoughts are with our team there. With that said, the main theme of today's discussion is that our business is lining up essentially as we've outlined over the past several months. In the quarter, we saw overall inventories come down in the channel as expected. Reductions are not uniform and we still have some work to do, particularly in Enterprise. Margins continue to be below our target model due to product mix, but a return to normal Enterprise numbers should lead us back toward our long-term target. In short, we continue to believe we are at or have now passed the bottom in our business and should start a climb out during calendar 2024, with both top line and mix improvements. While visibility to the slope of the recovery is uncertain. Customers have started to place orders again, engagements are increasing, and our pipeline is showing strength. Moving to the September quarter, revenue increased 5% compared to the 3 months prior and was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range with our Enterprise PC products performing better than expected. Our product mix imbalance resulted in a drag on gross margins putting us at the low end of the guide. We maintained our spending discipline and ultimately delivered non-GAAP EPS above the midpoint of guidance. As discussed at our Investor Day in September, we are redefining our product breakouts as Core IoT, Enterprise & Automotive and Mobile. Beginning with our Core IoT products, we continue to make progress with multiple design wins and new product introductions. In wireless, we introduced a new cost-effective single-stream device, the SYN43711. This product adds to our current high-performance portfolio and is the first wireless device done from the ground up by the Synaptics team. I'm very proud to report that the device was a first-pass success and was delivered on schedule. The other 3 devices we introduced this year, the SYN43756E, a dual radio 2x2 WiFi 6E product, the SYN4381, a 1x1 Triple Combo and the SYN4382, a 2x2 Triple Combo are all beginning to ramp at customers. In addition, the development of our first dedicated Broad market chip is progressing as planned, and we expect to tape out the device next year. In the quarter, we saw the first orders from a new module partner, marking our initial channel expansion with the goal of extending our reach into the broader customer base. Finally, we won multiple designs in the high-performance IoT market, sports cameras, drones and soundbars, and we are engaged in new opportunities in trucking and logistics, TVs and industrial automation applications. All of these designs require the highest performance Wi-Fi, flawless interoperability and unmatched Bluetooth coexistence. In our processor road map, we recently introduced a quad-core Linux-based, power efficient and cost optimized system on a chip, the DVF120. Like other SoCs in the processor portfolio, this device can be used to execute a variety of artificial intelligence applications. The DVF120 can run machine learning models on chip, utilizing our standard toolkit and framework for rapid development and deployment. Early traction includes intelligent video and adaptive noise cancellation for the unified communications and collaboration market. The device also operates from our unified software development kit that supports existing Synaptics SoCs, demonstrating our extensible software platform. As with our wireless products, we had several wins in the quarter, some in our traditional operator customer base and others for more general-purpose applications. For example, our customer Swisscom launched their next-generation streaming device, TV-Box 5, that is 35% more energy efficient and half the size of its predecessor, helping them achieve strict European ESG goals. Soon, we expect to announce our new family of general-purpose SoCs, targeting a wide variety of IoT applications that will enable Synaptics to expand our addressable market. Our Enterprise & Automotive products had two diametrically opposed stories during the quarter. With our PC and Automotive products performing better than expected, but continued softness in video interface and Enterprise headsets. Our Automotive products remained steady with new TDDI-based wins at Toyota, Tata Motors, Volkswagen and Mercedes. The move to larger screen size is accelerating, but the corresponding ASP benefit is offset by continued competitive price pressure. Another favorable trend in Automotive is increased adoption of local dimming, which brings LCD screens, which have already have priced and longevity advantages to the performance level of high-end OLED giving us added confidence in our SmartBridge rollout. PC as a second bright spot with solid sequential growth in fiscal Q1. Customer inventories appear to be back to normal levels and demand is improving. Our touchpad and fingerprint solutions continue to perform well with design wins across major OEMs and smaller customers. In addition, we are seeing solid traction in several focus areas within Enterprise that we believe are long-term growth drivers. Our Human Presence Detection solution for laptops performed better than initially forecast as early attach rates were higher than projected. We had our first wireless headset launch with one of our leading customers, Logitech, introducing a product that utilizes our AI-based voice processing for near-field and far-field noise suppression as well as premium hybrid ANC algorithms. Our low-power Enterprise-class audio SoC enables up to 40 hours of battery life. However, the remainder of Enterprise is weak as inventory levels persist at relatively high levels. In addition, new product ramps are slower than normal with engineering cutbacks at our customers affecting the timeline of initial introductions. In spite of this, customer interest, design wins and momentum remains strong for our products, and it is only a matter of time before we see a return to normal run rate.  In Mobile, we believe the majority of android handset makers are shifting more of their models to flexible OLED, which plays to our strength. Our Chinese customers are doing better against foreign competitors in the domestic market. Outside China, we continue to build momentum at Samsung, following the successful launch of the Z Flip5 phone, and we expect to follow on -- see follow-on wins in the near future. To conclude, our business is stabilizing at current levels. We continue to expect a recovery starting in calendar 2024, though visibility to the strength and the slope of this recovery is still limited. We are confident Enterprise inventories return to normal levels over the next few quarters, improving our overall mix and margins. We are focused on executing our Core IoT opportunities and are already seeing traction with our initiatives to expand our addressable market. Now let me turn the call over to Dean for a review of our first quarter financial results and second quarter outlook.\nDean Butler: Thanks, Michael, and good afternoon to everyone. Before I get started, I want to remind investors that we have reclassified our revenue into new categories, Core IoT, Enterprise & Automotive and Mobile beginning this fiscal year. We believe this provides investors with better measurement of our focus areas and creates an easier and more direct comparison with similar peers. We have provided this reclassification on a historical basis, in the supplemental slide presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. Now let me dive into the review of our financial results for the recently completed quarter, followed by our current outlook. Revenue for the September quarter was $237.7 million, which was above the midpoint of our prior guidance. Revenue from Core IoT, Enterprise and Mobile were 16%, 65% and 19%, respectively. While we did not guide to these categories during our August call, Q1 results were in line with our expectations of former IoT and former Mobile products, while our former PC products outperformed our forecast during the quarter. Year-over-year consolidated September quarter revenue was down 47%, but more importantly, grew sequentially by 5% as we moved off from what we believe to be the bottom of sales. On a consolidated basis, channel inventory depleted nicely in the quarter, and our distributors' point-of-sale indicated an increase relative to prior quarter. Core IoT revenue increased by 15% sequentially but was down 66% year-over-year. This area has experienced the most acute channel inventory accumulation which we believe is now near its bottom and should see its final depletion over the coming quarters. In Enterprise & Automotive, our September quarter revenue was up 9% sequentially, but down 47% year-over-year. Sequential growth was driven almost entirely by recovery in PC product shipments. We are optimistic that this may be a directional indicator of overall corporate IT spending as we look forward into calendar year 2024. Automotive product shipments slowed modestly during the quarter but were largely in line with our expectations. We're continuing to work down inventory across the balance of the Enterprise portfolio, which will likely take place over the next few quarters. Mobile product revenue was down 15% sequentially in the September quarter and down 10% year-over-year. We are seeing modest improvements in Android shipments and are gaining share at Samsung. While recovery in Mobile is encouraging, as more customers adopt higher-end flexible OLED displays, we continue to believe the Mobile end market will ultimately remain volatile. During the quarter, we had two customers greater than 10% of revenue, at approximately 18% and 11%, respectively. For the September quarter, our GAAP gross margin was 45.1%, which includes $17.8 million of intangible asset amortization and $1.1 million of share-based compensation costs. September non-GAAP gross margin of 53% was below our midpoint but within our guidance range as product mix skewed us a bit lower. GAAP operating expenses in the September quarter were $142.3 million, which includes share-based compensation costs, of $32.1 million and intangible asset amortization of $5.5 million. September quarter non-GAAP operating expenses of $96.7 million was down from the preceding quarter and below our guidance range as we continue to maintain vigilant expense control. The GAAP tax rate was negative, resulting in a tax expense of $15 million for the quarter and the non-GAAP tax rate was 17%. September quarter GAAP net loss was $55.6 million or a GAAP net loss of $1.43 per share. Non-GAAP net income in the September quarter was $20.3 million, an increase of 4% from the prior quarter and an 85% decrease from the same quarter 1 year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $0.52 was near the high end of our guidance range. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $824 million of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, down from the preceding quarter as we completed the wireless licensing transaction early fiscal Q1. Cash flow from operations was $45 million. Capital expenditures were $6.7 million and depreciation for the quarter was $7.2 million. Receivables at the end of September were $111 million and days of sales outstanding were 42 days, a decrease of 23 days from last quarter. This decline is primarily due to collection from short payment term customers and some front-end loaded linearity of our sales during the quarter. Our ending inventory balance was $132 million down $5 million as we cautiously reduce our inventory purchases. Our calculated days of inventory on our balance sheet also declined at 105 compared to 122 at the end of prior quarter. Now let me turn to our December quarter outlook. September saw good progress in reducing our inventory among our distributors with inventories depleting in line with our expectations. Point of sale at our distributors continue to hold up and in fact, increased versus the June quarter. As we look ahead, we continue to focus on reducing customer and distributor inventories further until full equilibrium is met. Demand shows signs of continued stabilization at the current levels with almost all our products shipping below historical 2019 levels. We expect to recover from these levels in 2024, but the timing and shape of recovery is still uncertain. We see improving strength in PC and Mobile end markets, which creates a gross margin headwind from a product mix perspective. Given these end market dynamics and expected channel inventory burn in the December quarter, we anticipate revenue to be in the range of $220 million to $250 million, roughly flat with the prior quarter. Core IoT is expected to be up slightly for the December quarter, Enterprise to be down on ongoing inventory corrections, and Mobile to be up as certain models are expected to ramp. We expect our revenue mix from Core IoT, Enterprise & Automotive, and Mobile products in the December quarter to be approximately 17% and 59% and 24%, respectively. We expect GAAP gross margin for the December quarter to be in the range of 42% to 45%. We expect non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 51% to 54%, roughly similar to the prior quarter as mix remains unfavorable with Mobile ramps occurring faster than inventory depletion in the other areas. We expect GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, which includes intangible amortization and share-based compensation. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses in the December quarter to be in the range of $95 million to $99 million. GAAP net loss per basic share for our December quarter is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.80, and non-GAAP net income per diluted share is anticipated to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.65 per share on an estimated 39.5 million fully diluted shares. We expect non-GAAP net interest expense to be approximately $6 million in the December quarter with the corresponding GAAP net interest expense of approximately $7 million. This wraps up our prepared remarks. I'd like to now turn the call over to the operator to start the Q&A session. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks for the question, guys. I guess Enterprise, we're waiting for this to come back. Where are the pockets where you see the most inventory? And are there any products or areas that are now kind of clear of that inventory overhang and orders are starting to come back reasonably well?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, Chris, this is Michael. Thanks for the question. I'd say two pockets of concern. One is around our docking station business and that's obviously a great margin driver for us. We've seen some recovery in the display port side of the business. The DisplayLink, if you remember, that was one of our acquisitions, the one-to-many dock that one has had quite a bit of inventory, and we're still going through that.  The other area is audio. We did really bang-up business. And again, it's a gross margin accretive product for us. And that one has been slow. We've started to see a little bit dribs and drabs of orders, but I still think there's quite a bit of inventory in the channel. What's doing well? Obviously, PC now we're classifying in this area, and we had a good quarter in PC. We do think that's a solid leading indicator for docking stations that, it's just a matter of time for inventory clears out. And frankly, it probably couples in these audio -- these wired audio headsets as well. So on balance, I'd say, relatively good news even in the Enterprise sector.\nChristopher Rolland: Excellent. Maybe one for Dean too. It sounds like mix is the big problem with gross margin here, but are there any other issues to consider, anything like pricing, et cetera? And then, maybe you could give us a timeline on when we might be able to return to 57% gross margin? Or your target gross margin, again. It seems like it might be pushed out a bit.\nDean Butler: Yes. Largely, this is mix driven, Chris. As we talked about at Investor Day and even on prior earnings calls, the Enterprise business being a little softer is actually is going to prevent us from having margins move immediately. I mean there's some mild pricing pressure, but it's not materially factoring into our guide. Any pricing pressure really is about maybe new products that might ramp in a year or 2 from now. So that's not as much of a sort of near-term concern. It's really all around mix. And how do we get back to our target mix and our target margin model? Really what we need is for all of the areas to kind of move back into its normal mix. We think that, that Core IoT business has hit bottom and that's starting to move up. Enterprise probably is just a little bit behind that, while at the same time, actually, Mobile is actually starting to move faster and actually looks like it's up in December quarter. So that's a headwind for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities.\nKevin Cassidy: Congratulations on the great quarter in this atmosphere. Interesting new wireless connectivity products you're introducing, can you give us an idea of what the ASP lift will be for those products versus the past generation?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, good question. And thank you for the nice words. It does feel like, to your point, we're now really coming off the bottom. I'd say we sort of called the bottom relatively early in the cycle and now it feels like we're certainly moving off of it.  Our wireless products, everything that we're doing right now is in the high-performance areas. We outlined in the Investor Day, these three categories for us, the high performance, the Broad market and then the Bluetooth opportunity. And so this one is in the Broad -- sorry, in the high-performance area. It's a 1x1 product. Typically, a 2x2 product, to give you an idea, is in the sort of to $3.5 to $5 range, a 1x1 product is in the sort of $2 to $3 range. What we get and benefit here, and I think you and I had talked about this before, is the idea of a lower die size. So our Core IoT business is sort of from a gross margin perspective is sort of at the corporate model or maybe slightly below as we outlined at Investor Day, this gives us an opportunity to improve and continue to see a build on gross margins by taking some of the cost out of this 1x1 device.\nKevin Cassidy: Great. And I imagine with the smaller die and higher performance, you're moving away from any competition -- head-to-head competition? What's the competitive landscape like?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, that's right. I mean in high performance, particularly for the IoT market, we really have -- I don't want to say the run of the market, but we're obviously on these security cameras, video streamers, drones, things that are moving video across the wireless link. We have an incredible competitive advantage just because of the quality of the signal that we're able to generate. We really like where we are from a competitive standpoint, and there's not many folks out there, Kevin, that can do this, really can deliver that consistency of wireless performance over that long video -- long range. So we think we're really, really well competitively positioned and this 1x1 just helps us on the cost front.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar of TD Cowen.\nKrish Sankar: Congrats on the good results and the guidance too in this environment. The first question, I was wondering, either for Michael or Dean, based on the bookings you're seeing so far in the quarter, can you give any color into March? Do you think it could be flattish? Or do you think there could be some seasonality impact on it? And then I had a follow-up.\nDean Butler: Yes. Let me take that one, Krish. Based on what we see on bookings, we actually think we've hit bottom. In fact, if anything, it looks like things are looking more positive as we look forward. We're not guiding specifically into March or anything beyond the December quarter at this point, but it does look like based on bookings and what we can see into channel dynamics, et cetera, looks like bottom is actually behind us and likely moves up. I mean the open question is trajectory, right? We have less visibility on exactly what does that slope look like, but it seems to be positive rather than negative.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. That's very helpful. And then I had a follow-up question on inventory. Is there a way to quantify how much excess inventory is there at your customers? Either in terms of days or what it is today relative to maybe 3 months ago or beginning of the year? And along the same path, Dean, you've done a great job reducing inventory days. What is the target? Do you want to go back to like 70 days, which it was historically? Or do you have an updated target for your own inventory days?\nDean Butler: Yes. It's kind of an interesting question, Krish. As we start to see the bookings, we're a little wary, what does positive momentum look like from here, and how far down should we drive inventory. Typically, we would want to hold something like 75 days, in that range. But I think that contemplates, hey, like a very consistent, you can predict the mix super well kind of business. So I think it probably -- days continues to float down a little bit, but we're going to be cautious on not trying to outsmart ourselves and cut inventory and get the mix wrong and then not be able to respond to any upsides or any sort of new bookings to start flowing in. As far as sort of channel shifting, I mean basically what we've been trying to do, Krish, without like targeting a specific days or inventory level, we're trying to ship in less than shipping out, and for the first time last quarter in September, we saw ship out actually from the distributors start to move up relative to the June quarter. One data point is not quite a trend, so we're going to keep an eye on that. So I think what you'll probably see from us over the next kind of couple of quarters, they just continue to sort of be cautious on what we're shipping in the channel. Until we have really a nice trend behind us that we can kind of get back to normal as far as channel operations. So I hope that helps Krish.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Quinn Bolton of Needham.\nNicolas Doyle: This is Nick Doyle on for Quinn. Congrats again also for the performance in what we're seeing is a weak IoT environment. Can you talk a little bit more about why you think the rising PC demand is a solid indicator of the Enterprise recovery? I'm just -- is demand coming from the same Enterprise customers that typically buy your docking stations and audio products? I guess I'm just trying to make sure it's not more of a consumer-driven recovery.\nMichael Hurlston: Yes. I mean, you've got the right general direction for the answer. We're definitely biased toward corporate spending and corporate buying. So in areas that our Enterprise products ship into the audio headsets, the docking stations, they will typically follow and be relatively well correlated to PC because our PC is really Enterprise focused. We have some mix of consumer in there. And I agree with your thesis. We're a little bit less certain about that particular segment of the market. But because we're so heavily indexed to corporate, our PC business has done pretty well over the last couple of quarters, certainly coming off bottom. And we had expected to start pulling through docking station and headsets. And we -- I think if you remember for those folks that followed us on previous earnings calls, the docking station and headset businesses fell later than PC. So we saw a roll off later. We would expect that now to recover a little bit later as well. So it's not totally inconsistent with prior remarks on the downside. On the upside, we expect to see the same thing. And certainly, Enterprise doesn't move quite as fast as the consumer markets.\nNicolas Doyle: And then yes, we're talking a lot about inventory and gross margins on the call already, but I guess I'll ask it a little bit of a different way. Is there a way to get back to 56%, 58% without the Enterprise recovery -- yes.\nMichael Hurlston: Yes. I mean, maybe I'll take that and have Dean add some color. I think that is a challenge. I mean, we're -- our Enterprise business is obviously our best gross margin business. I think if it doesn't recover, it will be a bit more of a struggle and not that we can't get there. I mean we're making a lot of improvements, as we just outlined a second ago in the Core IoT area to help on the margin line with cost reductions and things like that. But I do think that we are -- the gross margin improvement back to 57% and what have you is very dependent on the Enterprise business.\nDean Butler: Yes. Nick, I would just reiterate what Michael said. It does depend on Enterprise getting all the way back to normal. If Enterprise were not, you'd probably fall just a little bit shy of that target, but you would need Enterprise to recover from this inventory and get back to its normal level to get up to target or any chances of moving back beyond that, like you said.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo.\nGary Mobley: I hope your employees in Israel are safe and stay safe. Knowing that you have such a large employee base, I think, primarily from the DSP Group acquisition. I wanted to ask about how many have been called to military duty? And given those circumstances, how you're managing those day-to-day operations and as well road maps that come out of that region?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, Gary, thanks for the question. And obviously, I appreciate the sentiment. We've had slightly less than 10% of our employees called into service. Some of those that have been called actually are able to multitask a bit. They're doing backline jobs, meaning intelligence and some other sort of back-of-the-front-lines type of activity. So they're able to perform as mostly as usual. That being said, obviously, there's really some important projects that are going through our Israel team, and we're trying to backfill those with engineers across the globe. And I think right now, as it stands, we have a good plan for that, and we can keep most of our key projects very much on schedule.\nGary Mobley: Appreciate that, Michael. As my follow-up, I wanted to ask about some of the inflationary pressures or lack of in your supply chain. I appreciate the fact that mix is presenting a gross margin headwind, but presumably as well, some higher cost inventory flowing through the P&L statement. But as you think about the pricing terms that you're getting from current design wins as they're happening today. How does that match up with the trends and foundry quotes that you're seeing from your foundry partners as well. Is that does that fit into your goal at 57% gross margin?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, Gary. I mean, we're, if, our cost, I'd say, on balance, are going down modestly. So in general, we're seeing relatively good cooperation from our foundry partners, not significantly, but modestly, we're seeing decreases. And we're certainly working as well with our OSAT suppliers, our operations team is figuring out different strategies in the back end on packaging and test to take cost out of the business. And they've actually done a pretty remarkable job. I mean, there's no secret that foundry prices have been tough to move, and our biggest cost is wafers, but we have seen, I'd say, modest decreases in the supply chain. The question that keeps coming up over and over again on the pricing pressure, I mean, it's there. It's there to a certain extent, but that's why we've kind of come off the 60%, 61% gross margin and move that target down to 57%. I think that contemplates a modest level of pricing pressure that Dean talked about and also what we're seeing in the supply chain, which, again, is some help, but I wouldn't call it. We're not doing jumping jacks yet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Dean and Mike, I just wanted -- I'm trying to map the new segments with what you had before. And really just trying to understand how much of the Enterprise business or what's the mix of the Enterprise business that still is in that sort of challenged inventory, not bottomed out yet? I'm assuming the part of the consumer PCs, where is that now? Is that part of Core IoT? Or where did that go?\nDean Butler: Yes, Ambrish, let me just first make a statement we're not intending to sort of slice and dice our new buckets and quantify every piece. That being said, our former PC bucket that we had historically reported is 100% in the Enterprise & Automotive bucket today. Our historical PC business that we formally -- was called out, it was largely focused on Enterprise laptops. I mean we certainly had consumer exposure in there as well, but the majority of that, significantly more than 50% is Enterprise focused. So for simplicity, that's fully captured in our Enterprise buckets. And just sort of give you like a first order, PC -- you can take the historical PC number and just sort of compare it to our new Enterprise & Automotive bucket. So that PC makes up, kind of do a first order 1/3 of the bucket and 2/3 being the balance of Enterprise-related devices and/or the Automotive-related devices. So if that helps you map a little bit, Ambrish.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Yes, that does, that does. Okay, got it. Got it. So then the -- and just back to the comments on stabilization from the peak to trough, if this is indeed the trough, seems like it is. I think our, you saw it earlier than everybody else. I think you're off by 50%. And I'm just trying to understand what other metrics that you look at, and we've all been through so many cycles. They are never the same, and yet there are few metrics that are the same. So in terms of the rate of cancellations, bookings, what can you provide to kind of support that view that we indeed are at the bottom here?\nDean Butler: Yes. Let me just outline some of the things that we look at from a quantitative standpoint. Certainly, there's a lot of qualitative customer conversations, design activity expected to go into ramp, et cetera. But from a quantitative standpoint, generally, we are looking at things like booking rates, hey, if booking rates accelerated, slowed, you will look at book-to-bill sort of ratios. What we noticed is that actually bottomed few quarters back. We look at cancellation rates and push-out requests on already booked backlog. What we've noticed over the last actually several quarters, that has significantly slowed. In fact, it's very little now. It's actually almost back to sort of a normal rate. There's always some amount of noise in the system on people rescheduling their backlog, et cetera, it's a normal course of business. But what we've seen over probably the last 2 to 3 quarters is like the peak volume from these second-order metrics started to slow down in their magnitude. We saw a peak order as people try to cancel and reschedule and as you know, when we talked about it back in our May call, we started allowing people actually to reschedule on what it is that they needed to do. We also work with channel partners to do the same. So on balance, each quarter, we've seen that amplitude go way, way down and to the point where it's getting close to being sort of normal course of business. We do see this level as certainly sustainable. In fact, if anything, we're probably biased up to biased down as we look into '24. And I think, hey, credit to the business teams and sales teams here at Synaptics on trying to make a call early on where the direction of inventory and forecasts are going. And I think the internal team did a pretty good job.\nOperator: Next question comes from of Martin Yang from Opp Co.\nMartin Yang: The question on the module partners you developed. Can you maybe talk about -- that partner help you to address any new segment's geography or customer base? And do you see more of those new partnership developing in the medium term?\nMichael Hurlston: Yes, Martin, thanks for the question. The module partners are important for us because as we try to move into this broad market strategy that we outlined in the Investor Day, this is a really good first step. The customers that they can serve are not customers that we would be able to enable. So our business, like many of the semiconductor business is built around big customers, customers that we all know and understand the nameplates of, but there's a huge market there that are these smaller customers that we simply can't service with our application engineers. So this particular module partner is really going after a bunch of customers that we couldn't service. There are applications in there like tags and inventory trackers and things like that, that these guys are getting into that are not things that we would normally do. But I think the more important issue is the customers that they serve versus customers we would serve. And so we would expect this particular module guy, like our first module partner to become a very, very meaningful component of our wireless business simply because they can serve a very, very broad array of customers that we wouldn't otherwise touch.\nMartin Yang: So is it right to assume the impact on your business once the market recoveries in earnest, and this new module partner maybe serve or impact our business similar to getting to a new distributor?\nMichael Hurlston: It's almost like that, Martin. Yes. It's pretty significant. I mean the customer touch, and we've we obviously are monitoring who they're talking to, and they report that out. I mean the number of customers they're talking to are in the hundreds and we would talk to 10. So it's a really multiplicative effect. And yes, ultimately, we would expect to see business on the level of a distributor because they act like that. They're obviously very technical. They have a tremendous amount of software support that goes with it. It's very focused on wireless modules, in our case, a combo module, but they're really, really specialists in taking the product, doing the work on it to modularize it and then reselling it. But on a magnitude basis, yes, it's like a distributor.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn it back to Michael Hurlston for closing remarks.\nMichael Hurlston: I'd like to thank all of you for joining us today. We certainly look forward to speaking to you at our upcoming investor conferences during the quarter. Thanks, and have a good day.\nOperator: This now concludes the conference. You may now disconnect."
