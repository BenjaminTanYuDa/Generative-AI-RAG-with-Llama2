And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Magnuson: Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another strong fourth quarter, generating $131 million in revenue, up 33% versus the prior year and 6% compared to the prior quarter, again demonstrating the high ROI and long-term value of the Braze Customer Engagement Platform. Our solid performance comes despite a selling environment that has remained challenging all year due to macro considerations and its associated scrutiny on budgets. We have continued advancing our strategy and evolving our execution in order to simultaneously deliver strong revenue growth and enhanced operating efficiency, improving non-GAAP gross margins by 90 basis points year-over-year and non-GAAP operating margin by over 1,100 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of last year. We were again pleased with the strength of our enterprise business, as we continue to capitalize on the legacy vendor replacement cycle and consolidation trend. And we achieved record upsell this quarter, as customers continue to grow with Braze adopting more channels, deploying more use cases, increasing their volumes, and adding new business units and geographies. In fact, this quarter, we secured our first eight-figure customers through upsell with the media and entertainment conglomerate, who has consistently grown with Braze over the past eight years. Continued expansion opportunities like these with our long-term customers speaks to our pace of innovation, stability and reliability at scale and our leadership of the customer engagement category. As enterprise remains a strength for us, our roster of $500,000 plus ARR customers continues to grow as well, rising to 202 in the quarter, up 29% year-over-year, a testament to how customers continue to leverage rich first-party data and advanced artificial intelligence to drive sophisticated cross-channel customer engagement at scale. Notable new business wins and upsells in the quarter include AB InBev, Bojangles, DraftKings, FanDuel, Flix SE, which is the parent company of both FlixBus and Greyhound, and Nestle Purina among many others. We're also pleased to share that earlier in fiscal year 2024, we secured new relationships with both DoorDash and Wendy's. The performance, reliability and scalability of our platform is a core component of what many of these brands appreciate about Braze. Earlier this week, we published scalability and performance metrics for our full calendar year 2023, which included over 2.6 trillion outgoing actions, including the sending of messages execution of webhooks and other campus operations that transform data and manage audiences. Inbound, we processed over 7.5 trillion API calls with a 99.99% average system-wide uptime across all customers and products. Whether those API calls originate from our SDKs running in our customers' products, partner integrations or custom software running in our customers' back-ends, these API calls deliver constantly evolving context about users and their actions in order to trigger messages and drive personalization strategies, showcasing the growing sophistication among Braze customers as they tailor the communications to each individual recipients. During 2023, we also saw year-over-year growth of over 60% from messages sent with Braze Canvas, our no-code visual development environment, which marketers used to quickly implement sophisticated customer engagement strategies. This increase in usage reflects a rise in multi-step cross-channel messaging flows and the continued adoption of sophisticated orchestration, experimentation, and personalization techniques, all supported by Sage AI. Designed from the ground up to scale with demand, support massive scale at speed, and minimize outages, our system is exceptionally reliable even when faced with some of the world's largest consumer audiences. All of these metrics build on our privacy and security by design, which integrates safeguards at every level of our operation and is reflected in our privacy processes and security certifications. As the customer engagement landscape evolves, we continue to win against a large field of competitors, who cannot reliably deliver on real-time use cases, have limited channel selection or flexibility, a lower sophistication ceiling, or simply don't scale. Similarly, we continue to make progress replacing legacy marketing clouds as marketers realize that those clouds disjointed and siloed solutions are increasingly unsuited for modern customer engagement use cases. This quarter we replaced legacy marketing clouds at a European-based transportation company, a leading American health non-profit, a UK-based QSR, and a Japan-based digital software developer among others. In addition, this quarter we replaced point solution competitors at a design and collaboration platform, an athletics clothing retailer and a mobile gaming company. As I mentioned last quarter, we've been very happy with the execution of our sales team in the second half as we continue to navigate a choppy macro. And our competitive wins across verticals and geographies demonstrate both the flexibility and versatility of our platform as well as the enormous future potential of our business. Braze has the right to compete and win with virtually any organization that has ambition or sophistication around customer engagement. If your organization has a person whose job is customer engagement, we believe Braze is the best-in-class solution for them. In order to maintain our technical lead, we continue to invest in improving the capabilities of the Braze platform. With the wealth of data captured by Braze and the introduction of AI-powered tools, marketers are able to enhance relevance and performance, while saving time and energy in production. In order to meet the demands of this paradigm shift, we're infusing AI throughout our stack to help marketers efficiently implement highly personalized cross-channel strategies. Last year we launched Sage AI by Braze to inform and scale personalized sophisticated and lasting experiences that consumers love. At that time, we spoke to you about some of the exciting enhancements under development that further empower brands to embrace the craft of customer engagement, allowing them to move beyond simply sending messages. Just yesterday, we announced new features that simplify and accelerate the ability of marketers to tailor recommendations to each unique customer further unlocking sophisticated personalization and prediction at scale, inspiring creativity, and driving high-value actions from customers. At the same time, each feature is easily accessible and located intuitively across the marketers' workflow to support more creative testing, optimization, and personalization. These innovations include AI item recommendations, personalized path, tone control and estimated real open e-mail rates. All of these features leverage comprehensive first-party data inputs in real time, allowing for smarter decision-making and powering better business outcomes. Let me take a moment to walk through each of these offerings. Last fall, I mentioned the development of AI item recommendations. Today, I'm pleased to announce that this engine, which uses AI to enhance message relevance with better product, service and catalog recommendations, is now generally available. AI item recommendations leverages cutting-edge, transformer-driven AI models and is layered on top of Braze catalogs to enable easier setup and tighter integration with the rest of the Braze Stack. Accordingly, these recommendations can be used across every channel that Braze offers and as part of sophisticated cross-channel journeys in Canvas. We believe AI item recommendations will increase campaign revenue and improve customer loyalty for the brands that deploy it. I'm also pleased to announce the release of Personalized Paths, an automated decision-making feature within Canvas that scales personalization by matching each customer with the message copy creative channel and offer that they are most likely to engage with. It can be incorporated at any point in the Canvas journey and used across any channel, allowing it to be combined with sophisticated personalization and orchestration techniques. Personalized Paths enable marketers to leverage AI to deliver more value to their customers through deeply customized experiences, while also saving time for them, and their colleagues and engineering, even as they delve into more sophisticated experimentation. In addition to the work we're doing using our own custom models, we also continue to deliver productivity enhancements that utilize prompt engineering and fine-tuning of publicly available models like OpenAI's GPT-4. Recall that we integrated ChatGPT and DALL-E into Braze in May and December of 2022, respectively, before the AI hype of early 2023. And it's been exciting to see how customers have used and experimented with these features. We believe there is even more potential for marketing teams to quickly generate and validate creative assets to support more effective campaign creation and testing while maintaining brand voice and safety. Now we have built-in generative functionality, we call tone control, which helps marketers dictate and control the tone of AI-generated copy directly in Braze. This can save marketers time, help them craft more authentic experiences, foster additional creativity, quickly generate variants for testing and experimentation, and help eliminate mistakes. Finally, I'd like to highlight our estimated real open rates feature, another use of machine learning that allows Braze customers to continue to rely on data-driven content strategies even as changes in the privacy landscape obscure certain data inputs. This solution addresses the changes made by Apple's Mail Privacy Protection program, offering marketers a more complete view of open rates for email campaigns by controlling for the uncertainty created by Mail Privacy Protection's Machine Opens. One early AI customer success story that I'd like to highlight is from KoRo Drogerie, a German superfood e-commerce company, which tested our new AI item recommendation offering to help determine what products to offer to which customers and drive purchase decisions. KoRo syncs their product catalog into Braze in real-time with Braze's cloud data ingestion feature and can then intelligently suggest product offerings tailored to individual customer preferences. By combining the simplicity of Braze's cloud data ingestion with the power of AI item recommendation, KoRo gained valuable insights into new user behaviors, empowering them to deliver highly personalized recommendations from their extensive catalog of over 1,000 products. In addition, they drove these improved results with significantly less effort, automating everything from the data warehouse to the personalized recommendations seen by customers. Most importantly, KoRo tripled their purchase rates when these personalized product suggestions were incorporated into their onboarding messaging flows. Our pace of innovation and ease of use also continue to earn industry accolades for our excellence in software products. Recently, G2, the largest and most trusted marketplace for software, recognized Braze across six categories in its annual best software awards, including the categories Best Software Products, Global Software Companies, Highest Satisfaction Products, Marketing and Digital Advertising Products, Products for Enterprise, and Products for Mid-Market. Our solutions' inclusion in the G2 Best Software Awards is a testament of the strength and loyalty of our customer community and our ability to deliver high ROI solutions that our customers need to power outstanding customer engagement for their users. Before I turn it over to Isabel, I want to update you on our latest social impact initiatives. In 2021, Braze joined the Pledge 1% movement, through which we have reserved nearly a million shares of our Class A common stock to donate to a donor advice fund. Thus far, Braze has surpassed more than $1 million in grants via our Braze for Social Impact Fund, of which more than half have been directed by employee grant programs. Our Social Impact mission is to amplify employee impact, to create opportunities for underserved groups within our communities, and to accelerate science-based climate solutions. We look forward to growing these efforts through continued employee advocacy and participation over time. Thank you for your continued support at Braze. We are very excited for the year ahead. Our strategy of driving innovation to create industry-leading solutions remains unchanged, and we believe our investments in new product growth channels and advanced AI and machine learning, coupled with strong secular customer engagement tailwinds, will keep Braze on the path to becoming the industry standard for cross-channel customer engagement. And now, I'll turn the call over to Isabel.\nIsabelle Winkles: Thank you, Bill, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Bill stated, we reported a strong fourth quarter with revenue increasing 33% year-over-year to $131 million, driven by a combination of existing customer contract expansions, renewals, and new business. The quarter included a contribution of slightly more than $3 million in revenue from the North Star acquisition, which closed in June. Subscription revenue remains the primary component of our total top-line contributing 96% of our fourth-quarter revenue, while the remaining 4% represents a combination of recurring professional services and one-time configuration and onboarding fees. Total customer count increased 15% year-over-year to 2,044 customers as of January 31, up 274 from the same period last year and up 33 from the prior quarter. Our total number of large customers, which we define as those spending at least $500,000 annually grew 29% year-over-year to 202 and as of January 31, contributed 60% to our total ARR. This compares to a 57% contribution as of the same quarter last year. Measured across all customers, dollar-based net retention was 117%, while dollar-based net retention for our large customers was 120%. Expansion was again broadly distributed across industries and geographic regions. Revenue outside the US contributed 44% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter compared to 43% in the prior year quarter and in line with the third quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter, our total remaining performance obligation was $639 million, up 40% year-over-year and up 14% sequentially. Current RPO was $409 million, up 31% year-over-year and up 11% sequentially. The year-over-year increases were driven by contract renewals and upsells and the signing of new customer contracts. Overall, dollar-weighted contract length is slightly above two years and increased modestly during the quarter as more customers committed to longer-term relationships with Braze. Non-GAAP gross profit in the quarter was $88.9 million, representing a non-GAAP gross margin of 67.9%. This compares to a non-GAAP gross profit of $66.2 million and non-GAAP gross margin of 67% in the fourth quarter of last year. The 90 basis point year-over-year margin improvement was driven by ongoing personnel efficiencies and the continued cost optimization of our technology stack, partially offset by increased adoption of premium message channels. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $55.2 million or 42% of revenue compared to $46.5 million or 47% of revenue in the prior year quarter. While the dollar increase reflects our year-over-year investments in head count costs to support our ongoing growth and global expansion, the improved efficiency reflects our disciplined investment approach to resource deployment across our go-to-market organization. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $21.2 million or 16% of revenue compared to $19 million or 19% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The dollar increase was primarily driven by increased head count costs to support the expansion of our existing offerings as well as to develop new products and features to drive growth. Non-GAAP G&A expense was $20 million or 15% of revenue compared to $17.5 million or 18% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The dollar increase was driven by investments to support our overall company growth, including head count costs and increases in software subscriptions and licenses. Non-GAAP operating loss was $7.5 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $16.7 million in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Braze's shareholders in the quarter was $3.5 million or a loss of $0.04 per share compared to a loss of $13.7 million or a loss of $0.14 per share in the prior year quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with $480 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash provided by operations during the quarter was $3.8 million compared to $12,000 in the prior year quarter. Including the cash impact of capitalized costs, free cash flow was approximately negative $3.5 million compared to negative free cash flow of $1.9 million in the prior year quarter. As we have stated before, we expect our free cash flow to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter given the timing of customer and vendor payments. And now turning to our forecast. We continue to see solid interest in high-quality customer engagement solutions, particularly from existing customers. While macroeconomic headwinds persist, and we continue to face constrained marketing budgets and slower new business growth, levels of volatility and uncertainty have declined as we, our customers and our prospects have learned to better navigate this environment. As always, we approach our guidance with a prudent and risk-adjusted methodology, and assume current macroeconomic conditions persist over the forecast horizon. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $131 million to $132 million, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 29% at the midpoint. While we have not traditionally guided to gross margin beyond our long-term range of 67% to 72%, as I just noted, we have seen increased adoption of premium messaging channels, including WhatsApp, which will likely result in a first quarter non-GAAP gross margin that is at the low end of our long-term range. For the full year, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be within our long-term range with sequentially improving gross margins throughout the year. First quarter non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $13 million to $14 million. At the midpoint, this implies an operating margin of approximately negative 10%. First quarter non-GAAP net loss is expected to be $10 million to $11 million and first quarter non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.10 to $0.11 per share based on approximately 99.5 million weighted average basic shares outstanding during the period. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 21.5% at the midpoint. Fiscal year 2025 non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $20 million to $24 million. At the midpoint, this implies a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately negative 4% or a 450 basis point improvement versus fiscal year 2024. Non-GAAP net loss for the same period is expected to be in the range of $8 million to $12 million. For fiscal year 2025, non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be $0.08 to $0.12 per share based on a full year weighted average basic share count of approximately 101 million shares. We remain on track to achieve positive quarterly non-GAAP operating income and positive free cash flow by Q4 of this fiscal year. I'll close by reiterating our excitement and Braze's future. We remain focused on partnering with our customers to deliver best-in-class customer engagement solutions and driving product innovation while consistently executing against our financial targets. We remain confident in our ability to grow revenue while maintaining cost discipline and delivering on the financial targets that we have set for fiscal 2025. And with that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Your line is open. Feel free to unmute.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you guys and congrats on the strong end of the year. Some exciting capabilities from an AI perspective. Bill, I was curious if you could just touch a little bit on what prep work if any customers might need to do before they can leverage some of these AI capabilities that you've introduced from Sage. Like what needs to be done from a governance and data prep perspective? And it might vary by product. I'm just curious how long that might take and what you're doing to help your customers grow?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. Thanks for the question. So we're continuing to invest in AI across the entire product surface area. And I hope that the four recent releases that I highlighted earlier helped to demonstrate that. You're seeing a mix of machine learning techniques, multiple ways of using Gen AI, and it's being integrated throughout our stack. And so as you alluded to, it definitely depends on the future, but we continue to work in a couple of different categories. The first one, and I mentioned this before, is that copilot vision where we want using AI and Braze to make it feel less like you're using a tool and more like you're working with a whole team of specialist consultants to help you tackle your customer engagement challenges. And those are things like tone control that I mentioned earlier as well as some of the helpers that we have to help people write code or scripting in some of the more technical parts of the product. And just generally, the Gen AI integrations, those all just work immediately out of the box, no setup from the customer. And the entire purpose of them is to improve marketer productivity and allow for them to operate in a quicker manner with more agility and be able to take advantage of more of our products. Something like the AI recommendations that I mentioned, that does require a bit more setup. But as you heard in the customer example that I shared in the prepared remarks, we've done a lot of work to be able to improve the time to value there and streamline that setup. So in that example, it actually builds on top of two separate products, both of which we independently monetize. So our product catalogs feature is used for a variety of different content capabilities within Canvas. And then the item recommendations capability, which uses transformers to be able to provide even better recommendations and more content personalization sits on top of that. And those product catalogs can actually be built up through our cloud data injection capability, which means that the marketer with simple configuration can be automatically loading in all of the content from the product catalog directly out of a data warehouse like Snowflake, bringing that into Braze and then the item recommendations are similarly just clicks and simple configuration within Braze to then pull that into the content of any message channel. And so it is a place where they need to have their product catalog data clean, but many customers already have that. And the ability to interconnect that have something like cloud data ingestion, be able to automatically run all of the ETLs with no operational burden by the customer and then have item recommendations sit on top of that and be available in every single channel. I think it's just a great example where -- that is something which has a lot of moving parts to it, but because of the way that we vertically integrated the capabilities in the Braze stack, we are taking on the burden of managing the vast majority of those moving parts. And we are, therefore, elevating the job of the marketer up to that of connecting their business strategy to the customer journey and making sure that they are orchestrating and prioritizing their own goals in a way that's going to drive relevance for the customer and create value for their business.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. That's super helpful. And one, if I can, just on the demand environment as you see it. I think you called out a host of customer wins in the fourth quarter, some were traditional enterprise, some were more digital narratives. Can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing demand differences, if any, between those two groups and as you think about this year and go-to-market allocations, is there any between those two? Is there any one where you might lean heavier or might see stronger demand relative to the other?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So I think that we're seeing similar trends that you're hearing about elsewhere, which is that there's relative strength in the enterprise as compared to the commercial segment. I think that we're seeing relatively similar demand environments globally when we look out from geography to geography. And similarly, relatively similar across verticals. So most of the -- most of the differentiation that we see tends to be correlated with company size. That is certainly going to play into our go-to-market investment strategy, but a lot of that resourcing -- those resourcing decisions were already made earlier this year when we had declining sales capacity over last year. We are now, for the first time in over 12 months, increasing our sales capacity and hiring new people into that team. We're doing that broadly across different categories and in different geographies where we are able to -- where we're seeing opportunities to meet incremental demand, but that's coming off of a baseline where we did reorient those go-to-market resources across the commercial and enterprise segments last year to be able to match what we continue to see persisting, which is relative strength in the enterprise versus the SMB. So when you sum all that up, we are seeing participation rates increasing in our sales team. I mentioned that we've been very happy with the execution of the sales team, in particular, in the second half of the year. And that is why we are at the point now where we are investing and adding additional sales capacity for the first time in over a year, and we're excited about that.\nArjun Bhatia: Awesome. I appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from D.J. Hynes from Canaccord. Please unmute your audio and ask your question.\nDavid Hynes: Hey, thanks guys, and I'll echo Arjun's congrats on the quarter. Bill, maybe one for you. So, look, obviously, you spoke to taking share from Legacy Marketing Clouds, but we're seeing a lot of AI innovation from the platform firms, right? I mean Salesforce spoke to data cloud revenue largely being attributable to their Marketing Cloud. Are you seeing any signs that the velocity of replatforming opportunities is slowing at all as customers maybe contemplate like, hey, I'll stick with Adobe or Salesforce whoever for a little bit longer to see if AI can make a difference or is there any discernible change just as those firms continue to kind of tout the story around AI?\nBill Magnuson: No, I don't think that we're seeing much of a change there. That story of, hey, hold on, there's one more thing coming in a little while. Right now, the new flavor of the month for them is Gen AI, but we've seen that as an incumbent advantage that works against that transition from the legacy tools into a place like Braze for years now. And so it doesn't -- over the long term, it doesn't really feel materially different. And I think the Legacy Marketing Clouds even as they're working to put in place some of these Gen AI features that are either going to help with marketing marketer productivity or some of the work that Salesforce has been doing, they were still fundamentally built in a world where they assumed they were in control of the customer journey, the touch points with the customer, we're relatively linear. They didn't demand the same level of real-time or interactivity. They were single threaded. It's built into the foundations of how they process data, how they make sense of it, how they dispatch messaging. And you continue to see that those things that are in their foundations, they can't fix without their own replatforming. So even as they continue to try to make acquisitions and yet more things together, if anything, I think that it continues to work against them as it increases the amount of complexity that they have. And the way that they were originally architected may have been appropriate for the pre-mobile world, where most e-mail was read on your desktop at work. But modern consumers are always on, they interact with brands on their terms. They're on nonlinear customer journeys. They have an ever-expanding collection of mediums and channels that they want to be communicated with and that they want to use when they're accessing your products and services. And I think it's really important to grapple with that fundamental reality and the foundation of your product. We've embraced the fact that we're a companion to the customer journey. We carefully listen across all the touch points. We're working to deeply understand the customer and the context that surrounds them. And then we're leveraging that understanding to help shape the outcomes to achieve the brand's goals. And those goals are -- I spoke about this a little bit a little bit ago that we want the marketers to be able to have complexity controlled for them to the extent possible so that they can be operating at a more strategic level. They can be really connecting themselves to what the customer's journey looks like and feels like so that they can take their own brand, their own company's goals and attach those to the customer journey and be able to shape it in a way that's more positive for them, whether that's incentivizing advocacy, avoiding churn, it's helping build loyalty or drive purchases or even just educating their customer and making sure they know there's a steady hand alongside them during their products and service journey. These are all use cases that Braze fulfills and the modern customer engagement environment, they all demand that these foundations are able to be event-driven in real time that they can accommodate the nonlinear customer journey and really engage with them on their terms as a companion.\nDavid Hynes: Yes, makes a ton of sense. That's helpful color. Isabelle, maybe I could follow up one on the numbers for you. So like very rough math, this year, half of your growth came from the installed base half from net new, right? You had 33% growth, 117% NRR. As we look to fiscal '25, like how does that growth matrix feel to you as you contemplate what's in the guide? Like how much from net new, how much from the base?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So we still generally try to keep that sort of 50-50. And actually, we're always sort of trying to index on more than 50% coming from the net new. And so when I talk about that dollar-based net retention not yet having hit the bottom. Some of that is by virtue of trying to index a little bit more to that net new. So I don't actually think we've fully hit the bottom on that number just in case I get that question. And so that's how we think of the mix is trying to continue to index a little bit more towards the net new.\nDavid Hynes: Perfect. Thank you guys\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. Please unmute and ask your question.\nRyan MacWilliams: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. For Bill, I know a lot of the focus is on the largest customers from the Legacy Marketing Clouds. But have you noticed any changes in the competitive environment for -- against your private customer engagement competitors? Like have you seen more wins from those competitors? And I only ask because it may be harder for them to invest in some of these new AI capabilities and features that you guys are coming out with. Thanks.\nBill Magnuson: Yes. I mean I think we continue to broadly experience our competition in the two major segmentations that I spoke about before with Legacy Marketing Clouds at the high end of the market and the collection of start-ups that vary by vertical or geography in the mid-market and low end. We continue to only see sporadic competition from the start-up set in the enterprise. And most of the start-up competitors, I think, are also operating below our pricing floor, which remains in the 20,000 to 30,000 range. When I think about the R&D burden that's been placed on the private startups, in particular, especially those that haven't been hiring for quite a while as they've been trying to get themselves IPO ready. It's definitely a parent that product velocity for many of them has slowed down. And I think that -- I think that's fair to say it's not just the AI and machine learning features that are difficult for them to build, keeping up with the continued advance of channels and the adoption that marketers want to make as there are new opportunities and new ways to be communicating with customers, keeping up on the rapidly changing data science universe and the kind of data warehousing universe as well. There's a lot required in order to keep up with the space right now. And I think it is something that product velocity and the agility of the R&D teams is going to be really important as we continue to build down the stretch here.\nRyan MacWilliams: Appreciate the color there. And then for Isabelle, Braze historically has been prudent with your initial revenue guidance for the year. Just to double click on that, is there any change to the guidance philosophy this year? And are we largely through like the COVID era renewals of some customers that were maybe more optimistic in their growth projections two years ago or maybe is there still some of that left to start 2024? Thanks.\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. Thanks for the question. So first on the overall guide. So look, the macro continues to be challenging. It's not deteriorating, but it's certainly not improving. We're still seeing customers exhibit overall price sensitivity. They're buying, as we've said over the last couple of quarters, continuing to buy for their known needs rather than growth. And that said, we've actually learned to kind of adapt to this environment and some of our customers and prospects. So we do expect a little bit less volatility in our results versus last year. So we haven't really changed our guidance philosophy, but I would say the environment and the context around us has to be considered. So we'll continue to take that risk-adjusted approach, but we feel good about the guidance that we've set forth for the year. And sorry, your follow-up question on that?\nRyan MacWilliams: And just like some renewal from two years ago.\nIsabelle Winkles: The COVID. Yeah, so it's not so much the COVID piece specifically, but there was sort of the follow-up dynamic where customers were just generally exhibiting a desire to sort of buy for the current environment. And so even in upsells and that manifests itself in the dollar-based net retention as well, the upsells are really priced or sized more for what they need in the immediate term as opposed to buying for growth. So it's not so much. There is still a bit of the prior contracts that are working themselves out. We're through a lot of that. But the dynamic itself continues only because the upsell pieces are also now representative of buying for what they need as opposed to buying for future growth.\nRyan MacWilliams: That makes sense. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gabriela Borges from Goldman Sachs. Please unmute and ask your question.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon and thank you. Bill, I remember recently, I think it was maybe a year or two ago, when you unbundled e-mail. And that was the catalyst for helping with the legacy displacements. I'm curious when you hear from your sales team today, what are the -- what are the factors that are within your control that allow you to maybe pull the lever a little bit more on some of the legacy replacements. What are the sticking points which are still within your control that you could maybe push a little harder on? Thanks.\nBill Magnuson: Yes. Great question. I think that one of the major ones that has kept a lot of people in legacy players is also the services ecosystem, which is worth talking about a little bit. One of the things we've been talking about the last few quarters is just how pleased we are with our success across the global systems integrators and the large major marketing agency holding companies. And we continue to really build out the Braze enabled services ecosystem around the world and in all different kind of levels for customers. And so one of the things that definitely has gotten in the way of some of those migrations in the past has been the heavy lift of moving from a platform that you've maybe been on for five or 10 years as well as the requirement to move into what is ultimately a new paradigm in a new way of modeling your data, a new way of thinking about how you instrument and how you measure performance and such as you move into Braze. And so I think that a key component of that, especially for some of the -- some aspects of the early majority, definitely when you get into the late majority of those transitions that pairing that up with services ecosystem has been really important. And I think that we're continuing to see the tide shift away from that being a large legacy marketing cloud incumbent advantage to one where -- there's a lot of eagerness to get involved in the new wave that Braze is really representing as we're growing into the enterprise. From a product perspective, we've always had a portion of our R&D dedicated to enterprise-specific features and capabilities. Some of these things around approvals, workflows and compliance and security as well as just data management and governance and things like that. And you're continuing to see our road map accommodate those. We did build out more approvals, workflow capabilities through the back half of last year. We've obviously continuously been improving our own data governance capability, things like cloud data ingestion that I mentioned earlier are definitely more InfoSec friendly in various ways because it allows for the customer to keep a lot of their data in their data warehouse. And so those are all things that are certainly supportive of smoothing the path to be able to get those enterprise transformations going and they all work together, I think, in our favor, and that's why we -- that's a big part of why we're seeing acceleration.\nGabriela Borges: That all makes sense. Thanks and the follow-up is on the SMB ecosystem. And in particular, you made a couple of comments last quarter on the technology-backed ecosystem. So my question here is, do you think that there is a scenario where we see mean reversion over the course of the year up. And then maybe for Isabelle, how do we think about the implications for that on new logo growth? Is there a scenario where we could see more of an improvement over the course of the year?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So on the new logo growth, one of the things that you're seeing and the dynamic of the logo growth this quarter is it's not -- we had -- we were very successful in our upsell motion in Q4. And when you do an upsell, you can absolutely do upsells where there's new contracts that are being signed with an existing parent company. So because of the way we define the customer count, what you're missing is sort of the number of net new order forms that are actually being printed. And actually, when I've looked over time at the number of order forms that have been printed or signed within a quarter, there was no material deterioration in Q4 at all. So I think what we're seeing in terms of like the logo count right now is really just a bit of a shift towards upsell versus net new. I think on the SMB piece, there is still good momentum with new SMB. What you're seeing, though, is also one, the fact that a lot of this is happening in at the ultimate parent level, so you're not seeing the net new, but also with the SMB, we're still seeing levels of logo churn that are working against us. Now these are much smaller accounts, which is why you're seeing the dollar-based net retention continue to hold up. But there is logo churn that we're working against as well.\nGabriela Borges: That's super color. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan. Please unmute your audio and ask your question.\nPinjalim Bora: Great. Thank you so much. A couple of questions for Isabelle. Can you talk about the investments going into fiscal '25? I think Bill said, talked about sales capacity, is that 100% of the incremental investments or is there anything else that the incremental dollar is going towards? And then a follow-up on NDR. It sounds like it has not bottomed at this point. Where do you expect the NDR to bottom? I mean if I look at the guidance of 21% and if you kind of maintain that 50-50 between expansions and new logo, could NDR continue to go towards low double digit? Is that what is baked into the guidance at this point?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. I'll take the NDR question first. So I've said pretty consistently that I think there's -- I use the term historically more air to come out of the balloon. What -- we're very pleased with the results that happened in Q4 and what you saw was actually moderation in the reduction in that number sequentially. So historically, over the last couple of quarters, it's dropped about 2% sequentially this quarter, it dropped 1% sequentially. So I think there are definitely fact patterns that are working in our favor to help that stabilize, but I'm not calling the bottom on this. We don't guide on it. And I do think in the context of the scenario for guidance, I would assume that, that number continues to tick down.\nBill Magnuson: And then with respect to overall investment in the year, we're broadly investing in R&D right now. We're investing in marketing and across go-to-market as well as in building sales capacity, and we're excited to be doing that where we see a lot of great opportunities for continued revenue growth as we build out and monetize new products. You may have seen our rebrand that we launched a little bit earlier this year. We've been really excited to be doing some of our first major out-of-home that we've ever done before in order to help build awareness and visibility for the new brand in particular, and we're excited about the work that, that's been doing as we've been attending more events around the world. And so there's a lot happening at the kind of the top and the middle of the funnel as well in addition to building sales capacity and continuing to invest in R&D. You may have also seen that our international expansion has continued. So we've opened new locations in Bucharest in Romania or Bucharest, Romania and Sao Paulo in Brazil as well as in Seoul, in Korea. And we're going to continue to invest in building out our international presence, especially after the successful injection of the NorthStar acquisition last year, which has given us an extremely firm foothold in the ANZ market.\nPinjalim Bora: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Berg at Needham & Company. Please unmute and ask your question.\nScott Berg: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a great quarter. Bill, you mentioned you signed the company's first eight-figure customer in the quarter, mainly through looks like some customer expansions. But what does an eight-figure customer look like to Braze? Is it heavy on one channel? Is it a multichannel type strategy? How should we think about that type of deal?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So it's multiple across a bunch of dimensions. So we're working with multiple business units across multiple geographies. It's across multiple channels and multiple use cases. There's -- when we look at that, customer, in particular, we're helping with -- we're actually helping with a broad first-party investment strategy, where all of those business units are working together. And it's actually really incredible to see as they're able to invest in building up the direct-to-consumer relationship. They monetize it in multiple ways. They help cement the loyalty in ways that are self-reinforcing as those different business units work together. I think that, that's a really incredible testament to how Braze integrates both into the messaging surface as they're communicating with the customers, but also the back end from a data perspective that all of those brands, all of those kind of divisions across the globe are able to work together and provide a coherent experience to the same customer throughout it. And that's also a customer where there's still a lot of opportunity to continue to grow. We think that -- when we look out across even our high seven-figure customers, most of them, we still have great opportunity to continue to expand both into net new channels as well as expand backwards where most of these really big multinationals that are in our global strategic accounts program. We still coexist with the Legacy Marketing Clouds. And if history is any guide, it's only a matter of time before we fully consolidate them out, and that represents yet more upsell opportunity for us even in these customers that are already quite large.\nScott Berg: Got it. Helpful. And then my follow-up question, we were at the Shoptalk conference last week in Las Vegas, which you all had a nice presence at. But one of the key themes at the conference this year was all about personalization through the entire kind of merchant consumer relationship. And obviously, marketing is a big part of that. But the AI bench over the last year, this big wave on Gen AI model seems to be pushing on customer interest for more personalization throughout that life cycle. Do you think you're seeing that in some of your demand and sales cycles out there today that this push a rush for trying to adopt anything with a Gen AI feature has actually been maybe an incremental tailwind over the last 12 to 18 months?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. I think it's been helpful. As I mentioned before when I talked about some of the things that hinder people moving from the legacy clouds, a lot of them are just reasons why people feel that what they're doing today is good enough. And so when something like Gen AI enters the picture, it gives them a strong reason why what they're doing today might not be good enough, especially if they feel that they can't take full advantage of modern machine learning. And I think that when you look at, for instance, any company that has assembled a set of point solutions where they've got half a dozen different channels and maybe three or four different software platforms that are servicing those channels, and you ask them, how do you do a great job of optimizing across those channels? How do you actually deploy more sophisticated orchestration strategies that take into account the nonlinear customer journey? How do you keep all of them synchronized interactively so that when you have that opportunity to personalize a moment that matters for the customer, which by the way shows up out of the blue because we engage with customers engage with brands on their terms now. The simple answer is that when you assemble the collection of point solutions like that, you simply can't leverage machine learning in the same way as you can with a vertically integrated and consolidated platform like Braze. And so there's a lot of examples over the years where additional complexity or new technical capability has come into play, and it's helped us move up the adoption curve and get to people that are maybe more and more reticent to go through the switching cost of moving from what they were doing before to a more modern form of customer engagement. And I think that the advent of Gen AI is a really great example of that. Not only the capabilities that are available to you, but as we've spoken about before as well, there's also aspects of Braze which are technically difficult to use sometimes. And I think that when you're able to when you're able to actually bring to bear Generative AI to, for instance, automatically generate e-mail HTML for someone or to automatically generate liquid syntax for them to be able to do a certain form of conditional content personalization or when you bring in into play things like tone control, and you give them a really powerful experimentation tool and instead of them just kind of staring at a blank canvas and trying to figure out what the other three variants are, we can suggest them, and they can move along more quickly. And so those are all great examples where a lot of the ways of doing ways of doing customer engagement in a more modern way, that's more agile, that's more experimental that relies on more real-time data, which are all things that are in our foundation for much of the marketing world, especially teams that are strapped for resources, it's historically been a little bit harder for them to use those. And so I think that it's both looking at places where Gen AI or things like our transform-driven item recommendations or things like our personalized path capability that are using machine learning and in order to do automated decision-making and automatically optimize, those are all, of course, improving results for people that are already deep in that optimization game. But there's a big part of the market as well that still needs to simply graduate from batch and blast and so to the extent that Gen AI can either motivate them to do so or it can smooth that path by improving your productivity or making the more technical parts of our product more accessible and frankly, less scary, I think all of those things compound together to really help us.\nScott Berg: Got it. Helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Peterson from Raymond James. Please unmute your audio and ask your question.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I think there's been some debate on how spam rules, maybe be impacting the industry. I'm curious how much that's come up in your customer conversations? And how do you think that may kind of stack rate as a potential growth catalyst in terms of new logos in fiscal year '25?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So as I'm sure you're aware, Braze has been in front of these changes from the start. And our customers have actually always been compliant with these rules due to how we operate our deliverability practice. Nevertheless, we published a lot of material on it. We prepared our customers, partners and the broader marketing community with content and webinars. And that was really positive. I think that we navigated the change without any noise or problems. Braze also doesn't pool centers together and each one of our e-mail sending customers is in control of their own reputation. To the point I just made, there are sometimes humbling blocks to move into a place like Braze and this has historically been one of them. The need to manage your own reputation was sometimes one of the things that held customers back on shifting to Braze, but now that it's a requirement everywhere, the playing field is leveled and our other differentiators are able to shine through. We also think that over time, changes of this nature of ISPs are likely to lead to negative selection bias and any tools that do continue to use shared IP pools. And that's going to cause them to continue to deteriorate and effectiveness over time. And so there might still be some people that are cleaning to it. But from our perspective, if you're going to be on the right side of history, you just need to make this change. And then I would say in terms of stack racking the impact, I don't think it's going to be a massive impact. But it's yet another example where anything which makes the deliverability landscape more complex, benefits Braze relative to the rest of the category because of the sophistication that we have in targeting orchestration. This was true as GDPR came into effect. It was true and Apple rolled out their ATT framework. It was true last year as carriers started clamping down on short code spam and abuse and sharing. Each of those cases, we've been on the right side of history and those changes to the landscape only serve to strengthen our differentiation and create more reasons for marketers to move beyond the undifferentiated batch and blast so we were just talking about and embrace that more moderate approach to customer engagement. And so when I look at the impact of things like this as a business, I think it's positive, but I would also just reiterate that the secular trend has been there for the last five-plus years. I think every six months, across one of the channels that we work with. There's a major change which tells everyone to shape up and get more sophisticated and Braze is already there, waiting for them. And it's just yet another one of those that we think catalyzes people to go through the switching costs and moving to a more modern customer engagement platform.\nBrian Peterson: I appreciate all the color. And maybe a follow-up for Isabelle. You mentioned on the gross margin. I appreciate the guidance there, but there's a mix-driven dynamic that's pressuring results in the first quarter. Does that mix change throughout the year to drive the improvement or are there factors that's driving the gross margin improvement throughout the year? Thanks guys.\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So there's a couple of things at play. So as we continue kind of the channel expansion and into more and more of these sort of premium messaging channels, this has always been part of our growth strategy. It supports the need for sophisticated platform like ours for cross-channel orchestration. So all of that's great. What we've seen with, in particular, with WhatsApp is, obviously, it is a premium messaging channel. It is sold at lower margins versus the rest of the parts of the platform. We've seen faster adoption rates of this -- which is actually great. We're seeing our customers actually leg into their purchased volumes just much, much more quickly, which is great. And so we've reached sort of a steady state consumption for the purchase volumes faster than we have with some other channels. So while this is great, we're also operating at a relatively small scale still in these volumes. And so our unit cost for this channel, in particular, is still high. And so as that continues to grow in scale, we are going to be able to capitalize on cost optimization for that channel in particular. And we also have at play a number of other cost structure optimization, specifically for the technology stack that our teams are all working on. So you'll see -- we're going to see the impact in Q1 but then sort of lagging ourselves out of that and sort of sequential improvements in the gross margin and then ensuring that we're within the range for the year and the quarters.\nBrian Peterson: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Schwartz from Oppenheimer. Please unmute and ask your question.\nBrian Schwartz: Thank you for taking my question this afternoon. I just have one. I wanted to ask you about the evolution of the partner channel becoming a sales channel. So thinking about the net new mix for fiscal year 2025, are you planning for any contributions from the partner channel? Thanks.\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So I'd first clarify that our partner relationships are still ones where we perform the sale directly in the vast majority of circumstances. And so when you think about Braze from a channel perspective, you should think about these as mutually beneficial relationships where we're delivering services revenue opportunities to our partners, both for integration and onboarding as well as for ongoing creative services, data analysis and ongoing implementation as they continue to expand to new use cases and new channels. But we certainly expect the source and influence pipeline from that partner ecosystem to continue to become more and more prominent as we move through the year. There's been a great upward trend as we look over the last frankly, over the last several years, but we've also seen it more markedly in the last few quarters. And you're excited about our future across that entire ecosystem.\nBrian Schwartz: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Berg from Wells Fargo. Please unmute and ask your question.\nMichael Berg: Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I've got one for Bill. You mentioned at the top of the call, mentioning IDFA and cookies deprecating. Is that catalyzing potential changes in the MarTech software stack at a more meaningful clip than it has in the past? And I guess how would you stack rank what color changes is more holistically? And does that look any different in net new versus experience? Thank you.\nBill Magnuson: No, I think my answer here is generally the same as the ground we just covered in response to the Gmail and Yahoo! changes with respect to sender reputation and IP pools. And the high level there is simply that those are instances of both and I guess the new part of this is that in addition to that, adding complexity to the landscape, which I think benefits Braze and gives people reasons to move over to a more modern way of doing customer engagement. The changes that you referenced are also putting at a higher premium on first-party data. And so as brands continue to look at ways to replace the strategies that they were doing before, that depended on third-party data, many of them moved to first-party data first. And I actually have given a number of talks on this at our City by City event series over the last year about the three stages of first-party data investment that we see a lot of brands go through. The first stage is response to things like the IDFA change or the cookie apocalypse or what have you, they keep trying to do things the way that they were before. But suddenly, their third-party data sets are incomplete or they're legal or what have you or they're incorrect. So they try to replace that with first-party data. And that is, of course, effective, and you see that in features like our audience sync product, where you can use first-party data to help manage your pay to add audiences and continue to maintain high levels of relevance and high levels of targeting efficiency even as some of those third-party data sets are harder to access. The second is then when you start to move into doing modern customer engagement, which is being able to leverage the first-party relationship that you have with the customer, use the first-party data to understand them better and then use customer engagement software to help shape their journey in a way that's more positive to you. That's where the vast majority of Braze customers are today. And then when you get to the third stage, you start to understand that those first-party relationships are not just an opportunity to talk to a customer but they're actually a platform under which you can innovate within your business. And when I talked about that eight-figure contract where you've got different parts of the business that are operating together and they're doing so in a way that self-reinforcing, that's an opportunity that I think more and more businesses are going to be able to do on the back of investment in first-party relationships and first-party data. When you have an ability to understand your consumer and talk with them over a long time period, your ability is a business to put more products and services in front of them and to be able to leverage that first-party relationship as an asset in order to diversify your business continues to grow. And that's one of the reasons that I'm so excited about the future of Braze is potential because I think we're still in the very early innings of that third stage of business model evolution. And more and more categories are waking up to the opportunities that they can create for themselves once they built out a first-party relationship interface with their customers, which, of course, with the advent of mobile and so much becoming digital, as we continue to move into the future, means that every vertical is going to have that opportunity in a way that many of them didn't experience before. And so when we talk about, I mentioned Nestle Purina, as an example, that's a category that historically didn't have first-party relationships with their customers, but through subscription services and through other digitally connected products, they're starting to create the interfaces for those. And that's causing them to rethink their entire product families in a way that they can actually build on top of the foundation of the first-party relationships and diversify their business model. So that, I think, is super exciting. What does that do this year? What does that do in the near term? I don't think it's discernible from all the other changes that we have that have continued to kind of modify the environment. But I think if you take a step back, and you look at those secular tailwinds, you look at that investment in first-party data and all the things that are driving people to really adopt the more modern customer engagement practices that those all point towards massive future opportunity for Braze.\nMichael Berg: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nick Altmann from Scotiabank. Please unmute and ask your question.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks, guys. Just to build on Ryan's question around that COVID renewal cohort. I guess I wanted to kind of take the flip side of it. And can you maybe just talk about how customers who have maybe signed shorter duration deals over the last couple of years, how those renewals specifically are trending? And you guys called out upsell was very strong this quarter. So maybe just kind of compare and contrast the sort of upsell dynamics with customers who are maybe on shorter duration deals, who may be signed when the macro was a little bit choppier versus that COVID renewal cohort? Thanks.\nBill Magnuson: Yes, it's a great question, especially in light of the results that we just shared because as you can see in the strong RPO results and Isabelle alluded to this, we did have a slight increase in our average overall contract length. And we are actually seeing customers who were really nervous about payment terms. They were really nervous about contract length, relaxing again and committing to longer-term contracts. And I don't think we're seeing any material difference in renewal rates for people that were previously on one year or two year or what have you. But what we are seeing is upon renewal, more willingness for people to make longer-term commitments again to make more upfront payments to do so a little bit quicker. And we are seeing some of those parts of our motion revert back to more of what we've been used to over the last few years.\nNick Altmann: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Yun Kim from Loop Capital. Please unmute and ask your question.\nYun Kim: Okay. Great. So just on the WhatsApp channel, it seems like that's ramping up pretty meaningfully. If you can remind us how the pricing works on that channel? And is that similar to like the SMS channel? And also is the adoption of WhatsApp channel were driven by existing customers or is this driving new logo adds, especially in your international market? Thanks.\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So the pricing is similar to SMS and e-mail in the sense that we bill for it on a CPM basis. And we -- and then similarly, any of the monthly active users that you are communicating with through WhatsApp that might be net new because of that channel are going to count against your MAU allotments. And so similar to our other premium channels, it monetizes in both ways. In terms of upsell versus net new, it has -- it's been a great upsell channel because customers that are already running strategies on SMS or even push notifications, are able to quickly move those over to those channels. And of course, as we've spoken about so many times, all of the features that they're used to from a targeting and an orchestration reporting standpoint are available to them when they move to the WhatsApp channel. The new business opportunities are also there, especially as you alluded to internationally. I would also call out, though, as Isabelle mentioned on the gross margin point, WhatsApp is a brand-new channel for us. And so with respect to our pricing versus the overall unit margin of that channel, we are still working to optimize that more as it grows as a channel for us, we will be able to commit to higher volumes and improve our own cost function on it. And so that's some of the near-term pressure that you're seeing caused by that premium channel mix in, but it's something that we are confident we're going to be able to manage over time just as we've done with SMS and e-mail.\nYun Kim: Okay. Great. A real quick question for Isabelle. Any change in the initial land deal size with new customers and how that's been trending? Thanks.\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. No major differences there across the various segments. So obviously, continuing to see more strength in the enterprise. And so the land and an enterprise might typically be larger, obviously than lands at S&P. But among the segments, there's no material change in the size of the lands. And again, we talked about this in the past. We tend to not worry about the size of the lands because once we're in, our ability to kind of show ROI and value then leads to the expansion strategy over time.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hannah Rudoff from Piper Sandler.\nHannah Rudoff: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just one for me here. So full year growth outlook of 21% to 22% is comparable to your initial guidance during last year, which does suggest that demand is stabilizing. You kind of spoke to this in the previous question. But just wondering, what are the products and partnerships that could be most likely to for upside this year?\nBill Magnuson: I mean I think it's a lot of the things that we've spoken about so far on the call. We're definitely excited about the agency ecosystem and the global systems integrator ecosystem being able to continue to source and influence new pipeline. We're excited about the rebrand and the investments that we've put into marketing at the beginning of the year. The expansion of sales capacity as well, bringing new heads into the sales organization in new geographies as well. And then we've got great new products that we're able to monetize both for our existing customers who can cross-sell and upsell as well as provide new starting points for net new business, as was just alluded to in -- on that WhatsApp question. And so I think across the board, we're excited about a lot of different things contributing to what's going to be a good year.\nHannah Rudoff: All makes sense. Thank you\nOperator: Our next question comes from Cole Erskine from TD Cowen. Please unmute and ask your question\nCole Erskine: Great. Thanks guys. Just one for me. Bill, I was wondering if you could give us an update on efforts to kind of sell into product teams and data teams and target incremental budgets that are outside of the core marketing that you usually target? Thanks.\nBill Magnuson: Yes, absolutely. So I'll break those apart because when we look at from a data perspective, I think we are so far not selling a lot to data teams, but we are making their lives easier. And what that's doing is it's getting more data into Braze, more quickly with lower total cost of ownership and it's enabling marketers to run more use cases in Braze and expand into new channels and new message volumes and just generally increase their usage of Braze. And so we very much view data as an input into Braze, and it's one that we want to make sure gets to us quickly and easily. It's why you're seeing so much investment. So broadly, we're still very committed to our partnerships across the entire data ecosystem as well as building out things like our data transformation capabilities and cloud data ingestion. And all of those are working to try to make data science teams, lives easier, both that integration and onboarding as well as on an ongoing basis as they continue to work with Braze over time. On the product side, you're continuing to see us expand with new capabilities like feature flags, we also are working on more in product capabilities like landing pages. Our content cards are getting more flexible. The surveys capability continues to get more powerful. Those are all channel expansions that are some of those, you maybe wouldn't think of as a traditional marketing channel. We refer to them as channels because we are orchestrating them in the same way, and there are actions that are being taken by Canvas that impact the user experience. And I think that if you want to kind of think about where the ownership of those things are, if they're impacting the user experience in the product and affecting the product behavior, we're targeting those more product and engineering buyers, whereas channels that are more traditionally owned by CRM teams, you would probably call the marketing buyer. But broadly, we think of all of this as customer engagement. And if you go back to some of the comments I made earlier about the role that we have to play to be a companion to the customer as they move through their journey interacting with the products and services of the brands that we work with to be a companion we need to be in the product experience just as much as we are in the traditional marketing channels. And that's something that we're committed to and we're excited to see our customers adopting.\nCole Erskine: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Our final question will come from Taylor McGinnis from UBS. Taylor, your line is open.\nTaylor McGinnis: Yeah, hi, thanks so much for taking my question. So it sounds like there's noise in the net customer adds number. So Isabelle any color you can provide on what you're seeing in terms of new logo ARR growth exiting and starting the year? And how we should think about the potential trajectory path for that this year? Thanks.\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So the new logo adds for the quarter was not dissimilar or logos when you think of order forms was not dissimilar from what it's been historically. So the number that you're seeing is sort of muted for two reasons. One is we were very strong in Q4 in terms of upsell. And so a lot of those net new order forms were done in the context of larger enterprises where you can penetrate a new geography, a new business unit, et cetera. And so you're not seeing kind of all of the new order forms that are there. And then churn, as I mentioned, at the lower end of the contract sizes down at the SMB was still challenged. And so that sort of took the number down as well. But when we look at the evolution of net new order forms, so that is new contracts with new counterparties, I won't say customers, it's just a new counterparty. That actually was not dissimilar from trends that we have seen in the last couple of quarters. So that was more normalized. It was really more that it's more concentrated in the enterprise and therefore, more upsells in the context of existing parent companies and then obviously the churn of the SMB level worked against us.\nTaylor McGinnis: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no more questions in the queue.\nBill Magnuson: All right. Yes. Thank you, everyone. We're excited about the year ahead and looking forward to chatting with you again in a few months."

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Magnuson: Thank you, Chris. And good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a strong second quarter, generating $115.1 million in revenue, up 34% versus the prior year while continuing to drive operating efficiency in the business. Non-GAAP gross margin increased 70 basis points year-over-year. And we again demonstrated strong leverage with non-GAAP operating margin improving by over 1,300 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year.  We were encouraged by the new business we won in the quarter, sales strength in the commercial and enterprise businesses, the progress of our product initiatives and AI development efforts and the adoption of our newest channel, WhatsApp. While the macro environment still presents challenges, we are effectively navigating them and remain confident in our ability to drive top line growth while maintaining cost discipline and delivering on the financial targets that we have set. Brands continue to recognize the high ROI that can be achieved through personalized cross-channel customer engagement delivered by the Braze platform.  Customer growth was solid with our total customer count reaching 1,958, an increase of 92 during the quarter. New business wins and upsells included Miro, the National Basketball Association, Rappi and Stori, among many others. The diversification of new customer wins was also impressive, with the top five new business deals all originating from entirely different types of businesses. A quick service restaurant chain, an e-commerce platform, a provider of coupons and discounts, a digital collaboration platform and a company that connects homeowners to trades people. As those of you who have followed us closely are aware, Braze's business is highly diversified. With no single vertical contributing more than 1/4 of our ARR and many others where we have not only a significant presence but also opportunity for growth.  The versatility and adaptability of the Braze platform enables its adoption by any business that prioritizes investments in first-party data and customer relationships, regardless of size, vertical or geography. As the field of customer engagement matures, we continue to win against point solutions that have limited channel offerings are not real time or simply don't scale. We are similarly making progress against legacy marketing clouds as marketers find their fragmented solutions increasingly unfit for modern customer engagement use cases.  This quarter, we displaced legacy marketing clouds at numerous enterprises, including at a top quick service restaurant chain, a large consumer discounter and a well-known travel company. In the case of the restaurant chain, a global systems integrator partner was instrumental in the sales cycle and will be working with the customer to complete onboarding and provide ongoing marketing and data services. As we continue to expand our product surface area and enhance its capabilities by infusing AI throughout our stack, we're helping brands create personalized, cross-channel solutions faster than ever before speeding the rotation of the Imagine, Create and Evolve loop that lets them compound learnings and increase their ROI over time.  Meanwhile, the legacy clouds continue to be held back by antiquated data foundations and complex siloed architectures, limiting their innovation and causing them to fall further behind. We believe our product innovation and R&D focus, coupled with their relative stasis will accelerate the legacy replacement cycle and compel more enterprises to upgrade to the personalized cross-channel customer engagement enabled by the Braze platform.  We also continue to benefit from the vendor consolidation trend we've called out the last couple of quarters as brands look to an all-in-one platform to coordinate messaging across the growing array of B2C channels and accelerate their investments into first-party data. In the case of an accessories retailer, we replaced four separate vendors, providing a great example of how Braze wins on technical integration capabilities, aligning with the customer's vision of working with a comprehensive, best-in-class customer engagement platform.  We believe this trend will continue as customers look to capitalize on new AI-driven advancements in customer engagement, an area of innovation, which benefits tremendously from the breadth of Braze's data footprint and messaging flexibility as well as our real-time stream processing architecture. At Braze, we are constantly evaluating new ways for brands to communicate directly with their customers by delivering more relevant content and engaging experiences in the channels that resonate most. In March of this year, we launched a native WhatsApp integration that enables marketers to create, orchestrate and send WhatsApp campaigns directly from the Braze platform.  With more than 2 billion active users in 2022, broad international penetration and the ability to engage in content-rich conversations that build retention and loyalty, WhatsApp is a highly valuable addition to our cross-channel portfolio. And I'm happy to report that new and existing customers have responded very favorably to our offering with dozens of customers using the channel and a fast-growing pipeline.  One early WhatsApp success story I'd like to highlight is Rappi. One of the most popular and trusted technology companies in Latin America. Rappi has expanded its investment in Braze, specifically adding WhatsApp as an additional channel to its innovative customer engagement strategy that already included e-mail, SMS, push and in-app messaging. Rappi was looking for a more effective out-of-product channel to directly reach their audience and successfully leverage WhatsApp to motivate lapsed users to return to the app to make new purchases and to drive active users to make more purchases over time.  Leveraging WhatsApp and Braze's campus environment, Rappi was able to drive an 80% uplift in purchases versus a control group that received only push notifications and e-mail. Case studies such as these demonstrate how marketers can immediately leverage the flexibility of Canvas and the power of our streaming architecture with new channels like WhatsApp to target personalized and orchestrate sophisticated campaigns that drive high engagement and ROI. Beyond additional channels, we continue to improve and enhance our competitive moat by expanding our product surface area and deepening our existing capabilities, particularly around data management and governance.  Yesterday, we announced new data transformation and integration options to enable brands to get data into Braze quickly and easily with less ongoing maintenance burden and lower lift from technical teams. I won't go through all these enhancements in detail, but I'll mention a few key innovations that we believe will be particularly impactful for customers. First is data transformations, a feature that gives brands the ability to easily map incoming data from third-party services on to Braze user profiles. Even more exciting, the code that defines these transformations can be automatically generated using a generative AI capability within our Sage AI suite.  Second, we are expanding cloud data ingestion to include an integration with Databricks Lakehouse Platform, while expanding the capabilities of our existing integrations into the Snowflake Data Cloud, Amazon Redshift and Google BigQuery. This flexible data ingestion capability helps customers reduce total cost of ownership in their data ecosystem by eliminating complexities when accessing their first-party data.  Third, we infused generative AI into our query builder and SQL segment extension tools to empower teams to easily transform natural language prompts into insightful reports and audience segments.  SQL segment extensions itself is a recently released addition to our classification layer that enables comprehensive and flexible targeting on top of a customer's entire Braze data set, enabling marketers to execute on more advanced targeting use cases completely within Braze instead of relying on their in-house data teams or third-party tools. Leveraging these advancements, brands will be able to easily access and activate their valuable first-party data to power personalized customer engagement strategies that enhance loyalty, retention and revenue. We also recently launched Braze Instant Insights, a Snowflake native app that provides turnkey visualizations for analysis use cases like attribution, high-value actions, retention and investigating monetary value across cohorts.  In the same way that we built Snowflake data sharing to reduce the effort and time to value for customers building outgoing data pipelines from Braze, Instant Insights reduces the effort to go from data in the warehouse to sophisticated reporting. And in June, we announced Sage AI, a set of advanced AI and ML capabilities integrated into the Braze platform. Sage AI is designed to enhance marketer productivity while powering better and more effective customer engagement results. The most recent additions to Sage included three main innovations.  First, an AI recommendation engine that utilizes a custom-trained transformer model to match items for Braze catalogs with customers most likely to buy them, providing content personalization that outperforms competing techniques in our tests. We believe this feature, which will become a separate SKU, will boost campaign revenue and improve customer loyalty for the brands that use it.  Second, our AI content QA tool that leverages Open AI's GPT-4 to check messages for tone, structure, grammar and appropriate language was promoted into general availability and has now been used by hundreds of brands. We're seeing the advantage of being early movers in generative AI as we're quickly expanding beyond obvious use cases and integrating capabilities that are finally tuned to marketer workflows.  Third, we added winning path to Canvas, our visual development environment, which marketers use as a no-code journey orchestration tool. This feature automatically optimizes how customers flow through paths in a Canvas, allowing brands to boost conversions with a single click.  Finally, we were refining an A/B test prediction feature designed to use a combination of large language models and other neural network architectures to automatically predict the winner of an A/B test without a pilot send, helping marketers execute on new experiments more efficiently and improving their overall performance.  Finally, I wanted to update you on our social impact initiatives. In July, Braze published its second annual ESG report. This report included our FY '23 greenhouse gas emissions audit, an overview of our diversity, equity and inclusion activities and details on our grant-making efforts as part of our Pledge 1% equity donation program.  Our social impact mission is to amplify employee impact to create opportunity for underserved groups within our communities and to accelerate science-based climate solutions. We look forward to growing these efforts through continued employee advocacy and participation over time. Thank you to our customers, team members and shareholders for your continued support of Braze. We're excited about our path ahead and believe the investments in our product, people and ecosystem, combined with strong secular tailwinds, position Braze to become the industry standard for customer engagement.  And now I'll turn the call over to Isabelle.\nIsabelle Winkles: Thank you, Bill. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Bill mentioned, we reported a strong second quarter with revenue up 34% year-over-year to $115.1 million. This was driven by a combination of existing customer contract expansion, renewals and new business. Our acquisition of North Star closed on June 1 and contributed nearly $2 million of revenue in the quarter. Our subscription revenue remains the primary component of our total top line, contributing 95% of our second quarter revenue. The remaining 5% represents a combination of recurring professional services and onetime configuration and on-boarding fees. Total customer count increased 22% year-over-year to 1,958 customers as of July 31, up 359 from the same period last year and up 92 from the prior quarter. Our total number of large customers, which we define as those spending at least $500,000 annually grew 24% year-over-year to 173, and as of July 31, contributed 57% to our total ARR. This compares to a 55% contribution as of the same quarter last year. Measured across all customers, dollar-based net retention was 120%, while dollar-based net retention for our large customers was 123%.  Expansion was again broadly distributed across industries and geographic regions. Consistent with the prior quarter, revenue outside the U.S. contributed 43% of our total revenue in the second quarter. In the second quarter, our total remaining performance obligation was $524 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 10% sequentially. Current RPO was $353 million, up 29% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially.  The year-over-year increases were driven by contract renewals and upsells and the signing of new customer contracts. Overall, dollar-weighted contract length remains at approximately 2 years. Non-GAAP gross profit in the quarter was $80.6 million, representing a non-GAAP gross margin of 70%. This compares to a non-GAAP gross profit of $59.7 million and non-GAAP gross margin of 69.3% in the second quarter of last year.  The 70 basis points year-over-year margin improvement was driven by ongoing efficiencies related to personnel costs and continued economies of scale in our core technology expenses. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $51.8 million or 45% of revenue compared to $44.3 million or 51% of revenue in the prior year quarter. While the dollar increase reflects our year-over-year investments in headcount costs to support our ongoing growth and global expansion, improved efficiency reflects our disciplined investment approach to resource deployment across our go-to-market organization.  Non-GAAP R&D expense was $18.9 million or 16% of revenue compared to $16.3 million or 19% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The dollar increase was primarily driven by increased headcount costs to support the expansion of our existing offerings as well as to develop new products and features to drive growth. Non-GAAP G&A expense was $17.4 million or 15% of revenue compared to $16.5 million or 19% of revenue in the prior year quarter.  The dollar increase was driven by investments to support our overall company growth, including headcount costs and increases in software subscriptions and licenses. Non-GAAP operating loss was $7.6 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $17.5 million in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Braze shareholders in the quarter was $3.9 million or a loss of $0.04 per share compared to a loss of $15.2 million or a loss of $0.16 per share in the prior year quarter.  Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with $476.2 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash used in operations during the quarter was $17.5 million compared to $16.3 million in the prior year quarter. Taking into consideration the cash impact of capitalized costs, free cash flow was negative $18.7 million compared to negative free cash flow of $24.7 million in the prior year quarter. The improvement in free cash flow is primarily due to lower capital expenditures compared to the prior year quarter which included CapEx for our London office expansion.  Now turning to our forecast. We're encouraged by the strong first half of the fiscal year. Demand for high-quality customer engagement solutions remain solid, and we're optimistic in our ability to execute against our long-term financial targets. We intend to maintain cost discipline and reiterate that we believe that we are well positioned to achieve a non-GAAP operating margin of better than negative 7% in Q4 of this year. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $116.5 million to $117.5 million, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 26% at the midpoint.  For the third quarter, non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $15.5 million to $16.5 million. At the midpoint, this implies an operating margin of negative 13.7%. The sequential reduction in non-GAAP operating margin relative to Q2 is driven by onetime expenses related to the company's annual customer conference, Forge as well as other sales and marketing expenses related to sales enablement, which will be concentrated in Q3 and are not projected to materially impact Q4.  Third quarter non-GAAP net loss is expected to be $13 million to $14 million and third quarter non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.13 to $0.14 per share, based on approximately 100.2 million weighted average basic shares outstanding during the period. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $451.5 million to $454.5 million, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 27% at the midpoint.  Fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $47 million to $49 million. Non-GAAP net loss for the same period is expected to be in the range of $37 million to $39 million. Fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be $0.37 to $0.39 per share based on a full year weighted average basic share count of approximately 98.8 million shares. We remain committed to driving revenue growth while improving operating income and free cash flow margins in the coming quarters. We reiterate that we expect Braze will achieve positive quarterly non-GAAP operating income and positive quarterly free cash flow by the end of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.  I'll conclude my remarks by reiterating our excitement in Braze's future. We remain focused on partnering with our customers to deliver best-in-class customer engagement and growing our top line while maintaining cost discipline to achieve our long-term financial targets. And with that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams: For Bill, let us see the improvement in monthly active user growth this quarter. I know that's not a perfect metric but would love your thoughts on where your customers' usage and marketing spend currently stand at this point in the year. Like are they becoming more willing to make growth investments at this point? Or is it more stabilization? I'll love your thoughts here.\nBill Magnuson: So I think overall throughout the year, we've seen pretty consistent conditions for our customers and just broadly around the macro, and we're seeing that same consistency around the globe. Everyone's experiencing pretty similar interest rate conditions. A lot of marketers are operating with flat or frozen budgets. And so while we're -- we've been really happy with our execution through the environment. We obviously highlighted the new business growth. We've been really happy with the diversification of new customers that are coming in. I also do think that we've got some gas in the tank from the perspective of a lot of the product expansion that's happened, a lot -- the WhatsApp launch. We've been happy with the traction there.  But in an environment where marketers in general are sitting on frozen budgets, a lot of scrutiny from procurement and a lot of scrutiny from their CFOs, the opportunity for a new product launch like that or expansion to continue to really see its full potential is going to be more limited. And so we're -- from the beginning of the year, we've seen things continue to be challenging and unpredictable. I'd say that conditions broadly haven't improved, but they also haven't gotten worse. And we've been really happy with the execution that we've seen across the company. We've strengthened a lot of the foundations, both in our product as well as in our go-to-market strategy and our sales organization. We've been really focused for setting up the organization for our path to 1 billion in ARR, but it is definitely still challenging out there.\nRyan MacWilliams: Appreciate the color. And then for Isabelle, good to see the continued improvement in gross margin? What were some of the drivers of the gross margin improvement in the quarter? And do you think you can continue to see step-ups in this metric as your customers begin to utilize more large language model capabilities?\nIsabelle Winkles: Thanks for the question. Yes. So I think the trajectory that we're on within our gross margin metric is very consistent with our long-term targets that we've stated. So our long-term target is 67% to 72%. We're operating well within that range and already at 70%, which is great to see. And we're really kind of just ticking up as we continue to experience and realize cost efficiencies and operations of scale across our technology stack and then, some personnel efficiencies that we have.  I think some of the ongoing things that we can look to that I've talked about before in terms of our path to profitability is ongoing economies of scale across the tech stack, which we will continue to leverage and continue to improve over time. And then specifically across personnel, we've talked about our leveraging cost optimized locations as we continue to grow that headcount finding ways to do so in a more optimized fashion.  So I think the combination of those two things will continue to kind of lead us to where we are and beyond within that range that we've stated for the long term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jake Titleman with Goldman Sachs.\nJakeTitleman: Congrats on a great quarter. Bill, you mentioned an AI recommendation engine that will be a separate SKU. Can you talk a little bit more about that, what the plans are to monetize it? And maybe are there some other AI SKUs that are coming down the pipe that you also charge for separately?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So across our AI and machine learning investments, we expect there to continue to be a mix of ways that we will realize returns on it. Some parts will be monetized independently. Our predictive suite has actually been in the product as a separate SKU for a while. And if you look at the transformer driven recommendation engine, we anticipate that to both, be a separate SKU and also to support additional upsells for another product we have called product Catalogs, which could be used with or without the recommendation engine. And so those are both great examples of places where we have independent monetization and then, we also have support of other aspects of the product that independently monetize.  In addition to that, I think that a lot of the generative AI investments that we're making, which are improving marketer productivity and allowing for marketers to just bring their ideas to life more quickly, to be able to inspire them more. In the example of the SQL segment extensions or the data transformers that I spoke about earlier, we think that these are really good places where the generative AI is actually helping build confidence for marketers to take on more technical tasks within the platform. And what all of those lead to is faster time to value, more usage, the confidence to deploy more use cases.  And of course, when we see new use cases coming to the picture, those usually come with more monthly active users, and they often come with expansion into new channels or expansion into new data products. And so they're all very much self-reinforcing even without independent monetization. And of course, across the board, we make marketers more productive and when we make the teams that use Braze more agile, it also leads to higher levels of experimentation, which compounds ROI, improves customer satisfaction and ultimately leads to a better differentiation for Braze. And so we see this kind of flywheel effects happening where, yes, we are absolutely going to independently monetize. But even if we weren't, we still think there's a lot of monetary benefit. And the ability for our community to continue to up-level themselves more quickly, so that Braze can further separate from our competition in the sense that we are certainly characterized in the market as being the top of the sophistication pyramid in the space. And so the more that we have marketers who are operating with agile team methodologies and who are comfortable with more kind of data-driven strategies as well as using more technical features. All of those things lead to them being able to utilize the parts of Braze that are very differentiated and very hard to mimic or copy, and that leads to pricing power and other sorts of benefits for us.\nJake Titleman: That was very helpful. And then I just wanted to follow up on the GSI being instrumental in one of your displacements of the legacy marketing clouds. Can you just talk a little bit about the GSI relationships, the global agency relationships, how those are evolving? And when do you think that, that could actually be a material driver to revenue growth?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So we're continuing to deepen our relationships with solutions providers, including global systems integrators, the big agency holding companies and also a vast global network of smaller marketing and growth agencies. And the fundamentals of those relationships continue to be really solid. We're investing to allow that mutually beneficial flywheel that I've spoken about in prior quarters to continue to spin up. And I'd say we're also advancing at varying speeds depending on the partner, but we're really excited about the overall trend line, and we're seeing examples of tremendous success where we're generating really strong services revenue for those partners that are leaned into their Braze practices and our joint go-to-market motions.  But the characterization of how your really great Braze partner is very different from the way that you may have been a great partner of the legacy marketing clouds.  Braze represents easier integration, faster time to value. But on the flip side, it also represents greater opportunities to compound ROI through experimentation, through additional data analysis. And so the types of services that really resonate with the Braze customer base are different from what the GSIs were maybe used to providing for legacy marketing cloud providers. They're better, and they're exactly where those partners are trying to evolve to, because it represents more ongoing revenue as opposed to being predominantly the upfront integration-oriented revenue.  And so it's definitely an evolution that our partners want to make, especially at the GSI level. It's one that we're supporting them and making. But as I mentioned, they're certainly progressing at different speeds, depending on how leaned in those organizations are. And we're looking forward to seeing the success that we are in all the places where partners are really leaned in, where they've adapted their model to spread more evenly across that entire ecosystem over time.  And we're investing internally to make sure that's going to happen. So we're seeing really promising early results from the GSIs and from the big holding companies, we're seeing growing momentum quarter-over-quarter. And like I said, we have complete confidence that the foundations of how we get that flywheel spinning in a mutually beneficial way are completely sound and will continue to be. And we're excited about where that's going.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Berg with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Berg: Congrats on quarter. I just have a quick one on the cloud data adjustment progress. You have a number of announcements in and around that space. And with the strength you're seeing in the business, maybe you can help us understand how that's helping either drive expansion, stickiness adoption, or how you're thinking about the benefits of that longer term? It certainly seems it can ease the adoption curve here.\nBill Magnuson: Yes, I think that's exactly right. And broadly, we are focused on ensuring that our customers can get their data into Braze quickly, easily, affordably and that they can do so without an ongoing maintenance burden. And so when you think about whether you want to call it the total cost of ownership or just think about the characterization of how Braze first deploys and then lives within a technology ecosystem. What we're trying to do with things like cloud data ingestion is the activation energy to both, get data flowing into Braze in the first place, but also to add those incremental use cases over time.  And so that ability to onboard a customer more quickly to have them get comfortable in the Braze environment, get their early use cases out the door and then immediately be looking at new opportunities to say, \"Hey, oh, I didn't anticipate that I might want to personalize with this particular bit of data,\" or \"My data science team has just completed these new machine learning models around propensity scoring. That would be really helpful to incorporate into my personalization strategies in Braze,\" or \"I have a new corporate KPI that I want to be able to measure that was not a conversion event that was in my initial integration, but it lives in my data warehouse.\" There's a lot of examples like these that in the past, our marketing team would have had to have gone to an engineering team or a data science team, gotten into their next sprint cycle, gone through all of the heavyweight machinery that goes into releases around new software and such and just leads to delays additional energy and investment required. And often, that's enough for them to get their progress blocked up. And so what we're really trying to do is put marketers in control of their own destiny for a wider swath of the data that lives within their ecosystem. We're committed to giving customers flexible options for our stream processor to ingest either their raw data, the insights that they're generating through additional data science work, and obviously, all of the events and other activities that are generated by end user actions. And that means that we're committed to continuing to integrate with our whole partner ecosystem, working with CDPs, with reverse ETL vendors, with various analytics software as well as the data warehouses and lake houses and our own customers bespoke data engineering pipeline.  So you should expect to continue to see a broad investment by Braze on the data front, so that the Braze data platform continues to allow our customers to both, get up and running more quickly, get more use cases to us. And we're not trying to monetize things like that independently because, of course, we have the great advantage of new data that flows into Braze drives more use cases. It leads to incremental monthly active users when people bring in new user populations, and it leads to additional messaging usage as people start to deploy Braze into more and more parts of their user journey. And so we really look at data as an input. We want to make sure that customers can get it into Brazes very easily, they can expand that over time. And it's all a really good self-reinforcing loop for us.\nMichael Berg: Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on the product front. Generative AI, you mentioned you were early to the game. When I think about your Data [indiscernible] platform, it certainly seems like the products are coming out at a pretty high velocity. Is there anything structural in either your architecture or how you're using generative AI that's helping with your R&D velocity? And do you feel that's a competitive advantage moving forward to help take further share from the legacy players?\nBill Magnuson: Yes, absolutely. I mean especially when comparing to the legacy players, many of which were assembled through a series of acquisitions and still maintain the siloed architectures that come as a result of that. I think Braze has always been super focused on keeping tight vertical integration through all the different layers of our stack as well as just keeping complexity under control, making sure that we're constantly upgrading our foundations or we're keeping tech under control. A lot of the things that keep a well honed and the sharing machine running at high velocity even as you continue to scale.  And so when we're -- when we look at the roadmap velocity, we've been really happy with it for years. We've continued to add more and more investment to our R&D teams. And unlike in a lot of companies, as they get to a certain scale, you start to see the unit productivity slowdown out of R&D. I actually feel like in many ways, because of the strengthening of the foundations of Braze, we've sped up our unit productivity over the last few years. And you're seeing the results of that as see not only the rapid injection of AI into more and more of our platform, but you're also seeing channel expansion, platform expansion, the Braze data platform continuing to deepen its capabilities. And as we think about where the future of customer engagement is going, what we're trying to do is make sure that we're supporting exactly where the leading edge of modern customer engagement teams are driving towards. They're becoming responsible for more and more of the customer journey.  They're becoming responsible for not just the delivery of marketing messages but also aspects of the product experience. And those are all the leading edge of where we think that you can bring in a lot of these ideas around: How are we data driven about what we're delivering? How do we use agility and experimentation to compound learnings over time? How do we make sure that we're delivering personalized and relevant experiences where we can take in the combination of all the context around the customer, all of the strategies and the important priorities for our business, and we combine those with automated decision-making through all the investments in AI and ML? And those things compound together to create a tremendous amount of value for the brands that use Braze. They also deliver better product experiences to end-user customers.  And so we've always looked at the importance of us controlling that end-to-end data flow. And when you think about Braze's vertical integration where we live inside the end-user products, as users take actions, we know about it immediately. We're able to respond to it in the moment, in the product or we're able to use those insights in order to inform subsequent actions. And marketers are able to actually stay focused on business strategy as opposed to thinking about channels. And so that's all inherent to our architecture. It's been there from the very beginning. And you're seeing the benefits of that, not just in our great growth as a company but also in our R&D velocity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from DJ Hynes with Canaccord.\nDavid Hynes: I'll echo others' comments on the quarter. It was nice to see the sequential growth in cRPO. Isabelle, the last time we spoke, I think the message from you was kind of like signs of stability are forming in the business. Like to that end, can you talk at all about linearity of bookings in the quarter? Any observations on kind of intra-quarter NRR? Any of that sort of stuff would be interesting to hear.\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So I think we're really pleased with the execution that we had this quarter. And linearity actually -- I think one quarter does not a pattern make, but we were very pleased with our linearity results. And in fact, if you look at sort of some of the over attainment that we had relative to kind of the consensus number that was out there, linearity played a non-negligible part of that. I -- we are not including that type of expectation going forward for purposes of guidance.  So I definitely expect that the over-performance that you're seeing here, this is not a pattern that we would expect to repeat. But it was very pleasing to us to see the linearity that we did achieve in this quarter. We're kind of back to the pattern of -- in this quarter, back to the pattern of about 50% of our bookings occurring in the first 2 months of quarter, which is great versus some of the back-end that we had been experiencing over the past several quarters.\nDavid Hynes: And then a quick follow-up for you. Is that WhatsApp channel kind of gets in the market and continues to scale? Any comments you make around kind of contribution margin of that channel, like does it look more like SMS, does it look more like higher-margin channels? How should we think about things?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So we don't speak specifically to that. I'll just sort of -- and I think we've made comments around this just sort of in terms of like where it lives in the sequence, it's going to be somewhere between e-mail and SMS. So think of it as kind of there in the pecking order, but that's what I'll say. I'm not -- certainly not concerned. In fact, even as SMS was growing as a proportion of our total top line, which it's done very steadily over the last 3.5, 4 years. We've continued to find ways to expand our margin, and you've seen that fairly meaningfully. So I would not look at the incorporation or growth of WhatsApp as -- with any concern towards gross margin compression.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Derrick Wood with Cowen.\nJames Wood: Congrats on a solid quarter. Following on that same topic, just curious, Bill, or Isabelle, what you're seeing in terms of cross-sell activity across channels including e-mail, SMS, in-app WhatsApp. Just wondering how side to push where you're seeing the most traction and whether there's any change in what channels you're landing with for new customers.\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So I'll call it two things. One is that we've been really excited to see that as we've added new channels and as we've grown the sophistication of those channels, even some that have been in the product for 10 years, like e-mail, that we continue to find the ability to start new contracts across any subset of channels. So we have customers that are starting with just SMS, with just content cards, with just e-mail, Obviously, just mobile, which is a big part of our heritage. And so as we continue to build out these new channels, we're looking for them to both, provide upsell and cross-sell opportunities.  But also a new way to introduce people into the Braze ecosystem. And our goal with all of these and this comes under that umbrella of start anywhere, go everywhere that we've been talking about for a while is that when we get a customer into Braze on any given channel, we introduced them to Canvas. And they also set up a data flow that flows through every layer of our stack. And once they do that, it's incrementally very easy for them to then expand across to other channels. The feature sets that they use for targeting and for personalization, the concepts that exist around reporting are all the same. In many cases, the data flow can be augmented, and I spoke earlier about how things like cloud data ingestion and a lot of our partnerships across the broader data ecosystem make it easy for new use cases or new channels to have the data that backs them, supplementarily come in and get set up quickly.  And so we've got the right mechanisms, both to have customers start in a flexible array of places as well as have them continue to expand across new channels. I'd say that the thing that's most exciting though is the sheer number of customers that we see go from 4 to 5 to 6 to 7 to 8 to 9 channels. I was visiting a customer in Australia earlier this year, who proudly told me that they were in 11 different Braze channels, and they had made it like an internal mission to make sure that they continue to adopt all of them. And when we look at the adoption of WhatsApp in the quarter, there were certainly some of the customers that came in there were brand new, but there were other places where a customer was adding and it's their fifth, sixth or seventh channel.  And I think that when you look out across the legacy marketing cloud landscape and if you look out across our -- the other start-up competitors that we have, you're just not going to see examples of that. And it goes back to a lot of the points I was making about architecture earlier, which is that unless you're laser-focused on controlling complexity through the entire lifetime of your existence and unless your R&D process is continuously focused on upgrading your foundations and maintaining tech debt and making sure that you're doing a lot of user experience research, that you're going back revamping the UI/UX of all of these different products as you introduce new channels, so that the complexity stays under control.  You just are not capable of being able to have your customers expand so fluidly and across so many different channels as we see with Braze. I talk a lot here about how if we're talking about channels, we're actually missing the point. The idea is that if we can get people into orchestration and into sophisticated data-driven strategies that are focused on what the customer cares about and what the brand cares about and how you marry those together and have them self reinforce each other through sophisticated customer engagement that the channels are more of an implementation detail. And you're not achieving that unless your customers are able to spread across them. And so we really carry that as a goal, both with our product development as well as how we help our customers through integration and onboarding, and through the post sales process as they add new channels over their years of being a Braze customer. And we'll continue to measure ourselves by that yardstick to be able to say, \"Hey, it should be just as easy for a customer to adopt their eighth channel as it is for them to adopt their first two.\" And as long as we can keep accomplishing that, we think that our ability to invest in net new channels or to deepen the capabilities of existing channels and have our customers take advantage of those to both, drive more revenue to Braze through cross-sell and upsell but also to enhance our own ROI will continue to be a really vibrant growth path for us.\nJames Wood: Great. Maybe one for Isabelle. Just on the guidance. I mean, going into Q2, you had guided for 7% sequential growth. You ended up with 13%, very strong quarter. Going into Q3, you're guiding for 2% growth. It sounds like maybe that upside in Q2 was linearity, and you're not assuming that in Q3. But anything else to call out in terms of potential maybe some pull forward, or how to think about some extra seasonality around the Q3?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. Thanks for the question. I think one other thing to call out, so the linearity is certainly at play, and we did have a very strong execution quarter. I think one quarter does not a pattern make. So the combination of the strong execution with the linearity. Those two things combined drove some higher-than-anticipated results, which I wouldn't necessarily expect to repeat and are not embedded in the guide in the back half of the year. The other item is, you'll remember in my comments that North Star was in terms of the guide, we had embedded about $1 million. And we had an extremely successful on-time integration right at the beginning of June for that had very limited surprises to the downside, and they contributed almost $2 million instead of that $1 million. So when you combine that factor with the strong ACV and the linearity, all of that combined together that drives kind of the level of outperformance that you saw.  We are continuing -- you heard Bill talk about the -- where we are in the macro. We're not anticipating that to improve. And therefore, we're continuing to have a risk-adjusted posture in our earnings -- in our guidance. The only other thing to mention is on a sequential basis, remember that Q1 to Q2 has the number of day count that changes. So Q1 only has 89 days. All the other quarters have 92. And so from a sequential perspective, you end up with a very strong sequential growth between Q1 and Q2. That does not repeat in any other quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Bill, maybe one for you. It seems like ease of use and kind of maybe [indiscernible] reconfigured data marketing is a big part of the investments that you're making. How much of a sticking factor, gating factor was that with customers for growth? And as you make these investments, is the goal to expand the [indiscernible] customer segment that you didn't have access to or maybe just increase the intensity with which customers are even [indiscernible] the data that you're putting in the platform?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So it's definitely both, but they really go hand in hand. If you take, for instance, consumables or CPG as an example, many of those brands don't have large mobile app audiences. And so the historical way, which was very SDK-centric that we got the vast majority of the data into Braze is not going to be as applicable to a lot of their use cases. But when you look at -- to take -- to continue with that example, when you look at their paid ad spend, the combination of pulling the growing first-party data sets that they're creating out of data warehouses through something like cloud data ingestion or using a partner like a CDP or [indiscernible] CTL provider into Braze and then being able to take action with things like our audience sync capability is not what you would think of as a traditional Braze use case of integrating into a mobile app and sending push notifications. But it's actually a tremendous ROI when you consider the per user orchestration of data as it's generated in order to direct marketing actions. And so it's a combination of both, us expanding into new verticals and into new use cases as well as the expansion of our own channel and platform breadth. So as Braze has more places to interact with customers and more places collect data, that enables us to execute on more use cases. Of course, Canvas has been architected the entire time to be incredibly flexible and to enable customers to be able to take action across all of these different places. And so when you combine those things together, what you get is a greater amount of optionality for our customers to move within the surface area of our product. And in order to support their movement through that surface area, you need to be able to -- we need to be able to make it easy for them to get new data into Braze and into places where we're going to be able to make sense of it and take action on it quickly.\nArjun Bhatia: Got it. Super helpful. And for Isabelle, I know you have a free cash flow breakeven timeline out there. As we just kind of navigate through the next few quarters of continued macro, what would be some of those factors that maybe get you to push or pull that timeline and some of the investments that you're making in the business?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. Thanks for the question. So are you asking specifically only on free cash flow or the operating income as well? So I mean there's two different sets of answers.\nArjun Bhatia: No. In general...\nIsabelle Winkles: Got it. Okay. Great. Yes. So I'm going to reiterate some comments that we've been making as we've been talking about this path to profitability. Don't expect us to overachieve on this, because to the extent we generate extra capacity, we are going to look to prudently reinvest that into the business in order to foster overall growth. So I think we're sticking to the timeline that we have articulated, both for the free cash flow and the operating income. We were very pleased with our performance this quarter. But actually, we are taking some of the savings that we've realized on a year-to-date basis, and we are enabling certain parts of the business to redeploy some of those savings through the back half of the year while maintaining a laser focus on our guidance for Q4. So the short answer is don't expect us to overachieve and we have -- we're consistent in that commentary.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Nick Altmann with Scotiabank.\nNicholas Altmann: Just a quick one for me. As we entered the year, there was sort of this notion that COVID perhaps had a little bit of front office pull forward and then the turbulent macro front office, MarTech initiatives, maybe get put on the back burner. Just given the booking strength in Q1 and 2Q here, is there any way to sort of parse out the strength between the end market holding up a little bit better than maybe you guys had expected versus you guys just executing much better? Because I know that Isabelle, you had called out execution was very strong in 2Q. So just wondering if you could kind of parse out the strength between those two factors?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. I mean I said this at the top, which is that I think that the broad macro that we're experiencing and that everyone is experiencing together has been pretty consistent throughout the year so far. And so I've also been speaking for quarters now on these calls about how we think that a lot of the narratives out there about the front office, about concepts like optimizing spend don't apply to customer engagement in the same way, because the marginal ROI of customer engagement activities by customers is so much higher than a lot of other marketing spend.  We're not a seat-based model. We're tied to the activity of the customers. And the fact that you also can't go through, a lot of the optimization strategies that companies have used for things like data warehouses or other sorts of analysis where you do things like sampling, just simply don't apply when you need to actually be able to talk to your customers, right? It's on responsibility for brands. And so I would present that in two ways. One is that we think we're seeing a pretty consistent buyer behavior throughout these periods, but I think also a lot of the front-office narratives that have been floating around out there don't apply to customer engagement in the same way. And then I'll just reiterate that we have been really happy with execution. It was four quarters ago on this call that we highlighted some of the struggles that we were seeing from a salesforce productivity perspective.  And in those last four quarters, we've done a tremendous amount of work on this topic, including org structure and leadership changes across both, sales and go-to-market strategy. We've enhanced our training and our in-person onboarding, tighter performance management. And we also had a renewed focus on competitive strategy to make sure that in an environment with less opportunities that we're winning as many of them as we can. And we're encouraged by that progress, and we think we're going to continue to make progress there.  I think sales moral is high, and we're working really well together as the team. We're actually currently completing what is effectively a midyear global sales kickoff, complete with training, workshops and role playing, all of which have been done in person. It's actually an example of some of these incremental investments that we're making right now that Isabelle just alluded to on the last answer. Within that, we've been prioritizing things that are not as sticky. So that's why you're seeing headcount is still growing in a very tempered way. But we are really focused on making sure that we are prepared with extremely solid foundations and continuously improving execution, so that when we do come out of this, that Braze is going to be right there ready to stop on the accelerator and springboard out of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: As guess as you look at the -- somewhat of an acceleration on the $500,000-plus net revenue retention rate, curious if you're seeing even more sort of cross-sell and new channel adoption there? Or is this just sort of the natural expansion of large customers landing and expanding and already being at that size? Any additional color you can help that particularly at the larger sized customers where you're clearly gaining market share.\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So I think it's really just a combination of existing large customers that are continuing to grow, adopting more channels, more use cases were further penetrating organizations by getting into new geos and new business units that they have, being able to support incremental new use cases, all of that comes with new volume and new monthly active users. So I think there's existing customers, and we're also doing well in terms of large net new customers. And so I think when you look at the contribution in our ARR from these large customers, we are built for a broad range of customer sizes, but we're very well built for the top-tier enterprise. And so that I think you're seeing the needs across those enterprises for highest level sophistication customer engagement platforms. And as we continue to improve the product, increase our breadth of channels, we're just continuing to further penetrate these organizations.  In addition, 43% of our revenue earned outside the U.S., that means we already have a solid presence globally. A lot of these organizations, large multinationals, we can continue to support them and increase our exposure with them across the globe. So you're just seeing us continue to penetrate a very -- a great market that we think we have the right to win in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Taylor McGinnis with UBS.\nTaylor McGinnis: Isabelle, just one for you. So the sequential cRPO growth was really solid. So aside from just strong execution on linearity, was there any impact from North Star or something onetime in the renewal base to keep in mind? And the reason why I ask, because as we look ahead, if the environment is stabilizing, could we start to see stronger growth quarter-over-quarter adjusting for seasonality, of course, throughout the year versus maybe what we saw last year?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. Thanks for the question. So North Star did have an impact. And actually, if you -- we're not going to quantify it specifically. But if you remove the impact of North Star, Q2 of this year looks a little bit more like Q2 of last year. If you want to look at sort of sequential percentage growth in RPO, cRPO. So it looks a little bit closer to that. So that's one way to think about the impact of North Star.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: Great to see the change in the business. Even if Isabelle, even if I back out North Star, it looks like it's the highest dollar change in subscription revenue and overall revenue ever. You got the acceleration in U.S., accelerating growth internationally, accelerating RPO growth. It just feels like something's changed here. The strength, is it one area? It feels pretty broad-based.  So my question here, does it feel the environment year-end or your ability to execute in this environment, the new normal, is it different now? Or again, I know one quarter doesn't want to make it a trend, but it does -- outside looking in, it feels like there was a change here and maybe I didn't appreciate it going into the quarter that changes and just trying to understand to make sure if we fully do appreciate what it looks like to be a little healthier environment, your ability to at least execute in this environment has changed. So what do we think about that?\nIsabelle Winkles: I think we're very pleased with our execution results in the context of the macro that we continue to live in. So we've been talking about investments that we've made across our sales organization over the last several quarters, and Bill talked about some that continue on today. And we're very pleased to see some of the results of that in Q2. That said, the environment continues to be challenged. And so while we are going to continue to invest in this improved execution across our sales organization, I think it is too soon to declare that we really feel like things are different on a persistent basis.\nBrent Bracelin: Well, you're certainly surprised us this quarter. Hopefully, we'll get more surprises in the next few quarters.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer.\nBrian Schwartz: Following up on that last question, for you, Bill. The commentary is that the macro is unchanged and still challenging out there. So I wanted to ask you, what are you looking for to help you decide when to underwrite a higher level of new investments for the business for whenever the macro does turn?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So first of all, we are actually still carrying some excess sales capacity, and we've spoken about this in past as well that we think we have the ability to grow into. And we're similarly investing on the demand generation side to make sure that we can have our salesforce be as productive as possible. And all of that is about remaining in a forward posture, so that as things start to improve, we're able to pick them up immediately. We believe that we have a right to win across this market and that, as I mentioned at the very top of the call, I think there's been a lot of really exciting product innovation that we haven't seen the full potential of from a revenue generation perspective, simply due to the realities of a lot of frozen or declining budgets that marketers have been living through in this year. And so part of it is going to be the conditions and confidence improving, looking at brands extending their planning horizons.  I think it's why we have seen a bit more relative strength in the enterprise and we have across the SMB sector, simply because those businesses are more able to quickly shift back to planning on a multiyear time horizon. And that's exactly where you're going to invest in a premium product like Braze in order to set you up for your future.  Some of the other things to that end that we would look at are going to be the venture activity. And we're starting to see some green shoots there but continuing to see just more investment flowing into more promising and businesses, so that they can scale quickly. Part of it is going to be the calendar as well, getting into the next budget year, so that businesses are ready to be back on an investment footing as they start to look ahead into next calendar year, next fiscal year as we get to the end here. And in the meantime, we're going to continue to execute as well as we can and stay in control of everything that we can.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Morelli with Needham.\nRobert Morelli: Congrats on the quarter, [indiscernible]. As customers look to expand on the platform in the current macro. Are you guys able to touch on where they're expanding now compared to 1 year or 2 ago? Is it in different channels of capabilities, just still looking to understand where the incremental expansion dollar is going?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. I would broadly characterize it as being consistent with the caveat that it's conceptually consistent because obviously, the product continues to expand in net new ways, and we are seeing customers continue to adopt those. So for instance, has had a really high attach rate for a long time. It sounds like data sharing has gotten more capability. We're seeing more customers adopt that. But conceptually, those are very similar products in the sense that they help customers with their data export pipelines. We also are seeing people add incremental capability through things like product Catalogs or Audience Sync or the Predictive Suite. These are net new, but they kind of follow this trend line of customers continuing to deploy new use cases on Braze. And so I think that the drivers of it, which are how do we expand into new use cases, how do we over channels that are currently being run by other vendors? We talk about that for new business in terms of vendor consolidation, but that vendor consolidation trend obviously exists once a person is already a Braze customer as well as we supplant other vendors that might still have them in their ecosystem when we first got going with them. And then things like WhatsApp are net new for everyone. And so those are great places where we see a lot of greenfield. We don't need to go in and replace a legacy vendor. And especially as we get the early proof points like the case study that I referenced with Rappi early on, we can bring to life the ROI and the business case for more customers to be able to expand into those. And that's very exciting. But conceptually, that's similar to how we've gone to market with SMS over the last years too. And so I think at a high level, we're able to exercise muscles that we're getting more and more familiar with over time, as we go through cross-sell and upsell.  And the number of opportunities that we have to expand within our product surface area continue to multiply it as our R&D innovation continues at the rapid pace that it's at. I would say that it's all tempered by this -- by the flat or declining budgets that a lot of marketers went through this year. But I'd like to think that we're also generating some pent-up demand that when we start to see those budget levers loosen a little bit at whatever point in the future that we'll be ready to sell into those.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. The final question will come from Yun Kim with Loop Capital.\nYun Kim: I'll make just a quick one, Bill. As you roll out more generative AI-based products and solutions, how are you thinking about pricing model around those products? As you can see from a couple of large high-profile vendors, they're putting premium on their general Gen-AI products? And then maybe Isabelle can talk about the cost side of the equation on these products?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So I think that a lot of the Gen-AI work that we're doing to help with customer productivity or with marketer productivity, we're not looking to keep those amazing tools out of the hands of marketers, because we know that they lead to higher usage of Braze. And we're able to monetize them in that way, and I spoke about that earlier. If we're helping a marketer deploy more variants more quickly to help them check their copywriting or generate or inspire themselves to have new content strategies, if we're helping them be able to use a more technical capability through code generation or other sorts of scheme syntax checking.  These are all things that really encourage uses of Braze that we already monetized on our own. And so we're not looking necessarily for those aspects of Gen-AI that help the productivity of the marketer be monetized independently. But there are other aspects that incorporate in LMs or other sorts of transformer models.  I mentioned the personal -- or the recommendation engine earlier, the things like the Predictive Suite and other aspects of automated decision-making that will get deployed into both, our classification layer and your orchestration layer, that we think there's both, an appetite to pay more for those or an expectation based off of other investments that have been made. And they just produce a tremendous amount of value in terms of improved ROI and improved results for marketers. And so I think we're going to continue to take a hybrid approach across those, and we're going to look for them to all -- really feed each other in mutually self-reinforcing ways, but we always have the tremendous advantage of being able to build based off of the monthly active user, based off of the message volumes.  And to the extent that we incorporate more value into value generation into each monthly active user, that gives us more pricing power within that. And you've actually seen this for several years now where our revenue growth rate has outpaced our monthly active user growth rate for quite a while. A big part of that is because we continue to add more productivity for marketers that use Braze. And then they're able to extract more ROI out of the platform. And we're able to capture that very smoothly through monthly active user pricing.\nIsabelle Winkles: And the only thing I would say on the cost side is, I do not expect -- and I talked about this a little bit earlier in the Q&A., don't expect the impact of AI to sort of be margin dilutive. So we are continuing to remain within our long-term margin targets of 67% to 72%. And embedding the AI functionality and that cost structure, we don't break out the individual components but don't look for that to be margin dilutive.\nOperator: This concludes the Q&A. I will now pass the call back to Bill for closing remarks.\nBill Magnuson: I just want to thank everybody for joining the call today. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to seeing you at a conference or on the road soon or for the next earnings call in about three months."

The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Bill.\nBill Magnuson: Thank you, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone  We're very pleased with our first quarter performance, which again demonstrated the power of the Braze customer engagement platform, even against the challenging macroeconomic background. We got off to a great start to the year, generating $101.8 million in revenue, up 31% versus the prior year, while driving operating efficiency in the business. Non-GAAP gross margins increased 100 basis points year-over-year and we demonstrated strong leverage with non-GAAP operating margins improving by over 700 basis points compared to the first quarter of last year. We also generated record free cash flow of $21.7 million, driven in part by solid fourth quarter bookings. As we progress through fiscal 2024, we plan to continue driving strong top-line growth while maintaining cost discipline and believe we are well on our way to achieving the near and long-term profitability goals outlined on our fourth quarter call in March. Brands continue to recognize the high ROI that can be achieved through personalized cross-channel customer engagement enabled by the Braze platform. In the first quarter, we increased our total customer count by 96 sequentially to a total of 1,866 continuing to win against both legacy Marketing Clouds and Point Solutions with our best-in-class customer engagement platform. Recent new business wins and upsells included Procore Technologies, Sonos, Sweetgreen, and Swimply, among many others. We continue to realize strong growth across multiple customer classes, geographies and verticals with both retail e-commerce and media and entertainment showing particularly strong year-over-year growth during the period. Braze again benefited from vendor consolidation this quarter and we believe this trend will continue as enterprises with ambition and sophistication consolidate our technology ecosystem with modern omnichannel customer engagement solutions like Braze. We further believe that both the legacy replacement cycle and this vendor consolidation trend will accelerate as customers look to capitalize on new AI-driven advancements in customer engagement, an area of innovation, which benefits tremendously from the breadth of Braze's data footprint and messaging flexibility, as well as our real-time stream processing architecture. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call, existing at the leading edge of technology is in our DNA and at the core of our innovation roadmap. Braze is a company that perceives the opportunity presented by the coming wide-scale adoption of mobile more than a decade ago. And since then we've worked relentlessly to seize that opportunity through the use of sophisticated technology. For years Braze's had dedicated teams of data engineers and data scientists, focused on using machine learning to build AI into our product, with the goal of making marketers more effective and engaging their end users by optimizing customer journeys, generating more relevant content and enhancing targeting strategies. Even more importantly, we believe that the ability to use machine learning and generative AI are as fundamental to being a software engineer as using databases and writing secure code. As new technologies emerge, including but not limited to breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, our forward-looking R&D posture and highly extensible foundations allow us to quickly deliver innovation to our customers. You can see this track record in not only our long history of activating real-time first-party data through stream processing, but also with AI, including generative AI more recently. Braze debuted a GPT integration for email subject line generation over a year ago and we were early to integrate generative AI for images into the message composition experience, launching a dashboard integration with Dolly last December. More recently, we launched a message content checking tool, built on top of GPT4, helping marketers to avoid copyrighting mistakes, the accidental sending of text messages or sending culturally insensitive content. We're also testing a wide array of new capabilities including generating SQL for advanced segmentation and reporting use cases, automatically suggesting improvements to message copy during composition and even an adversarial AB testing simulator that we believe may be able to generate and predict winning message variants for populations before a campaign is even launched. Customers have been successfully using both our AI copyrighting assistant and automatic image generation for months to generate message content and inspire new engagement strategies. Lowering the burden of content creation while also serving as an in dashboard news encourages customers to bring new use cases into Braze more quickly, while also expanding their usage of the powerful experimentation features native to Canvas, our proprietary, no-code visual development environment. We believe this enhanced agility and reduce burden to test new ideas, further combines with our other machine learning driven experiment optimization capabilities, further compounding the ROI we deliver to our customers. We know from our customer base that even small or one person teams can still accomplish a lot with Braze and as a company that has never charged for seats, we expect to see generative AI-driven productivity enhancements for individual marketers translate into even more Braze usage over time. We believe this will further cement our stickiness and promote expansion into new user populations, driving higher message volumes and the adoption of more channels. Internally, we talk a lot about smoothing the on-ramp into Braze as a key part of ensuring that the differentiation presented by Braze's sophisticated capabilities remains broadly accessible to our ever-growing market, even to those who are early in their journey of adopting the modern practice of customer engagement. Over the last five years, we've seen an acceleration of two trends that highlight the importance of tackling this challenge, which also translates into a deeper moat for Braze's technology and our customer community. First is the rising imperative of collecting first-party data and making it available in real-time to engagement systems. And second is the increased ROI of tightly coordinating customer engagement with the product journey, often including the delivery of messaging directly inside the product experience. Both of these trends mean that the customer engagement professional who expands their traditional marketing skill set to include a deeper understanding of data analysis, product design and basic coding will find themselves generating higher ROI for their brand and advancing more quickly in their career. Braze's customer education and community investments are designed to help more marketers make this transition and we believe that the integration of generative AI into our platform and the pairing of AI with our Canvas environment more broadly will compound these efforts by further smoothing the on-ramp into Braze for our new customers, while encouraging the use of our advanced targeting personalization and experimentation capabilities for those that are already familiar with Braze. All of this is a continuation of a central principle of our product strategy, which is that immense value can be created when you place the power of programmability and data directly into the hands of those who are closest to the customer journey and brand promise. It's why we built Canvas and it's why we continue to view it with not only additional power and flexibility but also with enhanced usability and collaboration tools. And of course, generative AI isn't the whole story. Preceding these features has been a robust collection of automated decision-making techniques, using both machine learning and advanced statistical methods, including our Predictive Suite, Intelligence suite and a personalized varying capability integrated into the Canvas. Some of these features are already monetized directly through premium add-ons, while others are provided as part of our standard offering, a blended approach that we anticipate continuing as we release more AI features over time. All of these capabilities are integrated deeply into Braze's data flow and execution SAC, and represent early examples of what we believe will be an area of enduring differentiation for Braze. Underlying them is our differentiated architecture which distinguishes Braze from our competitors in three key ways. First is our comprehensive data flow and messaging capabilities. Last fiscal year, Braze processed over 13 trillion data points and sent over 2 trillion messages, all with our real-time stream processor. Customer data flows into Braze across our customer's data ecosystems, inclusive of direct integrations into their products and their data warehouses. We are also integrated into a wide array of consumer touchpoints and end user product interfaces, which enables us to take action across many channels. The inputs AI and the direct outputs from its decisions are both more flexible and comprehensive with Braze and the added value this represents is a key component of our ongoing success with vendor consolidation. Next is real-time execution. Our ability to ingest and act on newly generated data in real-time means that AI and Braze is able to make better decisions faster. Braze already employs multiple machine learning and statistical methods to enable automated decision-making in real-time within Canvas and we're experimenting with custom transformers for automated product recommendation that will be able to inject the outputs of generative AI into message content on a per user basis. Third is our focus on experimentation and programmability. Building on Canvas's flexibility and strengthening experimentation, we'll continue injecting both AI/ML and statistical techniques for automated decision-making into an increasing number of decision points throughout the user journey, enabling new AI techniques to be tested against existing manual strategies and again subsequent enhancement to our AI-driven methods. It's an incredibly exciting time to be leading a team as innovative as Braze in a market with as much potential as customer engagement. And even as we approach our 12-year anniversary this summer, it still feels like we're just getting started. Before I turn it over to Isabelle, I'd like to note that on June 1, we closed the acquisition of North Star, our exclusive reseller of Braze technology in Australia and New Zealand. We are thrilled to have brought their team fully in house and look forward to expanding in the Australia and New Zealand markets in the coming months and years. We look forward to updating you on our progress in that dynamic market. Despite macro challenges, we are confident in our ability to execute on our growth plan, while remaining disciplined and on a path to profitability. Further, we believe the investments in our products including generative AI in addition to the strong secular customer engagement wins at our backs positions Braze to become the industry standard for customer engagement in the coming years. And now, I will turn the call over to Isabelle.\nIsabelle Winkles: Thank you, Bill, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As Bill mentioned, we reported a strong first quarter with revenue up 31% year-over-year to $101.8 million. This was driven by a combination of existing customer contract expansion, renewals and new business. Our subscription revenue remains the primary component of our total top-line, contributing 95% of our first quarter revenue. The remaining 5% represents a combination of one-time configuration and onboarding fees as well as other recurring professional services. Total customer count increased 24% year-over-year to 1,866 customers as of April 30, up 363 from the same period last year and up 96 from the prior quarter. Our total number of large customers, which we define as those spending at least $500,000 annually, grew 27% year-over-year to 164 and as of April 30, contributed 57% to our total ARR compared to a 54% contribution as of the same quarter last year. Compared to last quarter, this reflects a 5% increase from 156 large customers that contributed 57% of our total ARR as of January 31. Measured across all customers, dollar-based net retention was 122%, while dollar-based net retention for large customers was 124%. Expansion was broadly distributed across industries and geographic regions. Revenue outside the U.S. contributed 43% of our total revenue in the first quarter, in line with the prior quarter. In the first quarter, our total remaining performance obligation was $478 million, up 22% year-over-year and up 5% sequentially. Current RPO was $325 million, up 28% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. The year-over-year increases were driven by contract renewals and upsells and the signing of new customer contracts. Overall dollar-weighted contract length remains at approximately two years. Non-GAAP gross profit in the quarter was $70 million, representing a non-GAAP gross margin of 68.8%. This compares to a non-GAAP gross profit of $52.5 million and non-GAAP gross margin of 67.8% in the first quarter of last year. The 100 basis point year-over-year margin improvement was driven by ongoing efficiencies related to personnel costs and continued economies of scale in our core technology expenses. Non-GAAP sales and marketing expense was $49.3 million or 48% of revenue compared to $40.2 million or 52% of revenue in the prior year quarter. While the dollar increase reflects our year-over-year investments in headcount costs to support our ongoing growth and global expansion, the improved efficiency reflects our disciplined investment approach to resource deployment across our go-to-market organization. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $19.6 million or 19% of revenue compared to $15.3 million or 20% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The dollar increase was primarily driven by increased headcount costs to support the expansion of our existing offerings as well as to develop new products and features to drive growth. Non-GAAP G&A expense was $17.1 million or 17% of revenue compared to $15 million or 19% of revenue in the prior year quarter. The dollar increase was driven by investments to support our overall company growth, including headcount costs and increases in software subscription and licenses. Non-GAAP operating loss was $16 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $18 million in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to Braze shareholders in the quarter was $12.6 million or a loss of $0.13 per share compared to a loss of $17.7 million or a loss of $0.19 per share in the prior year quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended the quarter with $507.4 million in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. Cash provided by operations during the quarter was $22.5 million compared to $17.9 million in the prior year quarter, driven by improved operating efficiencies, including improved spend management. While we reiterate that we expect our cash flow to fluctuate from quarter to quarter given the timing of customer and vendor payments, we note that this was the first period in which we delivered two consecutive quarters of positive operating cash flow, reflecting continued improvements in operating efficiency. Taking into consideration, the cash impact of capitalized costs, we generated $21.7 million of positive free cash flow compared to $15.7 million generated in the year ago quarter. Before I turn to the forecast, I'd like to make a few brief comments regarding Braze's application of AI and ML capabilities to internal productivity and efficiency. Beyond product use cases, Braze is rapidly experimenting with AI and ML capabilities throughout the organization via projects designed to shorten ramp times, improved productivity and streamline processes. Projects are in flight using both custom large language models and GPT4 via OpenAI's APIs to serve as co-pilots to our sales, solution consulting and post-sales teams, including an exciting project focused on customer support, which we believe will increase productivity and decrease enablement needs by improving discovery and automating research across our comprehensive public facing documentation and internal knowledge base. Across G&A functions, we believe there is a significant opportunity to use intelligent automation with machine learning in areas such as forecasting, human resources, accounting operations and internal audit. We will continue to implement and explore automation and AI/ML capabilities to complement decision-making and drive operational efficiencies. And now turning to our forecast. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2024 and interest in high quality customer engagement solutions remained strong. However, the broader macroeconomic environment remains challenging and as such, our guidance continues to assume the current macro environment persist through fiscal 2024. We intend to maintain cost discipline and reiterate comments made during our Q4 earnings call that we believe we are well positioned to achieve a non-GAAP operating margin of better than negative 7% in Q4 of this year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $108 million to $109 million, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 26% at the midpoint. This includes a $1 million contribution from our acquisition of North Star which closed on June 1. For the second quarter, non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $16 million. Second quarter non-GAAP net loss is expected to be $13 million to $14 million. And second quarter non-GAAP net loss per share in the range of $0.13 to $0.14 per share, based on approximately 97.4 million weighted average basic shares outstanding during the period. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $442.5 million to $446.5 million, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 25% at the midpoint. As a reminder, we expect our North Star acquisition to add less than 2% to fiscal year '24 revenue and our updated full-year guidance includes a $4 million contribution from North Star. Fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP operating loss is expected to be in the range of $54 million to $58 million. Non-GAAP net loss for the same period is expected to be in the range of $50 million to $54 million. Fiscal year 2024 non-GAAP net loss per share is expected to be $0.51 to $0.55 per share based on a full year weighted average basic share count of approximately 97.8 million shares. Our commitment to growing the top line while improving operating income and free cash flow margins remains unchanged. We reiterate that we expect Braze will achieve positive quarterly non-GAAP operating income and positive quarterly free cash flow by the end of fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. We are very excited about Braze's future. We're focused on growing our business and delivering best-in-class customer engagement at scale while effectively managing costs to achieve our long-term financial targets. And with that, we'll now open the call for questions. Operator, please begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan MacWilliams from Barclays. Please unmute your audio and ask your question.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for taking the question. Bill, how do you think generative AI real-time streaming processing more important in marketing campaigns. And any early signs on how generative AI could impact the number of interactions on your platform. Thank you.\nBill Magnuson: Yes, absolutely. And I spoke about this last quarter and it's one of the areas that I'm most excited about because of the way that it lowers the creative and content production burden and allows for more and more people to take advantage of the differentiated capabilities that we bring to bear through Canvas. And it's just generally pushing people in the direction toward more modern customer engagement. So we've been really excited to see the early adoption of generative AI features that we've had in the product for a while. We're seeing more and more customers discover these products, try them out, when they tried them, they're using them. They're moving content suggestions, textual an image-based directly into production campaigns. We are also promising feedback from our GPT4 driven content checking tool, including a marketer sharing with us that it gave them the confidence to move faster because it provides a robust copyrighting capability without having an individual that would actually provide that on their team. And with respect to pre-existing AI/ML features, these are widely used across our customer base, including through our Canvas. And I'd wager that many of our customers using them don't know that there's a machine learning going on under the hood for some of them and I think that's a great thing. We only call things AI until they fade into the background. And we're going to stay focused on the job that our customers have to do, deploying AI where it's most relevant and making sure that we're going to hold our product innovation to a high standard by rigorously field testing, new techniques as we conceptualize them. We're also really excited about some of the second order effects that this is going to cause and I can dig into those as people ask additional questions. But I think, when you look at it with respect to competition, when you look at the point I've made about Braze having a broad spectrum of both inputs and a flexible set of outputs, and I think if you think about what it takes to really fully leverage the automated decision-making capabilities, you need to have a full data picture that needs to be inclusive of the users historical behavior, their attributes, the evolving context around them as they either move through their own lives or the product journey they're having with your brand and you need to have the ability to quickly take action when the insights that are generated from that data, point you in a new direction. You want to nudge them toward taking a new high-value action. You want to try to avoid a bad outcome like churn or them drifting away. You want to move them to the next stage of their user journey or have them discover some new feature that's going to improve their stickiness. And you need to be able to process and understand those moments that matter and then immediately capitalize on them that are taking the right action. And I think when you look at whether it's a point solution competitor that's simply not there and all the moments that matter and has a destroying look at the data picture or you look at the legacy marketing clouds who suffer from destroying channel by channel architectures which inhibit cross channel use cases even today. And we know that their batch oriented data or architectures limit their ability to deliver real-time experiences. And that new reality is creating an even higher opportunity costs for companies who are remaining either on the legacy marketing clouds or continuing to use siloed point solutions. We believe that in order to take full advantage of what AI has to offer, you need to be comprehensively integrated to the user journey and executing in real-time at scale and that's just where Braze has been the whole time. And so, we're really excited to see. The market is moving toward us. The external community is really picking up on this. We're seeing adoption and repeat adoption of the newest generative AI features and we're just really excited to continue to see that momentum build.\nRyan MacWilliams: Yes, I agree, I think this definitely benefits to those that have shown product velocity over time. And for Isabelle, solid RPO performance in the quarter. Were there any deals or push out of 4Q into 1Q? And for new bookings, have you seen any signs of stabilization or improvement since the end of the quarter?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes, thanks for the question. So look, I think the overall evolution of the macro has not really changed. And what we're seeing in terms of elevated deal scrutiny and those elongated deal cycles, it is persisting. And so, we started talking about this last quarter, We are -- we continue to see that evolve and so there are deals from Q3 that pushed into Q4, deals from Q4 that pushed into Q1, and there were deals from Q1 that are pushing into Q2. So I think we're seeing some of that persist. But I do want to be clear that, that is embedded in our guidance philosophy and so that scenario is taken into consideration. And then, sorry, your second question?\nRyan MacWilliams: Just to say, in the quarter, have you seen any stabilization or improvement on new bookings?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So we're continuing to approach this. It was sort of a risk-adjusted view, but we are seeing some of the benefits of the investments that we've made to continue to improve and enhance overall productivity of our sales force. And so we are definitely seeing stabilization in those numbers. I wouldn't say that we're quite back where we want to be, but we are certainly having more productive conversations and certainly happy about the progress that we've made in the trajectory that we're on.\nRyan MacWilliams: Appreciate. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Gabriela Borges, Goldman Sachs.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon, and thank you, Bill, I wanted to ask on the longer-term implications of generative AI and what customers are telling you the way it's going to impact their budget. In other words, what are you hearing in terms of customer spending intentions on marketing, technology, and software, this marketing people versus other areas of the budget and is it actually leading to customers potentially thinking about taking up their budgets for marketing software over the medium term?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So I think about the marketers that are actually canceling keyboard in Braze as complementary investment that a brand needs to make into achieving customer engagement goals. And in some cases, when you look at the total cost of ownership of obviously software like Braze, one of the things that we've always tried to do is to make the individual marketer or the smaller team, more and more productive over time. And the more that we can do that, the more people can move from whether it's a basic email marketing strategy that they're maybe running before or batch and blast approach to things, maybe they're not putting in rigorous data analysis or maybe they're running on a six week or a three month cycle where they refresh content rather than getting down to the more agile teams that we see today. We know that as teams adopt a more agile methodology with more experimentation, they're trying out more content, more strategies, they are bringing more moments in the user journey into this agile and experimental framework instead of just having it be some sort of transactional message or something that is hard-coded which is so often the case with a lot of product delivery, you would -- as a brand you would definitely benefit from turning those into growth experiments. But you leave them where they are, because it just takes a lot of human power to be able to turn those into these experiments. And so we're really excited to see the impact of making the individual marketer more productive. I think that it will -- in my mind, I think right now the number of customer engagement practitioners and the economy is still very low compared to the potential that more and more brands have. I think that we're going to continue to see software like Braze make them even more productive, which improves the ROI function for bringing those teams together and for up-leveling them. And I think that there are also some just really exciting things happening from a skill set perspective, I spoke about some of the second order effects of there being more pressure toward getting higher speed data, to be able to have a more comprehensive view of it. I think also when we look at the second order effects of wide scale adoption of tools like ChatGPT, they're going to catalyze other changes in the labor force, and you're going to see more people becoming comfortable with basic scripting and other low code approaches automation. And you see that in some of the features that we have that we're working on right now where SQL or HTML templates or looking at data transformer, logic or the liquid logic that enables personalization, these are all slightly technical concepts that definitely are not accessible by all marketers. And what ChatGPT and other sorts of co-generating co-pilots are going to do is, it's going to -- first it's going to help generate them. But second, it's going to really teach people that they can be more comfortable working with these more advanced ideas. It also, I think, increases ROI in other systems to be able to use first party data and real-time data. Both of which should encourage ancillary investments that kind of pave the way for Braze to enter the environment, while also creating more catalysts to move off of legacy deployments, whether it's legacy data warehouses, maybe people moving from on-prem into the cloud to take advantage of more elastic compute capability or moving off of legacy Marketing Clouds and Point Solutions. So I think this all comes together and really at the end of the day by improving the ROI of the investment by enhancing productivity, we see -- we should see both the software spend and just the size and the skill set of the community around customer engagement continue to grow.\nGabriela Borges: Yes, that makes sense and it ties nicely into a little bit of the longer-term roadmap question. You mentioned the dynamic around consolidation of point products. You talked a little bit about competition. How are you thinking about Braze expanding longer term outside of marketing into perhaps adjacencies and other front office applications?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So when I look at this and look at the places where Braze's underlying foundation is supportive of us, continuing to take on more enterprise workloads and expand into new personas over time, it kind of models the -- or it parallels the same structure as I spoke about in the enduring differentiation that's going to drive forward our AI advantage. When you kind of break down Braze into these three parts, one of them is our comprehensive vertically integrated real-time data flow. The next one is the event-driven stream processor that gives a real-time kind of runtime and execution engine. And then you have experimentation and programmability through Canvas. And you saw just recently, we had a big productivity release, which was really focused on bringing more and more people into the Canvas environment, enabling it to be used for more use cases. And I think that when you extrapolate that forward, you see this future vision for Braze that really provides this real-time compute engine that lives in the flow of data being generated by customers through first party data as well as just other sorts of enterprise workflows. And provides the business user, the ability to not just kind of define these workloads in Braze but actually optimize and experiment with them over time. And so I'm not going to extrapolate exactly which markets we're planning on going into in the future through that, but when I look at the foundations that we have from a technical perspective and the early success that we've had, bringing these into the products here, bringing them into the data science and data engineering world, in addition to continuing to expand and break down the silos that exist within marketing teams, I think we have a proven ability already to bring disparate set of personas into the Braze environment really kind of create a home for them and produce value and encouraged collaboration amongst them as they bring more and more workloads into ultimately Canvas. And so as we continue to capture more of those, I think we see more scale. There is more of a center of gravity coming in because the data flow is all in that one place. People get comfortable turning more moments of their brand promise, their product journey, their -- whether it -- maybe it's their data governance or the way the data move through their organization and gets analyzed, the ways that they optimize, the data insights with AI and ML investments over time, those are all new personas that are coming in and ultimately moving those workloads to be executed by our stream processor and defined by the Canvas engine and that just creates tremendous potential and optionality for us in the future.\nGabriela Borges: Sounds good. Thanks for the detail.\nBill Magnuson: Absolutely.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Taylor McGinnis, UBS.\nTaylor McGinnis: Yes, hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to touch on the 2Q revenue guidance strength. So if we normalize 1Q and 2Q quarter-over-quarter growth for the two less days in the first quarter as well as North Star, it looks like at the high end of the 2Q organic guide, a sequential growth that is only a point below what we saw in 1Q. So the guide seems to apply some potential reversal of the decelerating sequential growth that we've seen. So can you just touch on what you saw in the quarter as well as what you're seeing in the demand environment today that's driving or giving you comfort in the outlook?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes, thanks for the question. So the 2Q guide excluding North Star, so excluding that $1 million, it does imply a little bit of a sequential reversion. But that is very seasonal. So remember, Q1, it's not two fewer days, it's actually three fewer days. And so that will then reverse in Q2 when we get the full 92 days in the quarter versus 89, so a part of that is seasonal. But we -- there is definitely some -- we're not necessarily seeing business -- material business re-acceleration, we are, of course, continuing to apply the same philosophical risk adjustment going forward. But you're seeing the seasonal difference between Q2 and Q1 there.\nTaylor McGinnis: Awesome. Thanks so much for answering my question.\nOperator: Next question will be from Michael Berg, Wells Fargo.\nMichael Berg: Hi, congrats on the quarter, and thanks for taking my question. I want to piggyback off of Gabriela's question on consolidation and competition. Maybe you can help us understand better, what's driving that currently in the near term. I think you guys announced you're going to have your resolution -- features are coming out soon and I think about that plus your data cloud ingestion capabilities, it seems like that may replace CDP, just as an example. So maybe you could help walk us through that dynamic. Thank you.\nBill Magnuson: Yes, I mean, I think all these things work together. So first, you continue to see expansion of our channel options which I've also referred to as kind of the outputs from the decision-making. And so as we've added WhatsApp in recent quarters, we continued to expand our audience network integrations, as we continued to increase the flexibility of -- in messages to include more robust surveys and other sorts of capture forms, and just kind of continue to march ahead the integration points and the number of touch points that our customers can manage through Braze. You'll see the point solutions continue to consolidate in. Then, when you look from a data perspective, I think that -- what we're trying to really accomplish is to make sure that people can get data into Braze quickly and that over time the operational burden of keeping that data flowing into the platform was lessened. And so, we definitely are going to continue to stay partnered with CDPm with Reverse ETL vendors and with the data warehouses, because those are all augmentation on top of the direct integrations into the products that our customers have. But our entire data picture is more than just making sure the inputs are coming in. We're also doing more from a data transformation and a data governance perspective and we're making it so that more of the operational data ingestion pipelines, if you will, is actually -- we're taking responsibility for that include -- inside of Braze so that when a marketer deploys Braze, they can go to their development team or their data engineering team at the integration point and they can have them help them set up the pipelines, but they don't -- those data teams then don't have the ongoing operational burden of babysitting them forever. We think that that actually improves the working relationship between marketers and between those data and engineering teams over time. It creates more organizational desire to actually move more and more use cases into Braze because it's a place that's delivering, not just the ROI through the capability, but it's doing so in a way that streamlined and operationally efficient. And then, of course, as you continue to move more use cases into place like Canvas and I mentioned this in response to Gabriela's more forward-looking question around what do we see in terms of the future workloads and the future personas that Braze can be executing on, we already see in our customer base, a lot of people leveraging the flexibility of Canvas to be kind of general purpose computation and to be able to do things like data transformations inside of Canvas, to be able to deliver products and aspects of the product experience through our flexible webhooks and the other logic that exist within it. And so when you kind of think about the extensibility there, you continue to pull in more use cases over time. And so just across the board, we're really thinking about how do we smooth the on-ramp of getting data into Braze, how do we make sure that over time organizations have across the entire set of people, collaborating, have got great perspective on Braze. It's not just a marketing tool that kind of libs inside of their ecosystem, it's really something that everyone can get value out of and that kind of gives them a home within it. And then you make it easy for them to bring new use cases in. You let them experiment and drive more value out of moving more and more workloads in the Canvas and give the massive flexibility to be able to deliver outputs, whether those are messages or product delivery or what have you through the flexibility of all of our different channels. And those combined together to just continue to push vendor consolidation.\nMichael Berg: Helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Derrick Wood with TD Cowen.\nDerrick Wood: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Bill, last quarter you guys talked about kind of relative strength in the enterprise, but seeing more acute headwinds down market. This quarter you had a stronger net new customer generation. Can you just talk about anything you'd flag and what drove that sequential strength and maybe just comment on what you saw across enterprise versus commercial cohorts?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So I think, as people are generally aware in SaaS, Q4 tends to be a pretty enterprise heavy quarter just because of the way the budget cycles work with a lot of these enterprises, and that definitely drives some Q4 specific behavior. As we got into Q1, I think that -- as Isabelle mentioned, we're continuing to broadly see a lot of the same pressures in the macro. And so a little bit more commercial business coming in, obviously, as you see in the net new customer adds. But I think, I would still characterize in broad strokes the differentiation between relative strength in those customer categories very similarly. I do think as well though, a lot of that -- I mean, this is again echoing what Isabelle said earlier, a lot of the work that we've done to improve execution, our work against competitor, tactics, and things like that, has all been really bearing fruit and we just continue to see Braze -- people across Braze all over the world, rising to the occasion of this difficult macro and making sure that we're executing during this time where it's such a great opportunity for us to be separating away from the competition. I know it's hard to always see that when the macro has such a tight lid on everybody's results, but we're really excited about the opportunity that this period represents, create separation in terms of market momentum, in terms of mindshare, really continuing to blow out the R&D velocity in such a meaningful way and we're really excited to see things start to improve. I'm not going to speculate on exactly when that's going to happen. We're still seeing a pretty similar environment as we have for the last couple of quarters, but we're excited about it. We're controlling everything we can and I think we're doing a great job of it.\nDerrick Wood: Got it. Isabelle, one for you. Very strong free cash flow in the quarter. I know as you commented, there tends to be volatility quarter-to-quarter, but any goalposts we should think about keeping in mind for free cash flow for the year versus how you're guiding operating income?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So I mean, I'm going to come back to the point that I've made over the last couple of quarters that free cash flow is going to continue to be volatile quarter in and quarter out. So we advise folks still hit it on more of a four quarter trailing. I'll reiterate the longer-term guide by the end of next year being both operating income positive by the fourth quarter of next year, in the quarter as well as free cash flow positive in that fourth quarter of next year. So look at that, look for that trajectory. I don't think it'll be linear. And so I would definitely expect some ebbs and flows there, which is part of the reason why we don't provide specific guidance on that metric.\nDerrick Wood: Got it. Well done. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Brent Bracelin with Piper Sandler.\nBrent Bracelin: Good Afternoon. I wanted to go back to kind of the macro-demand environment. Totally understand the environment is still challenging. Sales cycles remain challenging. But you did flag retail and media entertainment as one area of strength you saw in the quarter, I was hoping you could double click into the drivers of that improvement. Is there something specific to those verticals that's resonating around first party data, is it omnichannel? Just walk us through maybe a challenge macro in those environments, but Braze's ability to do a bit better. Thanks.\nBill Magnuson: Yes. I think it's both of those things. I think also Braze has shown tremendous ability over the years to get great reference and landmark accounts in categories and be able to leverage the increased -- know-how that we have around the business, and those customer examples to be able to continue to expand within those categories. We've also with -- retail and e-com in particular, we've also done a lot on the product side in order to do things like improve our Shopify integration and continue to build out e-com specific features. You saw the product catalog launch launched last year. We continue to enhance the capabilities of the product catalog over time and we're really excited about the future of that entire kind of data storage sitting along -- the capabilities of having that data storage sitting right alongside Canvas. And so I think that you'll continue to see over time Braze from a vertical perspective that, in any given year. we've seen our ability to build on prior momentum within different categories. There's other places where we spread our bets out and make sure that we're always cracking into new categories for the future, so that we can continue to have robust diversified growth even as things like the macro or other sorts of competition effects might hit a particular vertical or another. We've always been very diversified. And I think it's given a good durability and predictability to our results. And we're continuing to see that as well. However, or not however, I would say, and from a first-party data perspective, I think that we're seeing some really exciting investment and continued momentum in terms of how brands are thinking about first-party data. So most of the conversation about first-party data in the world recently has been largely, I would say, defensive or like focused on avoidance of loss, which is that, everyone is kind of talking about needing to invest in first-party data as their third-party datasets either become invalid, incomplete, illegal to use, et cetera, and they are frantically trying to build up our first-party data sets, so they can keep running the same performance marketing strategies as before. The next stage of that which is the stage that most Braze customers are at, is really realizing that first-party data has a job to do in describing your first-party relationships and understanding them. And once you can describe and understand them, when you pair that with customer engagement, you can then take action on them. And so at that point your customer relationships go from something that kind of exists and the either choose something you can really put your hands on as a brand and optimize and influence and move in a positive direction. We're really excited to see then the next stage of that is when customers start to look at their first-party relationships as an important brand asset and one that gives them the ability to have more flexibility within their business model, because on top of that customer relationship, you can start to expand the breadth of products and services that you're delivering to them. You can extend the lifetime of the relationship with the customer and you. Of course, that's all helped by customer engagement. And so, I think broadly you're seeing this transition as people start to wake up the first-party data, they start to collect it in the early days. Then they realize, once they have it. it's something that they can start to take action on and then those relationships start to feed into more innovative business strategy. And we see that whole spectrum across both our prospect and customer base, but it's an evolution that's all moving in one direction and it all points toward more future success for us.\nBrent Bracelin: Sounds good. It's great to see the soft execution. Thank you.\nBill Magnuson: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Peterson with Raymond James.\nBrian Peterson: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just one from me. So I wanted to double-click on the vendor consolidation point. I know it's come up with other questions. But, Bill, you mentioned that as a benefit this quarter, would you characterize that as something that's really reflecting this year or is that more of a continuation of the norm? How do we think about the balance of cross-sell versus upsell in that -- our metric this year. Thanks, guys.\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So I think we are seeing a bit of an inflection, obviously, as I mentioned before with the macro where it is -- it's hard to really compare to historical data because there are some other conflating factors that are out there. But if you think through what's going on with enterprise software buying right now, there's a lot more scrutiny on the budgets and the stack and there has been a lot of categories where you've seen people moving from either a point solution or maybe someone bought a suite before, but they were really only using it for a single thing and starting to really rationalize all of that spend. And I think that when you look across all of the different marketing communication software that's out there more broadly, that Braze really stands head and shoulders above the rest of the competitive set in terms of being really comprehensive from a cross-channel perspective and really being able to execute on all these use cases. I've spoken in the past about the importance of Braze's vertical stack design where, because we put such a strong abstraction layer over the channels, the feature set that you have within Braze for any given channel has a lot of consistency across it. And that means that when we add a new channel like we just launched WhatsApp recently, our marketers are immediately able to utilize all of the advanced capabilities that exist for targeting, for personalization, for orchestration, with that brand new channel right out of the box. And so Braze is very quickly competitive with even single channel-focused software as we add new channels. Similarly, not just from a feature set perspective but actually from a familiarity perspective, because we've been designed to have all of these integrated together, which as I mentioned before, is very different from how the legacy marketing clouds were assembled which was mostly through inorganic expansion where all the channels kind of work a little bit differently, the feature sets are heterogeneous across them, within Braze you have this consistent user experience. And so, marketers are able to confidently say like, oh, yes, I know how to send push notifications in Braze. I can also send SMS. I can also send WhatsApp. I know how to deliver in-app messages within Braze. I can expand that on my website. I can add it to my inbox. I can start to run surveys. There's just a lot that we've done to smooth the on-ramp and that expansion ramp both for new customers to come in and feel confident that they can pull together four or five prior vendors and run all those use cases through Braze, as well as maybe someone that only started with one or two channels in Braze, then systematically going through the rest of their ecosystem and really having that Braze be the center of gravity around all of their customer engagement use cases. And so that's something that we continue to see happening over time and that has been the consistent pressure. I think the macro has probably caused people to really go and scrutinize some of the decisions they made in the past to kind of blow out a number of different point solutions, when they maybe didn't have as much scrutiny on the purchasing. And then similarly, another important thing that's happening is just more collaboration across these teams. And so I mentioned that earlier about thinking about marketing and product and data teams and so, there are certain product use cases that you may have bought either a different vendor for, like our launch of Feature Flags that we had last fall, or maybe you look at something like simple surveying where someone would have bought a different product. Also within the marketing organization, the same pressure exists. So there's -- there previously hadn't been a ton of collaboration between the performance marketing teams and the customer engagement teams. As you start to see first-party datasets becoming more important for performance marketing strategies, you've got more collaboration happening between those teams. And that means that you've got things like our Audience Syncing, which started out with Facebook and Google, Audience Manager integrations, a couple of years ago when we launched that, we've since expanded into a whole bunch of other ad networks, looking at places like TikTok and Pinterest and LinkedIn, and what have you. And that actually is now creating a reason for more teams to collaborate with each other within the Braze environment and that continues to support the vendor consolidation drive because more use cases are coming into Braze. And so, I think that it's at a -- we're noticing more of it. A big part of that is because of the rapid development velocity of the product. Another part is the macro and then you've got that longer-term process happening with just greater collaboration amongst these different groups.\nBrian Peterson: Thanks, Bill.\nBill Magnuson: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from D.J. Hynes with Canaccord.\nD.J. Hynes: Hi, guys. Bill, maybe you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of adoption of cloud data ingestion. And then, for the customers that turn that capability on, what are you seeing in terms of signs that maybe A, they're spending more with Braze, or B, yielding better results? Any color there would be helpful.\nBill Magnuson: Yes, absolutely. So when look at cloud data ingestion and the impact on kind of revenue and adoption, it breaks down in a few ways. One of them is just more time to value, faster time to value, being able to get people up and running more quickly, and being able to therefore get more datasets. And so one of the impacts that you often see, whether we add a new channel and a new set of use cases or we add a new data source, there's a lot of times those data sources are describing users that previously had not appeared in wherever we were integrated before. So you had your mobile audience and maybe there was a customer loyalty program database that was living in the data warehouse, you wanted to be able to get those users into Braze to start orchestrating either emails to people or SMS or whatever it is, but you were stuck on in an engineering roadmap and it's going to take six to four months to get the integration or what have you. By us drastically reducing the amount of effort required to get those new datasets into Braze, we take on more use cases that brings in more monthly active users, it adds more message volumes. And as we've spoken about a lot in the past, we're really trying to make sure that when we value sell, we do so in a way where we're enhancing the value of the monthly active user, that we're collecting the value of a contract primarily in the middle of the SAC. We're really trying to make sure that when data is flowing into Braze that we're always working to kind of lower the cost of getting data into Braze, both in the near term and the long term. And so we're seeing great adoption of that by new customers and existing customers as they want to bring in datasets that were previously kind of stuck in those data warehouses. And we're already seeing, in terms of just like quantitative numbers, we're already in the billions of rows ingested across cloud data ingestion since it launched last fall. We also are looking at things like expanding the cloud data ingestion concepts into product catalogs, which I mentioned before, has been a driver of the e-com business. And that gives you an ability to bring in not just data about users but also data that's coming in from obviously a product catalog, maybe it's about your franchises, maybe it's other sorts of data around translations. There's a whole bunch of other datasets that can come in that aren't keyed on the user. that we're making it easier and easier to get into Braze so that it can sit alongside the stream processor.\nD.J. Hynes: Makes sense. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you. Bill, I wanted to touch on the legacy marketing cloud refresh cycle that we've been talking about. Can you just help us understand why this is happening now? It's certainly a positive for someone with a more modern stack. Why is this taking place now and what have you noticed about the customers that have come from legacy marketing clouds to Braze in terms of their sophistication, their usage, their scale, et cetera?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So first, I point out that the -- we think the legacy replacement cycle is broader than just people moving from the legacy marketing clouds into more advanced platform like Braze. There's also a lot of legacy point solutions that are out there in the email marketing space and there is a kind of a broad away or array of tools that have been deployed over the last 10 to 15 years that are not just the usual suspects of Salesforce Marketing Cloud or the Adobe Experience Cloud or the Oracle Marketing Cloud. And we spoke about this last quarter, I think we continue to see it, which is that, when you look across the rest of that legacy landscape, I think that those aforementioned legacy marketing clouds were actually hovering up a good portion of the legacy replacement cycle across those other tools before. I mean Braze didn't have as much mind share or market share awareness amongst those buyers. I think that's pretty fundamentally changed over the last probably call out the last 12 to 18 months. Certainly, the notoriety of having gone public helped with that a lot of -- that we've done in our ecosystem strategy with our partners, looking at the GSIs and our partnership with WPP and just continuing to expand and get our -- get the Braze brand and Braze product awareness into more corners. And I think we've also seen some of the shine come off of those legacy marketing clouds too as buyers have started to understood -- or understand more deeply that they are antiquated data processing architectures and destroying capabilities they have across their multiple channels, but not coordinated seamlessly across channels. That -- those are differences that really matter. And so that is really helping. And then, obviously, we also continue to have the inflow from the legacy marketing clouds as marketers and product teams are trying to be able to act on data and more real-time be able to bring together more of these channels and more of the use cases. I think that one thing that always helps there is when we continue to add net new channels very quickly, if you want to be able to send WhatsApp, if you want to be able to do the Audience Network integrations, you want to be able to coordinate those things in real-time and have them be triggered by not just actions within their silo but be able to cross coordinate the data inputs across disparate platforms and product interfaces and actually then deliver in these other channels, many of which are new or expanding quickly, these are all the catalysts that really get you to move on from your old strategies. There's also a lot that's just happening in the broader landscape that is starting -- continuing to put pressure on it. So if you look at things like Apple mail privacy that launched or the app tracking transparency, changes that continue to gain CE more -- the continued deprecation of cookies like, these are all things that have made operating siloed software much harder. You're like flying more and more blind over time unless you're meaningfully integrated into the product journey. And similarly this -- lot of the changes that are happening around things like email deliverability, you look at a lot of the kind of spam filtering that's getting more aggressive even in channels like SMS or in notification centers, or push notifications, all of these create increased returns to sophistication for marketers. And they make it so that if you're still just running the same basic strategies, they are less and less often even getting in front of your end consumer's eyeballs. And so just staying in place and continuing to use this old software is not just holding steady, it's actually actively deteriorating. And I think when people wake up to that, they don't find an ability to actually evolve the sophistication of their strategies in that old software and they need to upgrade to some more like Braze.\nArjun Bhatia: That's very helpful. Thank you, Bill.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Brian, you may unmute and ask your question. We'll come back. Next question will be from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you and let me add my congratulations. So Bill, when you look at sort of your partnership opportunities, what are you most excited about? And what's out there that you guys don't have yet that you'd like to get?\nBill Magnuson: Yes. I mean we've been really excited about the momentum that we've seen across the GSIs and across the big marketing agencies and specifically, we talked a lot about WPP last quarter. We're continuing to deepen our coordination with those partners and also seeing them continue to build their bench of certified people within their teams that are ready to integrate Braze, ready to help our customers run campaigns and evolve them over time. And so that's been really good to see that flywheel that I've spoken about over the last couple of quarters is really starting to spin. Within the technology partner landscape, we've been continuing to partner really closely all up and down the stack, looking at data warehouse providers, looking at a lot of the data transformation players, continuing to have channel partnerships as well to expand out there. I spoke about the Audience Network generation -- the Audience Network expansions as we've gone into more and more ad network targeting, as well as obviously the partnership with Meta as we've expanded into WhatsApp. So there's a lot that we've been doing across the partnership landscape and we're continuing to invest in those. I'd also go back to some of the ecosystem wide effects that we think we're going to see as a lot of the -- a lot of decision-making at the corporate level is going to try to optimize for getting more value out of AI. I think that these are also pressures that are going to motivate more brands to move to real-time, embrace data streaming, continue to ramp up their investments in first-party data, all of which are catalysts which are going to help drive that legacy replacement cycle. And I think that means that our partners in the modern data ecosystem are going to stand the benefit. And so whether those pressures caused them to really look at customer engagement first or it causes them to look at the rest of their data ecosystem and start to upgrade all of it to be more real-time, to be based on streaming, to be cloud-based, like whatever it is, that is really their evolution. Those are all things that help our partners and it further smooths the path to them becoming a Braze customer over time.\nPat Walravens: Awesome. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will be from Brian Schwartz with Oppenheimer. Brian, please press to unmute.\nCamden Levy: Good afternoon. this is Camden Levy, sitting in for Brian Schwartz today. Thank you for taking my question. Can you speak about the momentum you've seen with global GSIs and sourcing new business? And if possible any insight you can provide on the percentage of your net new ARR that is currently derived from these growing relationships. Thanks.\nBill Magnuson: Yes. So we're not disclosing that quantitatively, but I will say that qualitatively, as I just mentioned, we continue to see that flywheel spin up. We've got really great account coordination. We've got all the right -- communication channels are in place. We've got mutual investment on both sides and we're excited to see how those partnerships continue to bear fruit over time. When you look at the broad evolution of where -- I think the GSIs are trying to move to have more creative services, to be able to work on more of these customer engagement and marketing use cases. When you look at the marketing agencies and the big holding companies, they're trying to evolve to have more data sophistication and be able to help with more of these ongoing integrations and really kind of -- really express our technical chops and Braze exists right at the intersection of where both sides of that landscape want to evolve to. And so we've been really excited to be their partner, help -- bring them into this new world of modern customer engagement, to be able to do more with first-party data, to be able to do it faster, to be able to bring more value through experimentation and agility. I think that one of the topics that we spoke a lot about at the beginning of this call was just what more you can do when you've got more productivity, you have more access to hands on keyboards, to have resources to be able to run these strategies and evolve them over time and that's one of the things that's most exciting about our partnerships in that landscape is that it just brings more able hands and minds to the strategies that our customers want to be able to run and help them evolve and improve them over time.\nCamden Levy: Perfect. I appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nick Altmann with Scotiabank.\nNick Altmann: Awesome. Thanks, guys. Just given the strength in billings and customer count and the sequential step up you're guiding too in revenue for 2Q, I know, Isabelle, you talked about deals that slipped out of 4Q closed in Q1, but I'm curious just, was there any sort of pull-forward activity of bookings in the 1Q? Thanks.\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So there is some push out of Q4. If you think about -- if you remember, in Q4, we talked about a pretty back-end loaded bookings quarter. And so the way we count customer count is by when we actually start recording revenue which means the customer start date has to have actually passed. And so if you book a brand new deal on the very last day of the quarter -- in the last, or in the last week of the quarter, it's going to take a little bit of time for that to become a new customer. So some of that is timing and some of that -- and then we've seen some of that happened in Q1 pushing out into Q2. I mentioned that in answering a previous question. With regards to the guide, I'll come back to a little bit of the seasonality. We're not forecasting any improvement in the overall environment. In fact, we're -- our guide philosophy is generally unchanged but we are -- including the fact that sequentially, there are three extra days in Q2 versus Q1. Q1 is just seasonally our lowest sequential revenue quarter. And then you will see that start to reverse going into Q2.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Yun Kim of Loop.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. First, Isabelle, can you just talk about the how international regions performed in the quarter, especially on the heels of the WhatsApp integration release?\nIsabelle Winkles: Yes. So WhatsApp, look, just released in March of this year. And so we're seeing a lot of interest by customers and a lot of good momentum in pipeline. But we're not meaningfully yet adding to revenue from that channel. We saw the same thing with SMS when we launched this about a little over three years ago. So there's a lot of kind of keen interest and we look forward to kind of that adding overall. We don't disclose the net contribution from various channels, because we'd like to think of the channels as sort of all working together and that's really just what I would say about the WhatsApp contribution.\nYun Kim: Okay, great. And Bill, real quick. Do you expect that generative AI to work better and more -- and be more impactful on certain messaging channels that are more real-time driven, for instance.\nBill Magnuson: I wouldn't call it out across channels. But one of the things I'm most excited about with respect to generative AI, especially as we're talking about some of these smaller teams or one person teams is, because of the ubiquitous global adoption of smartphones and I think that just the app stores in general, more brands than ever before serve global audiences. But many of their customer engagement teams are still isolated to just one country or a handful of countries. And one of the best features of LOM as a co-pilot is their inclusion of a wide array of cultures, human personas, different languages. And so I spoke about generative AI being amuse earlier. And I think it's a lot more than just getting over writer's block. It's also about enabling a marketer, who is kind of lived just one life in one place to connect better with a globally diverse audience. And when you combine that with Braze's personalized varying capability and some of the other automated decision-making capability that we have in Canvas, what it does is, it provides just substantially more inputs for us to go and optimize. And so that's going to move across channels. And I think that the key part is that more of the user journey that gets into Canvas, the more the workloads that are defined there, gives us the mapping of all the different moments that we have to be able to intervene. And when we can improve the kind of diversity of different techniques and engagement strategies that an individual marketer is using or generating within Braze, we can then unleash our AI on it and really go and optimize the results for them in a way that they just never would have been able to access before.\nYun Kim: Great. Thank you so much and congrats on a solid quarter.\nBill Magnuson: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: I will now pass the call back to Bill for closing remarks.\nBill Magnuson: All right. Well, thank you to everybody for joining the call today. We appreciate your continued support and we look forward to seeing you either at a conference or on the roads. Thanks a lot."
