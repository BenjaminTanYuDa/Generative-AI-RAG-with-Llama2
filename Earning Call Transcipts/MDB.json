After the speaker's presentation [Technical Difficulty] question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] [Technical Difficulty] I will now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Brian Denyeau. [Technical Difficulty] Go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Thanks, Valerie. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB's fourth quarter fiscal 2024 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB, and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, our expectations for the macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2025 and the impact of AI, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial conditions, that cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For discussion of material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on December 7, 2023. Any forwarding-statements made in this call reflect our views only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them except if required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the investor relations portion of our website for reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter that capped off an impressive year as we continue to execute well to capture a large market opportunity. I will start by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year results before giving you a broader company update. Starting with the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of $458 million, a 27% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 34% year-over-year, representing 68% of revenue. We generated non-GAAP operating income of $69.2 million for a 15% non-GAAP operating margin, and we ended the quarter with over 47,800 customers. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. We had a healthy quarter of new business led by continued strength in new workload acquisition within our existing Atlas customers. In addition, our Enterprise Advanced business again exceeded our expectations, demonstrating strong demand for our platform and the appeal of our run anywhere strategy. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends, the quarter played out in line with our expectations and we saw a stronger consumption than in Q4 last year. Michael will discuss consumption trends in more detail. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q4, reinforcing the quality of our product and the mission criticality of our platform. Stepping back and looking at fiscal ‘24 as a whole, I'm proud of what we accomplished. We achieved revenue growth of 31% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 16%, well above our initial expectations. Atlas grew 37% year-over-year, and we added over 7,000 customers, ranging from AI startups to Fortune 500 companies. We had a record year of fast-paced innovative product releases such as Vector Search, Queryable Encryption, and the preview of Atlas Stream Processing, reinforcing why so many customers and developers choose MongoDB's developer data platform. Finally, we continue to innovate on our go-to-market motion to drive workload acquisition. As we look into fiscal ‘25, let me share with you what I see in the market. First, I'm excited about our opportunity to win new business. In today's digital world, customers express their business strategy through software. The software [indiscernible] strategy that one of the most important investments a company can make is in the productivity of its software developers. Consequently, customers are gravitating towards MongoDB as their next generation developer data platform standard. Second, I see stable consumption growth going into next year. Atlas consumption trends have been steady for several quarters now, and we experienced less consumption variability in fiscal ‘24 compared to fiscal ‘23. Ultimately, the main driver of Atlas consumption is the growth in the underlying application usage and we see stable usage growth across our portfolio of workloads. Third, while I strongly believe that AI will be a significant driver of long-term growth for MongoDB, we are in the early days of AI, akin to the dial-up phase of the Internet era. To put things in context, it's important to understand that there are three layers to the AI stack. The first layer is the underlying compute and LLMs. The second layer is the fine-tuning of models and building of AI applications. And the third layer is deploying and running applications that end users interact with. MongoDB’s strategy is to operate at the second and third layers to enable customers to build AI applications by using their own proprietary data together with any LLM, close or open source, on any computing infrastructure. Today the vast majority of AI spend is happening in the first layer, that is investments in compute to train and run LLMs. Neither are areas in which we compete. Our enterprise customers today are still largely in the experimentation and prototyping stages of building their initial AI applications, first focus on driving efficiencies by automating existing workloads. We expect that it will take time for enterprises to deploy production workloads at scale. However, as organizations look to realize the full benefit of these AI investments, they will turn to companies like MongoDB, offering differentiated capabilities in the upper layers of the AI stack. Similar to what happened in the internet era, when value accrued over time to companies offering services and applications leveraging the built-out Internet infrastructure, platforms like MongoDB will benefit as customers build AI applications to drive meaningful operating efficiencies, create compelling customer experiences, and pursue new growth opportunities. We already see our platform resonating with innovative AI startups building exciting applications for use cases such as real-time patient diagnostics for personalized medicine, cyber threat data analysis for risk mitigation, predictive maintenance for maritime fleets, and auto-generated animations for personalized marketing campaigns. Finally, our competitive position is getting stronger. Our win rates remain very high across all competitors. We rarely compete with legacy database providers as enterprises understand that they need to move away from inefficient and brittle legacy technology. We also rarely run into niche database players since customers are overwhelmed by the proliferation of point solutions that are hard to manage and add limited value. Our main competition remains the cloud players. They offer a wide array of database options, relational and non-relational, and benefit from their size and reach. We compete well against these players due to the flexibility and scalability of our document architecture. The fact that our open platform can run anywhere and avoids lock-in and MongoDB's popularity among developers all around the world. Finally, when you look at our newer products, we see increased success competing against the established players in those markets. We find that the same principle applies as in the core database market. Customers don't want to manage a myriad of point solutions and prefer consolidating their spend with strategic vendors, especially in the current cost conscious environment. In summary, we expect the environment in fiscal ‘25 to be largely similar to the environment we experienced in fiscal ‘24. With that backdrop, let me tell you what our priorities are going to next year. First, we'll continue pressing our product advantage in the core database, since we believe customers will place an even greater premium on performance and scalability in the AI enabled world. In addition, we'll continue maturing our newer products, including additional features of Vector Search, GA of Atlas Stream Processing, and enhancements to other offerings. Second, we will remain singularly focused on new workload acquisition as the key long-term driver of our business. We will continue fine-tuning incentives to ensure that our entire go-to-market organization is focused on identifying and sourcing new workload opportunities. In addition, we will leverage our expertise and learnings from our self-serve business to use product-led growth techniques to increase the adoption of Atlas by other development teams within our existing large enterprise accounts. Third, we are focused on growing sales capacity. As we told you in the past, we were slow to grow capacity in fiscal ‘24, especially in the first half due to macro uncertainty. Given that the market is more stable now and that we remain under-penetrated compared to our opportunity, we'll increase the pace of go-to-market investments in fiscal ‘25. Fourth, we will continue investing to become a standard in more of our customer base. We intend to double the size of our strategic account program and dramatically expand our account-based marketing efforts in our largest accounts. Finally, we remain focused on locking the relational migration opportunity. To remind everyone, there are three elements to migrating an application, transforming the schema, moving the data, and rewriting the application code. Our current relational migrator offering is designed to automate large parts of the first two elements, but rewriting application code is the most manually intensive element. GenAI holds tremendous promise to meaningfully reduce the cost and time of rewriting application code. We will continue building AI capabilities into Relational Migrator, but our view is that the end solution will be a mix of products and services. This year, we are investing in a number of pilots leveraging AI for relational migrations paired with services to substantially simplify and scale the process. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries around the world are running mission-critical projects on MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of a developer data platform, including ZF, Forbes, and Swiss Federal Railways. ZF, a global technology company supplying systems for passenger cars, commercial vehicles, and industrial technology, needed a central database solution with broad functionality to support more than 300,000 commercial vehicles connected to ZF infrastructure. ZF originally began using MongoDB on-premise in 2014 and migrated to MongoDB Atlas to modernize the architecture behind its new fleet orchestration solution. The team now uses time series and online archive to reduce the overall data storage size, as well as MongoDB Atlas Search to manage indexes and Atlas Charts to display billing information. MongoDB's developer data platform enables ZF to release new features faster as innovative technologies like drones and autonomous vehicles continue to come to market. In any -- PicPay and Anywhere Real Estate are examples of customers turning to MongoDB to free up the developers' time for innovation while achieving significant cost savings. Anywhere Real Estate, a global leader in residential real estate services whose brand portfolio includes Better Homes and Gardens, Century 21, Coldwell Banker, Corcoran, ERA, Sotheby's International Realty, is leveraging MongoDB Atlas and Atlas Search to greatly enhance its search capabilities. Their previous solution was too costly and operationally burdensome to maintain. Now with Atlas Search, they can ingest data from hundreds of MLS sources, aggregate the data and provide customers with a search solution that efficiently delivers accurate and up-to-date information, saving time and lowering costs. Anywhere is also exploring the use of Atlas Vector Search to provide semantic search and GenAI features to millions of consumers. Samsung Electronics, ArcelorMittal and Citizens Bank are turning to MongoDB to marinize applications. Samsung Electronics digital appliances division transitioned from their previous MySQL database to MongoDB Atlas to manage their clients data more effectively. By leveraging MongoDB's document model, Samsung’s smart home service can collect real-time data from the team's AI-powered home appliances and use it for a variety of data-driven initiatives such as training AI services. Their migration to MongoDB Atlas improved response times by more than 50% and disk read latency was reduced from 3 seconds to 18 millisecond, significantly improving availability and developer productivity. Let me wrap up by saying that I remain highly confident about our ability to execute on our long-term growth opportunity. We are pursuing one of the largest and fastest-growing markets in all of software, with significant expansion opportunities in both new and existing customer accounts. While it's early days, we expect that AI will not only support the overall growth of the market, but also compel customers to revisit both their legacy workloads and build more ambitious applications. This will allow us to win more new and existing workloads and to ultimately continue to establish MongoDB as a standard in enterprise accounts. Before I turn it over to Michael, I would like to personally invite all of you to attend the investor session at MongoDB.localNYC to be held at the Javits Center on May 2nd. Please email ir@mongodb.com if you're interested in attending. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our fourth quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025. First I'll start with our fourth quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $458 million, up 27% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance. As Dev mentioned, we had another quarter of healthy new business acquisition, demonstrating our product market fit and the mission criticality of our platform. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 34% in the quarter compared to the previous year and now represents 68% of total revenue compared to 65% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and 66% last quarter. We recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform, and that consumption is closely related to end user activity of the application. As a reminder, in Q4 fiscal ‘23, we had a higher than normal amount of revenue from unused commitments, making this a tough year-over-year comparison. Excluding the impact of unused commitments, Atlas year-over-year growth in Q4 was in line with the growth that we observed in Q3. Let me provide some additional context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. As we shared in our guidance last quarter, we were expecting consumption to be impacted by the seasonal slowdown in Q4 around the holidays. Week-over-week consumption growth in Q4 was stronger than in Q4 of last year and in line with our expectations. We've seen less consumption variability this year, and so as in Q3 we forecasted less of a seasonal impact than in prior years and that's exactly what we saw. Turning to non-Atlas revenue, EA exceeded our expectations in the quarter and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. Ongoing EA strength speaks to the appeal and success of our run anywhere strategy. The EA revenue app performance was in part a result of more multi-year deals than we had expected. As a reminder, the term license component for multi-year deals is recognized as upfront revenue at the start of the contract and therefore includes term license revenue related to future years. Turning to customer growth, during the fourth quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,400 customers sequentially bringing our total customer count to over 47,800, which is up from over 40,800 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 7,000 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 6,400 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 46,300 customers at the end of the quarter, compared to over 39,300 in the year-ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth of our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB, in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. Moving on to ARR, we had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 2,052 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,651 in the year-ago period. We also finished the year with 259 customers spending a million dollars or more annualized on our platform compared to over 213 a year ago. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the fourth quarter was $353.6 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is down from 78% in the year-ago period. As we said at the time, our gross margin in the year-ago period reflected a one-time benefit of roughly 2.5 percentage points related to one of our cloud partner contracts. Our income from operations was $69.2 million, or a 15% operating margin for the fourth quarter, compared to a 10% margin in the year-ago period. Our strong bottom-line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and are a clear indication of the strength in our underlying unit economics. The primary reason for our operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. Net income in the fourth quarter was $71.1 million, or $0.86 per share, based on 82.9 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to net income of $46.4 million, or $0.57 per share, on 80.8 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the fourth quarter with $2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the fourth quarter was $54.6 million and $121.5 million for the full fiscal year 2024. After taking into consideration approximately $4.1 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $50.5 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $23.8 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. For the full fiscal year ‘24, free cash flow was $109.9 million compared to negative $24.7 million in fiscal ‘23. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $436 million to $440 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $22 million to $25 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.39 based on 83.8 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2025, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.9 billion to $1.93 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $186 million to $201 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.27 to $2.49, based on 85.1 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP income per share guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context on our guidance, starting with the full year fiscal ‘25, where we're facing difficult compares in two ways. First, we expect to recognize close to zero revenue from unused Atlas commitments in fiscal 25, compared to over $40 million in fiscal ‘24. As you may recall, in fiscal ‘24, we changed our sales incentive structure to reduce the importance of upfront commitments. And so we saw far fewer upfront commitments. Therefore, as those fiscal ’25 -- ‘24 deals come up for renewal in fiscal ‘25, we expect to see limited revenue related to unused commitments. Second, in fiscal ‘24, we recognized approximately $40 million more in multiyear license revenue than we did in fiscal ‘23. As you know, our fiscal year ‘24 non-Atlas revenue benefited from a higher-than-usual amount of license revenue related to multi-year contracts, including our extended partnership with Alibaba. Clearly we are pleased with the fiscal ‘24 performance, but it was unusual in terms of the magnitude of multi-year deals and we don't expect similar performance in fiscal ‘25. As a result, we expect non-Atlas revenues to be modestly down in fiscal ‘25. Next, we expect Atlas consumption growth to be in line with the consumption growth we've experienced in fiscal ‘24. Finally, I want to provide some context to better understand our operating margin guidance. The $80-plus-million of fiscal ‘24 revenue that won't repeat in fiscal ‘25 was very high margin, making for an exceptionally tough operating margin compare. In addition, as we mentioned in the past, in fiscal ‘24 we began increasing our pace of hiring relatively late in the year. So the full cost from those investments will impact our fiscal ‘25 operating margin. We're expecting headcount growth in the mid-teens versus 9% growth in fiscal ‘24. And as Dev mentioned, we are prioritizing growth in sales productive capacity. Consequently, we expect to see a year-over-year operating margin decline while still delivering 500 basis points of margin expansion on a two year basis. We believe this is the most appropriate way to understand our continued margin progression. Moving on to our Q1 guidance, a few things to keep in mind. First, we expect Atlas revenue to be flat to slightly down sequentially. Q1 has two fewer days than Q4 this year, which represents a revenue headwind. Also, the slower Atlas consumption growth during the holidays will have a bigger impact on Q1 revenue than it did in Q4, thereby negatively impacting sequential revenue growth. Finally, the sequential impact from the expected decline in unused Atlas commitments will be most pronounced in Q1, given that we made the changes in Q1 of last year. Second, we expect to see a meaningful sequential decline in EA revenue. As discussed in past years, Q4 is our seasonally highest quarter in terms of our EA renewal base, which is an excellent indicator of our ability to win new EA business. In Q1, the EA renewal base is sequentially much lower. Finally, we expect operating income to decline sequentially due to lower revenue as well as our increased pace of hiring. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong fourth quarter results. We're pleased with our ability to win new business and see stable consumption trends in Atlas. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and will continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the question. Michael, I wanted to walk through the guidance with you a little bit. This time last year, coming out of Q4 ‘23, it was a pretty different environment, a much more cautious environment. I think usage growth was particularly impacted in Atlas last year. This year coming into fiscal year ‘25, things feel a little bit healthier or at least stable in sort of how you guys are framing it. And yet the guidance, the initial guidance for growth looks a lot like the initial guidance growth for last year. Just trying to understand, and I know you talked about some of the one-time impacts from last year, but just in terms of a better spending environment versus an initial guide that looks also pretty similar to last year, could you sort of frame out like the conservatism that you have embedded in guidance.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So a couple of things. Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think the key thing is, once you adjust for those one-time items that we called out, we see a stable environment. That's what we described and experienced in Q4 compared to Q3. So we feel good about that. I think just to underscore, there's the $80 million in revenue that won't repeat both from the unused commitments as well as from the multi-year deals. And when you adjust from those, we feel good about the dynamic. To your question, which is sort of embedded in that around, sort of I'll call it, guidance approach or approach to guidance, we haven't changed our view as it relates to guidance. We have seen more stable consumption that obviously gives us higher confidence, in part given the less variability that we've seen over the course of fiscal ‘24. I think we also have a better understanding of the underlying seasonality of the business. We had updated at the end of last year in our call, in our Q3 call, around the success that we're having on EA, and we had updated those EA new business assumptions, and so that our guidance reflects kind of continued strength there. So I think that's how we approach it, but there are no fundamental changes, but hopefully we've given you a fair amount of the piece parts so people can help do the math.\nSanjit Singh: Yeah, I really appreciate that. And thank you for breaking out that $80 million between unused commitments and the multi-year term license field. On the unused commitment side of the house, that $40 million, can you give us a sense of how that flowed through to the balance of the year? Obviously, it doesn't look like it all came in Q4, But the prior year in Q4, you also mentioned a $7 million impact to Atlas revenue that quarter. Was that impact worse or better this year when we think about the unused commitment contribution to this quarter's Atlas results?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so I think the key thing is the $40 million will happen over the course of the year. It obviously tracks to the actual contracts. It affects a relatively small number of customers and a small percentage of the commitments. It's a dynamic that goes away over time as we've discussed. We do -- we particularly called out that on a sequential basis it'll be most obvious and most pronounced in Q1 because we're basically hitting the first wave of those renewals where we don't have commits. And so especially as people are trying to do the sequential math, we just wanted to call that out and make sure people sort of understood that dynamic.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. Congrats on the Q4.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. One moment. [Technical Difficulty] Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats on a nice Q4. Question also a little bit on guidance, Mike. The last two quarters before Q4, we talked about EA seeing a little bit of a tailwind from customers kind of maybe modernizing on-premise rather than going to Atlas to kind of still modernize but maybe not spending all the money to go to the cloud. Is that trend still valid? And if you think about the multi-year commitments, obviously you had the $10 million, $15 million for the Alibaba deal, but then the other stuff is like customers that are just doing this work. Do you think that will change and people go back to like shorter commitments or is it just more that you're kind of thinking about the renewal pool? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so a few different things embedded in there. On the multi-year, it's always been a dynamic, and as we've seen deals or variability, we've tried to call that out, and that's why we sort of call out, given under the ASC 606, that increased variability and reduced comparability that comes from EA. Obviously, Atlas has grown as a percentage of the business, but that continues to be the dynamic for the EA portion. I expect that we will continue to see multi-year deals, but we -- just in fiscal ‘24, it was just so many more than we thought, and to your point, not just EA, but broadly non-Atlas. And it's just -- it's not something that we'll repeat in fiscal ‘25. And so that's why we wanted to call it out and quantified it. On the first part of your question on modernization, the way I would think about it is, customers all have their own IT strategies including deployment including their cloud postures and things like that. That's for them to decide. We want to make MongoDB easy for them to consume. Our run Anywhere strategy has proven to be successful. And we've seen that in the EA performance. And so I think the other thing I'd add is we have increasingly seen people appreciate, even if they're operating in a business or maybe in a regulated environment where they can't fully move to the cloud, where they do want to start to modernize applications and modernize infrastructure, and MongoDB is seen -- Enterprise Advance is seen now as an on-ramp to the cloud, even if you can't fully modernize and put yourself into a public cloud setting, EA can help that. Because eventually, given the [run-in to our] (ph) strategy, it will make it easier for your ultimate move to the cloud if that's what you wind up doing.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hey, thank you very much. Congrats on the results. One quick one for Dev and one hopefully quick one for Michael as well. Dev, you talked about Generative AI applications. You described the three layer architecture. When do you think it hits the sweet spot of how MongoDB is positioned from a timing standpoint? When do these Generative AI applications start to really drive underlying need for the kind of databases that you're best suited for? One for Michael. In your assumptions, when I take away the $40 million of the upfront, that's like a couple of percentage points of growth. I'm just trying to understand what kind of consumption trends you are using to build guidance? Was it average of fiscal ‘24 consumption trends or weighted more to its second half or exiting fourth quarter? Any color there would be tremendously useful. And also want to ensure the sales force is still selling EA and can get comp for EA because it does not look like you're giving much weight for EA in your forecast. That's it for me. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Kash. I'll take the first question. In regards to when we see enterprises deploying [indiscernible] production, I think it's a combination of customers getting comfortable with the technology and also these technologies maturing from both a performance and from a cost point of view. If you played with ChatGPT or any of the other chatbots out there or large language models, you'll know that the performance of these applications, you need to get response time in the one to two to three seconds, depending on the type of question you're asking. And so naturally a chatbot is a very simple but easy to understand use case, but to embed that technology into a sophisticated application, making real-time decisions based on real-time data, the performance and to some degree, the cost of these architectures are still not there. Also, customers are still in the learning phase. They're experimenting, they're prototyping, but I would say you're not seeing a lot of customers really deploy AI applications at scale. So I think it's going to take them, I would say this year is a year where they're going to do, you know, probably roll out a few applications, learn, and then as they get more experience, become more comfortable in rolling out more and more applications as they get -- as both these technologies mature and the costs come down. We feel very good about our positioning because from an architecture point of view, the document model, the flexible schema, the ability to handle real time data, performance at scale, the unified platform, the ability to handle data, metadata, and vector data with the same query language, same semantics, et cetera, is something that makes us very, very attractive. The other thing that we're finding is unlike a typical sale where someone's deciding to either build a new workload or monetize a workload, the AI decision is more of a central decision -- centralized decision more than ever. So it allows us to actually go higher in the organization. So we're actually engaging with customers at much more senior levels because obviously this is coming down as a top down initiative. And so this allows us to position us as a very modern platform designed for these new modern use cases and workloads. So we feel good about a positioning, but as I said this year I think is going to be continued experimentation and rollout of some individual applications.\nMichael Gordon: And then on the consumption questions, Kash, thanks for that. Overall, if you look at the guidance and the piece parts that we've tried to share with you, when you take into account the $80 million of impact from the unused commitments and the multi-year outperformance, you'll see at the top line level around 500 basis points of headwind. And then we also walked you through our expectations that the non-Atlas will be modestly down, given the $40 million of that part that isn't recurring. So when you kind of piece all those together, you'll wind up probably coming to a conclusion that Atlas looks consistent from a consumption growth standpoint, and that's in line with the stable trends we've seen over the course of fiscal ‘24. So we're using those fiscal ‘24 numbers. Obviously there's some seasonal adjustments that we have factored in there, but that's really what we're seeing there. And then the last part of your question around EA, we are -- we do still sell EA, we don't tend to sell EA into new accounts, it tends to be into an existing account, expanding their MongoDB footprint, sellers do get compensated on EA. In part it goes back to the comment from the earlier question that our sales rep really can't dictate the IT deployment environment at a customer. And so yeah, they get paid on that. And to your comment about the sort of, EA results or expectations, that's really just as a result of the difficult compare, in part given that multi-year dynamic.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from Alana Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. Thank you. Michael, we're going to stick with the guide scene here. If I look at last year, you guided to, I think, 16% growth. You ended up doing 31% for the full year. Even if I take out the $80 million tailwind you talked about, that's still 25% growth. You're guiding to 14% growth this year, again 5% headwind, so closer to 19% organically. Are you more confident kind of going into this year than last year just as you think about the trends. Is the 14% comparable to the 16% initial guide last year? Is it really more like 19% adjusted basis comparing to 16%? I know it's a little confusing, but getting a lot of questions on it, thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, no, it's fine. I go back to what I said in response to, I think it was Sanjit’s question. There's been no fundamental change or approach in terms of how we're looking and determining our guidance. I do think to the confidence point, I think that that is correct. We do have more confidence. We have more data. We -- if you think back a year ago, as one of the questions indicated, there was much more macro uncertainty. I think over the course of fiscal ‘24, we saw narrower variability. We saw more consistent results that does give us increased confidence. I think we also have another year under our belt in terms of understanding the seasonality trends of Atlas. I know Atlas is a big business, but it's still a relatively young one, especially when you think about getting quarterly data points. And so I think we have more confidence and better handle on that. And then lastly, while there is a difficult compare on EA, I think, we talked about this in the second half of last year where we were, at some point you could only be -- continue to be surprised by EA so much. And so as we looked at our, I think it was in our third quarter call, we talked about how we were upping our views on what EA could do. And so all that sort of baked into the guide.\nBrent Bracelin: Helpful color there. And then just, Dev, as you think about the million dollar question, when do you think these AI tailwinds, the interest in Vector starts to really impact your business? It sounded like you think another -- we'll see another year of more experimentation before we see big production moves. Is that the right take? Just walk us through your current thinking on when AI really starts to show up in your business. Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, I think it's going to show up in a business when people are deploying AI apps at scale, right? So I think that's going to be at least another year. But that being said, we do see some really interesting startups who are building on top of MongoDB, so it gives us confidence about our platform fit for these sophisticated workloads. But, given all the noise around AI, you have to remember we're still in the very, very early days. The performance of some of these systems is, I would classify as okay, not great. The cost of inference is quite expensive, so people have to be quite careful about the types of applications they deploy. There's some debate about open versus closed source LLMs. Do they use case specific LLMs or more general purpose LLMs? So there's a lot of learnings going on. And obviously, there's an announcement today that yet another company had delivered better performance than GPT-4. So, people are -- there's a lot going on in this space. So, for people to really get comfortable in picking a stack and deploying workloads in mass is going to take a bit of time. There are obviously some outliers who are obviously being far more aggressive. But that's essentially what we see across our customer base. But the good news is that we feel like we're well positioned. We feel that people really resonate with a unified platform. One way to handle data, metadata and vector data, that we are open and composable, that we integrate to not only all the different LLMs, we integrate to different embedding models. And we also -- essentially also integrate with some of the emerging application frameworks that developers want to use. So we think we're well positioned and you'll see us continue to expand and broaden our reach in this category, but I do think it's going to take a little bit of time.\nBrent Bracelin: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Karl [Technical Difficulty] of UBS. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Maybe one for Dev and one for Mike. Dev, just because my first question follows on that, I'll go to you first. There are certainly some voices in the industry that would argue that even in advance of AI applications being deployed at scale, which you just said might take a year, enterprises might look to spend more to modernize their existing data stack and on data readiness in advance of those AI apps going into production. Are you seeing any of that type of behavior that could proceed the in-production deployment timeframe?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, I touched a little bit about relational migrations. I mean, that's one way where a lot of people feel like they have a lot of data trapped in these legacy platforms. As we've shared, we've always had customers migrate from legacy SQL apps to MongoDB, But the hardest part was basically rewriting the application. Generative AI essentially lowers the cost to do so. We are running a bunch of pilots with customers. Customers are very aligned. We have access to senior level decision makers. And we're learning a lot. Obviously, we're learning about the effectiveness of some of these AI technologies. We're learning about how you have to handle old languages, old libraries, old packages, the different versions. And so the variability and all that makes it clear that this will require a mix of product and services. Product alone today will not solve the problem. So we do think this is a big opportunity, but we're in the early days. And as I said in the past, even when I talked to investors about this pre-AI, there was no big red easy button to press to kind of migrate a SQL app to MongoDB. And while GenAI makes that easier, it's still going to take a little bit of time, but it's definitely exciting and there's a lot of customers leaning in. And so, we're excited about the option, but it's a lot of work to do.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Dev. And then for Mike. Mike, could you just because we're all trying to set up our models by quarter for fiscal ‘25, is there any way to be more descriptive about how that $80 million, the sum of those two pieces, tracked by quarter and in particular how much of the $80 million landed in the fourth quarter you just reported?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so I don't have a quarterly breakdown. I guess what I would offer is throughout our life as a public company, including over the three prior quarters of this year, when there have been unusual trends, we've tried to call them out, so that people could understand both what was driving the results and looking forward what would impact the compares. And so, I think our historic comments should sort of leave a pretty good bread-cum-trail relative to things. I think we've been very clear on the multi-year deals and the EA outperformance when that's happened. And if you needed sort of a rule of thumb, credits would typically -- unused credits or unused commitments would typically, they map to the renewal cycle and we've called out the very seasonality as it relates to that. So those would probably be the big things on the EA and other non-Atlas, obviously Q2 last year was a big quarter. We talked about Alibaba and other deals that hit in Q2. And so I think you can -- it's not -- I wouldn't just divide by four. There are some differences quarter to quarter. And then lastly, we did call out the -- for folks who look at the business on a sequential basis, the impact of Atlas on the Atlas numbers for Q1, given that there'll be a much more pronounced effect, given this is the first quarter where we'll see the impact of that change.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, awesome. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty]\nUnidentified Analyst: Hello, Can you guys -- can you hear me? Because the line's cutting out a bit.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, we can hear you. Unfortunately, we can't hear the moderator, but we can hear you.\nUnidentified Analyst: Terrific. Okay, well, thank you for having me on. I'd like to ask about Atlas Stream Processing. So that was announced in June 2023. I guess, can you just remind us of like what is Mongo's reason to win in that segment of the market and then any idea of when that product will likely go GA?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so we announced -- as you said, we announced the private preview of Stream Processing where we ended up having hundreds of development teams use the product. Now we're in a public preview, so if customers are interested, they can actually start using the product today. Why are we in a position to win? For a couple reasons. One, this is purely focused on the developer market. The data is mainly in JSON. It requires a flexible schema and is for real-time applications. Given all those things are kind of coordinating, we feel really well positioned because most of the alternatives have a very rigid or fixed schema. And with the variability of data coming from these kind of events, that becomes much more problematic for customers to manage. So we feel very good about our position there. In terms of timing of when we're going to go GA, we're just currently getting feedback and responding to feedback. And we want to be very sure that we've addressed kind of the low-hanging fruit before we go generally available, but we're really sexcited about the opportunity that stream processing offers us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah, ideal. I might just also follow on to that and then add in my kind of proper second question. The follow-on is, is Stream Processing embedded in the guidance for fiscal ‘25? And then the question I had is about the bottom line. The guidance, if I'm not mistaken, is a 10% op margins in fiscal ‘25. Assuming the same beat as you guys did this year, so if 6 points of beat would put us at about 16 points of op margin exiting fiscal ‘25, so kind of net-net flat year-on-year. Is that due to this kind of putting the kind of foot on the gas in terms of hiring and really trying to be aggressive at adding headcount? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so a couple different questions there. Let me try and get them all. So obviously our plans related to Stream Processing are included in our guidance, but we don’t -- most of that will show up in Atlas overall when you think about the results. And certainly, whether it's new workloads or anything else, they tend to start off small and grow quickly in those first couple of quarters. But I wouldn't think of it as a major needle mover in the context of the fiscal ‘25 results, but we're very excited about it over the long term. In terms of the op margin, yes, our guidance is to go backwards on operating margin relative to fiscal ‘24. It will result in 500 basis points improvement over the two-year basis. And the thinking and the rationale related to that is the fact that if you take a step back and you look at us relative to the IPO, we had mapped out needing around 55 points of margin improvement to get to our target margins. With the fiscal ‘24 results, we effectively delivered 50 of those 55 points and yet are still at 2% market share and so it makes sense to continue investing in the opportunity, particularly on the sales productive capacity as we talked about but also to execute against the product roadmap. And so we will continue to do that, and that will take us backwards relative to last year, but positive 500 basis points on the two-year basis.\nUnidentified Analyst: Tremendous. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes to the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask a question around the sales capacity. It sounds like, at some point last year, you realized that you had under-invested, maybe pivoted too much towards margin expansion and then are now catching up. In the guidance, if you could assume you had the sales capacity that you would prefer to be at this point, given the demand that you're seeing, would we be at a higher level of growth? I'm just trying to parse out how much of the guide is factoring in those constraints on sales capacity that you've talked about?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, so thanks for your question. Yes, we, given the macro uncertainty, especially coming out off Q4 of last year, we did slow down hiring quite meaningfully. And obviously that showed up in our numbers to the point that Michael talked about in our op margin as well. We obviously know that we have a big opportunity in front of us. So we are growing our headcount between the mid and high teens. We think that's appropriate relative to the opportunities we see. And yes, if we had more productive sales capacity, the guidance would probably be higher. There's no question about that.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, I would just -- Brad, I would just make sure it's clear. The slowing down and hiring was really macro related and just sort of concerns about the environment. If you think back then, there were broadscale layoffs happening across the industry and everything else. And obviously we successfully weathered the storm. I think we talked about on the last call how with the benefit of hindsight and the results that we put up and how quickly, at least for us, things stabilized, we could have started investing sooner. And so I think in the call -- the year-ago call, we talked about adding single digit headcount growth relative to I think 30% headcount growth in the prior year. We wound up adding 9%. So obviously at the high end of what would constitute single digits in part because of the stabilization that we did see, but to the comments that affect the op income guide and everything else, that was very back-end loaded, right? So those investments will much more affect the fiscal ‘25 P&L, and that's really what we're reflecting into.\nBrad Sills: Understood, thanks so much for that. And then one more, if I may please. You guys have such broad exposure to different industries. With the advent of AI coming into your business and some of the early progress you're seeing, are there any verticals that you would point to where you're seeing more activity perhaps than others, any use cases you might point to, just to give us a sense for where that early adopter might come from? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, in regards to use cases, we're seeing most customers focus on driving efficiencies in their business because their existing baseline of costs are well known. So it's much easier for them to determine how much value they can derive by using some of these new AI technologies. So I see the first wave of applications being around reducing costs. You've seen some announcements by some customers saying, focusing on things like customer support and customer service, they really have -- they have found ways to dramatically reduce their costs. That's not surprising to me. I think cogeneration and this increasing developer productivity is another area. I think those are going to be kind of two areas where there's low hanging fruit. But then I think you're going to see customers focus on delivering better experiences for their customers and then find new streams of growth. And so I think it will be common phases. And so in terms of across industries, I think it's obviously there's some constraints and some customers based on the regulated nature of their industry, but in general we see basically high interest across almost every industry that we operate in.\nBrad Sills: That's exciting. Thank you so much, Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Brad. Give me a moment. Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria of RBC. [Technical Difficulty] is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Hey, Dev. Hey, Michael. Thanks so much for taking my question. I wanted to first start with relational migrator. Dev, can you talk a little bit about what demand for that looks like? And when customers are talking to you, are they more focused around the value prop being around cost savings that they get from moving from legacy relational databases over to MongoDB? Is it more about the flexibility around the technology itself? And maybe if you could tie in, how you expect now with GenAI's accelerator, how that can impact the timeline of migrating workloads from relational over to MongoDB? And then I've got a quick follow-up to Michael.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. When we talk to customers, and remember, even at our IPO, we had a meaningful number of customers migrating off relational to MongoDB. So they tend to come in three categories of reasons why. First is that the data models become so brittle with the relational architecture that it's very hard to build new features and be responsive to their customers. And so they just feel like their ability to innovate has slowed down. The second reason is that the system is just not scaling or performing given the increased number of users or the large amount of data that they have to process, that they realize that they have to get off a legacy platform. And the third reason is just the cost of the underlying platform and relative to the ROI that application is providing. So typically falls in one of those three buckets. Sometimes customers may have all three or maybe two of the three that are driving that demand. And then there's typically some compelling event, maybe there's some milestones they want to hit, maybe there's a renewal coming up with the incumbent vendor that's driving them to potentially move off that vendor as quickly as possible. As I said, with relational migrator, there's three parts to it. There's mapping of the schema from a tabular, relational schema to a document-based schema in MongoDB. Then there's actually moving the data, mapping to the new schema, and then there's the rewriting of the application. And so we have done lots of those already pre-GenAI, and some customers take a -- I want to rewrite everything. Some customers take a, I'll do it on a microservices basis, where I'll start peeling off functionality of the existing application and move that functionality to the new application and do that over time. It really depends on the customer's use case and their business needs. And yes, with GenAI, we do expect that rewriting the application has become easier and hence lower the cost of essentially switching, which by definition then expands the amount of customers and workloads you can go after. The other, I would say, on top of the three reasons I gave you in terms of why people move, there's now an emerging fourth reason, which is enabling their data and their applications to be more AI enabled. And so it's not just moving to more modern platform, but making them more AI enabled. And so that's also something that's getting customers' interest. And to your question on timing, as I said, I think this year we're going to see a lot of pilots and people trying out these new AI capabilities. And I think as the technology improves, as we learn more, I think you're going to see that scale much more quickly after that.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Really helpful. And then, Michael, just quickly, you put up your first free cash flow positive year in public company history. Just as we think about the margin guidance for next year, how should we be thinking about cash conversion going forward? Thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so I think the two factors to think about in terms of cash conversion are, within Atlas, there's this dynamic where we are reducing and continuing to see less upfront Atlas. Obviously, we're hitting the anniversary of that, and that's what's creating the headwind on the revenue front and the tough compare. But that's with Atlas at 68% of revenue. And so if you assume that Atlas is going to increase as a percent of revenue, I think that will sort of further drive the divergence. And then the only other big delta is things related to SBC and stuff like that. But I think it's the Atlas dynamic when you think about potential changes from a cash conversion standpoint, I think is where I'd focus and the impact, if you assume that Atlas is going to be a larger percent of the business.\nRishi Jaluria: All right, very helpful. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. [Technical Difficulty] comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Hey, can you hear me okay?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. Hey, Tyler. Good evening.\nTyler Radke: Okay. Cool. Okay, sorry, the line was a little choppy. Dev, I wanted to ask you just a question as it relates to competition. Obviously, it's been a busy week at both Snowflake and Databricks with Frank Slootman retiring. I hope you're not going anywhere soon. But Databricks announcing pretty impressive growth. I guess, how do you think about your positioning relative to those two vendors, especially with the new CEO, kind of more of a technical focus at Snowflake, and new store product coming out later this year, do you expect to compete more, just frame for us how you're thinking about it, especially as the GenAI momentum increases over the coming years?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, so first of all, I'm very committed to MongoDB. I'm very excited about the opportunity here, so I have no plans to go anywhere. Second, in regards to Snowflake and Databricks, we don't typically compete with them, right? Because they're focused on analytical workloads. We're focused on operational workloads. So those are two very different sets of use cases. The big difference in terms of how customer buy, typically data warehouses and data lakes tends to be a centralized decision, organizations standardize on one platform, and then basically move their existing data to those platforms where I would say, operational platforms tend to be a more decentralized decision where different development teams, different lines of businesses, et cetera, based on the requirements for their application, will choose, will make their own independent decisions about what they think they need to do. And we've always talked about how we start with one team and then try and expand from there, and why there's so much focus on expanding within accounts and becoming a standard within an account, because then that accelerates the amount of workloads we capture. But those are two very different kind of customer buying behaviors in terms of analytical versus operational. With regards to the potential overlap, we are embedding more analytics capabilities. We have a very sophisticated aggregation framework, so people can do real-time processing of analytics on our platform with real-time data. Remember, data lakes and data warehouses have a batch process to get that data into their platforms, so they're not dealing with the real-time data. And then with regards to Unistore, listen, there's like over 300 databases in the marketplace, so not sure, I have a lot of respect for the Snowflake people. I'm not sure, we've heard noises about Unistore for a long time, but we feel very comfortable and confident about our position just given the investments we made on our platform and the large customers we have. And frankly, the popularity of our platform with developers. And remember, developers are not a persona that these other players typically go after. They go after more the analysts and the data scientist community. We're very, very focused on developers.\nTyler Radke: That's helpful. Michael, just a quick follow-up for you on the overage comments you made. I guess a couple questions. First of all, the $40 million is what I think you called out. That seems pretty high for last year, just considering we hadn't really heard about it, since Q4 of last year, we called out only several million of overage credit figures. Can you just frame for us, was that consistent with what you've seen in prior years? And I guess, you're obviously embedding that that doesn't continue next year. Is that a change in the way that you're recognizing overage revenue or is that just -- you don't expect that to happen because all your contracts have been reset? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, so just two quick things in the interest of time. So a reminder, the several was the incremental amount over and above the normal amount that we experienced. So that's the sort of the principle that we take where we try and call out differences or variations from sort of the normal behavior. And so it was several million more than what we would normally see. The $40 million is the amount that was recognized in fiscal ‘24. We do see that going to zero effectively. And you're right, that's directly as a result of the changes that we've made in the go-to market and the fact that we are not prioritizing commitments and haven't since the start of last fiscal year. And so the result of that is that you have many fewer commitments and unused -- the revenue for unused credits simply just reflects the revenue at the end of that contract period that you haven't realized or recognized through consumption. And so we expect that to go away because we've taken a different approach to the market to drive greater adoption of workloads and all the other things that we've talked about, which is the rationale for doing that in the first place. So hopefully that helps put all that in context.\nTyler Radke: It does. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude our conference for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Dev, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you. Again, I thank everyone for joining us today. I just want to reiterate that we had a strong quarter and year as we executed our opportunity. We do expect fiscal ‘25 to play out similarly to fiscal ‘24 with a healthy new business and stable consumption trends. We are very excited about the long-term AI opportunity, but still believe it's early days as customers are mainly in the experimentation and prototyping stages of building AI applications. And our priorities for fiscal ‘25 are to invest in deepening our product advantage while remaining focused on acquiring new workloads and establishing ourselves as the standard for building modern applications. So thank you again for joining us and we'll talk to you soon. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would like to turn the call to your host Mr. Brian Denyeau from ICR. Please go ahead.\nBrian Denyeau: Great. Thank you, Valerie. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB; and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and future growth opportunities, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial conditions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2023, that was filed with the SEC on September 1, 2023. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter as we continue to execute well, despite challenging market conditions. I will start by reviewing our third-quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $433 million, a 30% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 36% Year-over-Year, representing 66% of total revenue. We generated a non-GAAP operating income of $79 million for an 18% non-GAAP operating margin and we had another solid quarter of customer growth and in the quarter with over 46,400 customers. Overall, we delivered a strong Q3. We had a healthy quarter of new business acquisitions, led by continued strength in new workload acquisition within our existing customers. In addition, our Enterprise Advanced business again exceeded our expectations, demonstrating strong demand for our platform and the appeal of our run-anywhere strategy. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends, the quarter played out in line with our expectations. Michael will discuss consumption trends in more detail later. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q3, reinforcing the mission criticality of our platform, even in a difficult spending environment. This quarter, we held our most recent global customer advisory board meeting, where customers across various geographies and industries came together to share feedback and insight about the experience using MongoDB. From these discussions, as well as our ongoing C-Suite dialog with our customers a few themes emerged. First, AI is in nearly every conversation with customers of all sizes. We're seeing great early feedback from our partnership with AWS's CodeWhisperer, the AI-powered coding companion that is now trained on MongoDB data to generate code suggestions based on MongoDB's best practices from over 15 years of history. Microsoft GitHub Copilot is also proficient at generating code suggestions that reflect best practices, enabling developers to build highly-performing applications even faster on MongoDB. And with the recent advances in Gen AI, building AI applications is no longer the sole domain of AI or ML experts, increasingly it’s software developers who are being asked to build powerful AI functionality directly into their applications. We are well-positioned to help them do just that. We saw exceptional interest in our Vector Search public preview and we announced general availability yesterday. Customers are building a range of AI use cases from semantic search to retrieval augmented generation or RAG where organizations can leverage the use of their private data, to increase the accuracy of LLMs. For example, UKG, a human capital and workflows management technology serves over 80,000 plus customers around the globe chose to use MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for an AI-powered assistant that helps guide their customers employees, people managers, and HR leaders. They chose Atlas Vector Search because of its minimal added architectural complexity, flexibility to handle the rapidly changing data as applications evolve and the scale to handle large workloads. UKG is not alone. In our recent state of AI survey report by Retool, Atlas Vector Search received by far the highest net promoter score from developers compared to all other vector databases available in the market. Moreover, developers can combine Vector Search with any other query capabilities available on MongoDB, namely analytics, tech search, geospatial, and time series. This provides powerful ways of defining additional filters and vector-based queries that other solutions just cannot provide. For example, you can run complex AI enriched queries such as find pants, shirt, shoes in my size that look like the outfit in this image within the particular price range and have free shipping or find real-estate listings with houses that look like this image that were built in the last five years and/or in that area within seven miles west of Downtown Chicago with top-rated schools. Second, customers feel more pressure than ever to modernize their data infrastructure, they are aware that their legacy platforms are holding them back from building modern applications designed for an AI future. However, customers also tell us that they lack the skills and the capacity to modernize. They all want to become modern but are daunted by the challenges as they are aware it's complex -- it's a complex endeavor that involves technology, process, and people. Consequently, customers are increasingly looking to MongoDB, to help them modernize successfully. We launched Relational Migrator early this year to help customers successfully migrate data from the legacy relational databases to MongoDB. Now, we're looking beyond data migrations to the full lifecycle of application modernization. At our local London event, we unveiled a Query Converter, which uses genetic AI to analyze existing sequel queries and stored procedures and convert them to work with MongoDB's query API. Customers already use the tool successfully to convert decades-old procedures to modernize their back-end with minimal need for manual changes. While it's still early days, we're continuing to invest in the Query Converter and other AI features with the goal of significantly reducing the effort involved in monetizing legacy applications to run on MongoDB. To be clear, application modernization will take time to ramp, but as one of the largest long-term growth opportunities for our business. Third, our run-anywhere strategy continues to be a real differentiator as customers greatly appreciate the optionality that our platform provides as they manage often conflicting priorities on the way to the cloud. On one hand, the movement to the cloud continues unabated. Customers in industries and geographies were at first hesitant to move to cloud, such as financial services in Southern Europe are Now moving to the cloud with urgency to become more nimble and to reduce costs. Many of our customers find that the all-in cost of maintaining legacy workloads on-prem is higher than the cost of migrating them to the cloud. On the other hand, our largest enterprise customers tell us they are planning to maintain a meaningful on-prem footprint for the foreseeable future. The reason for keeping workloads on-prem include regulatory requirements, the desire to keep using their existing on-prem infrastructure, or the enormity of the task of migrating all their apps to cloud. In the meantime, they still want to modern data platform to deploy new and existing applications, the continued outperformance of EA business demonstrates that our customers value our ability to run anywhere and to future-proof their eventual move to the cloud by building on EA. Finally, our customers remain focused on cost management, they're looking to do more with less by consolidating vendors and reducing the complexity of the data architecture. MongoDB dramatically increases developer productivity and supports a wide variety of use cases, eliminating the need for many point solutions. This combination resonates with customers in this macro-environment. For example, Atlas search now powers the homepage of one of the most recognizable sports media brands in the world. The customer replaced an incumbent search technology with Atlas search, because they were drawn to the operational ease of running search queries alongside other queries on Atlas as well as the overall cost-savings from consolidating functionality onto a single platform. In short, customers view MongoDB as a true partner, a partner that not only accelerate the pace of innovation, but also drives them to become more efficient. We are deepening investments in our product, partnerships, and customer-facing teams to continue to enable customers to do both. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries and around the world are running mission-critical applications on Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform. These customers include AT&T, Fishbowl by Glassdoor, and Trend Micro. AT&T selected Atlas as a key element of their modernization journey. The location match and application validates 380 million unique customer addresses and handles about 14 million transactions per day. But the various disparate data management solutions led to technical depth and there were duplicative sources of information. The company turned to Atlas as a developer data platform to simplify their data infrastructure, merged their data into a single view, and freed their teams from managing database operations. Now they rely on Atlas change streams to easily track changes with data as well as Atlas's native search capabilities and built-in geospatial functions to quickly identify location information and accelerate time-to-market for mission-critical products and services. EY, Delivery Hero, and ASAP Log are examples of customers turning to MongoDB to free up their developer's time for innovation, while achieving significant cost-savings. One of the 2023 MongoDB Innovation Award winners is EY. Ernst & Young LLP manages high volumes of transactional data and its clients and internal teams work under strict timelines to file taxes and meet regulatory deadlines. The cloud-based global VAT reporting tool or GVRT automates and digitizes the preparation of 242 different types of returns across 79 countries. EY migrated from their previous non-relational database solution to Atlas and experienced a significant performance boost, reduced cost by as much as 50% and are able to scale without limitations to handle increased data volumes, transactional loads, and concurrent user requests during peak periods. Evernorth Health Services, a division of the Cigna Group Manulife and [indiscernible] are turning to MongoDB to modernize applications. Manulife, one of the largest life insurance companies in the world, migrated to Atlas when it became clear that their relational database caused a drag on innovation and increased the time to bring new digital products to market. Manulife selected Atlas, because of the flexible document model speeds up development, scales easily, supports asset transactions, and offers seamless data migration. Using Atlas Device Sync, they successfully launched one critical app's offline mode to ensure uninterrupted app usage went offline or in low connectivity areas to improve mobile data synchronization. Using Atlas allows Manulife to broaden its digital capabilities and enhance the [indiscernible] of customer interactions cost-effectively. In summary, I'm pleased with our third-quarter results, our run-anywhere strategy allows customers flexibility over where they deploy and MongoDB is emerging as a platform of choice for their AI-powered applications and customers are using MongoDB to modernize and become more efficient. Before I turn it over to Michael I'm excited to share that Ann Lewnes, the former Chief Marketing Officer and Executive Vice-President of Corporate Strategy and Development at Adobe just joined MongoDB's Board of Directors, and her leadership roles at Adobe from 2006 to 2023, she was instrumental in driving Adobe's transition from a perpetual to subscription-based business model, and as experienced marketing to creative professionals, whether they are in a small agency, a medium-sized business, or very large enterprise. If you replace creative professionals with developers, this strategy is very similar to what MongoDB is doing and Ann did it at the next level of scale. Prior to Adobe, Ann held a variety of leadership positions at Intel during that 20-year tenure at the company, including Vice-President of Sales and Marketing. We're thrilled for the exceptional perspective Ann will bring to the Board. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dave. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the third quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our third-quarter results, and then finish with our outlook for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2024. First I'll start with the third-quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $433 million, up 30% year-over-year, and above the high end of our guidance. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy new business environment demonstrating our product market fit and the mission criticality of our platform. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 36% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 66% of total revenue compared to 63% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023 and 63% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to-end user activity of the application, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. Week-over-week consumption growth in Q3 was in line with our expectations and stronger than Q2. As a reminder, we were expecting a seasonal uptick in consumption in Q3 compared to Q2 based on what we've experienced and shared with you last year. We had forecasted that seasonal improvement to be less pronounced this year compared to last year. Given that overall, we've seen less consumption variability this year and that is exactly how the quarter played out. Turning to non-Atlas revenues, EA exceeded our expectations in the quarter as we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our existing EA customer base. Ongoing EA strength speaks to the appeal and the success of our run-anywhere strategy. The EA revenue outperformance was in part a result of more multiyear deals than we had expected. As a reminder, the term license component for multiyear deals is recognized as upfront revenue at the start of the contract and therefore includes term license revenues from future years. Turning to customer growth. During the third quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,400 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 46,400, which is up from over 39,100 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count over 6,900 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 5,900 in the year-ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 44,900 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 37,600 customers in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. During the quarter, we moved approximately 350 accounts, representing negligible ARR. Out of our self-serve customer count because they're better classified as subsidiaries of other customers or they are now users of our free tier. Taking that into account our self-serve net additions and overall net additions remain consistent with our historic healthy trends. In terms of our direct sales, net additions, new sales activity remains healthy. Our reported direct sales net-adds continue to reflect the dynamics we discussed last quarter related to leveraging cloud provider marketplaces to fulfill new direct sales, customer additions and the movement of some small mid-market direct sales accounts to self-serve. Moving onto ARR, we had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%, we ended the quarter with 1,972 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,545 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement, I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the third quarter was $335.3 million, representing a gross margin of 77%, which is up from 74% in the year-ago period. Our year-over-year margin improvement is primarily driven by improved efficiencies that we're realizing in Atlas. Our income from operations was $78.5 million or an 18% operating margin for the third quarter compared to a 6% margin in the year-ago period. Our strong bottom-line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and are a clear indication of the strength in our underlying unit economics. The primary reason for our operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. In addition, our operating income benefited from the timing of new hires. Finally, Q3 benefited from the timing of marketing programs, internal events, and other expenses, which we now expect to incur in Q4. Net income in the third quarter was $79.1 million or $0.96 per share, based on 82.7 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. This compares to a net income of $18.7 million or $0.23 per share on 80.4 million diluted weighted-average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow, we ended the third quarter was $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the third quarter was $38.4 million, after taking into consideration, approximately $3.5 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities free cash flow was $35 million in the quarter. This compares to a negative free cash flow of $8.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the fourth-quarter and full-year fiscal year 2024. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $429 million to $433 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $35 million to $38 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.44 to $0.46 based on $83.2 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. For the full-year fiscal 2024, we are increasing our outlook across the board. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $1.654 billion to $1.658 billion, non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $236.3 million to $239.3 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.89 to $2.91 based on $82.5 million estimated diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the fourth-quarter and full-fiscal year 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some context on our guidance. First, we expect Q4 Atlas consumption growth to be impacted by the seasonal slowdown around the holidays. Second, as you think about both the sequential and year-over-year revenue growth of Atlas in Q4, keep in mind that in Q4 last year, we had several million dollars more of revenue coming from unused commitments, which we do not expect to occur this quarter. Third; as a result of our strong execution so far this year, we are again raising our non-Atlas revenue expectations for Q4. However, we expect that our non-Atlas revenues will decline sequentially, Q4 versus Q3. This is different from our normal pattern as we usually see a seasonal uptick in Q4 due to greater renewal activity. The reason for the sequential decline this year is because of the strength we've seen in Q3, including the benefit of multiyear EA deals. Finally, thanks to the strong performance in Q3, and increased revenue outlook again, we're again increasing our assumption for operating margins in fiscal 2024 to 14% at the midpoint of our guidance, an improvement of more than 900 basis points compared to fiscal 2023. Our significant margin improvement this year is primarily driven by our revenue outperformance and the fact that we didn't increase our pace of investment as the revenue outlook improved until relatively late in the year. As a result, we achieved greater margin expansion this year than we think is desirable in the short term given the long-term market opportunity ahead of us. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent third-quarter results in a difficult environment, we're pleased with our ability to win new business and are demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our model, while we will continue to monitor the macro-environment we remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and we'll continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions, operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the results in Q3. When we look at the Atlas growth this quarter, Michael, I know you mentioned that -- that the consumption trends were better than expectations, in terms of the seasonality that you were anticipating what has shown up in the business for the past two years, was that more pronounced than you expected, or did that come in below in terms of the seasonal uplift that you've seen in Q3.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, so just to clarify Q3 for Atlas came in line with our expectations. We had seen and called out last year seasonal -- seasonality for Q3. We had expected that and incorporated that into our forecast. What we have seen is less variability over the course of the year and so, we assume that Q3 seasonality would be more muted this year and that's exactly what happened and how the quarter played out.\nSanjit Singh: Understood. Thank you, Michael, for the clarification. And then, Dev I guess a much bigger-picture question, it's -- I think the company was started in 2007, so it's about 17 years into the journey. And if you compare that to some of the large and competitive players in the space like an Oracle, around this time 17 to kind of 20 years, they started to move away from like the data management database space and into like the application software market. Is that a vision, particularly as we are in the dawn of the e-compute cycle with AI, is that an analogy that applies to Mongo in terms of its long-term roadmap in your view?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, thanks for your question Sanjit, what I would say is we've been very clear that we're really pushing our developer data platform strategy and we think the market is way larger today than it was for Oracle, when they were essentially 17 years old and our developer data platform strategy is really very simply enabling developers to use MongoDB for a wide variety of use cases across a wide variety of deployment models, whether it's on-prem, on the cloud, multi-cloud or even at the Edge. And so that's really our strategy. We don't see any need to get into quote-unquote the application space itself. And we think that we have a lot of runway ahead of us.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate it. Thanks, Dev. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Sanjit.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. I wanted to ask on EA first. Another very strong quarter there, can you talk a little bit more on the drivers here, because I do seem to remember you kind of double down on sales capacity I think it was [indiscernible] guide that you wanted to put on existing accounts, is that kind of a main driver or is it more like modernization or kind of picking up a lot more than what we thought would be possible. Can you speak to that, because it's like the second quarter and early where we kind of have better numbers and I have one follow-up for Michael.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah, Raimo. With regards to our EA outperformance, I think it really speaks to our run-anywhere strategy where customers really value the ability to build on MongoDB and essentially future-proof their deployment model, whether they stay on-prem or to move to the cloud or move from one cloud to another cloud and the fact that they can do that without having to rewrite the application is very compelling for customers. As you also said, a lot of customers still, especially the largest customer, still have a lot of sunk costs and they want to leverage that -- their existing data infrastructure. So, lot of customers have told us that they will still deploy infrastructure on-prem for the foreseeable future, but what -- but by building on MongoDB, they get the benefits of a modern platform and the optionality to also move to cloud when they're ready to do so.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah, the other thing which I know you know, Raimo, but just for the broader audience, we run the business on a channel basis, sales isn't oriented around products and then also, as we've said before, EA tends to be -- the additional sales of EA tend to be to existing customers, we don't tend to land a ton of new brand-new customers on EA.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. And then the follow-up is more, it's around AI, so, if I look at the demos that you guys have on Vector Search and how Search is getting a lot better, that seems very compelling and it seems like really straightforward for a client to improve their customer experience they use it for a customer [indiscernible] up for example, what is the -- what are the implications for gross margins for you Michael like, do you have to do a lot more compute here to be able to handle it. How should we think about that in terms of extra revenue, but also extra costs coming through? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So I think it's a little too early to tell, there's obviously plenty of variability in the workloads depending on the nature of what the underlying application is. So, I think it's a little early to give a strong direction to that. I think more broadly on margins, we've certainly been very happy with the margin progress that we've made I referenced, continued efficiencies that we're driving in Atlas. Atlas is roughly two-thirds of the business, so as that continues to increase Atlas still is lower-margin overall. And so that will have some impact over the next several years. But we're really pleased on the margin front, but I think too early to make a specific call or quantification on the gross margin impact of AI.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. And Raimo, just to add to that. One of the announcements we also made was that we can now do workload isolation. So, for Search or Vector Search functionality you can scale those nodes independently of the overall cluster. So, what that really does is allow customers to really configure those clusters to have the right level of performance at the most efficient cost. So, we've been very sensitive to making sure that based on the different use cases you can scale up and down different nodes based on your application needs, by definition that will be a very compelling value proposition for customers.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay, perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead of UBS. Your line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Great, thanks. Maybe I'll direct this question to Dev. Dev, I think a lot of people on the line are hearing this refrain about Customer's enterprises wanting to get their data states in order in advance of moving forward on AI initiatives and you even spoke about customers feeling pressure to modernize their data infrastructure. I'd just like to ask, where we are in that journey Is this. Is this a conversation that your sales teams are having or do you feel like this is actually beginning to result in deals and revenue pull-through and if it isn't yet roughly, when do you think that might start to translate to an actual revenue lift?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So I'll make a couple of points. Karl, you're absolutely right, there is a lot of focus on data because with AI, data in some ways becomes the new code, you can train your models with your proprietary data that allows you to really drive much more value and build smarter applications. Now, the key thing is that it's operational data because with applications, this data is always constantly being updated and for many customers, most of those applications are right now running on legacy platforms, so that operational data is trapped in those legacy platforms. And you can really do a batch process of e-tailing all that data into some sort of warehouse and then still be able to leverage the real-time use of that data. That's why customers are now much more interested in potentially modernizing legacy platforms than they ever have before. I would say, Karl, to your second part of your question, I would say it's still very, very early days. We definitely believe that this will be one of the largest long-term opportunities for our business, but we're in the very early days and as I've said in the past, there is a risk of overestimating the impact of the short-term but underestimating the impact long-term, we definitely think this is a long-term impact.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. And if I could ask a follow-up to Mike on a different subject. Mike, you had talked on the last call a little bit more about this mix-shift away from multi-year Atlas commits and you were pointing to that as a reason for some of your metrics like DR and I think even cash flow to come under a little pressure. This quarter I see DR is still under pressure, cash flow was a little bit better, can you maybe revisit that phenomenon and describe how it's impacting some of these metrics?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, a couple of things. As we've said from the beginning. Some of those like calculated billings are deferred revenue metrics aren't super helpful or don't provide a ton of insight in terms of how we run the business. We've also talked about how over the last couple of years, one of the things we've been trying to do is reduce friction for the sales force. Some of that includes reducing the emphasis around upfront commitments. And so that helps accelerate you know lending new workloads and things like that and that will flow through or does flow through the financial statements as less upfront deferred and things like that. And so -- but allows us to sort of synthetically cover more ground from a salesforce perspective. And so you do see that, continue to go through, we shared the statistics last quarter that Atlas revenue growth last quarter was 38%, but dollars of committed Atlas declined 15% year-over-year, just as one way to try and help dimensionalize it, we also talked, I think, earlier in the year about how roughly 80% of Atlas doesn't flow-through deferred and so I think all of those data points help kind of lineup to explain the rest of what you're seeing and why that's not sort of helpful forward-looking metrics like it might be in other companies. It doesn't kind of give you the insight that maybe people are used to or hope that it will provide.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes. That's clear. Thanks a lot.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Karl.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great, thanks very much, Michael, maybe following up on that last question in your commentary. At what point should DR stop being a headwind from a financial perspective, when should it stabilize or is this a multi-year trend as you kind of bleed it down?\nMichael Gordon: So I'd say there are a couple of things, obviously it's not something we guide to, it's not a key thing that we focus on, but I think the trends will be. You've got sort of two factors, one is overall Atlas mix, right, and so to the extent that Atlas continues to grow, that will provide a headwind on this dynamic. And then similarly, even within the current Atlas footprint, there's this historic commitments that we need to run-through renewal cycles and everything else and so I think this will take a little while still to play out.\nBrad Reback: Great. And then switching gears. Dev, as customers begin to trial -- excuse me, some of these Copilot code tools, we'll say, what type of feedback have you gotten from them as it relates to the pace with which they've been able to reduce net new workload time-to-market. How much faster or efficient are customers getting using these tools?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. We get different answers from different customers, really depends on which tool, they're using without commenting on who is better or who is worst, we definitely see a difference in the quality of the output between different tools. I think it's going to take some time for these tools to mature. So I think we're seeing a lot of customers do a lot of testing and prototyping. I would also tell you that doing a lot of this on internal facing applications, because there's still lots of questions about IP rights and what is potentially copyright-able then ultimately licensable, they offer this as a shrink-wrap software or service to their end-customers. So, we're seeing more of this work on internally facing applications. But the productivity gains, really do vary by tool and also very -- do vary by the sophistication of the app being built. So, it's hard for me to give you a real number. I know there are people out there to toating 30% or 40% improvements. But it really depends on the customer, and the use-case and the tool that they're trying to use. It'd be hard for me to give you a specific number.\nBrad Reback: Okay, thanks very much.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Yes, thanks for taking the question. So, earlier this quarter, you hired Mark Porter's replacement, Jim Scharf from AWS, a lot of experience in the database industry. Can you just talk about some of his priorities, what you're kind of accelerating in terms of the product roadmap to sell to larger enterprises?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, so for those people who don't know Jim's background, he spent about 17 years at AWS. He had a variety of roles but last two meaningful roles was he ran the Dynamo business at AWS which is AWS's fastest-growing and largest non-relational database business. And then he ultimately then took over that identity access management business, which if you think about it, every AWS customer has to use as a service that has to not only perform but perform at massive scale. The fact EV has dealt and built two mission-critical services for AWS was very appealing to us given our ambitions to kind of the level of scale that we expect our business ultimately get to at some point in time. He, obviously, brings us very strong technical DNA, he obviously has a lot of network of relationships in the industry. So, we expect him to help us grow the team around the world leveraging his relationships and in terms of priorities. I mean, right now, he still kind of really assessing the current state of the business. He has been quite impressed with the quality of talent that we have. But he is really kind of what I have encouraged him to do is we need to go slow to go fast to take his time in terms of really understanding the business, understanding the team, understanding the code base before he starts really prioritizing what to do and it's not like there's some things massively broken, it's really helping us set-up to scale to the next level.\nTyler Radke: Great. And a follow-up for Michael. I know you talked about how Atlas consumption during Q3 was in line with your expectations. I'm just curious, given there were a lot of volatility in at least the equity markets and the economy, did it -- was there any more variability within the quarter, in other words, did it start weaker and stronger and then I'm just curious throughout the month of November, have things kind of further improved ahead of the holiday seasonality? Just any additional color would be helpful. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So it like you said, Q3 Atlas results were in line with our expectations there was a seasonal benefit to Q3 relative to Q2. But given the fact that we've seen less variability in consumption in fiscal 2024, we had expected that to be smaller than it was in fiscal 2023 and that's exactly how it played out. The seasonal improvement, as it relates to Q3 is a little bit more in the back-half of the of the -- of the quarter. As it relates to Q4, typically the back half is weaker, given the holiday slowdown and I hope that helps people understand a little bit.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nKash Rangan: Hey, thank you very much, Dev and Michael. Happy holidays. Congrats on the results. So, going into calendar 2024, how does the management team feel relative to going into calendar 2023 with respect to how macro conditions are no longer impacting or maybe they are impacting some aspects of the business, any verticals that stand-out that you feel particularly excited about? So just wanted to understand how MongoDB is therefore fitting into customer priorities as you get into 2024. Thank you so much.\nDev Ittycheria: Hey, Kash. Thanks for the question. I think compared from last year, this year we don't see things getting worse, but we don't see things getting better. Where I said, last year with the Fed raising rates, you could really sense that people are getting much more cautious and there was probably more negativity in terms of the outlook coming into calendar 2023. So, that being said, we definitely see innovation, being a priority for customers. We clearly are. I would say the distinction between must-to-have and nice-to-have clearly, in the first category. But customers are also, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks remain focused on being sensitive to costs and ensuring that any investments that may have a high ROI. So we feel that we're well-positioned in terms of use cases or segments. I would say in general there is no real kind of material change in any across any vertical industry or geography. We do see. I mean we were at Reinvent last week and we had an amazing set of conversations with lots of senior-level customers. I think we're really viewed as a mission-critical platform by all our customers, and I think people view us as a platform that they can bet on long-term. And so we see less I would say focus on like point solutions and more about like trying to leverage MongoDB for more and more use cases and I would say that's pretty consistent across industries and geographies.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, the only other thing I'd add Kash is clearly, things have stabilized, we are not guiding fiscal 2025. But just looking out there is clearly a difficult EA and non-EA compare that people should sort of keep in mind, and. I think the big assumption or the big determinant will be people's macro outlook in terms of how that affects the fiscal 2025 numbers. But those are probably the key things to keep in mind.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nIttai Kidron: Thanks. Hey guys, nice numbers. Michael, I wanted to go back to one of the comments in your prepared remarks. I think you've talked about how you expect non-Atlas business to be down quarter-over-quarter in the fourth-quarter, because I think the third-quarter had multiple multiyear deals, correct me if I've got this wrong. I guess my question is, why would that affect 4Q unless there was a pull-forward also not just multi-years, is there a pull-forward element from 4Q into 3Q in your non-Atlas business?\nMichael Gordon: No, it's not about a pull-forward. It's just when you take into account the 606 impact of a multi-year deal, you wind up recognizing a lot of upfront license revenue. And so when you think about what that means on a sequential basis, you see the difference in the delta there.\nIttai Kidron: Got it, helpful and then, therefore --\nMichael Gordon: I think the only other thing, Ittai, just for people is, given the strength that we've seen of EA throughout the year, but including Q3 we effectively raised our outlook, if you will in Q4, in part given the strength of EA. Even though we don't guide to product, Atlas is in line with our expectations. EA outperformed in Q3. And our full-year raise was more than the beat in Q3 and I think that shows that kind of continued strength of EA.\nIttai Kidron: Got it, helpful. And then, Dev, on Vector Search, I know this is kind of fresh out of the oven here, but maybe you can talk about the opportunity here on a per-customer basis. How do we think about the dollar potential here and is there one common vendor out there that you expect to see more in competition for those types of use cases?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so let me start with the second question first. I would say that I think six to nine months ago, there was a lot of interest in vector databases and there were some point solutions that got a lot of name recognition and a lot of people wondering is there a risk that could be disrupted by them. And at that point in time, we've made it clear that we believed vectors were really another form of an index and that every database platform would ultimately incorporate vectors into their architecture and the winner really would be the technology that made the vector functionality very integrated and cohesive as part of the development workflow. I would I would argue that that's really played out. As I've said in the prepared remarks, there was a recent analysis done by a consultancy firm called Retool that really spoke to lots of customers and we came out on top in terms of NPS and by the way, our product is a preview product, it wasn't even the GA product. We've seen a lot of demand from customers and we feel like this is a big, big opportunity. Again, it's early days, it's going to take time to materialize, but this is again one of the other big growth opportunities for our business. That being said, in terms of the revenue opportunity, it is really hard to quantify now because the use cases that customers are starting with are still kind of, I would say, early in development, so because people are still playing around with the technology. But we are seeing you know as I mentioned, UKG, is using it to essentially provide a AI-powered assistance for its people, you know one energy -- European energy company is using -- has terabytes of geospatial data and is using vectors to basically get better insights in terms of the images that they're getting from the work they're doing in terms of drilling for oil. So, it's still very, very, early days. So, hard to give you like an exact number, even today even in our general non-AI workloads, the workload variety can vary a lot depending on the customer, the number of users, the amount of data. So, I think it's going to be similar to our core business, which is that just really depends on the use case.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thanks so much. Wanted to ask a question around the customer count, greater than 100K, it looks like a real nice result this quarter. Is there any change going on there in terms of the trajectory or the path for customers to get to that level. In other words, are they starting bigger, are they landing bigger or are they just getting to that point faster and what would be driving those two things?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, I'm glad you called that out, Brad. Yeah, we're -- I think we added 117 100K customers this quarter, which is the largest add. I think in the company's history. What I think it really speaks to is that customers are increasingly viewing MongoDB as a mission-critical platform. They're going to run more and more workloads on MongoDB. So, by definition, it's rare that one workload on its own will drive that kind of revenue. So, the multiple workloads and really dealing us as a standard part of their infrastructure stack is what's really driving that number. And we're obviously happy to see the results of that and we think that that's just indication, as I said earlier, where people are consolidating onto a few vendors. They recognize that we offer support for a broad set of use cases, we're truly a general-purpose mission-critical platform and that their developers really love using MongoDB.\nBrad Sills: Wonderful to hear. And then one more if I may please. On the commentary around customers viewing Mongo as that platform with some of these newer workloads besides Search like relational migrator, Atlas streaming, do you -- are you finding that receptivity for customers who want to run Search within you know one single solution, is that also the case for streaming and relational, just trying to get a sense for those cycles and how those might ramp on that platform capability. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so. Actually, yeah, one of the reasons we actually built Search is because we got feedback from our customers in many Instances lot of our customers were dual-homing data to MongoDB and to some sort of search database. So consequently, now that they had to manage two databases, keep that data in sync, but also manage the plumbing, the connected those two database platforms and customers told us [indiscernible] like, we don't understand why you're not offering a solution, because we much rather have it all in one platform with one API and that ultimately drove our desire to build-out our search functionality, which is really becoming more-and-more popular. So, the point for customers is that, if you can remove friction in terms of how they can use the platform, leverage the platform, have one set of kind of semantics In terms of -- to address a broad set of use cases, it really simplifies the data architecture and the more you simplify data architecture, the more nimble, you can be and the more cost-effective you can be, and I think that's what's really resonating with customers.\nBrad Sills: Thanks so much, Dev.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Your line is open.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful, thanks so much for taking my question. Maybe I want to start by diving a little bit into relational migrator, Dev, I know you said it definitely early days, but where you are seeing usage of it, maybe can you give us a little bit of color, what sort of workloads are these customers are utilizing the tool for, what is kind of that timeline look like; any color you can give there in terms of early adoption would be really helpful and then I've got a quick follow-up.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so -- again, as you can imagine, given the lot of these legacy platforms have been around four between 30 to 40 years. Lot of people have large repository of legacy apps and migrating off a legacy platform to another platform does require some work, it requires essentially three things; one, you have to map the scheme of the old platform onto the new platform, you then have to map move the data and then you have to rewrite the application code. And those three things took some time. So, we heard feedback. When we took the company public, you might remember that 30% of our net new business at the time we went public was actually relational migration. So customers were undertaking that heavy lifting because they were in such pain and wanted to move to a more modern platform. But clearly, that pain can basically be a bit of a tax on switching costs. And so essentially rebuilt tooling based on feedback from customers to start automating the schema mapping and the data movement. Now, with the availability of Gen AI. You can also now start automating the code generation associated with rebuilding or rebuilding an application and essentially what rather than thing, but just moving the app in one last step, we can actually break down a monolithic relational app into microservices and start cleaning off different parts of the services first. So it can be a much more efficient and also more ROI, quicker ROI and some of the investments we're making. So, there is a big, big opportunity here for us to do that, but again I want to be very clear, we view this as a long-term growth opportunity. We're still in the very early days. We've got some really interested customers who are doing some interesting things and working with us on pilots. Our engineering and product and field teams are really focused on this, but we are in the very, very early days of really automating relational migrated to the next level leveraging Gen AI.\nRishi Jaluria: All right, wonderful. That's really helpful. And then I wanted to ask about MongoDB Serverless. I know this is something you've kind of had at least been talking about for a while, given a lot of the concerns around cloud optimization and rationalization, customers overpaying, and having to figure out how to optimize our footprint. It feels like that could be a natural tailwind for MongoDB Serverless especially because you were early to embrace it, can you talk a little bit about what you're -- what you're seeing in terms of adoption there? How we should be thinking about that opportunity and maybe just kind of what this could look like over the next several years in terms of service adoption versus traditional consumption adoption in Atlas. Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so just to be clear, when we talk about serverless, basically what customers think about is that they don't have to start thinking about capacity planning that the workload can scale-up and scale-down based on the needs of whatever the use cases and what the compute and other resource needs are, and so there's been a lot of interest from customers. At first stage, there was a lot of the similar workloads, where they didn't want to go provision a dedicated cluster. They wanted to be able to leverage our serverless functionality, we think long-term that almost every workload will become serverless because over time that'll be the way most applications are provisioned. But we're in the early days and the receptivity and use of our serverless functionality has been very high. And you're right, it's -- for those legacy platforms that they can offer similar solutions MongoDB becomes that much more attractive because a development team and architecture team doesn't have to worry about capacity planning, they can just build the app and they know the background our infrastructure can scale-up and down as their usage -- as the usage -- as the usage goes up and down.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Brent Bracelin, your line is open.\nHannah Rudoff: Hi guys, this is Hannah on for Brent. Thanks for taking my question. Just one from me. The Subscription gross margins remained above 80% for the second straight quarter, even with that continued mix-shift to Atlas. I know you mentioned efficiency improvement to Atlas, but are we at a structural point, Michael, where the scale of gross margins can remain at that 80% plus range into the next year?\nMichael Gordon: Yes, so what I would say is, I do not think -- I think if you think about it, Atlas gross margins continue to be lower than Enterprise Advanced gross margins, and while we're very pleased with that 80% margin performance on a subscription margin basis in Q3, Atlas is quote-unquote only two-thirds and so there is still a delta between the two and so I think that that will have a slightly dilutive effect on margins as Atlas increases as a percent of overall revenue.\nHannah Rudoff: Okay, it makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville of Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nJoe Vandrick: Hi, this is Joe Vandrick on for Patrick Coleville. As of 3Q, it looks like about 29% of direct sales customers are spending over 100K on the platform. Just curious where you think that percentage can trend over the longer term and kind of how big the opportunity is within these existing direct sales customer accounts. Thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, Joe. I would say that we still believe that we have a very small percentage of wallet share in most accounts. And so, obviously the smaller customer the bigger the wallet share. But in most direct sales customers, our percent of wallet share is still quite small. So we see a big opportunity there and as we talked about in terms of our new business, a big part of our new business came from acquiring new workloads with existing customers. And that is a big focus for our go-to-market teams and the runway is quite long for that trend to continue.\nJoe Vandrick: Great and just one more for me. I mean, you kind of touched on this but what's the feedback been from those customers who have used Vector Search in preview, and then obviously with Vector Search comes quite a bit more data. So, how are you making sure that customers don't receive a surprise bill and end up unhappy?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, so, as we mentioned earlier the feedback on our Vector Search has been very-high, even when it was in public preview, we're getting a lot of feedback and then we saw this report that came out, obviously, we don't talk to people who are using alternatives, we just talk focus on our own customers, but it was -- we're pleased to see that out of all the products available in the marketplace, our own preview product had the highest NPS score. So then if you unpack that. Why do customers like using MongoDB, because it is one tightly integrated solution, you can tightly integrate capturing Vector data, metadata, and then data regarding a particular use case and that becomes very, very attractive, it just becomes much more seamless and easier to use versus either using point solutions or some kludgy solution that's been put together. So, I think that's a big reason about how we remove friction from a developers workflow and why the MongoDB approach makes it so much better to use instead of any other alternative approach. In terms of your question around the amount of data and data bills, obviously vectors can be memory intensive and the amount of vectors you generate will obviously drive the amount of usage on those nodes, that's one of the reasons we also introduced dedicated search knows. So you can asymmetrically scale particular nodes of your application especially Search nodes without having to increase the overall size of your cluster. So you're not -- to your point, shocked with a big bill for underlying usage -- for non-usage, right. So, you only scale to nodes that are really -- need that incremental compute and memory versus nodes that don't and that becomes a much more cost-effective way for people to do this and obviously that's another differentiator for MongoDB.\nJoe Vandrick: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. So, that is all the time that we have today for today's conference, I would turn the call-back over to Dev Ittycheria, CEO for any closing remarks.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you. I appreciate everyone joining the call today. Again. I just want to reiterate that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, validating the value proposition of our developer data platform and our run-anywhere strategy. We're seeing strong momentum on our AI strategy, especially Atlas Vector Search, which is emerging as a best-in-class solution for building powerful AI applications. And we continue to help customers drive greater efficiency, while also accelerating our pace of innovation. So with that. I appreciate your time and we'll talk to you soon. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating, you may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker for today, Mr. Brian Denyeau. Please go ahead, sir. The floor is yours.\nBrian Denyeau: Thank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today to review MongoDB's second quarter fiscal 2024 financial results, which we announced in our press release issued after the close of market today. Joining me on the call today are Dev Ittycheria, President and CEO of MongoDB, and Michael Gordon, MongoDB's COO and CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our market and our future growth opportunities, the benefits of our product platform, our competitive landscape, customer behaviors, our financial guidance, and our planned investments. These statements are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including the results of operations and financial conditions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and uncertainties that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks described in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on June 2, 2023. Any forward-looking statements made on this call reflect our views only as of today and we undertake no obligation to update them except as required by law. Additionally, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we had another exceptional quarter as we continue to execute well despite challenging market conditions. I will start by reviewing our second-quarter results before giving you a broader company update. We generated revenue of $424 million, a 40% year-over-year increase and above the high end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 38% year-over-year, representing 63% of revenue, and is now a $1 billion-plus revenue run-rate product. We generated a non-GAAP operating margin -- operating income of $79 million for a record 19% non-GAAP operating margin, and we had another solid quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 45,000 customers. Overall, we delivered an exceptional Q2. We had a healthy quarter of new business acquisitions, led by continued strength in new workload acquisition within our existing customers. From a new logo perspective, we added 1,900 new customers in the quarter. Our direct sales team had another strong quarter of Enterprise customer additions. Finally, our Enterprise Advanced and other non-Atlas business significantly exceeded our expectations, another indication of our strong product market fit and the appeal of our run anywhere strategy. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends, the quarter played out slightly better than our expectations. Michael will discuss consumption trends in more detail. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q2, reinforcing the mission criticality of our platform, even in a difficult spending environment. As we've told you in the past, our market is different from most other software markets because the unit of competition is a workload, not a customer. We started customer relationships by acquiring the first workload and we grew from there acquiring incremental workloads over time. Over the last few years, we have oriented our entire company around winning more workloads. Starting with product. At our New York user conference held in June, we made a number of product announcements that will position us to capture more workloads faster. We introduced Atlas Stream Processing, which enables developers to work with streaming data to build sophisticated event-driven applications, the flexibility of the document model and the power of the MongoDB Query Language provide a compelling and differentiated way to process streaming data compared to alternative approaches. Our early access program is meaningfully been oversubscribed as customers realize they can use a familiar and easy approach to work with streaming data and immediately see value. We announced the general availability of Relational Migrator, which makes it easier for customers to migrate their existing relational applications to MongoDB. We are seeing increased adoption across industries and geographies. For example, a leading international retailer was able to leverage Relational Migrator to dramatically accelerate their migration of Oracle. We also announced Atlas Vector Search, which enables developers to store, index, and query vector embeddings instead of having to bolt-on vector search functionality separately adding yet another point solution and creating a more fragmented developer experience, developers can aggregate and process the vectorized data they need to build AI applications, while also using MongoDB to aggregate and process data and metadata. We're seeing significant interest in our Vector Search offering from large and sophisticated enterprise customers, even though it's only -- still only in preview. As one example, a large global management consulting firm is using Atlas -- Atlas Vector Search for internal research applications that allows consultants to semantically search over 1.5 million expert interview transcripts. Over time, AI functionality will make developers more productive to the use of code generation and code assist tools that enable them to build more applications faster. Developers will also be able to enrich applications with compelling AI experiences by enabling integration with either proprietary or open-source, large language models to deliver more impact. Now instead of data being used only by data scientists to drive insights, data can be used by developers to build smarter applications that truly transform the business. These AI applications will be exceptionally demanding, requiring a truly modern operational data platform like MongoDB. In fact, we believe MongoDB has an even stronger competitive advantage in the world of AI. First, the document model's inherent flexibility and versatility renders it a natural fit for AI applications. Developers can easily manage and process various data types all in one place. Second, AI applications require high-performance, parallel computations, and the ability to scale data processing on an ever-growing base of data. MongoDB supports its features with features like sharding and auto-scaling. Lastly, it is important to remember that AI applications have the same demand as any other type of application, transactional guarantees, security and privacy requirements, tech search, in-app analytics, and more. Our developer data platform gives developer a unified solution to build smarter AI applications. We are seeing these applications developed across a wide variety of customer types and use cases. For example, Observe.AI is an AI startup that leverages 40 billion parameter LLM to provide customers with intelligence and coaching that maximize performance of their frontline support and sales teams. Observe.AI processes and run models on millions of support touchpoints daily to generate insights for the customers. Most of this rich unstructured data is stored in MongoDB. Observe.AI chose to build on MongoDB, because we enabled them to quickly innovate, scale to handle large and unpredictable workloads and meet the security requirements of their largest enterprise customers. On the other end of the spectrum is one of the leading industrial equipment suppliers in North America. This company relies on Atlas and Atlas Device Sync to deploy AI models at the edge. To their field teams, mobile devices to better manage and predict inventory in areas with poor physical network connectivity, they chose MongoDB because of our ability to efficiently handle large quantities of distributed data and to seamlessly integrate between the network edge and their back-end systems. As much as we innovate our products, we also continuously innovate and how we engage with our customers. We are highly focused on reducing friction in the sales process, so we can acquire more workloads quickly and cost-effectively given the large size of our market opportunity. Historically, the most significant source of friction has been negotiating with customers to secure an upfront Atlas commitment since it can be hard for customers to forecast consumption growth for a new workload. Given our high retention rates and the underlying consumption growth, several years ago, we began reducing the importance of upfront commitments in our go-to-market process to accelerate workload acquisition. This year, we took additional steps in that direction. For example, we no longer incentivize reps to sign customers to one-year commitments. Obviously, this has short-term impacts on our cash flow, but positions us better for the longer term by accelerating workload acquisition. We are pleased with the impact these changes have had on the business in the first half of the year, specifically, new workload acquisition has accelerated, especially within existing customers. We believe that our efforts to reduce friction are resulting in more efficient growth and we'll always look for ways to improve our go-to-market approach to make it even easier for customers to bring new workloads onto our platform. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. Customers across industries, including Renault, Hootsuite, and Ford are running mission-critical projects on MongoDB Atlas, leveraging the full power of our developer data platform. One of the 2023 MongoDB North American Innovation Award winners is Ford. With a focus on innovation, quality, and customer satisfaction, Ford is a leader in the automotive industry and a household name around the world. Ford is committed to developing advanced technologies that enhance the safety, performance, and sustainability of its vehicles. Their data explorer and transportation mobility cloud applications aggregate customer vehicle data from 24 different sources at a volume ranging up to 15 terabytes. Since migrating to MongoDB Atlas from the previous solution, Ford has seen a 50% performance improvement and faster rewrite times. Cathay Pacific, Foot Locker, and Market Access are examples of customers turning to MongoDB to free up the developer’s time for innovation while achieving significant cost savings. Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong's home airline carrier operating in more than 60 destinations worldwide, turned to MongoDB on their journey to become one of the first airlines to create a truly paperless flight deck. Flight Folder, their application built on MongoDB, consolidates dozens of different information sources into one place and includes a digital refueling feature that helps crews become much more efficient with fueling strategies, saving significant flight time and costs. Since the Flight Folder launch, Cathay Pacific has completed more than 340,000 flights with full digital integration in the flight deck. In addition to the greatly improved flight crew experience, flight times have been reduced and the digital refueling has saved eight minutes on the ground on average. All these efficiencies have helped the company avoid the release of 15,000 tons of carbon and save an estimated $12.5 million. Powerledger, Wells Fargo, and System1 are among customers turning to MongoDB to modernize existing applications. System1, a customer acquisition marketing company acquired MapQuest in 2019. At the time of the acquisition, MapQuest had a fragmented architecture that mixed disparate data persistent technologies with third-party services. System1 selected Atlas as a key piece of MapQuest's architecture transformation and has realized estimated cost reductions of 75% and performance improvements of 20% over its prior relational database solution. MapQuest is planning a number of future projects that we use Atlas search and time series collections to improve the user experience and create a feedback loop and location-based relevancy in different cities. In summary, I am incredibly stoked with our second-quarter results. Our ability to win new workloads remained strong and our run anywhere strategy is resonating with customers. While it's early days on AI, we continue to see evidence that MongoDB will be a platform of choice for AI applications, just like we are for other modern and demanding applications. We continue to invest to maximize our long-term potential. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the second quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our second quarter results and then finish with our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024. First, I'll start with our second quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $423.8 million, up 40% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy new business environment especially in terms of acquiring new workloads within existing customers. To us, this is confirmation we remain a top priority for our customers and that our value proposition continues to resonate even in this market. Shifting to our product mix, let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 38% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 63% of total revenue compared to 64% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and 65% last quarter. In Q2, Atlas slightly declined as a percentage of revenue due to the exceptionally strong performance of our non-Atlas business, underscoring the demand for MongoDB regardless of where customers are in their cloud adoption journey. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be affected by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. Consumption growth in Q2 was slightly better than our expectations. As a reminder, we had assumed Atlas would continue to be impacted by the difficult macro environment in Q2, and that is largely how the quarter played out. Turning to non-Atlas revenues. EA significantly exceeded our expectations in the quarter, and we continue to have success selling incremental workloads into our EA customer base. We continue to see that our customers, regardless of their mode of deployment, are launching more workloads at MongoDB and moving towards standardizing on our platform. The EA revenue outperformance was in part a result of more multiyear deals than we had expected. In addition, we had an exceptionally strong quarter in our other licensing revenues. On our last call, we mentioned that we would benefit from a few large multiyear licensing deals, most notably the renewal and extension of our relationship with Alibaba. We also closed some additional multiyear licensing deals in the quarter, which is a meaningful contributor to our outperformance and another sign of popularity of MongoDB and the success of our run anywhere strategy. As a reminder, under ASC 606 for both EA and licensing contracts, the term license component even for multiyear deals, is recognized as upfront revenue. Turning to customer growth. During the second quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 1,900 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 45,000, which is up from over 37,000 in the year period. Of our total customer count, over 6,800 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 5,400 in the year ago period. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 43,500 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 35,500 in the year ago period. It's important to keep in mind that the growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers, adding incremental Atlas workloads. Let me double-click into our direct customer count. As Dev mentioned, we're becoming increasingly sophisticated in how we engage our customers. But some of those motions result in the line between our direct sales and our self-service channels becoming more fluid. I thought it'd be helpful to highlight two particular inter-channel dynamics that impact the channel breakdown of our reported customer counts. While these customer movements represent less than 1% of our ARR, we do expect both of these trends to continue into the future, and so we wanted to make sure you understood how they affect our reported customer counts by channel. First, we are having increasing success leveraging cloud provider self-service marketplaces to drive new customer additions. Growing cloud marketplace volumes is a major secular trend, and we are the only ISV available on all three hyperscaler marketplaces. Customers can deploy Atlas in seconds through cloud provider consoles and can pay for it by drawing down their existing cloud commitments. This further reduces friction as it bypasses the need for our contract altogether. For this reason, our direct sales team has been directing certain new prospects to sign-up using self-serve marketplaces. We've added several hundred customers using this approach in recent quarters, and these customers show up in our self-serve customer count even though we have a direct sales relationship with them. Second, we continually review and analyze product usage signals to determine the potential of our customers. Because we are focused on velocity and efficiency of new workload acquisition, we're very careful not to deploy our reps on accounts where we don't see significant incremental benefit from sales rep coverage. If we determine that a direct sales customer can be supported more cost effectively in the self-serve channel, we'd prefer to free up the rep's time to focus on winning more new workloads. So far this year, we've moved over 300 small mid-market direct sales customers to the self-service channel. Moving on to ARR. We had another quarter with our net ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,855 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,462 in the year ago period. Moving down the income statement. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the second quarter was $329 million, representing a gross margin of 78%, which is up from 73% in the year ago period. It is important to keep in mind that this quarter, we saw exceptional performance of our EA and licensing revenue, which contains a large upfront license component and very high margins, and therefore, we wouldn't expect to repeat this performance. Our income from operations was $79.1 million or a 19% operating margin for the second quarter compared to a negative 4% margin in the year ago period. Our strong bottom-line results demonstrate the significant operating leverage in our model and are a clear indication of the strength in our underlying unit economics. The primary reason for our operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. Net income in the second quarter was $76.7 million or $0.93 per share based on 82.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to a net loss of $15.6 million or $0.23 per share on 68.3 million base weighted average shares outstanding in the year ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the second quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the second quarter was negative $25.3 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was negative $27.3 million in the quarter. This compares to negative free cash flow of $48.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Three things of note on our cash flow performance in the quarter. First, as many of you know, Q2 tends to be our seasonally lowest collections quarter of the year because of low contract volumes in Q1, as evidenced by our Q1 ending accounts receivable balance. Second, while our revenue reflects the ASC 606 treatment of multiyear EA and licensing deals, most multiyear contracts are still billed annually, so there's no equivalent benefit to cash flow. Finally, as Dev mentioned, we continue de-emphasizing the value of upfront commitments. So we're seeing fewer of them. In other words, we are intentionally collecting less cash upfront in order to win more workloads more quickly. As evidence of this, we grew Atlas revenue 38% year-over-year, while Atlas dollars committed upfront actually declined by 15% year-over-year. Lower upfront commitments only impact the timing of when our customers pay us, not the total payment. But this trend of declining upfront commitments will impact the relationship between our non-GAAP operating income and operating cash flow in the medium term. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $400 million to $404 million, we expect non-GAAP income from moderations to be in the range of $41 million to $44 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.47 to $0.50 based on 83.5 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year '24, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.596 billion to $1.608 billion. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $189 million to $197 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $2.27 and to $2.35 based on 83 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll provide some more context on our guidance. First, we have modestly raised our outlook for the rest of the year, primarily to reflect a slightly stronger Q2 and therefore a higher starting ARR for the second half. We continue to expect that Atlas consumption growth will be impacted by the difficult macroeconomic environment throughout fiscal '24. Our revised full year revenue guidance continues to assume consumption growth that is, on average, in line with the consumption growth we've experienced in the slowdown began in Q2 of last year, but with a slight seasonal benefit in Q3 and a slowdown in Q4 as observed over the last two years. Second, we expect to see a significant sequential decline in non-Atlas revenues in Q3 as we simply do expect similar new business activity, especially when it comes to licensing deals. For that particular line of business, Q2 was just an extreme positive outlier. Third, we're raising our non-Atlas revenue estimate for the rest of the year, even though we don't expect our exceptional Q2 performance to repeat in the second half, our results in the first half give us incremental confidence in our run anywhere strategy. We continue to expect, however, that the difficult compare in the back half of the year will impact our non-Atlas growth rate. Finally, thanks to strong performance in Q2 and the increased revenue outlook, we're meaningfully increasing our assumption for operating margins in fiscal '24 to 12% at the midpoint of our guidance. an improvement of more than 700 basis points compared to fiscal '23, while continuing to invest to pursue our long-term opportunity. As you update your models, please keep in mind that the majority of our planned fiscal '24 hiring will actually occur in the second half of the year. To summarize, MongoDB delivered excellent second quarter results in a difficult environment. We are pleased with our ability to win new business and are demonstrating the operating leverage inherent in our model. While we continue to monitor the macro environment, we remain incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead [Technical Difficulty] to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open it up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. One moment while we can file the Q&A roster. And our first question today will be coming from Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your line is open.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Good new version. Congrats from me on a great quarter. Two quick questions. First, the new -- or the trends you saw for EA or the numbers you saw for EA this quarter, you called out kind of bigger commitments from existing customers and taking more workloads -- or returning more workloads towards Mongo. Is that -- could you talk a little bit towards that in terms of is that a new trend? Was it just kind of very special this quarter? What are you seeing there? Because that's kind of in this sort of environment, seems like against what do you see from everyone else. So maybe couple of factors there? And then the second question is on the newer products like the streaming and vector databases, how does that feed into the revenue model for Mongo? That’s it for me. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So Raimo, the trends for EA, I think, is just an indication of our run anywhere strategy. We've been very committed to that strategy since the beginning. As you know, we started with EA and then introduced Atlas. But the whole point is that we give customers choice and we want to meet customers where they are in terms of what deployment model they want to use. And so I think this is just puts and takes of the quarter where we had a number of customers who wanted to double down on EA. And we also had some other non-Atlas business come in, in the quarter, which showed up in our results. But it's really a confirmation of the fact that we give customers choice and customers really appreciate that, and that's what you've seen in the results. With regards to, I think you said streaming and vector, those will show up in the Atlas revenue line as incremental consumption. There won't be a separate SKU. But what it will do is drive, as those workloads come on, that will drive incremental consumption of Atlas, which will show up in the Atlas revenue line.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I would just add that also as part of the broader developer data platform, it gives us the opportunity to win more workloads in the beginning. So you've got both sort of new workload penetration piece, which Dev mentioned, but also sort of the increased Atlas number is where it will show up on a revenue standpoint.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you, congrats.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Raimo.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Keith Weiss of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKeith Weiss: This is Keith Weiss on for Sanjit Singh. One question for Dev and one for Michael. Dev, you guys talked about, I think, last quarter, 1,500 AI companies using MongoDB. You talked a lot about your applicability for AI workloads. I think a question that a lot of investors have is like the time frame for when this actually creates real impacts to where it becomes significant tailwind or just software in general, but more specifically the question to you is when do you think that becomes a significant tailwind for MongoDB? When will we see that more significantly in Atlas revenues? And then the question for Michael. We talked about the commitments coming down, the Atlas commitments coming down and that being a drag on operating cash flow. Any sense you could give us on how long that drag on [OCF] (ph) persists? Is there any way to size that impact over time?\nDev Ittycheria: So, Keith, on AI, obviously, we're really excited about the opportunity that AI presents. We continue to add many more AI customers this quarter. In the short term, we're really excited about some of the use cases we're seeing. We talked about Observe.Ai, the management consulting company, a more traditional company using MongoDB for very impactful AI use case. And longer term, we believe our developer data platform value prop will just drive more AI adoption. People want to use one compelling, unified developer experience to address a wide variety of use cases of which AI is just one of them. And we're definitely hearing from customers to being able to do that on one platform versus bolting on a bunch of point solutions is far more the preferable approach. And so we're excited about the opportunity there. And I think you had some questions -- on the other thing on partners, I do want to say that we're seeing a lot of work and activity with our partner channel on the AI front as well. We're working with Google in the AI start-up program, and there's a lot of excitement. Google had their next conference this week. We're also working with Google to help train Codey, their code generation tool to help people accelerate the development of AI and other applications. And we're seeing a lot of interest in our own AI innovators program. We've had lots of customers apply for that program. So we're super excited about the interest that we're generating.\nMichael Gordon: And on your other question, Keith, it's been a multiyear journey where we've been focused on reducing friction and accelerating new workload adoption. I do think as we called out, we continue to make additional steps and Dev called out some of the specific incremental steps this year. I think it's part of a transition. If you look at the Atlas revenue growth, Atlas grew 38% year-over-year, but dollars collected upfront shrank 15%, right? And so that gives you a sense for the magnitude or the divergence there that's showing up in the op income versus OCF bridge. I think like most things, there'll be a transition time period, but then it will settle into a more normalized level, but I think we've still got like a little bit more transition to go as we kind of work through the balance of the year.\nKeith Weiss: Got it. Thank you, guys.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Keith.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will be coming from Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs, your line is open.\nKash Rangan: I'm sorry, I didn't hear my name. Thank you very much and congrats, Dev and Michael on the quarter. It's hard to -- put up this kind of operating margin performance being a database company at the scale that you're operating. So kudos on that. The relational migrator came off of beta and came into GA this quarter. So I wonder if that had any particular impact on the EA business because you've certainly up sighted your modest expectations. I want to get a little bit more detail on how that pipeline of Relational Migrator beta customers should play out? Is it going to be showing up in Atlas? Or is it going to be showing up in enterprise, the on-prem version. And on AI, just curious if you can quantify the level of consumption impact in the future to Atlas that you could attribute to the different new things that Mongo is working, whether it's AI or streaming. How should we think about the incremental opportunities for consumption afforded by some of the new things you launched at MongoDB live in New York a couple of months back. Thank you so much. Congrats.\nDev Ittycheria: Sure. So regarding relational migrators, it's important for investors to know that this is really a high-end enterprise play. That's where the bulk of the legacy relational market is. And Relational Migrator is designed to help customers reduce the switching cost of migrating off relational databases to MongoDB for both EA and Atlas. So it's a place to -- depending again on the customer's choice of their deployment model but it's really meant to reducing the switching costs. I would say that there was no real impact in terms of revenue of customers using Relational Migrator because we just only made it generally available in June. But there's a tremendous amount of excitement. We have a large pipeline of customers who are very interested and are actually starting to use Relational Migrator and projects have begun, but there was no real impact on the quarter. Regarding your second question about some of the new products and the impact of AI long term, what I would say is we definitely believe it will have a big impact long term. We think that things like Vector Search just make it so much easier to build smarter applications on MongoDB that unified developer experience is a key differentiator. There's a really strong interest in our Public Preview product. We also see a lot of interest in Stream Processing. Stream Processing is a use case that's really optimized for MongoDB. The data is typically JSON, the variability of the data lends itself to a document model that's much more flexible. It's obviously very developer-oriented, where all the alternatives are using very rigid schemas and are much more complicated to use that plays into our sweet spot. So we think we have a big opportunity there. But -- and so it's hard to quantify what that impact will be in the long term, but I will tell you that we're really excited and the interest level on the new products is incredibly high.\nKash Rangan: Fantastic. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Brad Reback of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. I'm not sure Dev or Michael, but going back to the commentary on fewer upfront Atlas commits. Oftentimes, when customers sign multiyear deals and pay upfront, they get a better rate. So if we were to think about not having them pay you upfront and make long-term commits, is that a net margin benefit to you guys on the pricing side?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So a couple of things. Thanks, Brad, for the question. In general, for us, even before the sort of evolution and changes in multiyear deals, typically, they were not all paid upfront. Typically, ours has been annually billed. But yes, to your point, I think as we've reduced upfront commitment, you have a couple of dynamics. The key one is when we are not motivating it or providing an incentive to our sales force, and it winds up being customer driven, the leverage in that negotiation shifts. And on the margin, that is helpful for the ultimate pricing or discount and winds up with sort of better pricing for us, less discounting to the customer.\nBrad Reback: Excellent. And then on your commentary about second half hiring outpacing first half. Would it be correct to assume that the hiring environment is a little less competitive, so you might actually be able to find people more easily and get better pricing for them as well? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. What I would say, Brad, is that, I would say, in general, obviously, the frothiness of a few years ago has abated, but for certain skill sets, there's still significant premium for talent, and we don't want to lower our bar just to optimize on cost. We pride ourselves on recruiting the best of the best in this industry. And we focus on paying market rates. And so while it's a little easier because the market is a little softer, I wouldn't suggest that all of a sudden, we're getting employees at a massive discount.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. I would think about it as availability rather than cost and then throw in some of the dynamics with some places around different return to office models and other things. I think that sort of incrementally is likely to provide opportunities in the back half of the year. And as they present themselves, we'll certainly pursue those.\nBrad Reback: Excellent. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Karl Keirstead of UBS. Your line is open.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Maybe this one to Mike. Michael, I wouldn't normally ask about the other segment, but it's such an outlier if I could ask a two-parter. First is, what surprised on the upside there? Was the Alibaba deal much larger than you thought? Or did you grab a few others, maybe you could unpack that? And secondly, you did tell us that the second half guidance assumes a significant decline in the non-Atlas business. Is it fair to assume that this other category might return back to the levels it was at pre the July quarter? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. Thanks, Karl. No, other deals, not Alibaba. Alibaba was baked at the time of the last guidance call. So it was sort of incremental deals that surprised us to the upside there. And yes, obviously, it's a volatile or variable, especially given the 606 and the nature of it where it goes, given the lumpiness of the term license revenue and things like that. And so, yes, I think that this is not repeatable performance, and I think it should settle back down to a more -- to a lower and more normalized level.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. And then if I could ask a follow-up, Mike, you did a good job explaining the changes in the model and the licensing on cash flow, but it's not a metric you often talk about, but your deferred revenue balance was actually down year-over-year, highly unusual. Is this basically the same explanation that would be impacting DR? Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. I think it's the same explanation or discussion overlaid with our recurring discussion around billings, and that's sort of not a metric that we focused on and that we sort of discourage people from using and we're focused sort of on those workloads and winning new workloads rather than large upfront commitments. But one of the ways that plays out is absolutely in deferred and for anyone still doing defer -- I mean, calculated billings. Calculations that will affect that there as well. Yes.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Awesome. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question is coming from Rishi Jaluria of RBC. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is [Rich calling] (ph) on for Rishi Jaluria today. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess if we look at the workloads you have in front of you with Vector Search, Relational Migrator and Streaming and could even throw an application search, which was more of a driver, let's call it, last year. But if we had to stack rank each of those workloads in terms of your positioning to win and your overall opportunity in each of those use cases, how would you go about doing that?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So Rich, thanks for your question. I would say, obviously, the general operational workload of what you call the OLTP workload is still our bread and butter. Workloads that people come to us and relational migrator would just be more of that because of the migrating operational workloads of relational databases to MongoDB. And then the other use case really, other products really function of the use cases that customers are really interested in. For example, Atlas Device Sync, which is really focused on the enterprise mobility play, for example, point-of-sale devices for the retail industry in automotive, connected car in manufacturing, instrumenting the factory floor. So it really depends on the use cases. In application search, we're really seeing an acceleration of large workloads in that -- for that product. So we're really excited about the size of some of the business that we're seeing there. Obviously, Vector is still in public preview. So we hope to have a GA sometime next year, but we're really excited about the early and high interest from enterprises. And obviously, some customers are already deploying it in production, even though it's a public preview product. Streaming is something that we're super excited about. This is more for event-driven real-time applications. It's just very suitable for MongoDB due to the -- most of the data is in JSON and the flexibility of [document] (ph) model makes it a very compelling play. And so I would say that, it really depends on the customer's use case. What it really does is it just enables us to go after more workloads more quickly, and it really positions us as a truly strategic supplier to large enterprises and obviously, a critical supplier for early-stage companies, and that's our strategy, is to get customers to use MongoDB for a variety of use cases across a variety of deployment models.\nMichael Gordon: The other thing that I'd add, which is probably implicit and comes across that, but I think it's important enough to make explicit is one thing that, that sort of, Rich, in your question, sort of the slice-by-slice view misses is the aggregate benefit of delivering the whole platform, right, in delivering a common integrated unified experience to developers so they don't have to use a bunch of point solutions. And I think that's really a key part of the strategy.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That makes perfect sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nBrent Bracelin: Good afternoon. This is Brent. I believe I’m -- was next there. Dev, I wanted to talk a little bit about AI. And Mongo has been at the leading powering new apps for the better part of the decade. We're all trying to figure out what this AI [first world] (ph) looks like, given your purview as a new app enabler, what's your sense in the next three to four years, how many of these new apps are going to layer in large language models? And what is the net result on the database? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So Brent, thanks for your question. I firmly believe that we, as an industry, tend to overestimate the impact of a new technology in the short term and underestimate the impact in the long term. So as you may know, there's a lot of hype in the market right now, in the industry right around AI and in some of the early stage companies in the space have -- the valuations are to the roof. In some cases, almost -- it's hard to see how people can make money because the risk reward doesn't seem to be sized appropriately. So there's a lot of hype in the space. But I do think that AI will be a big impact for the industry and for us long term. I believe that almost every application, both new and existing, will have some AI functionality embedded into the application over the next -- in your horizon three to five years. And let me just remind people why we see -- where we see AI impacting our business. One, developers will become far more productive with the use of code generation and code assist tools. What that will mean is like that will lead to more applications, which means they need more databases and more data platforms. Second, developers will use things like generative AI to just build smarter and more intelligent applications. One, they don't want to use point solutions because it's clear developers want one platform to process and analyze data and metadata and vectorized data and MongoDB is that platform. So which is why in so much interest. And Vector Search, I believe, is really ultimately a feature, not a product. And essentially, it's basically enabling people to marry private data with public data to really offer a compelling experience and there's so much interest in our public preview right now. And as we -- as I mentioned earlier, we've continued to add many more AI customers this quarter and we think the impact will be big. But in the short term, these are still smaller workloads, but they're going to grow over time. Some of the use cases are really interesting, but the fact is that we're really well positioned because what generative AI does is really instantiate AI in front of -- in software, which means developers play a bigger role rather than data scientists, and that's where you'll really see the business impact. And I think that impact will be large over the next three to five years.\nBrent Bracelin: Super helpful color there. And a quick follow-up for Mike. Three-year annual growth rate for EA is over 20%. It slipped below 10% in Q1, spiked now about 30% here in Q2, excluding the licensing multiyear deals. If you continue to see enterprise workload migrations happen, why can't you continue to see strength in EA?\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. So a couple of things. I think as Dev mentioned, some of the Relational Migrations, with the destination of those, whether it's Enterprise Advanced or Atlas will depend on the customers cloud strategy and their overall approach from like an IT strategy standpoint. Certainly, some of that could benefit EA, and we've continued to see robust adoption and adoption of new workloads within that EA customer base. I think the key thing, at least thinking about the back half of this year, and as you start thinking about next year, is just we have had very strong results from EA. And so we think about EA on a compare basis, I just think it's really important to keep in mind.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Jason Ader of William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just wanted to get a sense on EA. You talked about doing a good job of existing customers adding incremental workloads. What's the main driver there? Is there something you're doing differently? Or do you think it's just maturity and customers getting more comfortable with you for more workloads?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. I think it's really a function of people really recognizing that MongoDB is truly a standard. It's a platform they can bet on to run the most mission-critical use cases and the flexibility of the deployment models means that they can start on-prem, but they can always migrate to the cloud. And so that optional -- that built-in optionality also makes going to EA that much more comforting because it's not like they'll be locked into an on-prem solution or locked into some proprietary cloud solutions. So that that's why I believe, just given our maturity given how we're really becoming a standard in so many organizations, people are much more comfortable doubling down on EA.\nJason Ader: Got you. And then just to follow up on that on EA question. It seems like -- I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it seems like maybe you've been a little bit surprised at the strength of EA relative to Atlas over last year. I mean Atlas has been really strong, too, but EA has, I think, surprised you more to the upside. What does that say, I guess, about kind of on-prem versus cloud or self-managed versus fully managed. Any comments on that, Dev?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. What I would say is it really is a reinforcement that customers still will run workloads on-prem, that they still will run workload they want to manage themselves versus use a managed service like Atlas. And so -- and I think customers value choice. And customers value the ability to have different deployment models, but also value the fact that if they want to migrate from one deployment model to another, it's easiest to do so using MongoDB. So I think what we're really seeing is customers valuing choice and to run anywhere strategy is really resonating with customers.\nMichael Gordon: And I would just add, Jason, that the premise of your question is correct. We have been very surprised, obviously, pleasantly so, with the performance of EA. It's been terrific to see, but it's definitely been surprising to the upside.\nJason Ader: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question, please. And the next question will be coming from Tyler Radke of Citi. Your line is open.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. So Atlas revenue grew by almost $30 million quarter-over-quarter, which is the highest you've ever seen it. Certainly, that performance is better than any of the other consumption models you're seeing. It seems like the commentary at least on Atlas, consumption was pretty consistent with your expectations and still a bit below where it had been pre some of the macro challenges. So could you just kind of unpack what what's driving that strength and revision back to kind of record high levels of sequential dollar adds? Is it better pricing just given some of the sales changes you made or perhaps maybe it's the new AI use cases that you talked about. If you could just help us understand that a bit better. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yeah. Thanks for the question, Tyler. A few things. If you're looking at an absolute dollars basis, obviously, the business is much larger. So let's start with that. Secondly, if we're looking at the sequential from Q1 to Q2, remember, Q1 has fewer days. And so that's obviously part of the dynamic, and you'll see that historically as well. And then third, we had talked about the Q1 consumption being better than planned, and therefore, the starting ARR in Q2 being better. We saw the consumption itself kind of once we had that -- once you kind of adjust for that higher starting base, broadly in line with our expectations. So slightly better, but not big upside there. And when we look at it in the back half of the year, that's what we're continuing to assume is that same trend line, obviously, seasonally adjusted based on those emerging seasonal patterns. But that's really how to kind of tie and square all the numbers.\nTyler Radke: Okay. That's helpful. And then a follow-up question, just in terms of the excitement, obviously, out in the industry around generative AI. But I guess I'm curious specifically how internally you're using generative AI in products like relational migrator to automate a lot of the re-architecture process? And secondly, are you seeing a greater appetite from customers to modernize kind of legacy transactional applications. And is that starting to pick up just given the excitement around Gen AI? Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So with regards to Gen AI, I mean, we do see opportunities, essentially, the reason when you migrate off using Relational Migrator, there's really three things you have to focus on. One is mapping the schema from the old relational database to the MongoDB platform. Moving the data appropriately and then also rewriting some, if not all, of the application code. Historically, that last component has been the most manually intensive part of the migration, obviously, with the advance of code generation tools, there’s opportunities to automate the rewriting of the application code. I think we're still in the very early days. You'll see us continue to add new functionality to Relational Migrator to help again reduce the switching costs of doing so. And that's obviously an area that we're going to focus. So that's in some ways, a big opportunity for us. And Tyler, there was the second part to your question, which I...\nTyler Radke: Yeah. Yeah, it was just around the customer appetite, like is that the frenzy around Gen AI, is that causing an acceleration in the pace in which customers want to take on these modernization projects?\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. So I would say that the recent MongoDB is well suited for these new modernization projects is, one, obviously, the data that's trapped in these legacy platforms is incredibly important if you want to leverage that proprietary data for a competitive advantage. Two, is that the performance requirements of these new modern applications require a new modern platform. And three, because it's such an iterative area where people are -- is changing so quickly, you all see the platform that's inherently flexible. So that's driving people to move to MongoDB and to more modern platforms more quickly. So unlike the old lift and shift where people are just trying to say, avoid paying the Oracle tax, now people are being much more thoughtful about not just lifting and shifting, but modernizing and going off relational to MongoDB. And that's definitely a trend that's increasing.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Tyler.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from Patrick Walravens of JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [Owen] (ph) for Pat. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter. Just a quick one for me. What will the pricing structure for some of the new features like Vector Search and Stream Processing be?\nDev Ittycheria: So the pricing will be a function of the -- obviously, the consumption of the back-end infrastructure that supports those new capabilities. So they'll show up as essentially more consumption of Atlas clusters, or increases of clusters depending on the load of the application, and will show up on the Atlas revenue line.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the next question. And our next question will be coming from Michael Turits of KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nMichael Turits: Hello?\nDev Ittycheria: Hey, Michael.\nMichael Turits: My name got [indiscernible], I wasn't sure it was me. Thanks. Quick one for you, Mike, and then one for Dev. Very quick. Mike, are you able to comment on the linearity in the quarter relative to those consumption growth trends and how we exited? And then, Dev, for you, you just said that you think that Vector Search is a feature, not a product. There are as you know, two databases deliberately out there, explicitly out there in the market. And then, you, as well as others, who don't have vector databases, including Google, with [Allo] (ph) the other day, are talking about the applicability of their databases for vector embedding. So can you talk about how that's playing out as far as you can tell with customers in terms of their receptivity of looking for something besides a dedicated vector database for this? So linear question and then that one.\nMichael Gordon: Sure. Yeah, just quickly in linear, I don't think there's anything particularly point out of note there.\nDev Ittycheria: And so regarding Vector Search, and I've shared this with other -- talked about this previously, Vector Search is really a reverse index. So it's like an index that's built into all databases. I believe, over time, Vector Search functionality will be built into all databases or data platforms in the future. Yes, there are some point products that are just focused solely on Vector Search. But essentially, it's a point product that still needs to be used with other technologies like MongoDB to store the metadata, the data to be able to process and analyze all that information. So developers have spoken loudly that having a unified and elegant developer experience is a key differentiator. It removes friction in how they work. It's much easier to build and innovate on one platform as learning and supporting multiple technologies. And so my strong belief is that, ultimately, Vector Search will be embedded in many platforms and our differentiation will be, again, like it always has been a very compelling and elegant developer experience.\nMichael Turits: Thanks, Dev and Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for the next question. Our next question will be coming from Mike Cikos of Needham. Your line is open. Mike Cikos of Needham, your line is open.\nMike Cikos: I'm sorry. I apologize, the operator [indiscernible] Thanks for getting me on the call here, guys. If I could just follow up on, Dev, your comments there in response to Michael on the Vector Search. I know that we're talking about the developers and how they they're voting here because they want the data in a unified platform, a unified database that preserves all that metadata, right? But I would think there's probably also a benefit to having it all in a single platform as well just because you're lowering the TCO for your customers as well, right? They're not paying a tax for the movement or duplication of all that data between different vendors. Is that also a fair assumption when I'm thinking about the potential that you guys bring versus maybe some of those more point features or databases out there?\nDev Ittycheria: Well, with vectors, vectors are really a mathematical representation of different types of data. So there’s not a tonne of data, unlike application search, where there's a profound benefits by storing everything on one platform versus having an operational database and a search database and some glue to keep the data in sync. That's not as much the case with Vector because you're talking about storing essentially an elegant index. And so it's more about the user experience and the development workflow that really matters. And what we believe is that offering the same taxonomy in the same way they know how to use MongoDB to also be able to enable Vector Search functionality is a much more compelling differentiation than a developer have to bolt-on a separate vector solution and have to provision, configure and manage that solution along with all the other things they have to do.\nMike Cikos: Got it. Thank you for helping clear my understanding on that. And then just a quick follow-up for Michael. Michael, I've gotten a couple of inbounds just trying to unpack the Q3 revenue guide here, specifically as it pertains to Atlas. And I think what people are looking at is, I think Atlas embed slower sequential growth on a daily consumption basis. The questions I'm getting are, was there anything onetime 2Q that would cause us to think that the daily Atlas consumption growth would decelerate going into 3Q? Or anything else you can tease out there while we have you?\nMichael Gordon: No. I think if you look at what we said is the real underlying reason for the increase, obviously, we don't guide by product, but we are trying to give you a whole bunch of color around it, the real increase -- and the Atlas number is given the slight outperformance in Q2, we have a starter hiring ARR in Q2, and that's at the beginning of Q3. And that's really what's flowing through in the numbers and in the guidance.\nMike Cikos: Terrific. Thank you very much guys, I appreciate it.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, Mike.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Mile.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session for today. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Dev Ittycheria, CEO, for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I just want to reinforce that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, which really validates our value proposition and our run anywhere strategy. Again, we remain focused on our North Star, which is acquiring new workloads, both from new workloads -- new customers and existing customers. And we're innovating both on the product and go-to-market dimensions to accelerate workload acquisition. And while it's early days, we believe that with the rise of AI, MongoDB will be a beneficiary of as AI becomes more prominent. Thank you very much, and I appreciate all your time. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating and enjoy the rest of your evening. You may now disconnect."

Please refer to the tables in our earnings release on the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Dev.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Brian, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong performance in the first quarter and we continue to execute well despite challenging market conditions. I will start by reviewing our first quarter results before giving you a broader company update. But first, I would like to personally invite all of you to the Investor session at MongoDB.local New York City to be held at the Javits Center on June 22. Please email ir@mongodb.com if you're interested in attending. Now turning to our results. We generated revenue of $368 million, a 29% year-over-year increase and above the high-end of our guidance. Atlas revenue grew 40% year-over-year, representing 65% of revenue. And we had another strong quarter of customer growth, ending the quarter with over 43,100 customers. Overall, we delivered a strong Q1. We had a very healthy quarter of new business acquisition. We added approximately 2,300 customers during the quarter, the highest number in over two years, including over 300 new direct sales customers with notable strength in our Enterprise channel. Our ongoing new business success is due to the mission criticality of our platform and sharp execution by our go-to-market teams, who are navigating a difficult selling environment by remaining laser-focused on our North Star acquiring new workloads. In fact, this quarter, we acquired a record number of new workloads from our existing customers. Moving on to Atlas consumption trends. Q1 consumption was ahead of our expectations but remains below the levels we saw prior to the macro slowdown that began last year. Michael will share more detail on this. Finally, retention rates remained strong in Q1, reinforcing the enduring value in our platform. We are pleased with our results this quarter, especially given the difficult macro environment. It's clear, customers continue to scrutinize our technology investments and must decide which technologies are a must have versus a merely and nice to have. We believe that our Q1 performance and continued new business strength demonstrate that MongoDB is clearly a must have for customers. In today's digital economy, most companies express their business strategies through software. They use software to deliver their core value proposition, provide customers with great experiences and drive operational efficiency. MongoDB is an essential platform in this drive for innovation, making us the critical investment priority. Our customers ranging from the largest companies in the world to cutting-edge startups use our developer data platform to develop and run mission-critical applications. As these applications become successful, customers spend more with MongoDB. In other words, their spend on our platform is directly aligned with the usage of their underlying application, therefore, the value they derive from it. While the growth rate of existing applications can vary based on a number of factors including macro conditions, the relationship between application usage and growth -- application usage growth and MongoDB spend has remained consistent. We believe this is a testament to how well our value proposition is aligned to our customer success. Thinking about a long-term opportunity, I feel exceptionally confident about our core underlying growth driver, the need for companies to use software as a competitive advantage. Customers have ever-increasing expectations for better products, services and experiences, and companies rely on custom-built suffer to deliver these expectations better and faster than the competition. As I've said many times in the past, a durable competitive advantage is built through custom software, it cannot be obtained with an off-the-shelf product. Since most companies understand that they and their competition are all differentiating themselves through software, the speed of software development becomes existential. A McKinsey report found that companies that score in the top quartile of developer velocity generate revenue growth that is four times to five times faster than companies in the bottom quartile. MongoDB is built for speed. We believe AI will be the next frontier of development productivity -- developer productivity and will likely lead to a step-function increase in software development velocity. We know that most organizations have a huge backlog of projects they would like to take on, but they just don't have the development capacity to pursue. As developer productivity meaningfully improves, companies can dramatically increase their software ambitions and rapidly launch many more applications to transform their business. Consequently, the importance of development velocity to remain competitive will be even more pronounced. Said another way, if you are slow, then you're obsolete. Moreover, the shift to AI will favor modern platforms that offer a rich and sophisticated set of capabilities, delivered in a performance and scalable way. We are observing an emerging trend where customers are increasingly choosing Atlas as a platform to build and run new AI applications. For example, in Q1, more than 200 of the new Atlas customers were AI or ML companies. Well finance startups like Hugging Face, Tekion, One AI and [Nuro] (ph) are examples of companies using MongoDB to help deliver the next wave of AI-powered applications to their customers. We also believe that many existing applications will be re-platformed to be AI-enabled. This will be a compelling reason for customers to migrate from legacy technologies to MongoDB. To summarize, AI is just the latest example of the technology that promises to accelerate the production of more applications and greater demand for operational data stores, especially the ones best suited for modern data requirements such as MongoDB. We look forward to telling you more at our Investor session on June 22. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the adoption trends of MongoDB across our customer base. MongoDB's developer data platform continues to gain momentum as customers across industries and around the world are running their mission-critical projects on Atlas. Organizations, including Anywhere Real Estate, GE Healthcare and Intuit are leveraging the power of our developer data platform. GE Healthcare has turned to MongoDB's developer data platform to manage the lifecycle of its IoT devices, imaging, ultrasound and other patient-care devices from deployment to retirement. They selected Atlas for its effective management, scalability, built-in security and multi-cloud support. GE Healthcare's use of Atlas helps healthcare providers enhance productivity by reducing the complexity and time required to manage databases, resulting in an 83% decrease in data retrieval time and enabling faster deployment of IoT devices. Many customers are turning to MongoDB to free up their developer's time for innovation, enabling them to move faster and deliver better customer experiences, while driving cost-savings. This includes China Mobile, Tata Digital and Grant Thornton International. China Mobile provides mobile voice and multimedia services via its nationwide mobile telecom network across Mainland China and Hong Kong. It is the world's largest mobile network operator by total number of subscribers. The telecom leader is using MongoDB to support one of its largest and most critical push services, which sends out billing details to more than 1 billion users every month. Prior to MongoDB, the tech team relied on Oracle. But as the user numbers increase, performance degraded. Despite large investments, it was still taking too long to do basic requests like finalize and deliver bills to users. As a result, China Mobile migrate this service to MongoDB after comprehensive testing and evaluation of alternatives. By taking advantage of MongoDB's native [sharding] (ph), they were able to improve performance by 80% and go from 50 Oracle machines to just 12 machines for the same workload. This service now handles all current requirements and is set up to scale with future growth. Digital transformation is redefining how organizations operate, and MongoDB is helping customers on this journey by delivering the developer data platform that powers the migration from on-premises to the cloud. Companies including Shutterfly, Radio and Bendigo and Adelaide Bank are example of customers leveraging MongoDB in their transformations. A leader in the HR and job finding tech space shifted from MongoDB Community to MongoDB Atlas during its journey to migrate its entire infrastructure from on-premises to the cloud. They selected MongoDB Atlas to give its developers full autonomy over their data, while freeing up the time they previously spent managing their database system to focus on innovation and improving the end user experience. During their migration journey to Atlas, the company identified [indiscernible] significant infrastructure reduction and subsequent cost-savings. In addition, the company has experienced 250% faster query performance and 300% faster right throughput on their applications built on Atlas. In summary, I'm pleased with our first quarter results in a difficult macro environment. Our ability to win new workloads remain strong and Atlas consumption trends were better than expected. We also believe that AI will accelerate application development, which would further stimulate demand for MongoDB. We continue to invest to maximize our long-term growth opportunities. With that, here's Michael.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks, Dev. As mentioned, we delivered a strong performance in the first quarter, both financially and operationally. I'll begin with a detailed review of our first quarter results, and then finish with our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2024. First, I'll start with our first quarter results. Total revenue in the quarter was $368.3 million, up 29% year-over-year. As Dev mentioned, we continue to see a healthy new business environment, both in terms of acquiring new customers, as well as acquiring new workloads within existing customers. To us, this is confirmation we remain a top priority for our customers and that our value proposition continues to resonate even in this market. Shifting to our product mix. Let's start with Atlas. Atlas grew 40% in the quarter compared to the previous year and represents 65% of total revenue compared to 60% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and 65% last quarter. As a reminder, we recognize Atlas revenue primarily based on customer consumption of our platform and that consumption is closely related to end-user activity of the application, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors. Let me provide some context on Atlas consumption in the quarter. As Dev mentioned, consumption growth in Q1 was above our expectations. This outperformance was broad-based and driven by stronger growth in underlying application usage. While Q1 consumption trends were better than expected, the growth remains below the levels we had experienced prior to the beginning of the slowdown in Q2 of last year. Turning to Enterprise Advanced. As you know, we will be facing very difficult EA compares throughout fiscal 2024, and Q1 was no exception as evidenced by our slower year-over-year EA revenue growth. However, EA revenues were up sequentially, which is better than what we had anticipated in our Q1 guidance. This is despite the fact that Q1 is typically a seasonally slower new business quarter for EA. Turning to customer growth. During the first quarter, we grew our customer base by approximately 2,300 customers sequentially, bringing our total customer count to over 43,100, which is up from over 35,200 in the year-ago period. Of our total customer count, over 6,700 are direct sales customers, which compares to over 4,800 in the year-ago period. As a reminder, our direct customer count growth is driven by customers who are net-new to our platform as well as self-serve customers with whom we've now established a direct sales relationship. We saw a strong quarter of customer -- of direct customer additions in our enterprise channel. The growth in our total customer count is being driven primarily by Atlas, which had over 41,600 customers at the end of the quarter compared to over 33,700 in the year-ago period. It is important to keep in mind that growth in our Atlas customer count reflects new customers to MongoDB in addition to existing EA customers adding incremental Atlas workloads. We had another quarter with our net expansion -- ARR expansion rate above 120%. We ended the quarter with 1,761 customers with at least $100,000 in ARR and annualized MRR, which is up from 1,379 in the year-ago period. Moving down the income statement. I'll be discussing our results on a non-GAAP basis unless otherwise noted. Gross profit in the first quarter was $279.9 million, representing a gross margin of 76%, which is up from 75% in the year-ago period. We're very pleased with our gross margin progression, especially in the context of Atlas representing 65% of our overall business. Our income from operations was $43.7 million, or 12% operating margin for the first quarter compared to a 6% margin in the year-ago period. The primary reason for our strong operating income results versus guidance is our revenue outperformance. In addition, Q1 benefited from the timing of marketing programs, internal events and other expenses, which we now expect to incur later in the year. Net income for the first quarter was $45.3 million or $0.56 per share based on 81.5 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This compares to net income of $15.2 million or $0.20 per share on 77 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the year-ago period. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the first quarter with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash. Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $53.7 million. After taking into consideration approximately $2 million in capital expenditures and principal repayments of finance lease liabilities, free cash flow was $51.8 million in the quarter. This compares to free cash flow of $8.4 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. I'd now like to turn to our outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2024. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $388 million to $392 million. We expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $36 million to $39 million and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $0.43 to $0.46 based on 82.5 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion to $1.542 billion. For the full fiscal year 2024, we expect non-GAAP income from operations to be in the range of $110 million to $125 million, and non-GAAP net income per share to be in the range of $1.42 to $1.56 based on 83 million estimated diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Note that the non-GAAP net income per share guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2024 includes a non-GAAP tax provision of approximately 20%. I'll now provide some more context around our guidance, starting with Q2. First, I want to remind you that Q2 has three more days than Q1, which is a tailwind for Q2 Atlas revenue. Second, we expect to see a sequential decline in the EA business after a stronger than expected Q1. Third, we recently signed a few large licensing deals, most notably a renewal and extension of our relationship with Alibaba. Those deals have an upfront license revenue component, which will positively impact our revenue in Q2 by roughly $10 million. You will see this impact in other subscription revenues, the portion that is neither Atlas nor EA. Finally, we expect to see a significant sequential uptick in expenses since we have some of our largest sales and marketing events in Q2, most notably MongoDB.local in New York. Turning to our updated full year guidance. First, we are increasing our revenue expectations for the rest of the year because Atlas Q1 exit ARR is now higher than previously expected given the stronger Q1 performance. Second, we continue to expect that Atlas consumption growth will be impacted by the difficult macro environment throughout fiscal 2024. Our revised full year revenue guidance continues to assume consumption growth that is in line with the average consumption growth we've experienced since the slowdown began in Q2 of last year. In other words, our usage growth assumptions for the remainder of the year remain unchanged from what we provided our initial guidance range for fiscal 2024 last quarter. Third, we continue to expect that the year-over-year growth of Enterprise Advanced will be impacted by the difficult compares from the prior-year period. Finally, thanks to strong Q1 performance and the increased revenue outlook, we are meaningfully increasing our assumption for operating margins in fiscal 2024 to 7.7% at the midpoint of our guidance, an improvement of approximately 300 basis points compared to fiscal 2023, while continuing to invest to pursue our long-term opportunity. To summarize, MongoDB delivered strong first quarter results in a difficult environment. Our new business performance and strong total customer net additions demonstrate the continued demand for our developer data platform. While we are pleased that Atlas Q1 consumption growth was above our expectations, we continue to be mindful of the environment, taking a step back from the near-term trends. We are incredibly excited about the opportunity ahead and we'll continue to invest responsibly to maximize our long-term value. With that, we'd like to open up to questions. Operator?\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow of Barclays. Your question please, Raimo.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. My first question before I have to follow-on -- follow-up question. Dev, if you -- everyone talks about AI at the moment and Mongo in theory always kind of view as an operational database. How do you fit into this kind of new AI world? You mentioned some of the names and some of the projects that would look really exciting. But how does Mongo kind of fit into this new world? And I had one follow-up for Michael.\nDev Ittycheria: Yeah. Sure, Raimo. First, we expect MongoDB to be a net beneficiary of AI. And the reason being is that as developer productivity increases, the volume of new applications will increase, which by definition will create new apps, which means more data stores. So driving more demand for MongoDB. Second, developers will be attracted to modern platforms like MongoDB because that's the place where they can build these modern next-generation applications. And third, because of the breadth of our platform and the wide variety of use cases we support that becomes even more of an impetus to use MongoDB. As I mentioned that we've had over 200 customers just in last quarter who are running AI apps on Atlas. Some of those includes some very cutting-edge well-financed startups like Nuro and Hugging Face and Tekion. We have a high degree of existing customers who are engaging with our field organizations on AI use cases. And so the demand for using MongoDB to build and run these AI apps is very high.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And Michael, if I look at the update or the significant upgrade to the profitability outlook, like, obviously, you had your budgeting cycle to come up with the initial guidance. So what has changed besides maybe slightly higher revenue to kind of come up with these kind of much higher numbers? And obviously, we all like that. But like, what drove that? Thank you and congrats from me.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks. Yes. The big driver of the improved bottom line output is the stronger Q1 performance and then the upgraded revenue outlook and it's really just sort of flowing through to the P&L.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, Sanjit.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions and congrats to the MongoDB team on a strong start to the year. I wanted to start off -- just a question on the environment. As we talked -- as we listen to the [Hyperscalers] (ph) report, their results seem some of the cloud infrastructure ecosystem reported results. We're all trying to get a sense of where are we in sort of the cloud optimization budget scrutiny sort of cycle. It sounded like from what you guys are saying that you guys are executing well, but things are still pretty tight from a budget environment perspective. So wanted to get your sort of latest perspective on whether you see cloud spend and optimization headwinds fading anytime soon? And then what you saw in May that potentially gave you maybe some leading indicators on where things may be headed?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So first point I'd make, Sanjit is that, we don't really see optimization as a trend because there's a direct link between app usage and our revenue, right? So the more the apps are used, the more revenue that drives. And consequently, when apps are used less, the less revenue we get. And so, there's a one-to-one correlation between usage and revenue, which as you can imagine, when the customers are building these apps, they want their apps to be used. So that's really what's happening in terms of what's driving our revenue. In terms of what's happening in terms of the macro environment, I definitely agree with you that it's tough out there, but what we see is innovation is still a priority. We see that customers really want to leverage software as a competitive advantage. We had very strong new business numbers. We added 2,300 customers this year. Our six figure customer count grew 28% year-over-year and our Atlas growth was 40% year-over-year. So like these are pretty good signs that customers are still prioritizing innovation and they're doing so leveraging modern platforms like MongoDB. So I would also say that our go-to-market channels have to really focus on and are doing a really good job on qualifying these opportunities, being able to separate customers who are serious versus customers who may be just wanting to kick the tires. And again, as I mentioned earlier, it's all about us acquiring high-quality workloads. If we can hire -- acquire high-quality workloads, onboard them well and make sure they're served as well, good things will happen; and that's happening. And we had a record number of new workloads added this quarter from existing customers.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the perspective, Dev. I just wanted to follow up on Raimo's question on AI. And I guess the context is that, you guys have proven that the document model has been very, very scalable in terms of addressing multiple different types of workloads and different data types. So in the context of large language model applications and customers trying to build applications with large language models and the rules of vectors and vector databases, from your guys' perspective, is this a use case that MongoDB can address? And any sort of product updates or anything on the product road map to address this part of the market?\nDev Ittycheria: Right. So -- and maybe I'll just do a little primer just so everyone is on the same page. The results that come from training and LLM against content are known as vector embeddings. And so content is assigned vectors and the vectors are stored in a database. These databases then facilitate searches when users query large language modeling with the appropriate vector embeddings, and it's essentially how a user searches match to content from an LLM. The key point, though, is that you still need an operational data store to store the actual data. And there are some adjunct solutions out there that have come out that are bespoke solutions but are not tied to actually where the data resides, so it's not the best developer experience. And I believe that over time, people will gravitate to a more seamless and integrated platform that offers a compelling user experience. And I do want to say it's still very early days. I think people tend to overestimate the impact of new trends in the short term but underestimate them in the long term. So it's very early days. And I think you're going to see a lot of things happening over the course of the next few months and quarters and years, but we feel we're in a very good position to take advantage of this new trend.\nSanjit Singh: I appreciate the comments, Dev. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback of Stifel. Your question please, Brad.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Dev, last quarter you talked about a couple of very large financial institutions beginning to migrate, I believe it was hundreds of apps. I know you talked about better usage trends this quarter. Was that -- did those migrations impact this quarter? Or is that more something we should expect in the coming quarters?\nDev Ittycheria: No, they'll -- I mean -- so one, we're obviously we are very happy about customers wanting to migrate a large percentage of their applications to MongoDB, but that takes time, right? It's not going to happen overnight. And so, that's going to happen over the long term and so that's something that's a trend that we're feeling good about. I would say, in terms of the usage trends, it's again tied to our customers' underlying business. And so the applications of building on MongoDB are clearly being used. They're driving value, which consequently drives our revenue; and we feel really good. And again -- so that drives us to go acquire more workloads, high-quality workloads, that we can then onboard quickly. And then that drives future usage, so that's the real focus for us. That's focus on the input metrics that drive the outputs that you see. And that's an example what happened this quarter.\nBrad Reback: That's great. And then Michael, real quick. Since the year got off to such a great start here, does it impact your hiring plans for the rest of this fiscal year? Thanks.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, thanks for the question, Brad, yes. Strong start to the year, no major changes. Obviously all that's factored into the full year guide, and you can see the significant upgrade in the bottom line outlook. We are obviously continuing to invest for the long term, though, and believe that we can walk and chew gum at the same time.\nBrad Reback: That's great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Piper Sandler. Your question please, Brent.\nBrent Bracelin: Thank you. Dev, what drove the record number of new workloads migrating to the platform? You flagged that in the comments there. It seems a little too early for Gen AI to be driving the number of new workloads, so what drove that [indiscernible] as well? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Like I said, I think people tend to overestimate the impact of a trend like AI in the short term. And so I will clearly say it wasn't AI that drove the acquisition of workloads. It was really sharp execution by go-to-market teams. We have really focused our teams to acquire workloads either through the acquisition of new customers or the acquisition of workloads in existing customers. It's all about acquiring workloads, so our incentive mechanisms, management attention and focus is all about this North Star about acquiring new workloads. And I saw -- and I think you've seen the results of that showing up in Q1.\nBrent Bracelin: Great, blocking and tackling and walking while chewing gum. Sounds like it's working for you. My follow-up is really around a vector feature engine as you think about AI. How important is layering in vector feature engines inside of the Mongo database? Is that on the docket? How should we think about vector functionality inside of Mongo going forward relative to attracting more Gen AI workloads? Thanks.\nDev Ittycheria: Again, for generating content that's accurate in a performant way, you do need to use vector embeddings which are stored in a database. And you -- but you also need to store the data and you want to be able to offer a very compelling and seamless developer experience and be able to offer that as part of a broader platform. I think what you've seen, Brent, is that there's been other trends, things like graph and time series, where a lot of people are very excited about these kind of bespoke single-function technologies, but over time, they got subsumed into a broader platform because it didn't make sense for customers to have all these bespoke solutions which added so much complexity to their data architecture. I don't want to preempt what we're going to be talking about on June 22, but I encourage you to attend because that's where we'll share a little bit about our AI strategy.\nBrent Bracelin : Looking forward to it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan of Goldman Sachs. Your question please, Kash.\nKash Rangan: Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter, great start to the year. One for Dev and one for Michael. Dev, you've talked about relation of database displacements for a while now, so how are those deployments coming along? And are you increasingly able to open the door for even bigger deployments in the future? That's one. And one for you, Michael. It now appears that you have a cadence where you -- despite challenging consumption trends on a per-customer basis, you've been able to add new customers at record pace, so results have been actually quite resilient. So how does this make you think about the business model ahead? I mean, are you at a point where the new customer momentum more than offsets declining consumption growth trends that you have better visibility into your business than you did probably, say, a year back, six months back? Thank you so much.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes, what I would say is, I think, in the short term, the consumption trends are clearly tied to our customers' underlying business. The only way we can really influence that is, over the long term by acquiring more and more workloads either through from existing customers or acquiring new customers. And so, we're really focused on what we can control, which is all about acquiring new customers and new workloads. And obviously there'll be puts and takes in every quarter, but our go-to-market organization is very, very focused on this. And we do that not just from our sales organization but also from our self-serve business. And then we also just don't just focus on acquiring but also making sure they're onboarded properly, they're serviced properly so that those workloads grow well and the customer's experience with those workloads is very positive so they continue to add new workloads to our platform. That's ultimately the things that we can control and that's what we're really focused on. And you talked about...\nKash Rangan: [indiscernible]\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Sorry. So we are seeing -- again, part of acquiring a workload is acquiring a relational workload and replatforming it on MongoDB, so when we say acquiring a workload, you should not always assume it's a new workload. It could be an existing workload that people want to replatform. We talked about the China Mobile example where it was a very, very large workload servicing a very, very large user population. And they just weren't getting the performance benefits that they needed for such a large set of -- such a large implementation, so that was their catalyst to basically migrate to MongoDB. And I want to be clear. There's always going to be some catalyst. There's got to be some compelling event for a customer to do so. It could be for cost reasons. It could be for performance reasons like in China Mobile. Or it could be that they're -- they can't add new features fast enough on a brittle legacy platform so they need to migrate to a new modern platform where they continue to service their own business well. So those are the drivers and that's a big focus for us as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead of UBS. Your question please, Karl.\nKarl Keirstead: Thank you. Maybe this will go to Mike. Mike, if we could unpack the 2Q guide a little bit. First, on the $10 million onetime lift from Alibaba, if you could just clarify the entirety of that lens in other subscription. None of it lands in Atlas or EA. And is there any follow-through on that, Alibaba? Or is it truly onetime 2Q? And then I've got a quick follow-up.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So it will show up -- first of all, it's not just Alibaba in the $10 million, but Alibaba is the one that people understand and know and we had a joint press release about. And it's certainly driving a healthy chunk of that. It does show up in that kind of other, other line, so it's not showing up in Atlas or in the EA line items, just for sort of clarity around the geography. The extension of the deal, we initially signed a multiyear deal with them. This extends that contract. The structure has minimum commitment levels, and so what runs through the P&L is the minimum commitment level. So obviously, to the extent that there is outperformance above this further increased level, like, that could impact things. We have seen those historically. That's part of what led to the early renewal and extension given the success of the joint offering. Over the time since we've launched it, we've seen an 8 times increase in their end user consumption. And so that's what sort of gave them and obviously us collectively the confidence to sort of extend that.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Thanks, Mike. And then further on the 2Q guide, the three extra days relative to Q1, does that loosely offer kind of an added three point sequential boost? And then secondly, in terms of the overall demand assumptions you're using to drive that 2Q guide, is it sort of similar broader trends that you've seen in the last couple of months? Or Mike, are you assuming things get better or things get a little worse? Thanks. And that's it for me.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So you're correct. The Q2 days, it does affect because it's consumption and it's recognized as it's utilized. So that is a tailwind to Q2 relative to Q1 by those few extra days. The -- in terms of the broader assumptions, the primary driver of the increase in the fiscal 2024 full year guide is the fact that Atlas outperformed in Q1. Therefore, our starting Atlas ARR for Q2 is higher. We have not changed our outlook for the expected growth over the balance of the year. And so, we're not seeing things get worse. We're not assuming things get better or deteriorate further, and so it's consistent with our view that we had 90 days ago.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes. Super helpful. Thanks Mike.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes on the line of Tyler Radke of Citi. Your question please, Tyler.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks very much for taking the question. So Dev, in your opening remarks, you talked about how AI can kind of provide a new opportunity for modernization of existing applications. And I'm just curious, from your perspective, how you see this playing out. Or do you -- when do you think that this starts to accelerate the pace in which companies modernize their apps? And maybe how you're preparing your go-to-market team to tackle that opportunity.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. Tyler, we're already seeing high customer engagement of customers already talking to us about new AI use cases that they want to build and run on MongoDB, so that's obviously a very positive trend. Again it's early days, so I don't want to suggest that there'll be some step function increase in consumption or revenue, but the trend is obviously real. As I mentioned, we already saw like over 200 customers who are AI companies who are deploying apps on MongoDB. And I would argue that there's an emerging trend that Atlas is one of the preferred places for AI companies to go to build apps, and so we feel really good about our positioning. And I think we feel like it will be definitely a tailwind given that with all of the AI assist tools around cogeneration and improving developer productivity, the capacity of a development team in a typical organization will only increase. There's statistics that say it can increase anywhere from 15% to 30%, 40%. I think it's still early days to determine what percent is real, but it will definitely increase, which by definition will increase the number of applications developed, which will then obviously drive more demand for MongoDB.\nTyler Radke: That's helpful. And I assume the answer is too early, but as you look at those 200 customers or so and maybe some existing ones that were already on the platform, is there any way to think about quantifying the AI-related revenue and -- or maybe where you think about that for the full year?\nDev Ittycheria: I think it's way too early, Tyler. I think it's also really tied to the market and the product market fit of those customers' businesses because obviously, if those customers do well, then we're a beneficiary. If they're not doing well, then obviously they're not going to drive a lot of consumption. So it's really tied to the product market fit of those companies, but the general trend that we are very pleased about is that, there's a lot of people leaning towards MongoDB in terms of thinking about the next set of AI apps that they're building.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nDev Ittycheria: Thanks, Tyler.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader of William Blair. Your question please, Jason.\nJason Ader: Thank you. I just wanted to ask about the linearity of consumption through the quarter and then any comments you have on consumption in the month of May?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So I'd say clearly March and April were better than we expected given the outperformance of our revenue numbers. And so that's great to see. In general what we've seen since the start of the slowdown is certainly some month-to-month variability, but in general, like, some pretty reasonable ranges. And to the extent that when we see ranges that diverge at the start of Q2, the more pronounced holiday slowdown that we saw, we tend to call those out, but we feel that we've seen a pretty consistent level of sort of macro-affected or post-macro growth rates of existing expansion. That was what was included in our guide and that's what's initially for fiscal 2024. And that's also what's in our guide for the balance of the year.\nJason Ader: Okay, just -- yes. I mean what's a little hard to reconcile is I understand the sort of onetime pop in Q2, but for the back half, I mean, it just seems like growth is going to slow down massively year-over-year. I'm just trying to understand. If you're not assuming anything different on the macro, why would that be the case?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So what I would say is, when we look at it, you've got a higher starting Q2 ARR as a result of the strong Q1 performance. And as you flow through the same cohort expansion, for lack of a better phrase, over the balance of the year, that's what leads to the improved revenue outlook that we have. And so, we're actually seeing stronger growth on a year-over-year basis for the back half of the year than we thought at the beginning of the year.\nJason Ader: Got you, all right. And then one quick last one for you, Michael, on the gross margin outlook. I think your long term -- unless it changed, I think it was 70%. And you're running now in the mid-70s. It seems like Atlas has really been above your expectations in terms of the gross margin. Any comments on just sort of like, call it, the next couple of years on gross margin?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So we have not specifically guided to gross margin. You are correct. We have outperformed our expectations on gross margin. Our gross margin progression plan, particularly as it relates to Atlas has been very strong. I would not have forecast such high gross margins with Atlas at almost two-thirds of our revenue. And so we've continued to execute incredibly well there. I would just go back to your comment around sort of our long-term target model was 70-plus. And so I think I feel significantly more confident in delivering against that now that we've got Atlas at a much higher percent of the revenue. Atlas still is dilutive on a margin basis, but clearly we've meaningfully narrowed that gap and outperformed our own plan, both in terms of the rate and pace of achieving the improvements, as well as, as we've kind of pulled additional levers, we've gotten more value out of the levers that we had identified along the way. And that's what's put us in this strong position.\nJason Ader: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes line of Fred Havemeyer of Macquarie Capital. Your question please, Fred.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you. I wanted to also follow up on margins with respect to Atlas. I think, as your company is going through a transition from, of course, like more term licenses, towards Atlas being more of a consumption-based model, it's exciting to see the margin upside flowing through as revenue is coming through, but I wanted, I think, a refresher on how to think about just essentially unit -- sorry, just on how to think about margin progression with Atlas in play. Just generally, once customers have signed and you are through that period of, of course, recognizing commissions, et cetera, and customers are expanding on that Atlas, how should we think about that incremental revenue contribution contributing, of course, to profitability?\nMichael Gordon: Sure. So I'll try and tackle it a couple of different ways, Fred. So I think in general what you see is Atlas revenue is consumption oriented. I think people understand that. We have this very close value linkage, and so it maps quite tightly to the underlying application usage for our customers and their end users. And so I think the key thing when you compare it to the 606 implications particularly of enterprise advanced and the term license revenue is, while it's not ratable -- and I do think sometimes there's the tendency to confuse it was ratable. It is spread over the duration. If we just assume a one year contract, which most of our contracts are, you'll get the same revenue over the time, but with the enterprise license -- enterprise events license, you'll see that upfront revenue being lumpier, right? That's part of the reason why we talk about and go to great pains to explain the EA compares and some of those other things. So that's really the big driver. You get the same revenue, but there's less upfront. I think the other thing that's important to understand in terms of the financials is really the cash flow dynamics and understanding that. As we've talked about for the last several years, we've been deemphasizing upfront commitments, trying to reduce the level of friction, trying to focus on acquiring more workloads and getting more workloads on the platform. And the result of that is spending less time on upfront commitments. Atlas now has -- about 80% of Atlas does not flow through deferred. And so that's just a very different dynamic when you start thinking about less from the income statement but more kind of away from the other parts of the balance sheet and some of the other calculations that you all do.\nFred Havemeyer: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kingsley Crane of Canaccord. Your question please, Kingsley.\nKingsley Crane: Great, yes. So I would like to ask a question about the replacement opportunity and in just a slightly different way. So we're all excited about this AI theme. I know this is more longer term, but do you think that AI workloads creation, app replatforming can act as a catalyst for share shifts as relational DBs are less prepared to support these workloads?\nDev Ittycheria: I think, over the long term, that's definitely the case. I think you're seeing that, I mean, people forget that the relational database has been around for almost 45 years, right? So -- and so it's a technology that's worked well for a long period of time, but it really doesn't suit the needs of modern applications. And as applications get more and more sophisticated, have more performance and scale requirements, people need to consider moving to more scalable platforms and that's our strength. And China Mobile, again, is a great example of that. And that's not even AI apps.\nKingsley Crane: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turits of KeyBanc. Your line is open, Michael.\nMichael Turits: Hi, guys. Good evening. So I want to come back to the usage trends. So I want -- maybe explain it, but I'm not sure. So what really drove the better-than-expected usage in 1Q? I know you said that execution was great, which is awesome. And then [Multiple Speakers] in terms of expectations for the rest of the year?\nMichael Gordon: Sorry. Say the last part of the question again, Michael.\nMichael Turits: So what drove the better-than-expected usage in Q1? But then for the rest of the year, you're expecting a return to your prior assumptions regarding usage growth.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So let me try and clarify it. So first, the strong execution, I think, that Dev was talking about really ties more to the new business environment, which remember is very valuable for the medium to long term, but the near term is much more governed by the performance of existing applications. So that, what drove the outperformance of that was stronger underlying usage of those applications, right? So when you think about the underlying queries, right, the reads and writes of those applications, more activity. That drove more consumption and so that's what drove the outperformance. And when you think about the -- as I mentioned, there's a little bit of variability period to period, but other than sort of the start of the downturn in Q2 of last year and the more pronounced holiday slowdown, it's been in a fairly reasonable range. That was the range that we've seen the performance in for Q1. That's the range that we saw the performance was -- in our Q1, our guide at the beginning of the year for the full year. And so there's no real reason to change that outlook for the balance of the year. We're not assuming things get materially better. We're not assuming things get materially worse, and we don't have any data that would suggest either of those directions.\nMichael Turits: And then just a quick follow-up. I know you talked about Atlas not running through deferred, but it was actually EA that was a little stronger this quarter. So what would maybe explain it? But why did we see that sequential decline in deferred revenue that we haven't typically seen?\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I go back to a couple of thoughts. One, billings in general is not a super helpful metric for us. And I know we've said that for -- really since going public, I guess, but it -- increasingly, I think that, that is true. Certainly, as roughly two-third of the business is Atlas and as I mentioned, about 80% of that does not flow through deferreds, but also what that means is that a larger portion of what will run through deferreds is EA. And you saw EA grew more slowly on a year-over-year basis. And Q1 tends to be a seasonally slower quarter for new EA business.\nMichael Turits: Okay. All right. Mike and Dev. Thanks very much.\nMichael Gordon: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Cikos of Needham. Your question please, Mike.\nMichael Cikos : Hi, guys. Can you hear me all right? I apologize. The operator might have tuned...\nBrian Denyeau: Yes, all good, no problem.\nMichael Cikos : Awesome. If I could just follow up on Michael's last question there. And one of the things I wanted to highlight, on that EA strength in Q1, I believe we were expecting EA to actually decline sequentially. And you guys delivered some slight outperformance there. And I guess, broadly if we look back over the last couple of quarters, EA has really outperformed expectations. Can you help us think through what is driving that EA outperformance; and I guess, with more specific color to Q1, where that outperformance came from?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. You have to -- thanks for your question, Mike. You have to remember that one of our strengths is people can run MongoDB anywhere. And there's still a large percentage of workloads and a lot of customers who still run a lot of important workloads on premise. I think the journey to the cloud is far from over. And the attraction of starting with MongoDB on premise is that they, customers then get optionality to -- at some point in time, if they ever choose to move to the cloud, they don't have to rewrite the application. It's a much more graceful migration than having to replatform on to another technology when they want to move that workload to the cloud. So that is a very attractive part of the MongoDB value proposition. And beyond that, obviously, [indiscernible] is people value MongoDB's ability with a flexible document model. The highly distributed and scalable platform just gives enormous benefits whether it's on-prem or in the cloud. And so, that's something that people also value, so we still see a lot of demand. Obviously Atlas is the biggest growth engine of our business, but there's still a lot of customers who lean into EA.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. I would just add, we were expecting enterprise events to be down. And so the fact that it had a slight sequential gain, It was great to see and speaks to all the points Dev is underscoring. I would just remind people that, to the point, EA did have a very strong year last year. And so we do face very difficult compares throughout the year on enterprise advanced. And I just think it's important to understand that because you can see the slower growth rate on EA shining through in Q1.\nMichael Cikos : No, that's great. And I appreciate you reiterating the difficult comps there, Michael. I think, if I can just follow up with a two parter, maybe more for Dev here, but first, I know that you're really citing the sharp execution from the go-to-market teams with respect to the number of new workloads or customer wins. I wanted to sanity check. Has relational migrator in any way played a role in landing these workloads and customers? That's the first part. And the second part would be can you just give us an update on how the investments are tracking as far as enhancing features around time series and search capabilities on MongoDB.\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So on the first question, again while we do have customers, some customers, migrating relational workloads to MongoDB, I would not say relational migrator was a huge lever in making that happen. We're very excited about the prospects of relational migrator and helping to reduce the cost and time to migrate relational apps to MongoDB, but we're still early in that journey. With regards to time series and some of the other capabilities, we feel really good about the platform. Uptake is high. And we plan to do a pretty broad set of announcements at our MongoDB.local New York on June 22, so stay tuned for some announcements then.\nMichael Cikos : That's great. I'll see you guys in New York in June. Thank you very much.\nDev Ittycheria: We look forward to it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Firoz Valliji of Alliance Bernstein. Your question please, Firoz.\nFiroz Valliji: Hi. Thank you taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Maybe, the first one on the consumption trends. So you have talked about revenue being linked to consumption. And we have seen consumption level come down over the past few quarters. Is it fair to assume that, in next couple of quarters, consumption level may reset at a new normal and then maybe resume growth from that level? Or is it hard to call bottom on the per-user consumption level? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nMichael Gordon: Yes. So what I'd say is we have -- I would just say, when we look at our outlook, there's no reason, based on the data that we have, to assume things get materially better or materially worse. And that's what's included in our guidance for the balance of the year. And that's consistent with what we thought in last quarter's call, when we provided our initial view. And when we look at where we are now and the outlook, I think that's the right view, so I don't think that there's any particular data that would point to things suddenly becoming better or becoming materially worse.\nFiroz Valliji: Got it. And so recently, we heard from another data platform [indiscernible] seeing some of the customers move data out of the platform to maybe economize on costs. Are you seeing anything similar? Or do you see pockets of workloads where that might occur on MongoDB's platform as well?\nDev Ittycheria: Yes. So if I understood your question, you're saying are people moving -- you've seen other companies have talked about customers moving data out of their platforms. We have not seen that trend. As we said, our consumption is tied to the application usage. And you have to remember, if customer builds an application, they want that application to be used, so if the application is not being used, in some ways, that's not a good thing for a customer. That being said, our revenue is driven by usage, so when usage goes up, our revenue goes up. And when usage goes down, our revenue goes down, but it's very linked to the underlying trends of that customer's business, so the link to -- from value to price is highly correlated. So we don't have customers who are “trying to move data off Atlas”. That's not a phenomenon that we see.\nFiroz Valliji: Perfect. Thanks. It’s very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Ma of Guggenheim Partners. Your question please, Howard.\nHoward Ma: Thank you squeezing me in off the hour mark. Can you just quickly comment on whether or not relational migrations are contributing more to growth relative to greenfield plus subsequent expansion? And if you could frame that within the 2,300 net adds in the quarter too, that would be great. Thank so much.\nMichael Gordon: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Howard. No, I would say generally consistent is what we've seen. I wouldn't particularly call out a particular spike up. Obviously there's the China Mobile case study or vignette that Dev walked through, and you can always find those in every quarter. It continues to be a healthy part of the business, but I wouldn't uniquely call that out as sort of particularly driving the results, although it's obviously a big part of our long-term market opportunity.\nHoward Ma: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nMichael Gordon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back to Dev Ittycheria for closing remarks. Sir?\nDev Ittycheria: Thank you. I just want to again just close by saying that we had another strong quarter of new business performance, while Atlas consumption rebounded from last quarter. We remain laser-focused on our North Star, which is acquiring new workloads from both new and existing customers. We do believe AI will increase the velocity of software development and, in turn, the number and sophistication of new applications developed. And we believe that this increase -- this will increase demand for powerful and comprehensive platforms like MongoDB over the long term. So with that, we want to thank you for your time today. And we look forward to seeing you on June 22 at the Javits Center in New York City. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
