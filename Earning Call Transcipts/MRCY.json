        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Mercury Systems Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to the company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Farnsworth. Go ahead, Mr. Farnsworth.\nDave Farnsworth: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today is our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Ballhaus. If you've not received a copy of the earnings press release we issued earlier this afternoon, you can find it on our Web site at mrcy.com. The slide presentation that Bill and I will be referring to is posted on the Investor Relations section of the website under Events and Presentations.  Turning to Slide 2 in the presentation. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements, including information regarding Mercury's financial outlook, future plans, objectives, business prospects and anticipated financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or performance to differ materially. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements on Slide 2, in the earnings press release and the risk factors included in Mercury's SEC filings. I'd also like to mention that in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. During our call, we will also discuss several non-GAAP financial measures, specifically adjusted income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, organic revenue and acquired revenue. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics is included as an appendix to today's slide presentation and in the earnings press release.  I'll now turn the call over to Mercury's Chairman and CEO, Bill Ballhaus. Please turn to Slide 3.\nBill Ballhaus: Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our Q2 FY24 earnings call. Today, I'd like to talk through three topics; first, some introductory comments on our business and results; second, an update on the progress we are making in each of our four priority areas, delivering predictable performance, building a thriving growth engine, expanding margins and driving improved free cash flow; and third, expectations for our performance both for FY24 and longer term. Then I'll turn it over to Dave who will walk through our financial results and guidance in more detail. Please turn to Slide 4. As I said in the past, while FY24 is a transitional year, I'm optimistic about our strategic positioning as a leader in mission critical processing at the edge, the attractiveness of our business model and our outlook over time to deliver predictable organic growth while expanding margins and robust free cash flow. During Q2, we made solid headway in each of our four priority focus areas and in addressing what we believe to be the two transitory dynamics in our business I referenced last quarter; transitioning our high mix of development programs to production and converting our high level of working capital into significant cash flow. We believe this progress is evident in three highlights from the quarter; strong bookings, solid free cash flow and better than expected progress in closing out our challenge programs, most of which are development in nature. First, we delivered near record bookings in the quarter with a 1.65 book-to-bill. Our bookings were anchored by a number of important program wins that we believe will drive future growth. These awards reflect customer recognition of the unique value we deliver, the reliance on us for their most critical franchise programs and ongoing healthy demand. Second, we delivered strong positive free cash flow and a reduction in net working capital. We generated over $37 million in free cash flow in the quarter along with an approximately $70 million improvement in net working capital. These accomplishments were primarily driven by strong in-quarter collections, reductions in our unbilled receivables and inventory and improved customer advance payment terms. And third, we are making progress with retiring risk in and completing challenged programs. While the underlying performance of the business continues to be obscured by unanticipated cost growth on a subset of programs, we believe we have largely narrowed these risks from the original 20 challenge programs to one product line with game changing technology that comprises approximately 25% of the original challenge programs. Although we are still working through this remaining set of challenge programs, we anticipate retiring these risks on slightly more than half of the remaining challenge programs in FY24 and entering FY25 with a much clearer path to deliver predictable organic growth, expanding margins and strong cash flow. In addition to these Q2 highlights, we made significant progress this quarter in establishing the team and structure to lead Mercury through the next phase of our journey. We announced a reorganization to simplify and streamline our business by eliminating redundant corporate functions and consolidating a number of functional areas into a single operating unit under the leadership of Roger Wells as our Chief Operating Officer. In his previous role, leading our microelectronics division, Roger delivered strong results and demonstrated an exceptional aptitude for scaling business operations and expanding and converting pipeline opportunities. We also announced the addition of Stuart Kupinsky to the leadership team as our Chief Legal Officer. Stuart brings a wealth of experience in legal leadership roles and a track record of driving dynamic change and value creation in a number of technology companies. I'm very pleased that Roger and Stuart have taken on these critical leadership roles. Please turn to Slide 5. Following those introductory comments, I'd like to spend time on each of our four focus areas. Our first focus area is enhancing execution to deliver predictable performance. In Q2, we incurred a number of costs that obscured the underlying performance of the business. Specifically, we recognized approximately $48 million of such items that we believe are transitory, including nearly $31 million of program cost growth impact across our portfolio, approximately $12 million of manufacturing adjustments associated with specifically identified inventory reserves and higher scrap due to unfavorable yields, and nearly $5 million associated with contract settlements where we worked with customers to transition away from programs where we did not expect to see acceptable returns. These items, which again, we believe are transitory, represented the vast majority of the year-over-year decline across our P&L metrics. As a reminder, program cost growth identified within a given period has an overweight impact on the financial results of that period. In accordance with GAAP, there is a cumulative adjustment to reduce progress and align margins on the life-to-date of the program, which results in a decrease to revenue and gross margin that permeates down to net income and adjusted EBITDA in the current period. Breaking down the nearly $31 million of program cost growth, $14 million of this impact was derived from our challenge programs with nearly all of the impact tied to one single program. Approximately $8 million was spread across several development programs and the remaining $9 million related to multiple production programs. The challenge program impact was driven primarily by unexpected redesign and prototype efforts following initial development unit deliveries. Similarly, the remaining program cost growth was a function in part of revised baseline costs predicated on initial unit deliveries across several development and production programs. In addition, the program cost growth reflects a risk adjusted outlook on program performance and estimates to complete across our program portfolio. As shown on Slide 6, with respect to the challenge programs, during the second quarter, we made better than anticipated progress by completing, exiting or retiring risk on an additional four of the original 19 programs. Together with the four completed through Q1, we believe we have now retired risk on eight of the original 19 challenge programs that have driven earnings volatility in recent quarters. For the remaining programs, we expect to close out more than half over the remainder of the fiscal year. The balance of open challenge programs as well as the one program where we experienced significant program cost growth in the quarter are tied to a common processing architecture. So while we experienced a significant P&L impact during the quarter, we believe we had made progress in isolating the primary go-forward development risk in the challenge programs to this one technology area. Of note, our differentiation based on this technology has afforded us sole source positions on critical programs, and the functionality we provide is mandated on these programs. As such, we and we believe our customers, are committed to success in this area. The challenges we are facing are related to efficiently and cost effectively maturing the manufacturing process to support the transition to scale production on these programs where we see significant growth potential at attractive margins. Even for the one challenge program with cost growth this quarter, the current margin outlook remains above our consolidated program gross margin profile. In addition, this common processing architecture is being developed within an isolated part of our business, representing approximately 20% of our revenue, which has experienced the majority of the revenue and earnings volatility that we saw in Q2 and that we expect to see within the fiscal year. We believe resolving the challenges in this technology will go a long way to restoring growth and profitability in this part of the business and Mercury as a whole. So despite the challenges we're working through and the corresponding investment, we believe we are well positioned as a sole source provider with large growth opportunities and solid margins as we seek to execute on the remaining development efforts and transition these programs to production. Please turn to Slide 7. Turning now to the second focus area of driving organic growth. Bookings for the quarter were a near record $325 million, resulting in a 1.65 book to bill. We had several exciting awards for both development and production programs in the quarter. Two marquee wins in the quarter are worth noting. We received our first production award for LTM. This is an exciting and important award coming earlier than originally anticipated. While we don't expect significant revenue from this program in FY24, we expect this program to drive organic growth in FY25 and ultimately become our largest revenue contributor in the future. We also won a large development program on a strategic weapon system, which we anticipate will drive growth in the near term and stronger growth in the future as it transitions to production. This program, while well within our technical capabilities, was awarded as a cost plus contract with favorable billing terms of at least monthly, thereby, reducing the potential earnings and cash volatility through development. While we still expect the majority of our contracts to be firm fixed price, we are exploring opportunities to take certain development contracts on a cost type basis where appropriate. In addition, as I have discussed before, we are working to incorporate more robust terms in all of our contracts to more clearly define scope, support improved execution and customer satisfaction and shorten cash conversion cycles. Finally, last week, we received a large follow-on award to provide our solid state data recorders for a large defense space program. This technology, which was introduced only a few years ago, is now the largest driver of growth in the military space market for Mercury and we expect further growth opportunities for this unique commercially developed offering. These awards are important not only because of their value and impact on our long term growth but also because they reflect our customers' continued trust in Mercury to support their most critical franchise programs. I mentioned last quarter that this effort to build an organic growth engine will occur over a longer period of time given the time content involved with improving book to bill levels, and that our near term growth will be fueled by the transition of development programs to production where we are well positioned in the back half of this year and early FY25. Demand remains strong and we anticipate the strong bookings momentum to continue through the year. Please turn to Slide 8, now turning to our third priority focus area, addressing our cost structure to expand margins. As we mentioned last quarter, to achieve our EBITDA margin targets, we are focused on the following levers; executing on our development programs and minimizing cost growth impacts; getting back to a historical 20-80 mix of development to production programs; driving organic growth to generate positive operating leverage and achieving cost efficiencies. In Q1, we took a series of actions designed to better align our cost structure with our scale and our financial expectations. These actions are on track to generate $24 million in annual run rate savings primarily related to SG&A efficiencies. In January, we announced a corporate reorganization in which we streamlined and simplified our operations, consolidating our two division structure to a single integrated structure, incorporating all of our lines of business and matrix business functions, reporting in to Roger Wells, who was appointed Chief Operating Officer. This integrated approach is designed to clarify accountability and eliminate redundancy. In total, we expect this action to deliver an incremental $20 million in annual run rate savings, bringing our total action run rate savings to $44 million, of which approximately $24 million to $26 million will be recognized inside the fiscal year. Though we continue to see negative operating leverage in FY24 given little revenue volume, these structural reductions will be evident in our margin profile as we expect to return to growth in FY25 and beyond. Please turn to Slide 9. Finally, regarding our fourth priority focus, to drive improved free cash flow. I am pleased to report that in Q2, we delivered over $37 million in positive free cash flow. We made progress on converting our unbilled receivables, which were down nearly $38 million in the quarter, and we continue to have strong collection trends across our billed receivables. In addition, we continue to pursue advanced payments on certain contracts, which is reflected in the $23 million increase in deferred revenue in the quarter. In total, net working capital decreased $70 million or over 10% in the quarter. We continue to expect unbilled receivables to burn down through the fiscal year as we apply resources to completing hardware deliveries and especially as we continue to resolve challenge program. We also continue to expect inventory to decline as we receive follow-on production awards. At the end of the quarter, we had cash and cash equivalents of $169 million. Net debt of $448 million is down $39 million in the quarter, reflective of our free cash flow generation. We expect to be cash flow positive for the second half of the year, which we believe will allow us significant flexibility to allocate capital. Please turn to Slide 10. As I have discussed, we continued to make progress on our four priority focus areas. Even so, for the first six months, our revenue and earnings are below expectations primarily due to higher than expected cost growth and other charges as we retire risk across the portfolio especially related to our challenge programs. Aside from these headwinds, which we believe are temporary, I continue to believe this is a business capable of ultimately delivering above average industry growth with low to mid 20% adjusted EBITDA margins. In the second half of the year, we plan to continue to work on the transitions I discussed earlier; shifting our large portfolio of development programs to production, especially the majority of our remaining challenge programs; and focusing our operational capacity on burning down our large net working capital balances, particularly in unbilled receivables and inventory. Turning to guidance. We're going to do this a bit differently for the remainder of the year as we work toward completing these transitions. Based on our first half revenue and our outlook for the second half, we are updating our guidance for full year FY24 revenue from the prior range of $950 million to $1 billion to a revised range of $800 million to $850 million. The reduction in revenue guidance is based in part on our first half revenue performance, particularly in the second quarter, which included significant revenue reductions due to program cost growth. The reduction in revenue guidance is also based on reduced volumes expected in the second half as we continue to apply our operational capacity to advance late stage development programs and shift against legacy unbilled balances. As a reminder, we expect the completing late stage development programs will reduce unbilled receivables, release cash and unlock production revenue, which should drive growth and margins. This work is critically important to unlocking value but we'll continue to deliver little revenue in FY24. Let me spend a little more time on the volume reduction because it is significant. As we discussed in Q1, we continue to implement a more cash efficient operating approach with operational capacity focused on completing late stage development programs and releasing unbilled receivables. This approach should generate cash and clear the way to higher growth, higher margin production revenue. However, there's little revenue associated with completing this work in the near term. In addition, as we look to the second half, we are implementing a more mature process designed to ensure we have a robust low risk approach to transition from development to scale production, particularly as it relates to the common processing architecture I mentioned previously. This work is important as part of our priority to restore predictability and profitability into the business. We will remain the flexibility in terms of timing and, in some cases, cost in H2 to get this right.  Turning to our outlook for earnings, including GAAP net loss and adjusted EBITDA. The reduction in our expected revenue range due to the volatility we have seen and expect to continue to see in a small subset of programs related to a single technology offering, coupled with our focus on completing hardware deliveries in order to reduce unbilled balances naturally results in a reduction to our GAAP earnings and adjusted EBITDA expectations as well. That said, it is difficult to provide reliable guidance estimates beyond revenue for the remainder of the year. Consistent with Q2, we may take additional actions to settle contractual arrangements that do not yield acceptable returns or align to our long term strategy. We may also make continued adjustments to our cost structure, where appropriate, designed to position us for positive operating leverage in FY25 and beyond. Our objective for the remainder of the year is to maintain the flexibility to take this as necessary to complete this work as quickly as possible in order to position the company for what we believe will be a return to predictable organic growth, improved profitability and strong cash flow in FY25. So we are withdrawing our full year FY24 GAAP and non-GAAP net earnings guidance, including adjusted EBITDA, provided on November 7, 2023. As I have said in prior calls, demand remains strong, our outlook for bookings is unchanged and we continue to expect strong bookings for the second half with full year bookings expected to exceed $1 billion. In addition, while we expect limited free cash flow in Q3, given the strong Q2 results, we believe we will be cash flow positive for the second half and full fiscal year. As Dave will discuss, total net leverage, based on our credit agreement definition, is well within our covenant thresholds and we expect cash generation to strengthen our balance sheet as we progress through the year. As we proceed through the second half of FY24, our goals are as follows; complete or retire risk on more than half of the remaining challenge programs; retire the risk associated with the common processing technology I mentioned earlier and validate a highly producible, scalable design that can be released into production; and validate capacity requirements and our ability to ramp production against our expected large and growing backlog in Q4 and into FY25. Success in these areas, along with consistent performance against internal expectations, will give me and Dave the comfort to reestablish guidance across all financial metrics. To summarize, we are pleased with the progress we made in bookings and free cash flow in the quarter and expect strong results in these areas for the year. We will continue to assess our organization and cost structure through the second half to position ourselves for positive operating leverage in FY25 and beyond. We continue to make progress on our challenge programs and are working diligently towards the goal of a quarter free of material program execution volatility in our financial results. We look forward to showing progress in this area when we speak next quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave to walk through the financial results for the second quarter, and I look forward to your questions. Dave?\nDave Farnsworth: Thank you, Bill. I'll start with our second quarter fiscal '24 results and then discuss our full year fiscal '24 outlook. As expected, our financial performance in the second quarter was below that of the prior year across all P&L metrics. As discussed in our last earnings call, fiscal '24 is a transition year where the organization is seeking to execute on both our challenge and development programs and then progress to the follow-on production awards. Through that transition, we expect to recognize the small proportion of remaining revenues on the challenge program contracts, but more importantly, we expect to move towards releasing significant working capital balances, especially related to unbilled receivables. We then anticipate shifting our resources to execute on the follow-on production awards, which we believe will begin to rebalance our program portfolio more heavily towards higher margin predictable production programs as well as consume existing inventories. We continue to expect this transition to occur throughout fiscal '24 and into fiscal '25. In Q2, we made meaningful progress towards this rebalance with some positive early indicators emerging. First, our bookings for the quarter was $325 million with a book-to-bill of 1.65. Second, we completed exited or retired risk on four more challenge programs in the quarter for a total of eight programs through the first half of fiscal '24, better than the five we had expected. We continue to be on track to transition a majority of the approximately 20 challenge programs by the end of the fiscal year. Finally, we generated over $45 million of operating cash flow, $37 million of free cash flow and improved working capital by approximately $70 million in the quarter. Cash flow generation in the quarter was primarily a result of strong collections, including a higher volume of customer advances as we successfully negotiated more favorable billing terms on newer awards. With that, please turn to Slide 11, which details the Q2 results. Our bookings for the quarter were $325 million with a book-to-bill of $1.65, yielding backlog of $1.3 billion, up over $160 million or 14% year-over-year and $128 million or 11% sequentially. As Bill discussed, we received two large awards in the quarter. LTAMDS was received earlier than expected in fiscal '24 and signifies an important franchise production program for which we are a key supplier of processing capabilities. We also won a large cost plus development program on a strategic weapon system with favorable billing terms. Revenues for the quarter were $197 million, down $32 million or 14% compared to the prior year of $230 million. As expected, revenues decreased year-over-year as we continue to prioritize resources to execute our challenge programs, transition from our higher mix of development programs and aim to better align our operating cadence with prudent working capital management. As Bill noted, we experienced nearly $31 million of cost growth impact in the quarter as compared to approximately $7 million in the prior year. The $31 million was comprised of $14 million related to our challenge programs and $17 million related to multiple development and production programs. In accordance with GAAP, this resulted in cumulative revenue adjustments to properly reflect progress on the programs due to the revised cost baselines driving an overweight impact in the second quarter. The $14 million cost growth impact related to our challenge programs was almost entirely driven by a single program and was a result of facts and circumstances in the quarter, specifically on the cost growth related to unexpected redesign and prototype efforts of a common processing architecture following initial development unit deliveries. While we executed largely in line with expectations across the remaining challenge programs, we did experience cost growth on certain other development and production programs in the quarter, which impacted revenues in a similar manner but to a lesser extent. Of the remaining $17 million of cost growth impact, nearly $8 million related to development programs and $9 million related to production programs. The cost growth within our development programs was primarily attributable to $6 million of cost growth across a suite of three development programs with similar performance obligations. A majority of this cost growth was due to a revised cost baseline predicated on initial development unit deliveries and extrapolated across the remaining backlog. Similarly, we had several production programs in the first half of the fiscal year for which actual costs incurred were trending higher than the prior cost estimates. This resulted in a revised cost baseline for the remaining backlog on these programs. In addition, we experienced minor technical issues resulting in incremental rework costs across several production programs in the quarter. The scope of the issues was narrow, risk mitigation plans are in place and the issues are expected to resolve and allow for delivery on these programs beginning in the third quarter. Finally, as we build and mature integrated processes and management systems, we seek to continuously assess our judgments and estimates, including potential future risks and opportunities based on the latest and best information available. We are applying our judgment consistently as we work through the full portfolio of programs. In addition, and consistent with prior earnings calls, we are shifting our operating cadence with the goal of more properly balancing our material purchases with contract awards and resource availability, driving better working capital results. These factors are contributing to a temporary volume shift in our total revenue, especially our overtime revenue, which decreased by approximately $25 million year-over-year. We expect this trend to continue through the remainder of fiscal '24. Gross margin for the second quarter decreased to 16% from 35.3% in the prior year. Gross margin contracted year-over-year primarily as a result of cost growth impacts as well as higher manufacturing adjustments, especially as related to inventory reserves and scrap. As just discussed, we recorded approximately $31 million of cost growth impact in the second quarter. This represents approximately $23 million of incremental cost growth impact year-over-year contributing to more than 50% of the margin reduction, as shown on Slide 15 in the appendix. The remaining decrease in gross margin year-over-year was primarily due to higher manufacturing adjustments of approximately $12 million related to inventory reserves and scrap. With regard to inventory reserves, we recorded over $8 million more reserves in the quarter as compared to the prior four quarter run rate average. This was a result of specifically identified excess and obsolete inventory in the quarter, primarily due to a shift in customer demand toward our next generation product offering. In addition, we are actively marketing and selling certain of our slow moving inventory, sometimes at a discount to the current carrying value. With regard to scrap, we experienced higher levels of discrepant material, especially related to the common processing architecture involved in several of our challenge programs. Due to the nature of the technology, the discrepant material is high value and cannot be reused or reworked. We have several initiatives underway designed to address more efficient and cost effective producibility of these subsystems. We expect gross margins to recover gradually in the second half of the fiscal year. That said, we believe the full year fiscal '24 gross margins will be below those of fiscal '23 given the higher than expected cost growth impacts through the first half of fiscal '24. As Bill discussed, we believe we have successfully narrowed the scope of risk across our challenge programs to a single technology related to our common processing architecture within one of our business units. We expect gross margins to continue to be impacted by unknown risks that may materialize as we progress these challenge programs through final stages of completion. In addition, we may continue to see cost growth impact as we transition from our higher than normal development program mix as well as continue to mature our operational management systems and reporting. Operating expenses decreased approximately $3.1 million year-over-year due to $2.1 million of restructuring charges as well as $1.3 million more of amortization expense in the prior year. That said, the second quarter of fiscal '24 included nearly $5 million of contract settlements, resulting from negotiations to reduce performance obligations on customer contracts that do not align with our strategy or otherwise do not have acceptable returns in exchange for lower cash consideration. We believe these costs are not comparable to the prior year, and thus, our run rate operating expenses would have decreased nearly $8 million year-over-year, reflecting the cost savings actions executed in our first quarter fiscal '24. As Bill mentioned, earlier this month, we announced an organizational consolidation of our divisions into one unified structure, incorporating multiple business units and supporting functions. The resulting workforce reduction is eliminating approximately 100 positions, resulting in expected restructuring charges of $10 million to $12 million in the third quarter. This cost savings action is expected to yield annual run rate savings of approximately $20 million. In total, our cost savings actions in fiscal '24 are expected to yield over $40 million in annual run rate savings. GAAP net loss and loss per share in the second quarter was $45.6 million and $0.79 respectively as compared to $10.9 million and $0.19 respectively in the prior year. The increase in GAAP net loss is primarily result of approximately $48 million of costs incurred in the quarter comprised of $31 million of program cost growth impacts, $12 million of inventory reserves and scrap expense as well as nearly $5 million of contract settlements. GAAP net loss was also impacted by the temporary volume shift in revenues as we align our operating cadence with prudent working capital management. These factors were partially offset by approximately $16 million of incremental tax benefit year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was negative $21.3 million compared to $35.7 million in the prior year. Adjusted loss per share was $0.42 as compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.26 in the prior year. Consistent with GAAP net loss and loss per share, the decrease was primarily a result of approximately $48 million of costs incurred in the quarter comprised of $31 million of program cost growth impacts, $12 million of inventory reserves and scrap expense as well as nearly $5 million of contract settlements. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted loss per share was also impacted by the temporary volume shift in revenues as we align our operating cadence with prudent working capital management. Slide 12 presents Mercury's balance sheet for the last five quarters. We ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $169 million. We increased our borrowings by $40 million in the quarter, resulting in $616.5 million of funded debt under our revolver. As Bill discussed, total net leverage based on our credit agreement definitions is well within our covenant thresholds. Our debt agreement allows for adjustments beyond those included in our adjusted EBITDA definition, including adjustments related to some of the headwinds that we believe are temporarily driving earnings volatility and obscuring the underlying performance of the business. We are forecasting significant headroom in the covenants for the remainder of fiscal '24 and expect to end the year with lower gross debt as we deploy the positive free cash flow generated through the remainder of the year to pay down debt. Billed receivables decreased approximately $9 million as a result of continued strong collections in the quarter. Unbilled receivables decreased approximately $38 million, primarily due to successful execution and billings across the program portfolio, as well as cumulative adjustments associated with the cost growth impact in the quarter and our contract settlements as previously discussed. Inventory decreased approximately $8 million in the quarter, primarily as a result of the incremental reserve and scrap activities. Accounts payable decreased nearly $8 million, evidencing the shift in our operating cadence aimed at better aligning the timing of material purchases with both contract awards and resource availability. Deferred revenues increased approximately $23 million in the quarter, reflecting the higher volume of customer advances as we successfully negotiate more favorable billing terms on newer awards. Working capital improved approximately $70 million in the second quarter as we transition through the completion of our challenge programs and start to shift the development and production mix in the program portfolio. We successfully converted unbilled to billed receivables and ultimately cash in the quarter through our focused execution efforts. We also negotiated advanced payments on a number of new contracts and reduced inventory growth through effective management of our material purchases. We expect this working capital trend to continue, resulting in further progress by the end of the fiscal year, primarily driven by decreases in unbilled receivables and inventory. As we continue to execute, especially as related to our challenge programs, we expect to convert unbilled to billed receivables and then cash. In addition, we expect the mix of development programs to shift to better align with historical norms. And as we receive expected follow-on production awards, we believe we will consume inventory purchased in anticipation of these awards. As we have discussed on prior calls, we consider 35% of trailing 12 months revenues to be a more appropriate level of working capital for the business. Turning to cash flow on Slide 13. Free cash flow for the second quarter was $37.5 million as compared to $22.2 million in the prior year. As previously discussed, this was primarily a result of strong collections in the quarter, including a higher volume of customer advances as we successfully negotiate more favorable billing terms on newer awards. I'll now turn to our financial guidance for the full year fiscal '24. Our results through the first half of fiscal '24 have been below expectations. In addition, we expect earnings volatility may continue for the remainder of the year, including as we make intentional decisions around the strategic alignment of our program portfolio, technology investments and working capital balances. As a result, our full year results are expected to fall short of the previously issued guidance. At the start of the fiscal year, we shifted our guidance approach to guide annually rather than quarterly due to the expected volatility in financial performance as we pivoted focus to operational execution, especially related to our challenge programs. We have taken several actions designed to improve predictability within a subset of our business, and key early indicators of progress emerged in the second quarter. We have successfully completed eight of our approximately 20 challenge programs and believe we are on track to complete the majority of the challenge programs by the end of the fiscal year. That said, we have experienced development challenges on a single technology within one of our business units that spans several of our remaining challenge programs. These challenges will require heightened effort and potentially increased cost through the remainder of the fiscal year. We have quantified this risk, among others, across our program portfolio based on information available as of the second quarter as well as considered how best to allocate our resource capacity to further reduce working capital levels, resulting in a revised revenue range of $800 million to $850 million for fiscal '24. Providing meaningful estimates of GAAP and non-GAAP measures beyond revenue is challenging, including in light of the continued actions we may need to take to complete our business transition in fiscal '24. Thus, we are withdrawing our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance outside of revenues as provided on our first quarter earnings call on November 7, 2023. While we are not formally guiding beyond revenues for the remainder of the fiscal year, we can provide further perspective over certain key financial metrics. First, we expect the demand environment to continue to support strong bookings especially in the fourth quarter, yielding expected fiscal '24 bookings in excess of $1 billion. We continue to expect these bookings to be weighted more heavily towards production based programs, supporting the start of a shift in the mix of development and production programs in our portfolio. Second, we believe we have narrowed the risk and scope of effort within our challenge programs to a single technology in one of our business units with the remaining challenge programs executing largely in line with expectations. We have completed eight of our approximately 20 challenge programs and continue to expect to complete a majority of all challenge programs by the end of the year. The cost growth impacts incurred through the first half, coupled with the potential for continued volatility, especially related to this single technology, will negatively impact revenues and gross margin for the remainder of the year. As such, we now expect both revenue and gross margin to trend lower than the prior year. We believe operating leverage will improve as we progress through the year due to expected revenue and margin increases compounded by savings from the cost actions completed in both the first and third quarters of fiscal '24. We expect GAAP net loss and loss per share as well as adjusted EBITDA and adjusted loss per share for fiscal '24 will be meaningfully below the prior year. We expect positive cash flow for the fiscal year before any benefit from the potential passage of the R&D tax legislation currently before the Senate, which we anticipate would add more than $40 million of additional cash flow in fiscal '24. While cash flow in the third quarter is projected to be near breakeven, we expect a significant improvement in the fourth quarter as we plan to complete a majority of our challenge programs, ship and build final product and convert unbilled receivables to billed receivables and then to cash. We continue to expect positive free cash flow for the year. A government shutdown or prolonged continuing resolution may pose risk to our cash flow expectations. As discussed, we expect further improvement in net working capital by the end of the fiscal year as we anticipate seeing reductions in unbilled receivables, but also inventory with more meaningful reductions expected over the longer term. In closing, we continue to be focused on four priorities; enhancing execution to deliver predictable performance, driving organic growth, addressing our cost structure to expand margins and driving improved free cash flow conversion and release. We believe executing on these priorities will not only enable a return to historical revenue growth and profitability but will also drive further margin expansion and cash conversion, demonstrating the long term value creation potential of the business. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Bill.\nBill Ballhaus: Thanks, Dave. With that, operator, please proceed with the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line from Peter Arment from Baird.\nPeter Arment: Bill, I'm just trying to understand on the cost growth breakdown. The $14 million that was derived from one of your challenge programs, I guess, it's just tied to one program, the $14 million of cost growth. Will that one specifically be eliminated as you're thinking about having the majority of these done this fiscal year or do we expect that, that's one of the troubled ones that will linger a little bit?\nBill Ballhaus: The short answer is that program will be active for a while. But maybe if I gave some color on what was behind the cost growth, it might be helpful to understand what's happening with that program. And it's actually, in some ways, sort of unique. This is a challenge program that includes development, low rate production and a production run. Most of our development programs just contain the development activities or low rate production. This one is unique in that it includes a long production run. And what we discovered in the quarter as we worked our way through development and then we worked our way through the first few units in production that we got a good view on the unit economics or the unit costs that then informed an updated estimate on the production. And so the big cost growth in the quarter that we recognized was tied to the impacts of what we learned and how that pertained to the production. So while that program will be around for a while, we think we have a much clearer view of what we need to do to execute on that program and what the production will look like. So hopefully, that color commentary is helpful.\nPeter Arment: And just a follow-up, if I could. Just given all the cost growth and a lot of Mercury over the last several years was built up through kind of M&A, are any of the business impaired, or how do we think about that just thinking about risks from a financial standpoint?\nBill Ballhaus: I'll let Dave speak to that in a second. There's one more piece of color commentary that I wanted to make about the program that I referenced. And that is that even after we made the adjustments to our ETC for the production run, the margin profile on that program is still above, what I call, the composite average of our gross margin across our full portfolio. So it's just another, I think, helpful piece of information to round out that picture. But on the impairment question, I'll go ahead and turn it over to Dave.\nDave Farnsworth: When we do an assessment around impairment, we do that at a gross level so we don't look at the individual components. And we don't maintain goodwill at that level, we maintain it at the overall level. So we always do an analysis on the overall company and where we stand from a goodwill impairment standpoint.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.\nSeth Seifman: I wanted to ask first, I noticed in the filing that the percentage of sales to some of the key customers is down kind of lower than it's been, below the 10% disclosable threshold. And I guess how do we kind of think about what that means and how do we think about that with regard to the kind of underlying trend of prime contractor outsourcing that kind of underlies the Mercury business case?\nBill Ballhaus: I think those percentages are going to bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter. So I wouldn't pay too -- or at least I personally don't pay too much attention to that. To the extent that they do go down, I think it does show the robustness of our backlog and the diversification of our backlog. And the thing that I'm really focused on, around customer health and desirability of our products in the marketplace and the strength of demand is to look at our backlog. And right now, we're staring at a record backlog. We had a near record bookings for the quarter, which I think is the strongest indicator of our customer health and the health of our business looking forward. Dave, anything you want to add?\nDave Farnsworth: I would just mention that it is the threshold at 10% and it does vary. If you look at it historically it varies. I think some of them dip just below and some of them pop up just above in a given quarter. So I don't think there's a significant shift in any of these.\nBill Ballhaus: And again, I go back to the backlog and I think that reflects the trust that our customers have in us with respect to their franchise programs. And we mentioned a couple of the specific bookings that we received in the quarter that I think speak to that fact.\nSeth Seifman: And then maybe just I think one of the key things that people think about as they -- or maybe one of the key ingredients in the model as you think about where -- without the guidance and with the results being so variable now, some number in the outyears to anchor around, and it's probably the gross margin. And so if you wanted to think about a kind of conservative case where things don't necessarily all turn out your way and some of these things -- still struggling with some of these things for a while. What's kind of a fair way to think about, not necessarily next quarter but as people try to anchor around what the company might be able to do here in the future, a fair way to think about that gross margin number?\nBill Ballhaus: I'll start and then Dave can chime in. I mean specifically, we don't guide to gross margins. What we have said and which we continue to believe to be true is that when you look across our portfolio, our range of gross margins is 30% typically for development programs and 40% for our production programs. And what really drives our gross margins is the mix associated with development and production. And so as we think about margin targets going forward, we more think about EBITDA targets going forward. And I would just refer you to the bridge that we put in prior investor presentations where we think the key to getting to those margins is around minimizing the volatility in our development programs and the EAC impacts. And despite the numbers in the quarter, we feel like we're making very good progress to boxing the risk associated with the development programs and the EAC volatility. Second, it's transitioning the development programs to production and we are making very good progress on that front. One of the big bookings in the quarter is evidence of that. But as we're progressing our way through development, we're getting closer line of sight to converting them to production, its continued efficiency in our cost structure. And again, this quarter, and with the negative operating leverage, it won't show through this year but we expect it to go through next year, the efficiencies that we've driven into our cost structure. And then ultimately, in the near term, driven by the organic growth associated with converting our production programs to development, positive operating leverage. And that's really the path from where we sit today to our targeted margins that are in the low to mid-20s, and that's still our view on the target margins for the business. So I'll pause there. Dave, anything that you would like to add to that?\nDave Farnsworth: I think that's right. And as Bill said, margins in the low 20s, he's referring to EBITDA margins, just to be sure. And we've reiterated and looked at and we still feel confident in the long term model that we’ve laid out in the past and that has the gross margins that we believe this business should be able to generate and continue to believe that.\nBill Ballhaus: And just to go back -- to bring your question and the first question that we had on the call together, the one program that caused really the majority of the volatility in the quarter was the challenge program that included the development, the low rate production and the long production run. It had an impact in the quarter, because we have revised estimates of our percent complete. And so we had some reversals in the quarter that basically had the cumulative catch-up in the quarter. But again, when we look at the gross margins of that program going forward, still above the average gross margins of our profile across that spectrum of 30% to 40% that I reiterated for development in our production programs. So hopefully, that's helpful. Hopefully, it gives you better insight in how we're thinking about the target margins of the business and really focused on target margins when it comes to EBITDA margins.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair.\nJonathan Ho: Thank you for the additional color on the challenge programs that you just provided. One thing I wanted to better understand a little bit is that you have scrutinized these trouble programs and implemented processes in the past. Can you help us understand why it took so long to sort of identify these additional issues? And maybe help us understand why this time you have more confidence that you've got a handle on it?\nBill Ballhaus: One thing that I'll iterate is where we're seeing EAC growth in the challenge programs, in general, it's not repeat issues. So if you look across the list of programs, the 19, with the exception of the one, we had very little volatility in the quarter. Where we did see the issue on the one program represented the fact that we're progressing the program. So we worked our way through development, that's a positive. We worked our way through the low rate production. And as we did, we learned more about the unit economics and specifically the unit cost that informed our view of the production. So I understand the question around why it took so long, but it really has taken us progressing through the different phases of this program in particular. And again, this one has a different profile, because it includes development, low rate production and a longer production run. On most of the development programs in general and our challenge programs, we have the opportunity to complete the development. So there may be some risk associated with completing the development. But at the end of the development, we get to the design baseline, we have an opportunity to execute on a small number of units so that we can get a good baseline for the unit economics, and in particular, the unit cost, and then we're able to factor that into bids for production contracts that are follow-on. So in this particular case where we have development, low rate production and a longer run production associated with it, within this one program, we have the risk associated with those three phases, which is relatively unique. So it may seem like it took us a while to get to the EAC and really understanding it. But we had to do the work and progress through development and low rate production in order to inform and update our view on the production run. So that's really the background on that.\nJonathan Ho: Just one quick one as a follow-up. How flexible have your partners been to sort of work with you on these revised either contract terms or prepayments? Does this have an impact on your future relationships as well?\nBill Ballhaus: On payments themselves, Jonathan, could you please clarify?\nJonathan Ho: So you referenced sort of going back to renegotiate some of the contracts and then having some acceleration in terms of the payment. So I just wanted to understand if that impacts the relationships, whether your partners or end customers have been willing to work with you? Just trying to understand sort of the dynamics around those discussions.\nBill Ballhaus: Yes, thank you for clarifying the question. And this ties back to what we've talked about now for a couple of quarters about, in general, our more cash efficient approach to our operations. And that has a couple of comments. One is how we order material and better stage it with the timing of deliveries. And the second piece of it is the contract terms that we put in place so that we can better align progress with progress payments historically. And one of the reasons why we have a large unbilled balance is our payment terms speak to us being able to bill invoice and collect cash only once we're complete and deliver the units. And so one of the things that we've done operationally is work to align our payment terms with progress payments. And so that, I think, is the renegotiation that you're referring to. And what I would say is, in general, it's not a big deal because our customers, in many ways, our incentives are aligned. So when we build them, they're able to collect cost, invoice their customers and collect cash. So our incentives are aligned. And as a result it's typically not a difficult conversation for us to have with our customers. Anything, Dave, that you would add to that?\nDave Farnsworth: I would add to that. When you think about the relationship and you're asking about our customers and working with our customers, I mean, a reflection of our customers’ thoughts and you know working with us, I mean, it’s reflected in the strong bookings we had that you see. These are customers who largely we have these customers have had them for a long period of time, and they're working with us. Bill has met with several of the customers even on the areas with the challenge programs. So he's working with those customers. And they want us to get to the answers the final activity so that we can get into production. They need these products where we have a unique capability to deliver these products and you see it reflected in our growing backlog and in our bookings that we've seen. As Bill said, we see some transitory kind of impacts but our customers understand that and then they’re working with us.\nBill Ballhaus: And then the other thing I'll add, Jonathan, and this may have been part of what you're asking as well, we did mention that we had some contract fulfillment in the quarter that resulted in a transitory impact, I think, of $5 million. In general, those discussions and what was behind the settlements had nothing to do with us trying to negotiate different payment terms, better align payments with progress payments, et cetera. They were completely different matters, specific to those contractual relationships, and not reflective of us trying to negotiate different terms with our customers. So in the event that, that was part of the question, I want to provide that color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.\nKyle Wenclawiak: This is Kyle Wenclawiak on for Sheila. I appreciate the legwork you guys are doing around cost savings and the cash focus nowadays. But I just want to hone in on the profitability guide for this year, because it seems like the two uncertainties are kind of what you just mentioned around contract exits. So first question there is maybe how much of the backlog or revenue bridge is maybe up for negotiation? And then second part being the cost savings, it seems like a lot of that is pretty exhaustive, so maybe some color around why you didn't hone in on a more profit shakeout this year?\nBill Ballhaus: I'll take a stab at the two questions, and then Dave, maybe can fill in. First, on just the cost savings piece of it. As we’ve said in prior calls, I don't think of that as a onetime activity. I think of it as an ongoing activity to drive efficiency in our organization and our structure. And I think we've been pretty consistent in demonstrating that that's our focus with what we announced in Q1, the further enhancements that we rolled out in January, and we'll continue to look at opportunities to improve our cost structure. And I think that's a very natural thing to do in a business like ours that's been built up through acquisitions over a period of time for us to continue to look for opportunities to better integrate the business. As far as the contract, I guess, on the first question around…\nDave Farnsworth: This is Dave, Kyle, if it's all right. If I understood the question, it was around, of the $1.3 billion of backlog we have, how much of that backlog do we think would be -- I don't know what the right word would be, potentially renegotiated. Is that what you were driving for?\nKyle Wenclawiak: Yes, maybe how much of the backlog is maybe the lower margin work that you'd look to either exit or I mean, I guess, renegotiate?\nBill Ballhaus: I think about it very differently. That isn't a dynamic that we're currently thinking about or working on. I mean we feel very good about the backlog that we have in place. And again, like I said, it's a record backlog coming off of a great bookings quarter. The risk that we see in the business really is isolated to what we consider to be about 20% of the business, that's where we've seen volatility in the business. And the remaining 80% of our business has performed very predictably and we expect it to continue to perform predictably. And we're really focused in not so much on contract renegotiations or anything like that, but it's the execution in the 20% of our business. In particular, that includes this one common processing architecture technology that cuts across a few programs that we need to finalize the work that we have currently underway so that we can get to a design that is not just producible, which is where we are today, but producible at scale, so that we can perform very predictably and profitably and that’s our focus. So it’s less about the $1.2 billion backlog that we have and it's more about this one part of our business that represents 20%, and this common technology is a subset of that 20%.\nDave Farnsworth: And that's not to say that we feel like 20% of the business is at risk. What we're saying is that there's contained within that segment of the business that piece of business is where we see the highest concentration of risk that we're working through. But as Bill said, Kyle, I don't see a significant exposure for renegotiation settlement in our backlog.\nBill Ballhaus: And then I think the other thing that I would add relative to that area where we're focused on the technical work, we feel very good about our long term positioning there, because we're differentiated, we're sole source, we're baselined on programs where the capability is mandatory. And our customers are incentivized, we believe, with us to get to the other side on these technical issues, so that we can get to the person runs and get the product into their hands. So hopefully that paints a little bit clearer picture of the technical issues that we're describing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from Truist Securities.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Just to stay on that topic, I mean, looking at the guidance cut, I mean, can't we just say the high end of the prior $1 billion to the low end now at $800 million, isn't that 20% of the business? So I mean, it seems like 20% of the overall business has been kind of compromised here.\nDave Farnsworth: Yes, and I think I would say that when we look at the reduction in the range, it is largely in that business unit where we see the biggest reduction in the revenue. Because as we looked at the first half and the adjustments that we've taken that have impacted revenue, they've largely been in that business, as Bill said. And as we look at the volume going forward, as we both talked about, we're going to get these programs lying flat on the development before we really start producing in volume into the production. And that transition to make it seamless and to make it smooth without variability in the future needs to be completed before we move ahead. And that's why you're seeing we're not having as much early material receipts as we've had in the past. We're managing that carefully, so we don't end up in a situation where things are -- where we brought in things that design changes are still happening, too. And so yes, a significant part of that reduction in the range is driven by that part of the business.\nBill Ballhaus: And I would just offer too that it's really a timing around that volume and pushing to the right of that volume. And that's as a result of us being very methodical and working our way through the technical issues to get to a robust baseline that we can produce very predictably and profitably and at scale. And the reason why we're doing that is because we're very excited about the prospects for this part of our business. It's highly differentiated. We have sole source positions. We see a significant growth opportunity in front of us in this area with attractive gross margins, similar to when I walked through with the one challenge program where we had the major source of our impact this quarter still operating at very healthy gross margins going forward. And so we're very excited about our piece of this business. This volume reduction largely associated with that part of the business is a push out to the right.\nDave Farnsworth: And Michael, I would say it is a thoughtful, intentional view on our part of making that decision to not add to the risk profile by bringing that in -- by executing that early.\nMichael Ciarmoli: Just the last one, the $150 million guidance cut at the midpoint, you called out the revenue headwind from cost growth in the quarter in volume in the quarter. What's sort of the breakdown for the year if you can bridge kind of the $23 million in cost growth you saw this quarter? Is it fairly balanced, or how should we think about that?\nDave Farnsworth: I think the way I would look at it is, as we talked about, we're not trying to guide the back half from a profitability standpoint. It is if you take the first half and you take the reduction that we saw the shortfall in revenue, it's starting with that as the starting point that that's in the number for the year and then taking a look at exactly what Bill said, the intentional shifting of execution on contracts until we've got some of these things laying flat on that piece of our portfolio, not certainly on our entire portfolio.\nOperator: Mr. Ballhaus, it appears there are no further questions. Therefore, I would like to turn the call back over to you for any closing remarks.\nBill Ballhaus: Okay. Well, thank you very much. And I very much appreciate everybody listening into our call this afternoon and the questions, and we look forward to providing you an additional update next quarter. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Mercury Systems First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to the company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Dave Farnsworth. Please go ahead, Mr. Farnsworth.\nDave Farnsworth: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today is our President and Chief Executive Officer, Bill Ballhaus. If you've not received a copy of the earnings press release we issued earlier this afternoon, you can find it on our website at mrcy.com. The slide presentation that Bill and I will be referring to is posted on the Investor Relations section of the website under Events and Presentations. Turning to Slide 2 in the presentation. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements, including information regarding Mercury's financial outlook, future plans, objectives, business prospects and anticipated financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to future risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results or performance to differ materially. All forward-looking statements should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements on Slide 2 in the earnings press release and the risk factors included in Mercury's SEC filings. I'd also like to mention that in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. During our call, we will also discuss several non-GAAP financial measures, specifically adjusted income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, organic revenue and acquired revenue. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics is included as an appendix to today's slide presentation and in the earnings press release. I'll now turn the call over to Mercury's President and CEO, Bill Ballhaus. Please turn to Slide 3.\nBill Ballhaus: Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our Q1 FY 2024 earnings call. Today I'd like to talk through three topics: first, some introductory comments on our business and results. Second, an update on the progress we are making in each of our four priority areas that we outlined in our last call: delivering predictable performance, building and thriving growth engine, expanding margins and driving improved free cash flow. And third, expectations for our performance both for FY 2024 and longer-term. Then I'll turn it over to Dave, who will walk through our financial results and guidance in more detail. Please turn to Slide 4. Since our last quarter's call and during my first full quarter in the business, I've had the opportunity to meet with a number of customers, visit our Mercury teams and facilities domestically and abroad and deepen my understanding of the underlying opportunities and challenges in the business. As I said last quarter, I am optimistic and confident in our strategic positioning as a leader in mission-critical processing at the edge, the attractiveness of our business model and our outlook over time to deliver predictable organic growth with expanding margins and robust free cash flow. In the near term however, we are addressing two transitory dynamics in our business that are impacting our financial results. First, a high mix of low-margin development programs that we expect to eventually transition into a portfolio of predictably performing production programs; and second, an increase in working capital over the last few years, namely in unbilled receivables and inventory that will convert over time into significant free cash flow. I'd like to provide a little color on these two transients, before turning to our priorities including how we are addressing these dynamics. Please turn to Slide 5. With respect to the volume of development activities, as we discussed last quarter, we entered the year with an increased mix of development revenue versus production revenue at approximately 40-60 versus our historical norm of 20-80. We view this increased mix as a positive indicator of future organic growth, as we complete the development efforts and transition to production programs. In the near term, however, and including in Q1, we are seeing this higher mix impact our P&L in a number of ways. First, mix-driven margin pressure as our development programs typically generate 1,000 basis points lower gross margin on average than our production programs. Second, cost growth impact on a subset of programs, a majority of which are development in nature has led to additional volatility in our revenue and gross margin. Third, continued buildup of working capital as we progress these programs, which are typically overtime contracts toward completion and billing milestones. And fourth, lumpiness and delays in follow-on development task orders and production contracts tied to completion of development activities. Again, despite the near-term impacts on our results, we view this increased mix of development work as a positive leading indicator of organic growth associated with the transition of the development efforts to production contracts. I'll come back to our progress in executing on the development programs in a moment. Please turn to Slide 6. Turning now to the second transient I mentioned, which is the large ramp in unbilled receivables and inventory over the last two years, largely related to our subsystem development programs. The increase in unbilled receivables has occurred across a number of large long-standing contracts, many of which relate to our challenge programs where revenue is recognized as we make progress on the contracts or specifically as material is consumed and hardware is assembled, while invoicing on these contracts has generally been tied to shipments of completed hardware. As a result, over the last two years, we have recognized revenue and adjusted EBITDA on these contracts and generated unbilled receivables that will only convert to cash once we complete the hardware deliveries. Our large unbilled receivable balances reflect a growing amount of hardware in process largely tied to our subsystem development programs that we need to deliver in order to invoice and collect cash. Additionally, it's important to note that on many of the programs with large unbilled balances the majority of revenue has been recognized and only a small portion of the contract revenue remains to be recognized with the final delivery of the hardware. On a late-stage program for example, the unbilled receivable balance can represent upwards of 80% or more of the total contract value. As material received and labor incurred, would have been recognized as revenue in prior periods. Looking ahead, as we complete the hardware associated with that unbilled balance while we'll be able to invoice and collect cash for 100% of the hardware value, we will be recognizing a small fraction of the total remaining contract revenue. A second significant driver of the growth in unbilled in inventory over the last two years has been our historical approach to ordering material ahead of hardware delivery as opposed to just in time due in part to prior disruptions in the supply chain. Receiving material ahead of the just-in-time need has adversely increased working capital in a number of ways. On overtime revenue contracts, material was kitted and labor allocated to respective programs resulting in revenue recognition and in most cases increased unbilled receivables given our legacy billing terms were weighted heavily towards hardware shipments. For our point-in-time revenue contracts, material was received into inventory awaiting any remaining components within the bill of material to begin transformation to end product. Related to a number of development programs, material was purchased and received into inventory in advance of production awards to support customer schedules but for, which development is a precursor. Going forward our approach to address even the buildup in working capital is very simple; deliver hardware so that we can invoice and collect cash and time material closely to resource availability and ultimately hardware delivery need dates. While our approach to unlocking a significant amount of cash over time is clear, in the near-term working through the current volume of hardware in process creates pressure on our P&L in a couple of ways. First, completing hardware associated with the unbilled receivables consumes significant operational capacity, but generates little revenue. Second, our cash-efficient operational approach aligning timing of material consumption to hardware delivery and cash milestone payments yields less near-term revenue creating a timing dynamic. That said, we believe this shift is important to improving our working capital posture over the long run. With this overview of two significant near-term transient in our business, I'll now transition to an update on our four priority areas that I introduced in our last quarterly call that also address these dynamics. Please turn to slide 7. Starting first with our focus on delivering more predictable performance through improved execution on our development programs. During Q1, we continued to build and mature integrated processes and management systems to deliver more predictable performance on complex development programs with an immediate focus on the approximately 20 challenge programs that contributed to a majority of the $56 million in cost growth in FY 2023. We made good progress executing on these programs in Q1. During the quarter, we completed two more of the approximately 20 challenge programs that we referenced in our last call in addition to the two programs completed as of Q4. We remain on track to complete five or more of the challenged programs by H1 as expected, and we expect to complete the majority of the challenged programs by the end of FY 2024. We also saw a significantly reduced impact from cost growth on these programs in the quarter with little variation except for one of the 20 reference programs. Cost growth impact on the challenge programs was approximately $6 million in the quarter, of which $5 million was driven by one program. On this program, the cost growth impact was a result of facts and circumstances that arose in the quarter and specifically related to engineering changes in the development efforts, impacting the bill of materials for low rate initial production hardware units. The remainder of the challenged programs executed reasonably well against revised baseline estimates, with an aggregate impact of approximately $1 million in the quarter. As anticipated and in the normal course of business, we experienced some cost growth impact on programs outside of the 20 challenge programs, referenced in the prior quarter. Specifically, we recorded an impact of approximately $12 million across the remaining program portfolio. This cost growth impact was primarily non-technical in nature and related mostly to investment decisions and annual standard cost increases. Of that $12 million, nearly half was expected in our first quarter understood early and actively managed. The remaining $6 million reflected a high volume of low dollar impacts, across a large set of programs, demonstrating our more rigorous program management review process which began in Q1. While this level of cost growth impact was not expected in the first quarter, it was a planned risk within our annual guidance. It is worth noting that our production programs, which accounted for approximately 60% of our annual revenue over the past year, continue to perform predictably and profitably at gross margins consistent with our historical averages of approximately 40%.  However, our heightened mix of development programs, which accounted for approximately 40% of our annual revenue over the past year, combined with the temporary cost growth we are experiencing on a relatively small number of programs, continues to obscure the underlying performance of the business and contributed to the majority of our year-over-year gross margin decline. I believe the actions we are taking to improve program execution, will yield tangible progress toward more predictable performance as we move through FY 2024. Turning now to our focus on driving organic growth in tuning the growth engine that is bidding and winning new contracts, at an appropriate level given our scale. In our last call, I mentioned that this effort will occur over a longer period of time given the time constants associated with improving book-to-bill levels, and that our near-term growth will likely be fueled by the transition of development programs to production programs where we are extremely well positioned, primarily in the back half and beyond this fiscal year. Our bookings for the quarter were $191.5 million, resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.06. While we continue to see steady demand for our standard product businesses, which are comprised of components and modules, we saw a delay in bookings for our subsystem offerings outside of Q1.  As discussed last quarter, we see a number of subsystem production bookings that have been delayed due to the dependency on completing challenged development programs. As we complete these development programs in FY 2024, we anticipate growth in follow-on production bookings. That said, we did receive some important bookings in Q1 and have good line of sight on major bookings later in the year that will drive organic growth in FY 2025 and beyond. For example, in Q1, we received a large award from a government customer to develop composable secure system and package technologies. The total contract value is worth more than $80 million, only a fraction of which was included in our Q1 bookings. Given our position in the defense industrial base and our positioning as a leader in mission-critical processing at the edge, we continue to see a large organic growth opportunity in front of us. Our customers recognize the unique value we bring and continue to rely on us for their most critical franchise programs. Our focus on execution, particularly in our subsystem business will pave the way for a return to strong organic growth in FY 2025 and beyond Please turn to slide 8. Turning now to our priority focus on margin expansion. Last quarter, we laid out a bridge for delivering industry-leading margins in the mid-20% range as shown on the slide. While we have confidence in this outlook clearly we are not there today given the transient we're experiencing in the business. This quarter, our high mix of development programs and the cost growth impact I mentioned earlier were the primary drivers of variance to our long-term gross margin goals. Additionally, given the year-over-year revenue decline, which I'll speak to in a moment, we experienced negative operating leverage in the quarter driving the additional variance to our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin expectations. To achieve our adjusted EBITDA margin targets as we discussed last quarter, we are focused on the following levers: executing on development programs and minimizing cost growth impacts, adjusting back toward a historical mix of development production programs, driving organic growth to generate positive operating leverage and achieving efficiencies through our cost structure. Since I have already discussed the first three levers, let me touch on our approach to driving efficiencies through our cost structure. As we discussed in the last call, as I stepped into the business the team worked quickly to make targeted reductions to our operating expenses in an effort to better align our cost structure with our scale and financial expectations. These actions are expected to generate approximately $24 million in annual run rate cost savings, including approximately $20 million to $22 million of net benefit to fiscal 2024. In addition in Q1, we developed initiatives to achieve additional efficiencies in SG&A targeted prioritizations and R&D investments and longer-term manufacturing footprint to drive margin expansion through gross margin and operating leverage. These ongoing efforts will continue to yield efficiencies in our business through the back half of the year and beyond. Please turn to Slide 9. Turning to our fourth priority focus. Improving cash flow by reducing the working capital that has accumulated in the business over the last few years. As I've mentioned, improved free cash flow conversion and cash release involves delivering hardware and transitioning to a cash-efficient approach whereby we are timing material more closely to resource availability and ultimately hardware deliveries. With time, we are confident that this approach will deliver significant free cash flow. However, as we work through this transition, we will see some temporary impacts to our P&L as we are applying operational capacity to delivering hardware with little revenue and moving towards a more cash efficient operational posture, which will result in lower overtime revenue in the near term. Reflective of these impacts revenue in Q1 was $181 million, down $47 million or 20% compared to the first quarter of FY 2023. The year-over-year decline in revenue was almost entirely driven by our volume of overtime revenue in Q1 versus last year. In Q1 of FY 2023 specifically, we received a significant amount of material to which we applied labor and progressed the program, but could not complete and deliver hardware. This yielded a nearly all-time high of $143 million in overtime revenue in the quarter. This compares to $105 million of overtime revenue in Q1 of FY '24, our lowest quarterly overtime revenue since 2021. This year-over-year decline of almost $40 million demonstrates the dynamic associated with our operational shift to better align with a just-in-time model with regard to both, material and labor resources, as well as timing on our production follow-on activity. We expect to see a downward trend in unbilled receivables related to our large long-standing contracts and especially our challenge programs as we progress through the year and apply resources to deliver hardware and burn down legacy unbilled balances. While we expect an overall decrease in unbilled receivables as we exit FY '24 this will be partially offset by growth in overtime revenues in the second half of the year. Inventory increased $26 million in the quarter, primarily tied to material orders over the last few quarters in anticipation of follow-on production awards. As we progress through FY '24, we expect to see this balance decrease as we complete development programs, receive follow-on production awards and transition the business to a more disciplined cash-efficient approach, especially with regard to material receipt and labor transformation timing. Please turn to slide 10. With that overview of our priority focus, let me wrap with a summary of our expectations looking forward. We are reiterating our full year FY '24 guidance based on our current view of bookings, timing of product delivery and our allocation of factory capacity. As we continue to work through the transient I referenced earlier, we anticipate improved profitability in the second half and positive free cash flow for the year. While there remains risk of a government shutdown or a prolonged continuing resolution and there may be some variability in the timing of improvement as we address transitory impacts on the business. We are confident we will see the benefit of our efforts reflected in financial results as we move towards the back half of FY '24. Furthermore these actions will unlock organic growth and continued margin expansion as we exit the fiscal year. In summary, we remain confident in our strategic positioning our business model and our ability to deliver organic growth with expanding margins and attractive free cash flow over the mid- to long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave to walk through the financial results for the first quarter and I look forward to your questions. Dave?\nDave Farnsworth: Thanks Bill. I'll start with our first quarter fiscal '24 results and then discuss our full year fiscal '24 guidance. As Bill mentioned in our first full quarter at Mercury, we have spent considerable time visiting our facilities meeting many of our employees and deepening our understanding of the capabilities and challenges in the business. I continue to be impressed by the breadth of innovation throughout our program offerings as well as the unwavering commitment of our employees to deliver mission-critical processing to the edge. It has also become increasingly evident that our near-term focus on developing a mature integrated management operating system is the anchoring point from which we can achieve predictable performance and deliver differentiated end-to-end processing solutions that our customers demand. Turning to our first quarter fiscal 2024 results. As expected our financial performance was below that of the prior year across all P&L metrics. As discussed in our last earnings call, fiscal 2024 is a transition year, where the organization is dedicated to executing on our challenged programs, most of which are development in nature and then progressing to the follow-on production awards. Through that transition, we will recognize the small proportion of remaining revenues on the challenge program contracts. But more importantly, we will move toward releasing the significant working capital balances that have accumulated, particularly within unbilled receivables. We will then shift our resources to execute on the follow-on production awards, which will begin to rebalance our program portfolio more heavily towards higher-margins predictable production programs, as well as consume existing inventories. We expect this transition to occur throughout fiscal 2024 and into fiscal 2025. In Q1, we made progress towards this rebalance through the complication of two additional challenge programs and are on track to complete at least five challenged programs in the first half of fiscal 2024. Our portfolio of production programs continues to execute predictably and in line with expectations. With that as background, please turn to Slide 11, which details the Q1 results. Our bookings for the quarter were $192 million with a book-to-bill of 1.06, yielding backlog of $1.15 billion. We have several meaningful awards expected in the second quarter and continue to expect the book-to-bill above 1.0 for the first half and full fiscal 2024. Revenues for the first quarter were $181 million, down $47 million or 20% compared to the prior year of $228 million. As expected, revenues decreased year-over-year due to our pivot towards enhanced execution. Specifically, with regard to our challenged programs, we have recognized a majority of the revenue and related costs as we acquired material and applied labor over the period of performance to progress these programs. As we continue to resolve technical challenges and complete these programs, the remaining revenues are recognized. However, these revenues represent only a very small proportion of the total contract value. In addition, as we transition to a just-in-time operating model to more properly balanced working capital, we are experiencing a temporary shift in the allocation of material and related labor to our overtime revenue programs. This is evidenced by a decrease of approximately $40 million in overtime revenues year-over-year. Gross margin for the quarter decreased to 27.9% from 34.3% in the prior year. Gross margin contracted 640 basis points, primarily as a result of program mix and related cost growth impacts year-over-year. Program mix in the quarter continues to be heavily weighted towards the execution of our challenged programs, most of which are development in nature and carry lower gross margins. Certain of our challenged programs trend lower on average on gross margins as a result of costs associated with technical issues. The growth in estimated cost to complete recorded in fiscal 2023 resulted in a onetime cumulative impact but also significantly reduced overall margins recognized on these programs through completion. In addition, we recorded approximately $18 million of cost growth impact in the first quarter. This represents approximately $5 million or 410 basis points of incremental cost growth impact in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, as compared to the prior year. As Bill mentioned, the cost growth impact recognized on challenged programs was $6 million and related to facts and circumstances in the quarter which were primarily non-technical in nature. Approximately $5 million was recognized on one program with the remaining $1 million recognized across all other challenged programs. The remaining $12 million of cost growth impact was more normal course in nature and contemplated as planned risks in our guidance for the year. The remaining decrease in gross margin year-over-year was due to higher manufacturing variances, primarily related to nonrecurring cost adjustments as well as inventory reserves. Operating expenses increased year-over-year primarily as a result of $9.5 million of restructuring charges in the quarter. Consistent with our fourth quarter earnings call we completed a restructuring action in the first quarter reducing our workforce as well as discretionary and third-party spend. These cost-saving actions are expected to yield net cost savings of $20 million to $22 million in fiscal 2024 and annualized net savings of approximately $24 million going forward. The increase of $9.5 million in operating expense was partially offset by the realization of these savings in the latter half of the first quarter, including the reversal of stock-based compensation or full fixtures related to the workforce reduction. GAAP net loss and loss per share in the first quarter was $36.7 million and $0.64 respectively as compared to $14.3 million and $0.26 respectively in the prior year. GAAP net loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 included a tax benefit of $13 million calculated using the discrete method. A more appropriate methodology given our year-to-date and expected fiscal 2024 results. In the prior year our income tax benefit was $1 million. Year-over-year GAAP net loss and loss per share reflects negative operating leverage due to lower revenues of approximately $47 million and a 640 basis point reduction in gross margin partially offset by the increased tax benefit. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $2 million, compared to $31.2 million in the prior year. Adjusted loss per share was $0.24 and as compared to adjusted earnings per share of $0.24 in the prior year. Consistent with GAAP net loss and loss per share the decrease was a result of lower revenues and gross margin. Free cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of approximately $47.1 million as compared to an outflow of $73.4 million in the prior year. Slide 12 and presents Mercury's balance sheet for the last five quarters. We ended the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $89 million. We increased our borrowings by $65 million to fund operations in the quarter resulting in $576.5 million of funded debt under our $1.1 billion revolver. Billed receivables decreased approximately $33 million, as a result of continued strong collections coupled with lower invoicing volume in the quarter. Unbilled receivables increased approximately $6 million. In the quarter there were six programs contributing about $20 million of incremental unbilled receivables with the balance of the portfolio declining approximately $14 million. Inventory increased approximately $26 million, primarily as a result of the receipt of long lead material procured over 12 months ago. This inventory is required to execute against our existing backlog as well as expected demand. We continue to maintain abnormally high levels of working capital driven by unbilled receivables and inventory. As we progress through completion of our challenged programs, we will convert unbilled to build receivables and ultimately cash. With the receipt of follow-on production awards, a few of which are expected in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we will transition inventory acquired in anticipation of these awards to unbilled then billed receivables and ultimately cash. While unbilled receivables will continue to cycle as new awards progress, we expect to see an overall reduction as the legacy balances especially related to our challenge programs are billed and collected yielding stronger cash flows in the second half of the year. In addition as we continue to transition to a more just-in-time operating model, our inventory balance will decrease over time. Finally, we continue to negotiate more favorable terms and even advanced payments for long lead material on new contracts in an effort to further reduce our working capital to more appropriate levels. As we've discussed on prior calls, we consider 35% of trailing 12-month revenues to be a more appropriate level of working capital for the business. Turning to cash flow on slide 13. Our free cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of $47.1 million, primarily as a result of our GAAP net loss of $36.7 million. In the quarter, we re-priced our interest rate swap to approximately 4.7% resulting in proceeds of $7.4 million. I'll now turn to our financial guidance for the full year fiscal 2024 on slide 14. As discussed on our fourth quarter earnings call, we have shifted our guidance approach in fiscal 2024 to guide annually rather than quarterly. While we have taken actions to improve predictability, fiscal 2024 will be a transition year with our primary focus on operational execution especially with regard to our challenged programs. We are progressing on the completion of our challenged programs as expected and continue to believe we will complete five or more programs within the first half of fiscal 2024 and with the majority of programs completed by the end of the fiscal year. Our portfolio of production programs continues to execute predictably and in line with expectations. In addition, we expect the demand environment to continue to support strong bookings especially in the second quarter yielding a positive book-to-bill in fiscal 2024. As a result we are maintaining our full year guidance across revenues and adjusted EBITDA. Our fiscal 2024 guidance for total company revenues remains at $950 million to $1 billion. This represents flat growth at the midpoint. Given our current backlog combined with strong expected second quarter bookings, we have line of sight into the demand required to deliver revenue consistent with our full year guidance. Our backlog continues to support a high level of revenue visibility, providing more than 70% forward coverage for the remainder of the fiscal year. We continue to expect a book-to-bill above 1.0 for the first half and full fiscal 2024. Revenues in the second quarter are expected to be lower than that of the prior year as we continue to focus on the execution of our challenged programs. As discussed final hardware deliveries represent a small proportion of the total contract value on these programs. However, these deliveries will drive a reduction to our working capital balances and most, especially, unbilled receivables in the second quarter. Gross margins through the first half of the fiscal year will be below those of fiscal 2023 as we continue to transition through the challenged programs and balance the potential for unknown risks that may materialize through final stages of completion. Gross margins will increase throughout the year as we receive and execute on the expected production follow-on awards and begin to shift from a lower-margin development program mix. GAAP results for fiscal 2024 are expected to be in the range of a net loss of $15.9 million to net income of $3.8 million with GAAP loss per share of $0.28 to earnings per share of $0.07. The improvement on the high end of the guidance range is primarily a result of lower stock-based compensation expense and income taxes. We continue to expect fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA in the range of $160 million to $185 million up 30% at the midpoint from fiscal 2023 and reflecting adjusted EBITDA margins of 16.8% to 18.5%. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.19 to $1.54 per share. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins for the fiscal year continue to reflect the marked improvement in gross margins although not a full recovery to historical levels. Reflecting the potential for unknown risks materializing as we transition through final stages of execution on our challenge programs, especially, in the first half of the year. We realized certain of those risks in the first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins in the first half will be significantly below the comparative period in fiscal 2023 with a meaningful ramp in the second half supported by strong bookings leading to higher margin revenues as well as the continued execution and completion of a majority of our challenged programs. In addition, the cost actions we have taken combined with our continued initiatives to expand margins will turn the negative operating leverage we experienced in Q1 into positive operating leverage in the second half of the year. We expect positive cash flow for the fiscal year inclusive of a full year of cash outflows related to R&D tax legislation. While cash flow in the second quarter is projected to be negative, we expect significant improvement in cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year as we complete a majority of our challenged, programs ship and build final product, and convert unbilled receivables to billed receivables and then to cash. Government shutdown or prolonged continuing resolution may pose risk to our cash flow expectations. As discussed, we expect improvement in net working capital by the end of the year as we begin to see reductions in unbilled receivables and inventory with more meaningful reductions over the longer term. Our continued progress on executing against our challenge programs coupled with our strong slate of existing programs within our backlog, as well as new or expanded program content bookings throughout the year positions us well for organic growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital over time. In closing, we continue to be focused on four priorities; enhancing execution to deliver predictable performance, building a thriving organic growth engine, addressing our cost structure to improve margin expansion, and driving free cash flow release and improved conversion. Executing on these priorities will not only enable a return to historical revenue growth and profitability, but will also drive further margin expansion and cash conversion, demonstrating the long-term value creation potential of the business. With that I'll now turn the call back over to Bill.\nBill Ballhaus: Thanks Dave. With that operator let's proceed with the Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we would like to open up today's call for the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is live.\nKen Herbert: Yes, hi, good afternoon gentlemen.\nBill Ballhaus: Hi Ken. Good afternoon.\nKen Herbert: Maybe Bill or Dave I just want to make sure I've got this correctly. So, it sounds like you've you're targeting sort of five of the programs of the 20 programs to be complete by the first half, which if I understand properly, you did two in the fourth quarter and two this quarter, so that implies one in the second quarter? And then you've said a majority is so implying sort of at least five to six in the second half of the year. Is that the right way to think about the pacing of these? And is there any opportunity to maybe accelerate the completion of those programs in the second half of the year?\nBill Ballhaus: Yes Ken, this is Bill. First of all, I think that is the right way to think about it or at least that's how we're thinking about it in terms of pacing. And while that is the majority of the programs, I think it puts us on a good track to unlock a significant amount of bookings and that's what we're really focused on. We want to get the development programs done. We want to execute predictably on them so that we can mitigate any EAC impact or gross margin impact tied to our mix. And what we're really interested in is as we complete these development programs pull that margin mix pressure and uncertainty out of our results unlock the bookings that lead to the attractive production programs and with that free up unbilled and generate cash. So, that's why we're so focused on it from a pacing standpoint. I think what you articulated is consistent with our expectations.\nKen Herbert: Okay, great. And Bill on those programs it looks like there was a little bit of cost creep especially with one particular program in the first quarter, is the run rate of sort of the $6 million for the development programs at $12 million for the other sort of programs, which sounds like that $12 million was initially contemplated in the guidance. But that $6 million on these programs, is that something that should significantly step down in the second quarter? Or how should we think about that from a modeling perspective?\nBill Ballhaus: Yes. Obviously, our goal is to see that step down over time. If we look at the $18 million, and just unpack, that I'd say that about one-third of that is ordinary course that we would expect to see. And as we said in our remarks, we saw it targeted it identified it early. And over time, the $12 million the other $12 million we would like to see that come down over time. And we've mentioned in our last call and reiterated this call, we've really increased the rigor and scrutiny that we're putting into these development programs. I think a big difference from how we're executing today is, we've got a weekly rhythm in place on our development programs and our production programs, so that something comes up from either a technical standpoint or a production standpoint, we can jump on it early and mitigate the impact. We put increased rigor in our monthly processes around EACs, et cetera. So, over time we would expect to see the impacts be mitigated from what we've experienced this quarter and historically and that's certainly our goal.\nDave Farnsworth: Yes. And I think one of the things, certainly for us was that we didn't -- that we said -- we saw growth, but it was largely nontechnical in nature. So it wasn't because there was new technical challenges that we had to go solve. So the risks we identified around those things are -- seem like they're the right risk still, and we're working our way through them. I think ideally as Bill said, I'd love to be in a mode, as we go forward where we get down the road and we don't see this kind of change in some of these EACs. But frankly, the fact that on the challenged programs it was one EAC that was that grew by about $5 million and the balance of that the roughly 20 programs was only $1 million was really a positive fund.\nBill Ballhaus: Yes. So those 20 programs, just over the course of the last 90 days, we've seen a lot more stability. And as Dave mentioned on the one program, where we did see cost growth it was primarily bill and material related and there were shifts in assumptions around quantities that drove pricing, et cetera. So without getting into too much detail, it's something that wasn't technical in nature in the balance of the 20 programs, we saw a lot more stability than we've seen historically.\nKen Herbert: Great. Appreciate all the color. I’ll pass it back there. Thank you. \nBill Ballhaus: Okay. Thanks, Ken\nDave Farnsworth: Thanks for your question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with Truist Securities. Your line is live.\nQ – Michael Ciarmoli: Hi, good evening, gentlemen. Thanks for taking the questions here.\nBill Ballhaus: Hi, Michael.\nQ – Michael Ciarmoli: Bill you obviously, you gave a lot of detail there. And I guess to put it maybe simplistically I mean you laid out the $18 million of cost growth. You talked about more run rate savings, I think to the tune of $24 million. You kept the guidance. I mean there was a lot of information. I mean are you guys on plan tracking, better than planned, worse than planned? I mean what's the quick simple assessment of where you are right now?\nBill Ballhaus: Yes. I'd say look, when it comes to the challenged programs we talked to the fact that we put a pretty detailed scrub, across those programs as we went through the first quarter. So personally for me, I was disappointed to see the magnitude of the impact that we saw on the development programs. The $18 million about one-third of it I think we would consider expected. But for me seeing cost growth on one of the 20 programs, I don't feel great about that. And we saw about $6 million across a number of other programs that it was just like one small thing after another. I do expect to see the impact from these programs go down with time. As we just keep driving increased rigor, putting attention on these programs, program by program and when something comes up jumping on it quickly. So I'd say from that standpoint probably beneath our expectations. That said, as we look ahead we've got pretty good line of sight on follow-on production programs and bookings coming as we're completing and making progress on these development programs. And just based on that line of sight we feel good about the back half of the year as we articulated in our guidance. But I'd say the one area where I was a little bit disappointed in ourselves was the amount of EAC growth that we saw. But other than that pretty much within our expectations.\nDave Farnsworth: I think Mike that we recognize and I think we said, initially when Bill and I did the last call that we saw still risk but the risk was largely first half weighted. So not – I mean frankly, we're both expect a lot from folks. So it would have been – it wasn't perfect for sure.  From a – Bill talked about the cost growth but from a revenue standpoint, we absolutely entered in our minds with a plan that the first half would be lower and I think we talked about that. And as we were looking towards not trying to pull a bunch of costs onto the balance sheet we talked about that. And to position ourselves for growth in the second half and to get these programs done and we spent a huge amount of the capacity of the firm working towards getting these programs done. And making sure we're ready at the – when we get into the second half and we expect as we said some significant awards in Q2 that we're ready to produce on those contracts as we go one of the things that was actually really strong and was good to see was on the production side of the business, which is 60-plus percent. I mean we absolutely – the team nailed it that the margins were right in line with what our expectations were. And so that gives us a really good sense of the strength we have in the back half of the year.\nBill Ballhaus: And as Dave said, we came into the year expecting that the first half will be down. The first quarter would be down. And if you just look at Slide 11 and walk top to bottom on that chart, it's pretty understandable as to where we are versus last year. We talked for instance about the large booking that we got in the year and we only recognized a portion of it. We talked about the revenue differential and the fact that the bulk of the revenue change year-over-year is tied to our overtime contracts and we are deliberately timing material to be much more efficient and linking it to the just-in-time need of our hardware. And then when you look at the gross margin differential, we talked about the impact of the development programs and adjusting back for the impact of the development programs the gross margins were largely consistent with our expectations. So I think that should be a pretty good indication that our results in the quarter, while they're down year-over-year, we expected them to be down. And I think we've got good line of sight around those variances. And as we look forward, we can see how driving execution on these development programs is going to lead the bookings. It's going to take variability out of our performance as we mitigate the impacts of the EACs and cost growth et cetera. And as we move hardware through the factory and time material more closely to hardware delivery, we're going to improve dramatically the free cash flow of this business. So it may sound odd, but I think we feel pretty good about where we sit right now.\nQ – Michael Ciarmoli: Got it. Thanks guys. I will keep it to just one. Thanks.\nBill Ballhaus: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Your line is live.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. How are you?\nBill Ballhaus: Hi, Sheila.\nDave Farnsworth: Hi, Sheila.\nBill Ballhaus: Doing well.\nDave Farnsworth: Thanks. Good afternoon.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: So I just wanted to go over a few things as possible on the top line and the bookings. Maybe if you could square away, what's happening with the top line a little bit more? I know you guys talked extensively, but are you kind of accounting for it in a different way? Does overtime revenues that are kind of what happens to how you account for it based on a material and labor way? And are you also saying that the revenue recognition left to do on the challenged programs is very small? So what part of the top line is driving the organic decline I guess I would...\nDave Farnsworth: Yeah. This is Dave, Sheila. I would not say -- we're not accounting for anything differently. It's the same accounting obviously and we're recognizing the material and the labor as we progress. And the one thing that's happened to the business in the past is we brought in a bunch of that material and Bill talked about this. We brought in a bunch of material and applied labor to it early on in the process. And for lots of reasons some of those reasons were go back way in time when supply chains were completely going haywire because of COVID which is long behind us. And -- but some of that practice was -- would bring it in as early as possible and start progressing it and then get to a stage, it would sit on the balance sheet until it was ready to be progressed further. And so we intentionally said, let's not do that. We don't need to do that. Supply chain stable enough now there's some long lead stuff that still freaks everybody out in the industry and we all know that. But let's make sure we're not bringing it early. We're not trying to progress it ahead of when it's needed. And so that really did lead to a significant decline in the overtime revenue. We expect that we'll still have that material and be able to progress it with the labor we need to and largely that's going to happen in the second half and we'll be able to bring it in. At the same time, as we get the new programs you'll see, a bunch of the inventory we've got progressed too into those projects and products so that that will show up as revenue where today it does not. But I thought one of the things that was a positive. If you look at our inventories and you look at the 10-Q, you can see that the inventories grew $26 million, but $21 million of that growth in the quarter was work in process not raw materials. So it's activities that we're progressing towards final product, so that we can ship it. So it's stuff that's making its way through the pipeline. So I don't think Sheila, there's been a big change other than us trying to be more just in time and trying to get ourselves in a better position from a working capital standpoint which I think is critical to the business.\nBill Ballhaus: Well, I would say that our focus on working capital really has two pieces to it that are really important. One is our focus on hardware delivery, so not just progressing hardware, but actually completing hardware, getting it out the door so that we can invoice and collect cash. Now, because we've recognized revenue on a number of programs that have the large unbilled balances and in many cases its most of the contract revenue, completing the hardware may have very little revenue associated with it in many cases, but it's what we have to do in order to invoice and collect cash. So part of the dynamics that you're seeing is us being focused on allocating factory capacity to hardware that we need to get out the door, so that we can collect cash that may have a small amount of remaining revenue to be recognized. Hopefully, that additional color is helpful.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Yeah. It does. Maybe just switching a little bit of gears, can you then talk about how you're thinking about some of the bookings element of it just down 30%, you mentioned a big component of that is system orders you're waiting for, complete the development program. But how should we sort of think about that timing disconnect that you're only going to go complete 11 of the programs this year. So kind of when bookings front I guess?\nBill Ballhaus: Yeah. Well, I'll tell you, we expect to see the bookings improve as we go through the year, starting in Q2. And we've got pretty good line of sight to a small number of good-sized bookings that we expect to see coming in starting in Q2. And I'd also point to the large award that we mentioned where we only recognized a fraction of it in Q1.

One of the things you'll see as a significant ramp up our backlog to set ourselves up for the second half of the year. Bill talked about a couple of the programs. Just generically we don't go through programs, individually and talk about bookings before they're coming in, but we definitely have line of sight on a couple of those significant bookings. We're not intending. And don't need all of the challenged programs to finish. The ones that are driving the most significant bookings are largely in the realm of the programs we will be finished with.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thank you.\nDave Farnsworth: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. At this point, I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ballhaus, for closing comments.\nBill Ballhaus: Okay. Thanks Aaron, and thanks everybody for joining our Q1 call. And we look forward to connecting with you soon, to talk through our Q2 results. Thanks for your time, this evening.\nOperator: Thank you gentlemen, and ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Mercury Systems First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. Have a great evening."
