At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Debra Chen of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma'am. \nDebra Chen : Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Biotricity third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. As a reminder, Biotricity’s third quarter 2024 fiscal year ended December 31st, 2023. So, all figures presented for this period will reflect that end date. Earlier Biotricity issued its fiscal 2024 third quarter press release, which highlighted financial and operational results. A copy of the press release is available on the Investor Relations section of Biotricity's website and the full financials have been filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q, and posted on EDGAR at www.sec.gov. Before beginning the company's formal remarks, I'd like to remind listeners that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views with respect to future events. Any such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Biotricity does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements except as required. At this point, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Biotricity's Founder and CEO, Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq. Please go ahead.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq : Thank you, Debra, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. This quarter proved to be quite successful for us. Despite limited news announcements, our diligence and focus efforts can be seen across various operational and financial metrics. We not only improved our margins once again, but also achieved record margins, increased our revenue and reduced losses. This brings us closer towards our path to profitability, and I believe that time has never been near.  We continue to leverage our data intelligently, pushing the boundaries of operational automation and efficiency, and in late January, we announced the development of our cardiac AI cloud platform. The platform is being designed for predictive monitoring, helping physicians and users in detecting potential issues before they arise. This supports our objective for early interventions, which decreases the likelihood of readmissions and contributes to lowering healthcare costs. Biotricity product portfolio is already recognized as one of the most extensive remote cardiac monitoring collections worldwide, and this further reinforces our commitment to advanced healthcare solutions.  Today, we have successfully recorded over 500 billion heartbeats a data set that is supporting our R&D efforts to continuously improve analytics, to help drive better patient outcomes. Additionally, we were proud to announce that to date we have monitored, recorded, and helped diagnose over 250,000 patients. Some additional features that further enhance our existing products include fascia analytical results, improved scalability, improved operational efficiency and support for other commercial models. Our efforts to build a comprehensive cardiac AI cloud are the first step in making cardiac care not only accessible, but also affordable and scalable.  Today, cardiologists are overwhelmed with too many patients and too much data, making it difficult for them to service more patients. An accurate cardiac cloud will provide the necessary support and assistance to cardiologists so that they can service more patients and focus on the most relevant pieces of data. I believe that we have the ability to transform cardiac care into a more streamlined and effective healthcare solution.  Results for our third quarter, demonstrate year-over-year revenue growth and improvements in all key operating metrics, specifically in recurring technology fees, device sales, and gross margins. Throughout this, we've maintained a strong focus on cost control, managing expenses, and making consistent progress towards our goal of achieving positive cash flow and profitability.  We've upheld our track record of strong customer retention, supported by the quality of our customers and the cardiologist-friendly support services that emphasize the accuracy of our diagnostics and ease of use. Our recurring technology fees and growth margins continue to trend upward, and we have successfully managed expenses, all while penetrating the market and securing market leadership in cardiac remote patient monitoring devices and solutions.  In looking forward, we plan to leverage our sales force to expand and penetrate new markets.  With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, John Ayanoglou. \nJohn Ayanoglou : Thanks, Waqaas. Let's review the unaudited highlights of our third quarter fiscal 2024 period. Recurring revenue generated from our technology as a service subscription model, as well as our usage-based subscriptions, is driven by popularity of our FDA-cleared cardiac devices. Biotres and Bioflux, both remain strong. In fact, we're seeing growth in demand in market adoption for the Biotres and the next-generation Biotres pro.  Atrial fibrillation or Afib is a primary contributor to stroke, so we are very proud to be able to report that Biotricity has protected patient lives using the metrics that Waqaas mentioned earlier that we have monitored and recorded over 500 billion heartbeats and that over the last two years we estimate that we have facilitated the diagnosis of over 250,000 patients, providing them the opportunity for earlier medical intervention. This not only improves patient outcomes, but also underscores significant healthcare cost savings for both individuals and the broader healthcare system.  Revenue for the third quarter into December 31st, 2023 increased 21% year over year to $2.97 million. We continued to persistently advance our focus on our flat fee subscription-based services by transitioning most of our customers away from a usage-based subscription. This is strategic for us as it establishes the foundation for a higher quality of revenue that is more predictable, a more consistent recurring revenue stream in the long term.  A gross proper percentage of 73% for the quarter and December 31st, 2023 as compared to 57% in the corresponding prior year quarter. This increase in gross margin was a result of expansion in our recurring technology fee revenue base, and efficiencies gained in using proprietary AI and operational automation and improved efficiency in infrastructure. This is in line with our performance expectations on improving margins as our recurring business grows.  Looking ahead, we anticipate continued improvement in overall blended gross margin over time. Technology fees comprise 93% of this quarter's total revenue for the three-month period ended December 31st, 2023. Gross profit total $2.2 million, up 55% from $1.4 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Through the continued success of our sales team, we have reported a geographic expansion into 35 states that include thousands of cardiologists in over hundreds of centers.  Our expansion is intended to allow us to compete in the broader U.S. market using an insourcing business model. This approach allows our cardiac medical professionals to have direct control and management over our solution, potentially enhancing efficiencies, but it also establishes or enables us to tap into a broader market.  Our technology has a large potential total addressable market which can include hospitals, clinics and physicians' offices, as well as other independent diagnostic testing facilities or IDTs. Let's discuss the business dynamics to support the level of revenue reported by comparing this quarter to the corresponding quarter one year ago.  Our SG&A expenses improved by 31% and we reduced our R&D by 48%. This was a quarter in which we continued to focus on long-term building. We continued to transform our sales force and focus them on longer sales cycle, larger accounts, some of which are also independent hospitals or belong to group purchasing organizations or GPO networks. In this and the last few quarters, we have purposefully changed our variable sales compensation for our sales team to reward the hunting for new device sales since that is the precursor for recurring technology subscriptions.  We then used trained account professionals to do the account management work that we previously used salespeople to do. This has required that we form a stronger partnership between our outside sales force and our inside sales force. The results, the third fiscal quarter of 2024, on which we're now reporting, was a successful device sales quarter. To date the highest-selling device sales quarter ever. And these device sales will nicely impact technology fee subscription revenues in the next quarter and beyond.  Device sales achieved, and indeed, the revenue reported should also be seen in the context of the fact that they occurred in a traditionally low-selling quarter that included Thanksgiving and Christmas or Hanukkah vacation periods when we would've expected lower usage-based revenues.  Speaking of GPOs, we now have relationships with the strongest GPOs in the country, which we anticipate will translate into an ability to sell to over 80% of U.S. hospitals, something we expect to start giving us traction in coming quarters. Through this focus, we've been able to manage our resources more effectively while controlling expenses in the areas that allowed us to retool and effectively impact our future sales growth. We've been able to be nimble and flexible by being proactive and pivot in the areas that better manage our cash flows and push forward the other areas that enhance our financials.  We continued our path toward EBITDA breakeven later this year. To do this, we significantly retooled our cost of goods sold expenses, including our infrastructure. In addition to reorganizing our sales expenses to ensure that our sales force is focused on direct revenue growth, we curbed our spending on other expenses and reduced the pace of some of these, including some of our R&D initiatives, in favor of rescheduling some of these initiatives later into 2025.  We are pleased with our focus on building our technology, our insistence on registering our devices with the FDA, our focus on building a more effective sales force and on mindful spending. The results show this progress. On a year-to-date basis, our total operating expenses were reduced by $4 million, which resulted in a loss from operations that improved to just under $6.2 million.  Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended December 31st, 2023 was $3 million compared to a net loss of $4.7 million during the comparable quarter in the prior year. This improved result was reported despite some mitigating factors that include the expenses associated with necessary infrastructure growth and rising variable interest rates, which impact short-term notes and our term debt, resulting in a year-over-year increase of $377,000 in interest that impacted this quarter.  Earnings per share for the quarter improved to negative $33.09 per share versus negative $41.01 per share compared to the preceding quarter. Quarter over immediately preceding quarter adjusted EBITDA improved by about $720,000, such as adjusted EPS improved to negative $0.12 per share. Each quarter, I'd like to provide a big, high-level explanation of how we drive our revenues. First is our technology fees, which are recurring subscription service fees generated by our software platform, diagnostics, and biosphere data platform.  For the third quarter, fiscal 2024. Our technology fees rose 23% year-over-year to $2.78 million. This growth reflects our strong customer retention that is supported by the quality of customer and cardiologists friendly support services that emphasize accuracy of diagnostics and ease of use. Our second revenue segment is device sales, which are the sales of our proprietary hardware, which like our software is all designed in-house. In third quarter, fiscal 2024, the device sales comprised 6.5% of our total revenue, or 193,000 for the three-month period ended December 31st, 2023.  In January, 2024, we hired Dr. Farida Siddique as our VP Healthcare to spearhead community health and remote patient diagnostics for chronic care. This has the potential for being a significant business for us in 2026 and beyond. More on that in future quarters. Our technology is truly globally useful. Cardiac is the number one chronic care condition in the entire world. We've recently made inroads or received approvals from regulatory bodies of other countries that will allow us to sell in other jurisdictions. This sets us up for new initiatives, we intend to move on in 2026 and beyond.  As we advance the commercialization of Biotres, Bioflux and Biocare products. We anticipate continuing this growth trajectory. The market scoring interest and demand for our suite of products dedicated to chronic cardiac disease prevention and management reinforces our confidence in our market position and our focus on commercialization and development has resulted in significant advancements in remote monitoring solutions for both diagnostic and post-diagnostic products, bringing us closer to achieving positive cash flow.  With that, I hand it back to you Waqaas.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq : That concludes our opening remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ben Haynor with Alliance Global Partners. Please proceed.\nBen Haynor : Thanks for taking my questions. First off for me, just on the salesforce changes, the hunters and the farmers, the changes that you've made there, how much more efficiency is available to you there? And have you -- the trends that you've seen, obviously they look positive, but any more color you can provide to us there? \nWaqaas Al-Siddiq : Yes, I mean, it's early days. It's hard to kind of like quantify what the efficiency gain is, but I can certainly say that, with the Hunter Farmer methodology, you have people that are focusing on purely account management and individuals that are focused purely on sales versus before the sales rep was spending part of their time on selling and part of their time on account management. So certainly, that has made the sales force more efficient and each individual more focused on new business. \nBen Haynor: I mean, that certainly makes sense, and then on the larger account opportunities, the GPOs and such, what do you see out there? I mean, in terms of closing dynamics to, for these sorts of larger groups and such, are there near-term opportunities that you expect will hit the P&L sooner rather than later? Or is it kind of later in or in calendar ‘24 that we should start to see a bigger impact?\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq : I mean, the GPOs are really allowing us to focus on the larger deals and the larger customers and the IDNs and those deals typically take longer, and I think that based on our internal projections and conversation that we're having, we're expecting to see that towards the end of 2024. Typically, sales cycles on those deals are well above a year. But having GPO relationships shortcuts that, but they're still pretty long sales cycles. The key for us is building a base of our business, which is got its path to break even. And so that allows us to have the extra time and the ability to go after these bigger accounts. And with the GPO relationships, it helps us shorten that process. \nBen Haynor: And then how do the hunter’s kind of spend their time in between going after the larger accounts and then smaller accounts or one-offs, how does that typically get spent? And anything you can share on that? \nWaqaas Al-Siddiq : The way we think about it is like pillars and fillers, if you will. So, the larger accounts are our pillar accounts that are going to be leveraged with the GPO relationships and the longer sales cycles. But reps have quotas and they have to sell a certain amount on a quarterly basis. So, they're building that base pipeline to meet their quota requirements on a quarterly basis, and then they're augmenting that with the larger deals. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Michael Davin with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed.\nMichael Davin : Thank you, operator, and congrats on the quarter Waqaas. Can you add a bit more color on your cardiac AI cloud platform? What sort of milestones and timeline can we expect as you work towards commercializing the new predictive features? \nWaqaas Al-Siddiq : Our cardiac AI cloud that is really focused on getting and taking our traditional algorithms and really improving those and improving the sensitivity and specificity on that so that we can essentially scale faster and service more patients with essentially less resources, and op and scale the operations of the organization a little bit better. In terms of timeline, we've tracked about 500 billion heartbeats that grows every month. It is a big initiative for us. And the FDA clearance process on stuff like that is typically a year, sometimes a little bit longer. Right now, we are in the stage of analyzing and establishing a foundation which we will then file an FDA for.  So, I expect that we'll file something by the end of this year, maybe a bit earlier, and expect the FDA response to come in, nine months after we file. So, I would say probably you're looking at mid to late next year in terms of commercial availability. But that is something that is going to be a game-changer for us. \nMichael Davin: Great. Thank you. Now will this platform be prioritized in terms of R&D expenses? I know you mentioned having reduced R&D initiatives and then pushing a little bit more of these initiatives later out in the calendar year 2024. So, if you can, kind of break that down a little bit more, that'd be helpful. \nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Yeah, so I'm sure you guys have -- read and probably paid attention. We have a lot of initiatives that are going on. So, in terms of an R&D perspective, we recently got a couple FDA clearance. We launched a couple products. So, a lot of those products are now in maintenance mode. So just naturally some of our R&D expenses come down because those products are no longer in the R&D phase. They're in the maintenance mode. And the cardiac AI cloud is the priority right now for us.  And anything that's related to our cardiac ecosystem, the stuff that we have pushed out is stuff that is ancillary and things that we have plans for in the future. Unless of course that gets accelerated, so we got an NIH grant to work on our stroke prediction in kidney patients. So that we brought closer because that was a funded program, but other initiatives that we have in terms of development and bringing in other biometrics into our cardiac ecosystem, that stuff is, has been pushed out a little bit further. So, we've been really focusing on things that are driving direct business outcomes and direct operational efficiency. \nMichael Davin: Great. That's very helpful. And one last question. So, for these, the increased device sales, did these arise from previous relationships with hospitals or do you think that these increases from new relationships with GPOs and whatnot? \nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: A combination of both. I mean, there were certainly deals that were already inside of our pipeline that we had recently closed and we're closing accounts. So, they were, they were continuing to increase in terms of sales and growing in terms of our sales. And then there were new accounts that we closed. So, device sales come from a combination of accounts that are growing and new accounts. \nMichael Davin: Great. Thank you so much. \nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. There are no further questions at this time, and gentlemen, I would like to turn it back to you for closing remarks.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Thank you everybody for attending the call, and we appreciate you taking your afternoon and listening to our remarks. We are always available. You can reach us at investors@biotricity.com or reach out to us on our website, if there are any questions that weren't answered, please feel free to contact us and join our mailing list. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day."

And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Debra Chen with Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nDebra Chen: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Biotricity's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. As a reminder, Biotricity's second quarter 2024 fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. So all figures presented for this period will reflect that end date. Earlier, Biotricity issued its fiscal 2024 second quarter press release, which highlighted financial and operational results. A copy of the press release is available on the Investor Relations section of Biotricity's website and the full financials have been filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q, and posted on EDGAR at www.sec.gov. Before beginning the company's formal remarks, I'd like to remind listeners that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect management's current views with respect to future events. Any such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Biotricity does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements except as required. At this point, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Biotricity's Founder and CEO, Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq. Please go ahead.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Thank you, Debra. And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. This quarter, we continue to make substantial progress, reporting double-digit sales growth. Our recurring technology fees, device sales and gross margins all demonstrated positive growth while we maintain cost control in order to make progress on our plan to achieve positive cash flow and profitability. To address the increasing interest and demand for our suite of products, we launched our new online store this September, which provides a user-friendly integrated shopping experience to showcase all of our monitoring devices, which we believe will further enhance our distribution sales and streamline our sales operations. Additionally, our sales force has amplified our geographic reach, and we're pleased to announce that as of September 30, 2023, we have customers in over 32 states in the U.S., contributing to an impressive 21.4% year-over-year revenue growth. Our gross margins have also improved significantly, rising from 54% during the same period last year to an impressive 69%. We also saw a reduction in our SG&A by 22% to $3.5 million, which was something that we said we could continue to monitor and trim in the previous quarters. Through diligent cost structure management and strong growth across the board, we achieved a reduction of our net loss by 20% year-over-year from $4.9 million to $3.9 million, or $0.446 per share. As we review our second quarter financials, I think it's important to highlight a few takeaways for why we are here and what we are trying to achieve. Since founding Biotricity, our mission has been to innovate and create transformative health care products in preventative care. Today, we deliver pioneering remote monitoring solutions to the medical, health care and consumer markets, focusing on diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for lifestyle and chronic illnesses. Although it remains an unmet need, we are witnessing the paradigm shift within the health care world, from reactive to proactive and see how technology propels the emergence of solutions that contribute to improved curative therapies. We addressed the diagnostic aspect of remote patient monitoring by innovating with established business models that already have reimbursement structures in place. This method, we believe, mitigates the risks typically associated with traditional medical device development and speeds up the journey to generating revenue. In the post-diagnostics sector, we incorporate medical-grade biometrics, empowering consumers to self-manage. This approach aims to enhance patient compliance and ultimately, lower health care costs. For a full suite of products in the Biotricity platform, please visit www.biotricity.com. Turning to our Biosphere platform and complementary products, our Biocare app has garnered tens of thousands of downloads and Biosphere continues to attract industry-wide interest among both new and existing customers. It is clear that AI has become a big component to what we are developing in our realm of remote cardiac care. We are leveraging proprietary AI technology to develop a suite of predictive monitoring tools to enhance new disease profiling, improved patient management and revolutionize the health care industry for disease prevention. Additionally, we strengthened our partnerships with major players, including Amazon and Google. With the health care AI market anticipated to reach $208.2 billion by 2030, we've already positioned ourselves as a significant player. Our powerful proprietary cardiac AI model integrates Google's TensorFlow, AWS infrastructure, Big Data and a continuous learning engine, allowing for rapid advancements in our cardiac technology. This has led to increasing sales of our remote cardiac monitoring devices and the ramp-up of our subscription-based service, increasing our recurring revenue over the past few quarters. Our ability to grow this type of revenue is predicated on the size and quality of our sales force to place these devices with clinically focused health care providers operating in the cardiac sector. In the coming months, we will continue to use our team to address new markets and achieve sales penetration in the markets currently served. With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, John Ayanoglou.\nJohn Ayanoglou: Thank you, Waqaas. As Waqaas has already addressed the fiscal year second quarter numbers at a high level and the market and the industry and key operational matters, I will not delve into the unaudited highlights of the second quarter and some of the details for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Our Technology-as-a-Service subscription-based recurring revenue from our cardiac monitoring device, Biotres and our FDA-cleared Bioflux device continue to see demand and market adoption. Biotricity as previously announced that they have monitored over 2 billion heartbeats for Afib, atrial fibrillation, a primary contributor to strokes. Over the past few years, this initiative has positively impacted well over 14,000 patients diagnosed with Afib and continues to do that, offering them the potential for earlier medical intervention. This not only enhances patient outcomes but also underscores the substantial health care cost savings for both individuals and the broader health care system. Revenue for the second quarter ended September 30, 2023, increased by 21.4% year-over-year to a stable level of $2.9 million, just under the $3 million mark posted for the immediately preceding quarter, but on higher quality of earnings. The months of August and December have traditionally been slower months as patients and doctors go on vacation or otherwise reduce office hours over the vacation and holiday periods. However, there is more going on here. This quarter, we continued to transition our Houston-based customers to our subscription-based service, ramping up our efforts to do this. While this shift to a higher quality of earnings may result in an initial dip in revenues, it lays the groundwork for quality in the form of increased, recurring and predictable revenue and benefits us in the long term while helping us chart a clearer path to profitability. This quarter is a testament to the improvements in our business as a direct result of those efforts. Our gross profit percentage was 69.1% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 53.8% in the corresponding prior year quarter and 63.5% in the immediately preceding quarter. This increase in gross margin is due to our expanding recurring technology fee revenue base and proportion of our sales mix in that component, which has consistently stayed above 70%. We also gained efficiencies in using AI and data processing and improved our monitoring cost structure. This is in line with our expectations on improving both performance and margins as our recurring business grows. Looking ahead, we anticipate continued improvement in an overall blended gross margin over time. Technology fee revenue comprised 94.5% of the quarter's total revenue for the 3-month period ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit totaled $2 million, up 56.2% from the $1.28 million, comparatively for the same period in the prior year. We have expanded our sales efforts across a broader geographic footprint with the intention to expand further and compete in the broader U.S. market using an in-sourcing business model. Our technology has a large potential total addressable market, which can include hospitals, clinics and physicians' offices as well as other independent diagnostic testing facilities, known in the industry as IDTF. I want to remind you that cardiac is the number 1 chronic care condition, not only in the U.S. but all around the world, and our connected technology is useful across the globe. But there's more. Our sales expenses decreased or improved by 1% and our R&D decreased or improved by 2% this quarter, such that we reduced our loss from operations by $140,000 this quarter. With respect to sales expenses, we've been able to do this through the retooling of our sales force, focusing on hunters rather than farmers in terms of the profile of each of our salespeople, our professional salespeople, thereby leading to a variable sales compensation for our external and more senior salespeople that is more direct drive and aligned to growing our recurring profitability while we've taken the job of maintaining our customer accounts and improving their satisfaction levels, by using a focused internal sales team that is less expensive. This is a good news story because we've been able to earn our higher-quality revenue with a smaller professional sales force that is less expensive thereby reducing our overall sales expense, while at the same time, managing cash and putting our product that will enhance our hospital and strategic footprint. Our efforts to improve the quality of our earnings and our cost structure are visible in this quarter's results. Despite the slight dip in revenues, we've improved margins, reduced sales and operating costs and improved our loss from operations to under $2.2 million, reducing operating losses by over $1.8 million from the corresponding prior year quarter and $131,000 from the immediately preceding quarter. Net loss attributable to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was $3.9 million compared to a net loss of $4.9 million during the comparable quarter in the prior year. When compared to the immediately preceding quarter, our net loss to common shareholders degraded by $280,000 due to increased interest costs, rising rates on variable term loan interest caused that and accretion expense. Earnings per share was $0.441 versus $0.411 compared to the preceding quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved by about $66,000 such that adjusted EPS was an improved $0.23 per share versus $0.24 per share in the immediately preceding quarter. Underpinning all of these improvements in the quality of our earnings and our cost structure is the fact that month-to-date, November is shaping up to be an excellent month, perhaps, our best month of device sales ever. As we advance the commercialization of Bioflux, Biotres and Biocare products, we anticipate a continuing growth trajectory. And we've just launched our Biotres Pro, which our sales force tells us is going to be a groundbreaking product that will have a lot of demand. The market's growing interest and demand for our suite of products dedicated to chronic cardiac disease prevention and management reinforces our confidence in our market position and our focus on commercialization and development has resulted in significant advancements in remote monitoring solutions for both diagnostic and post-diagnostic products, bringing us closer to achieving positive cash flow. I will now turn the call back to Waqaas for his closing comments.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Thank you, John. In looking at the near-term and long-term prospects for Biotricity, there is a lot to be excited about. We recently announced a patent application for our groundbreaking Biotres device. This filing is part of our broader strategy of expanding our IP portfolio with trade secrets and patents. As we consistently innovate and expand our IP and FDA 510(k) portfolios, we are not only winning market share and protecting our IP, but continuously increasing the barriers to entry. We also filed a patent application for our innovative wearable heart monitoring device Bioheart, which is recognized by Time Magazine as one of the best inventions of 2022. Finally, we just expanded our current product portfolio with the release of our Biotres Pro, with critical capability of cellular backup for off-line connectivity. This is a game-changing product to our current product, the Biotres, which is our three-channel technology for preventative and comprehensive cardiac care. Previously, we actually offered up to 30 days of recording and automated data offloading while connected wirelessly. But with the addition of Biotres Pro's innovative cellular connectivity, there are no longer delays in data retrieval that may have occurred previously due to low connectivity. This marks a significant leap forward as our Biotres Pro offline data storage established it as the leading solution for cardiac monitoring. With the addition of Biotres Pro, Biotricity now has the most comprehensive remote cardiac monitoring portfolio in the market. That concludes our opening remarks. I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Davin: Well, thank you, operator. This is Michael Davin, calling on behalf of Kevin Dede. Congrats, Waqaas. And for the Biotres Pro, can you discuss a little bit more about that cellular backup for connectivity feature? And how it -- I see how it helps patients, but also how it help clinics? Just provide a little bit more color on that aspect.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Appreciate it. Yes, sure. So the cellular backup, I mean, sometimes when you end up having these patients might forget to charge your cellphone or the connectivity is interrupted because the Biotres is a Bluetooth based device. And so in that case, data may not be fully uploaded by the time the device is returned. So when the device is returned, the clinic may have to plug it in and it will charge and while it's charging, it might upload and taking 10 minutes upload the data. So to remove that having cellular backup so that even if connectivity is interrupted, it will continue to upload in the background.\nMichael Davin: Okay. Great. Appreciate that. Now what are you guys seeing? You mentioned hospitals, clinics, independent labs, where are you seeing most of demand right now? Is there one segment that is producing more demand for you guys?\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Demand for us is pretty much across the board. I think the way to look about is more about where are we focusing our time. So previously, we were spending a lot of our -- 80% to 90% of our time on the independent market, like the specialty cardiac center groups, and about 10% of our time on the hospital market. And as we build the business and as we've been able to drive revenue now, what we are looking at is creating a more blended mix. So 60% of our time is still focused on the independent market, but 40% of our time is now spent on the hospital markets. We understand that the sales cycles are longer with the hospital. But once you close the system, you generally have multiple orders and a long-term relationship as well as a much bigger order in the long run. So -- but we want to continue to close business on a monthly basis and on a quarterly basis, so we have this blended mix now, so as opposed to what we were doing before. Now we've taken a chunk of our commercial team and have focused it towards going after the hospital.\nMichael Davin: Great. Understood. And in terms of focusing our time and efforts are you planning to expand beyond these 32 states? Or is your sales force kind of focus on those clinics and those hospitals, those 32 states prior to further expansion?\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: We are always looking at opportunities and always looking to expand. A lot of our customers have colleagues, friends that they went to medical school with or they've moved from a different stage. So we go into our existing network and existing customer network and look for referrals. And as opportunities arise in other states, we absolutely go after them. So it's not -- it's not something that we are specifically saying, hey, we don't want to go into other states. It's more about, we have a footprint that is primarily driven by where we have reps and the geography where our reps are based. And then the secondary aspect of where we are is really based on opportunities that are coming in from our referral network. So the goal is to be in 50 states, but we are not chasing a particular state. We are chasing and focusing on building the most powerful commercial team that we can. And so it's really about finding the right types of reps and expand our commercial team and our commercial capability. And then as time goes on, I think we will see ourselves going to and have a full national footprint across all 50 states.\nMichael Davin: Okay. Great. Now in terms of your aim to enhance patient compliance. Is there a way to quantify that at this stage?\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: So patient compliance, it's tough. We are looking into that. We've implemented an app to look at how many patients are downloading and following the rules. We've seen a good impact on that. We've seen a lot from a percentage of perspective, a significant percent of patients download the app. We are going to be looking and analyzing that data and are looking to put out an impact report, and part of that will be looking at patient compliance.\nMichael Davin: Okay. Okay. And last question. Can you expand upon your partnership with Amazon and Google in terms of what TensorFlow means to overall operations as well as with Amazon's infrastructure? And given that Biotricity has this proven track record, do you see any potential for further opportunities between you and Amazon or Google?\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Yes. So what we've done is we've built our proprietary analytics and data cloud using the technologies within Amazon's automation and scaling infrastructure and Google's AI and deep data systems. So we've taken those -- the elements that are most powerful and applicable to our product category and our use case and build our own proprietary data cloud and ecosystem in terms of measurable improvements and how that's been driven. I mean, I think you can see that in our financials, right? Our margins are improving, expenses are going down. A big part of this is our proprietary systems becoming more automated, becoming smarter, being able to deal with data in a more efficient way and allowing us to do more with less. So that's essentially what we've been doing, and I think that, that is going to come through and it's going to continue to come through over the next couple of quarters that we will see margins improvement, data costs coming down, our cost of servicing and maintaining data, there's economies of scale that will come through as we get more and more data. We have quite a bit. But as we get more devices out there as we collect more information, we're going to get economies of scale. And we were very mindful of the fact that these costs and looking at these systems, the expenses can actually rise quite quickly if you're not proactively thinking about it and looking at how to automate and develop something that is not only efficient, but also predictive, right? So our next move is to really go into prediction because that, again, can save time and make us even more efficient.\nMichael Davin: Great. Thank you, Waqaas. One final question. For Biotricity's online store, could you kind of give some reasoning for launching this? And does this help Biotricity with reimbursements versus your devices on Amazon? What are the pros of having your store versus of the other online avenues for acquiring Biotricity devices?\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Yes. So our model is a very -- is a subscription-based model. So Amazon is really something that you purchase as a onetime expense. Amazon is really not set up for subscription models. I mean you can do it, but it's incredibly complicated. So that's not the right platform to be utilizing for that. And the main reason we built the store, first of all, it simplifies operations for us in terms of anyone being able to purchase and buy our technology. But more importantly, we get inbound interest on occasion. And so allowing people to purchase the technology, it streamlines our ability to operationally manage the whole sales and ordering process.\nMichael Davin: Got it. Got it. Well, thank you, Waqaas. Congrats on the quarter. We'll hop back into queue\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Gentlemen, we'll turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Thank you, everybody, for joining us on this quarterly call. I would like to just leave one parting remark, I think that the key takeaway for this quarter was really the execution and what we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters where we're going to continue to focus on top line growth but also expense management and margin improvement. And last quarter, we were talking about how we made changes. We implemented new optimizations. We enhanced our AI technology. And the result of that was going to be margin improvement in the coming quarters, and so we showed that this quarter. And I think that, that is something that we're going to continue to see as well as this focus on revenue growth, but while managing and optimizing how the business is working. Thank you, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to Biotricity’s First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results and Business Update Conference Call. Today’s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Debra Chen, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma’am.\nDebra Chen: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Biotricity’s first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. As a reminder, Biotricity’s first quarter fiscal 2024 ended on June 30, 2023, so all figures presented for this period will reflect that end date. Earlier, the company issued its earnings press release, which highlighted financial and operational results. A copy of the press release is available on the Investor Relations section of Biotricity’s website, and the full financials have been filed with the SEC on Form 10-Q and posted on EDGAR at www.sec.gov. Before beginning the company’s formal remarks, I’d like to remind listeners that today’s discussion may contains forward-looking statements that reflect management’s current views with respect to future events. Any such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that can cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Biotricity does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements except as required. At this point, I’m pleased to turn the call over to Biotricity’s Founder and CEO, Dr. Waqaas Al-Siddiq. Please go ahead.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Thank you, Debra, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. I welcome you to our first quarter fiscal 2024 teleconference. As reported in our earnings press release, we experienced a very solid quarter with a year-over-year revenue growth and improvements in key operating metrics. Specifically, our recurring technology fees, device sales and gross margins all demonstrated positive growth while maintaining a firm grasp on cost reduction and expense management. I can confidently assert that we are making strides towards positive cash flow given the consistent results we observe from quarter-to-quarter. From a market perspective, the increasing interest and demand continued to drive the adoption of our suite of products focused on chronic cardiac disease prevention and management. Our efforts in commercialization and development have yielded tremendous progress in remote monitoring solutions for diagnostic and post-diagnostic products. The expansion of our sales force has expanded our geographic reach, and I’m pleased to announce that as of June 30th, 2023, our sales have launched in over 35 states in the U.S., contributing to a remarkable 46.9% year-over-year revenue growth. Notably, our gross margins have also seen significant improvement, rising from 59.6% during the same period last year to an impressive 63.5%. We accomplished all of this while also announcing that we reduced our SG&A by 22% to $3.5 million. Through diligent cost structure management, automation and utilization of our proprietary AI technology and strong growth across the board, we achieved a reduction of our net loss by 33% year-over-year to $3.6 million, or $0.069 per share from a net loss of $5 million or $0.098 per share. At Biotricity, our responsibility as a management team and my role as CEO and is to innovate and create transformative healthcare products while ensuring financial discipline, driving margin and revenue growth to deliver value creation for our investors. This approach has been consistently demonstrated on a quarter-by-quarter basis. The results we’ve achieved this quarter serve as a testament to the successful execution, hard work and dedication of our exceptional team. Turning to our BioSphere platform model and complementary products, we’re thrilled to observe continued growth. Our Biocare app has garnered thousands of downloads, and Biotres continues to attract industry-wide interest among both new and existing customers. Earlier in the quarter, we announced a significant milestone between Bioflux and Biotres products. Biotricity has monitored over 2 billion heartbeats for atrial fibrillation, a leading cost of stroke. Over the past two years, our efforts have benefited over 14,000 patients diagnosed with afib, providing early intervention and resulting in cost savings exceeding $330 million. By preventing late diagnosis and subsequent strokes, Biotricity has also facilitated savings exceeding $1.3 billion. Our commitment to innovation remains unwavering as we harness data intelligently to explore novel avenues for enhancing healthcare outcomes. Through cutting-edge research and development, we’re not only redefining medical diagnostics and patient care, but also pushing the boundaries of what AI-driven solutions can achieve. Just last month, we announced that we are expanding our AI technology development in remote cardiac care. We are leveraging our proprietary AI technology to provide a suite of predictive monitoring tools to enhance new disease profiling, improve patient management and revolutionize the healthcare industry for disease prevention. This comes at the heels of us also announcing that we have strengthened relationships with both Amazon and Google. The healthcare AI market opportunity is projected to grow to $208.2 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. Our company has already established a strong foothold, having already built a powerful proprietary cardiac AI model that combines Google’s TensorFlow, AWS infrastructure, big data and a continuous learning engine. This combination allows us to rapidly improve our cardiac technology. In the near future, we believe the capabilities of our cardiac AI model will allow us to support healthcare professionals in handling exponentially more patients while identifying the most critical data. This will enable healthcare workers to elevate the quality of care while serving a larger number of patients. As growing patient numbers further stress the shortage of healthcare professionals, our technology could help alleviate this pressing issue. We have engineered our technology to not only improve patient care and outcomes, but to do so in a manner that supports more patients. This has led to increasing sales of our remote cardiac monitoring devices and the ramp-up of our subscription-based service, increasing our recurring revenue over the past few quarters and charting a clear path to profitability. With that, I’ll turn the call over to our CFO, John Ayanoglou.\nJohn Ayanoglou: Thank you, Waqaas. Given the insight that you provided in your discussion of key operational matters, I am going to review the first quarter fiscal 2024 highlights, which are unaudited. Our Technology-as-a-Service subscription-based recurring revenue from our Biotres and Bioflux devices continue to grow at a healthy pace. Revenue for the first quarter ended June 30, 2023, increased 46.9% year-over-year to $3 million. Our gross profit percentage was 63.5% for the quarter ended June 30, 2023, as compared to 59.6% in the corresponding prior year quarter. This increase in gross margin was largely attributed to an increase in margin related to our technology fees and reductions we were able to achieve in processing costs from providing these services, some of which relate to efficiencies gained through the use of AI. Given consistent gross margin on technology fees of approximately 70% or better and an evolving revenue mix where technology fees are expected to comprise an increasing proportion of revenue, we anticipate continued improvement in overall blended gross margin over time. Technology fees comprised 92% of the quarter’s total revenue. Gross profit totaled $1.9 million, up 56% from $1.2 million a year ago. Net loss attributed to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2023, was $3.6 million compared to a net loss of $5 million during the comparable quarter in the prior year. As we have mentioned in our call in June, our revenues come from two sources or segments. First, our technology fees, which are recurring subscription service fees, generated by our monitoring diagnostics and Biosphere services. For the first quarter fiscal 2024, our technology fees rose 47% to $2.77 million. In part, its strong growth reflects our extraordinary customer retention rate of approximately 98%, which in one simple single number speaks volumes about our excellent customer and cardiologist-friendly support services, superior device hardware and tech services, ease of use and superior diagnostics. Our second revenue segment is device sales, which are the sales of our proprietary hardware, which, like our software, is all designed in-house. In first quarter fiscal 2024, device sales comprised 8.3% of our total revenue and were reported at $252,000. We are continuing to work hard towards achieving positive cash flow. And just like we discussed in our fourth quarter year-end call, are starting to notice things taking a turn for the better in our financial growth. Indeed, all of our fundamentals are pointing upwards. I will now turn the call back to Waqaas for his closing comments.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Thank you, John, for that report. In summary, there’s a lot to be excited for as we look into the future of Biotricity and the addressable markets that we are involved in. Our AI segment has begun to accelerate. We’ve strengthened relationships with Amazon and Google, validating our position, leadership and commitment to AI development into remote cardiac care. In the future, we envision our cardiac AI models’ capacities will empower us to assist healthcare experts and efficiently managing a significantly higher patient load, while discerning the most vital data points so that we can enhance disease profiling, improve patient management, and revolutionize the healthcare industry by centralizing these data points for disease prevention. Looking towards the rest of calendar year 2023, our focus remains threefold to increase sales of our remote cardiac monitoring devices and suite of products, ramp of our subscription-based service and accelerate our recurring revenue, and as such, draw a clear path to profitability. That concludes our opening remarks. I’ll now turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin Dede: Hi Waqaas, thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. Nice to see the sales ramp up. I was wondering if we could dig into the top line a little bit commentary that you and John offered and some digging suggests that that device sales and fee revenue pretty consistent measure the mix, but what isn’t clear are the types of devices that are dominating the device sale mix and the relative service fees that you’re seeing on those specific devices.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Yes. Great question, Kevin. I mean, we aren’t really breaking that down yet. We will I think in future quarters what I can tell you is that the bulk of the revenue is still Bioflux. We have Biotres coming up. We – and I will refer you back to I think the press release that we did back a couple months ago where we broke out how much of that revenue in terms of SaaS revenue was related to Bioflux and Biotres. But that mix is still about the same. And of course, Biotres in your product has only been around for a year. Bioflux has been around for four years, so it’s still going to make up the bulk of that revenue. But it is going to as the other products pick up rates and they become more available in the market. And as time goes on, they’ll become a better mix. And that’s when we will start like breaking that information out and making it clear because it’s still early days for some of these products and we want to make sure that we have a handle on it internally before we start talking about exactly, which one relates to what.\nKevin Dede: Okay. Fair enough. Appreciate that. The past couple of calls Waqaas you’ve really sort of centered in on the ability to deliver AI enhanced solutions. And I’m wondering in the – in this era of cost containment, how you’re emphasizing your R&D expenditures, vis-à-vis what had been a strategic imperative of expanding your product portfolio to address ancillary cardiac issues such as nephrology. So I was just wondering if you could just sort of help us think about where you’re putting your development emphasis.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Yes. Absolutely. So what we’ve done is, so we – as you know, we’ve launched a bunch of products in the last six months to nine months, right, grown our TAM and we’ve been really focusing that development effort has already been sunk in and we’ve already invested those dollars. So now we want to see the fruits of that, right, as those products become commercialized, for a longer period of time, we’re going to see more of that revenue come in, right? In the meantime, we are focusing on two things in terms of our R&D dollars, right? One is, in the automation perspective and in terms of cost management like you identified, we’re focusing on stuff that is enhancing ultimately the product, right? So we can expand the product and go faster. So there’s still product related, right? So when we took – take a look at what can we automate from workflow perspective and where can we apply AI, some of the improvements that we’re seeing on the margin side, some of the stuff that we’re seeing on the expense reduction side is directly related to efficiencies that we are applying within the existing product portfolio, right? And so taking AI, taking automation, applying it to enhance the workflows and provide better support and better data into our existing products so that they are effectively operating at a more efficient level, right? One area that we’re investing R&D dollars into, and why we do that is because it’s direct drive, right? We know if we spend X number of dollars, there’s a measurable result that we will get, meaning our cost reduction will go down, right? So when we’re thinking about an initiative that we have, we’re saying, hey, if we do x, right, if we implement this automation and this is a practical example, we know that our COGS will come down by 3%, right? So that’s something that is a direct drive, and we know what that 3% means and we know what that cost means, okay? Then the other area that we’re looking at for R&D is we are continuing to invest in areas, and of course, we’re looking for last call I talked about our NIH grant, right, so when we talk about nephrology and some of these other areas, we’re looking at areas that, again, how can we collect low hanging fruit revenue and where we can take our technology, enhance it, and then apply it in another market, right? And where we can, we will go in and try to find grants or R&D projects or work with universities and see where we can, of course further reduce that cost, but it’s very – the investment on the R&D is very much driven directly by, okay, how can we commercialize or how can we increase revenue or how can we apply the product in a market where we know that we can get direct drive revenue from? So it’s a very focused approach in our R&D, because now that we’ve built the platform before we had a – and the vision was building the platform, we invested dollars for two years to build that platform. That platform is now built. Now it’s about enhancing and applying it in areas where we know we can get revenue back from.\nKevin Dede: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate the color on that. Now, a little on the business development, I always go back to this topic. You mentioned coverage of 35 states. I’m wondering if you are comfortable sharing what your targets are for the balance of the fiscal year, just so we can sort of keep an eye on that. Or if you’re more comfortable maybe offering the number of physicians you hope to address or the number of clinics, some sort of quantifiable measure that we can monitor.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Yes. So we’re not usually providing the guidance on that stuff. What I can say is – what we are seeing is we’re announcing as we grow that network and as we optimize that network, I mean, obviously our goal is to have 50 state exposure, and I would say in some parts, because we’ve added distribution relationships that we do have that presence. But what we’ve been really focusing now on is, of course, building out our sales force, making sure that the key markets, we’ve addressed the key markets. And I think what’s going to happen, and we will certainly announce this when we have a veteran on it, which is to say, okay, as we build out these distribution relationships, we will put concerted effort in trying to march towards 50 states. So distribution partners have people in, they essentially have 50 state coverage. But when you do a distribution partner of size, you have to work with different groups within that division and different reps. And for us, we focus on areas where we’re not covered. So I think what we will, what we can say, and how I can answer it is that, look for us over the next couple of quarters that as we work with some of the relationships that we’ve made, how going to expand that state coverage, and we will announce that and notify everybody. And our goal, of course, is to get to 50 states as quickly as possible and focusing our primary, like our direct sales efforts in the areas that we have the most opportunity.\nKevin Dede: Okay. Couple of financial questions, maybe John, will chime into. The gross margin, absolutely great sequential progress on that. I’m wondering how you think we should see it from a sustainable perspective. Is I know John mentioned approaching, I think, the – like the 70% margin, I think I understood that. I’m just wondering what sort of time frame we might expect that to happen.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: So I think the piece that is happening is that before we weren’t even identifying this stuff. So as you see that we get a handle on these things, we’re going to provide more and more color. The thing is, as we’ve announced in the last few press release, our revenue mix of SaaS versus device sales – device sales have a different margin and SaaS has had consistent margin, right, of between 70-ish percent. So we will start announcing that and in terms of how long will it be, I would say that eventually, I think once you are 99% of your revenue being SaaS-related and 1% being device, essentially your margin steady state rate is going to be your SaaS rate. We still have about 9% or something around that revenue that we have to build up towards on the SaaS side to get to that steady state. And can we predict and tell you when we expect to do that? I would say no, but I think that going from now forward, every quarter, we will announce that mix. And you will see that margin creep closer to that as a steady-state margin.\nKevin Dede: Okay. On the – just on the OpEx side, cost controls – and you eliminated almost $1 million of OpEx from the March quarter. I’m wondering if you think this reduced expense level is sustainable?\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: So what we’ve done, and I think that this is a fantastic quarter, and I think it’s going to be indicative of what we are doing going forward. so cost-cutting, I wouldn’t call it about cost-cutting, what we have done is we have optimized our operations to focus on a commercial team, which is focusing purely on sales. And a corporate team, which is focusing on account management and operations and delivering services at a certain efficiency level. We grew to a size and everybody, there’s these always milestones for companies, and they are I think, milestones for reasons. And we achieved a milestone, which we were at a $10 million revenue run rate and it allowed us to basically look at the organization and apply more processes and procedures. So moving forward, the ratios that we are seeing that are in this past quarter, we expect to be able to continue those. But if we’re growing, our costs and our expenses are going to grow, but the ratios we expect to be maintained. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Gentlemen, we’ll turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.\nWaqaas Al-Siddiq: Thank you, everybody, for joining our conference call. If there are any other questions that pop up or if you guys have any other information that you are looking for, please feel free to reach out to us, we are always available. You can reach us via our website or through e-mail or through LinkedIn or any of our social channels. Thank you again, and we’re very excited about the rest of the year.\nJohn Ayanoglou: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
