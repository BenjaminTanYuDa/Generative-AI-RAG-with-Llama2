[Operator Instructions] I’ll now turn the conference over to your host, Alexis Tessier, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nAlexis Tessier: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Hain Celestial's second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. On the call today are Wendy Davidson, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Lee Boyce, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During the course of this call, we may make forward-looking statements within the meanings of federal securities laws. These include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. These statements are based on our current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Please refer to our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and other reports filed from time-to-time with the SEC, as well as the press release issued this morning for a detailed discussion of the risks that could cause our results to differ from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement made today. We have also prepared a presentation, inclusive of additional supplemental financial information, which is posted on our website at Hain.com under the Investors heading. Please note that remarks made today will focus on non-GAAP or adjusted financial measures. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP results, are available in the earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call. This call is being webcast and an archive will be made available on the website. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Wendy.\nWendy Davidson: Thank you, Alexis, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. I will begin today's call by first reviewing our second quarter results, and then provide an update on the progress with our Hain Reimagined strategy to return the business to profitable growth. Lee will then review our financial results in more detail, along with our outlook for the year. We are pleased that our second quarter delivered sequential improvement from our first quarter as anticipated in revenue, gross margin, and adjusted EBITDA. Our international business segment continued its strong growth, led by pricing, distribution, and currency benefits, and our North American business segment improved revenue trends compared to our first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the first half came in ahead of our plan, but was down versus prior year due to lower volume and increased investments in marketing and SG&A, offset by both pricing and productivity. Lee will provide greater detail in his remarks.  We are making continued progress on the four pillars of our Hain Reimagined strategy, focusing our business in our five core categories and our five core geographies, progress in building our organizational capabilities to scale our brands and gain share, driving growth through innovation and channel expansion, and progress in generating fuel through working capital management and productivity savings to expand our margins and transform our business for sustained performance. This momentum contributed to the sequential improvement in both our top and bottom-line trends and is expected to drive growth in our second half. As we outlined on Investor Day, fiscal ‘24 is the foundational year of our multi-year transformation strategy. In the first half of the year, we prioritize execution against the focus and fuel pillars of our strategy, which will enable us to fund incremental investments in capabilities for the build pillar in the back half of the year to support accelerated growth. Let's look now at some highlights across the business for the second quarter. Our snack category dollar growth trends have improved since the start of the fiscal year, and I'm pleased with the momentum we are building. This improvement in trend occurred despite the first half strategic changes we made in our promotional strategy and channel mix, which resulted in short term impacts on our overall snacks category trends. Our largest snack brand, Garden Veggie snacks, grew dollar sales more than 3% in the second quarter across all customers, measured and non-measured. And Terra chips grew dollar sales 8% in the quarter, and grew units 5% and gained share. With channel expansion a key growth lever for our snacks brands, we are pleased to see our non-measured trends outpacing measured channels, and both non measured and C-store sales continuing to grow double digits. We are excited for our Flavor Burst innovation launch in the Garden Veggie brand that should further drive our revenue growth in the second half, which I'll elaborate on more shortly. In the Baby & Kids category, industry-wide organic formula supply shortages persisted from quarter one into quarter two. We continue to work with industry supplier partners, and I'm happy to report we have secured supply commitments that we expect to support double-digit year-over-year growth during the second half, and improved end market consumption by the fourth quarter. Excluding formula, our overall global Baby & Kids category continues to perform well. Earth's Best snacks and baby food are outperforming the total category, driven by pricing and distribution gains, with expansion into Canada this year. And our UK-based Ella's Kitchen brand grew net sales year-on-year, gaining share in e-commerce by optimizing online visibility and enhancing customer planning.  In our beverage category, we grew net sales year-over-year. Celestial Seasonings, the number one bagged herbal tea brand in North America, grew dollar sales in the most recent quarter, and gained share, driven by success in both brand-building with our Magic in your Mug campaign, and with innovation, with the continued performance of both Sleepytime melatonin and throat cooler. In the international segment, we grew non-dairy beverage net sales for the second consecutive quarter, driven by both private label and brand growth across our Lima and Nutumi brands. Our meal prep category grew net sales year-over-year, led by Spectrum Oils, MaraNatha nut butters, and Imagine Soup in North America, and branded soups, Hartley's Jams and jellies, as well as our private label grocery business in international. Spectrum Oils grew dollar sales by mid-single digits, driven by strong velocity. And our branded soup portfolio continued its strong momentum, with mid-single digit year-over-year growth, ahead of the category and gaining share. Our three international brands, New Covent Garden, Yorkshire Provender, and Cully & Sully, are the number one, two, and three leading fresh soup brands in the UK. Private label spreads showed continued strength, growing dollars by double digits and gaining share. In the plant-based category, the overall category continues to be challenged. However, it returned to growth in the UK in the latest quarter in frozen, where the majority of our plant-based meat-free sales come from. We have two leading meat free brands, Yves, the number one brand in Canada, and Linda McCartney Foods, the number two brand in the UK. Yves is performing better than category, resulting in both distribution and share gains, and we are seeing recovery in both branded and private label in the UK.  Lastly, we continue to concentrate on stabilizing our personal care business. While we acknowledge we still have progress needed, we delivered year-over-year net sales growth overall led by Alba suncare, Avalon Organics, and in Live Clean, a leading personal care brand in Canada. We're seeing growth in e-commerce and other non-measured channels, leading to non-measured growth for our overall portfolio, and we've made progress optimizing our manufacturing capacity utilization for improved efficiency. As Lee will outline, we will be pulling forward some of the Hain Reimagined initiatives originally planned in fiscal year ‘25 that will result in a top line drag to the personal care portfolio in the back half of this fiscal year, but enable us to accelerate key business mix improvements. Overall, we continue to be encouraged by the bright spots we're seeing across our five categories and our five geographies.  Turning to our Hain Reimagined progress, as we've said, fiscal ‘24 is the foundational year of our strategy. We're making great strides towards focusing our business, resetting our global operating model, enhancing critical capabilities across brand-building, channel expansion and innovation, and in implementing our fuel program. Our second quarter results demonstrate a marked improvement sequentially in year-over-year trends. This improvement is even more pronounced if you exclude the short-term impact of baby formula. This reinforces confidence that our Hain Reimagined strategy is on track as we begin to deliver on our promise of returning our company to profitable growth. As a reminder, Hain Reimagined is built upon four strategic pillars, focus, grow, build, and fuel. Starting with the focus pillar, we've made great progress in simplifying our business and aligning our global teams and functions to support a high-performance culture. We recently welcomed a new Chief People Officer, Amber Jefferson, to our global executive leadership team. Amber will be instrumental in building out our people strategy to enable our high-performance culture and a strong pipeline of talent to help us deliver on our full potential. During the quarter, we also made strong progress on streamlining our footprint as well, opening our right-sized headquarter in Hoboken, New Jersey, consolidating our sales offices in Europe, and continuing to optimize capacity utilization in our manufacturing facilities across both meat-free and personal care. The rollout of our agile working model to leverage our hub and spoke footprint is delivering on our high-performance culture objectives. In the past 12 months, our applications are up 300% on fewer job openings, and applications are up 500% with women. Our turnover remains below industry average, and our engagement scores improved by 8%. Looking ahead to the balance of the year, we will be pulling forward several focus pillar initiatives designed to establish a winning portfolio of SKUs, streamline our operations, and simplify our geographic footprint. These initiatives are an important step towards eliminating complexity in our business, allowing us to concentrate our resources more effectively on the areas where we have the greatest right to win.  Under our growth pillar, our goal is to drive share gains across our core snack, Baby & Kids, and beverage platforms. These platforms have gained incremental distribution across mass and grocery channels, reinforcing our confidence that this momentum will continue to build throughout the year and support our pivot to growth in the back half. Our build pillar is centered on brand building, channel expansion, and innovation. As we mentioned previously, we're driving improved marketing efficiency through a reshaping of working and non-working media, and leveraging both paid and earned media to drive brand awareness and reach. We launched our Hain agile and amped brand building model globally, and began to ramp up brand campaigns in the first half of the year for Celestial Seasonings with Magic in your Mug, and the beloved Sleepytime bear, and targeted marketing on Greek Gods yogurt. We've begun to leverage global platform insights and campaigns for our leading Baby & Kids brands, Earth's Best with good food made fun in North America, and eat, play fun for Ella's Kitchen in the UK. Our improved effectiveness in our brand building spend will drive more from our core products and brands, and also support new innovation launch success.  For innovation, we continue to enhance our capabilities and pipeline, working to leverage key insights to develop breakthrough, scalable innovation. Our recent launch of Garden Veggie Flavor Burst tortilla chips is a prime example. Created from consumer research, highlighting a gap in the Better-for-you snacking segment, Flavor Burst fills the better-for-you tortilla chip void by combining the craveable flavors of Nacho Cheese and Zesty Ranch, with wholesome ingredients, including non-GMO corn and colorful veggies, with no artificial flavors and no artificial preservatives. Consumer testing results have been outstanding, and we've received nearly 100% retailer acceptance in both the US and Canada. Flavor Burst will hit the market with strong initial ACV, and we expect distribution to build based upon retailer commitments, setting Flavor Burst up to be the strongest innovation launch in recent company history. We're supporting the launch through a robust omnichannel activation, leveraging our agile and amped brand building model to drive awareness, trial, and repeat purchase, both on shelf and online. Flavor Burst tortilla will be a strong driver of our year-on-year second half growth in this next category. To support the strong launch, you will see a sequential increase in marketing investment in quarter three. In addition to innovation, we are strengthening our channel expansion capabilities in both away from home and e-commerce. As our new teams scale up, we are pleased to see our C-store sales up 15% in the quarter, driven by our snacks business, which was up 18%. Further, in January, we expanded snacks distribution to more than 10,000 C-stores. Increasing our store count in this margin-accretive channel by double digits. And Garden of Eatin has had several significant wins in commercial restaurants, helping drive both revenue and reach. On the e-commerce side, we are pleased to see digital sales penetration at our unified commerce retailers growing and outpacing grocery category averages. Brand building, innovation, and channel expansion are key drivers of our pivot to growth in the back half of the year.  Our last pillar is fuel, which is designed to unlock efficiencies across our business to fund our growth and drive margin expansion. Our productivity pipeline, as measured by cost savings initiatives and our manufacturing operations, is robust and on track to deliver our targeted savings to offset inflation within the year. Our revenue growth management initiatives are on track for fiscal ‘24 expected savings, largely in trade and non-trade efficiencies, net price realization, and price tech architecture. Our working capital initiatives are also on plan to reach fiscal ‘24 targets. We have approximately 80% of our payables targets committed to date, and our raw and pack inventory is over 20% lower than a year ago, and our finished goods remain below the expected seasonal build for the first half, better than we projected on the last earnings call. We are continuing to unlock value through our fuel program, which will facilitate reinvestment in the business and the return to growth in the back half of the fiscal year. I'm excited that we've made strong progress in our fuel initiatives and for our plan to deliver continued sequential improvement in our business and year-on-year growth in quarter three and quarter four. With formula supply recovery, distribution gains and innovation and channel expansion and continued momentum in our international regions, we have many reasons to believe in our outlook for a pivot to growth in the back half, in spite of the challenging macroeconomic environment.  Before I hand the call over to Lee, I want to thank the entire Hain team for their dedication, their passion, and their hard work. As we've reimagined Hain Celestial and redefined the future of better-for-you purpose-driven brands, our global team has played a pivotal role in putting new plans into action, coming together to grow our brands, our business, our impact, and our people. I want to thank them for their continued commitment to lead with purpose, to live our Hain values, and to demonstrate possibility thinking.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Lee.\nLee Boyce: Thank you, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. Q2 delivered a sequential improvement in both top line and bottom-line performance versus Q1. This was driven by the focus on fuel pillars of Hain Reimagined, and establishes the pathway to continue to deliver sequentially improving growth rates as we move through the balance of the year. Consolidated net sales for the second quarter were flat versus the prior year period at $454 million, an improvement sequentially from the first quarter decrease of 3.3% year-over-year. Organic net sales for the second quarter, adjusted to exclude the effects of divestitures and discontinued brands, increased 0.2% versus the prior year period, an improvement sequentially from the 2.9% year-over-year decrease in the first fiscal quarter. Organic net sales growth in the second quarter reflects an approximately two percentage point benefit from foreign exchange. The increase in organic net sales was driven by sales growth in the international segment, offset by lower sales in the North America segment, as expected. Formula was a 2% drag on organic net sales growth in the quarter.  We delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $47 million versus $50 million in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.4% as compared to 11% in the prior year period. Adjusted gross margin was 23.5% in the second quarter, an increase of approximately 60 basis points versus the prior year period. The increase was driven by pricing and productivity savings, partially offset by deleverage on lower sales volume, and by cost inflation. For full fiscal year ‘24, we anticipate gross margin to show an improvement of 50 to 100 basis points versus the prior year. SG&A increased 2.2% year-over-year to $74 million, representing 16.3% of net sales for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher marketing expense and people-related expenses on the reinstatement of bonus accrual, as expected. Looking ahead, we expect to ramp up marketing spend in the third quarter in support of our Flavor Burst launch, and additional programming in the back half of the fiscal year on our priority brands. During the second quarter, we took charges totaling $31 million associated with actions under the restructuring program, including contract termination costs, asset write-downs, employee-related costs, and other transformation-related expenses. Of these charges, $21 million were non-cash.  Interest costs for the second quarter rose, 49% to $16 million, due to the higher variable interest on the unhedged portion of our debt, partially offset by lower outstanding borrowings. As a reminder, we have hedged our rate exposure on approximately 50% of our loan facility with fixed rates at 5.6%, and remain keenly focused on driving down net debt over time. All of these factors combined to reduce net loss for the quarter of $14 million or $0.15 per diluted share, compared to net income of $11 million or $0.12 per diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted net income, which excludes the effect of restructuring charges, amongst other items, was $11 million or $0.12 per diluted share versus $18 million or $0.20 in the prior year period.  Now, turning to our individual reporting segments. In North America, reported net sales decreased 5.2% year-over-year to $268 million in the second quarter. Organic net sales decreased by 4.8% versus the prior year period due to a sales volume decline in Baby & Kids, which is a function of continued industry-wide challenges in organic baby formula supply, as previously discussed, and lower sales in snacks, as we shifted our promotional strategy and optimized our channel mix for improved trade efficiency and profitability. This was partially offset by growth in beverages. Formula was a 3% drag on organic net sales in the quarter. Second quarter adjusted gross margin in North America was 24.8%, a 40-basis point decrease versus the prior year period, driven by deleverage on lower sales volume and cost inflation, partially offset by pricing and productivity savings. Adjusted EBITDA in North America was $31 million, an 18.9% decrease versus the prior year period. And adjusted EBITDA margin was 11.7%, a 190 basis point decrease from the prior year period. These year-over-year declines resulted from lower volume, inflation, and marketing investments, partially offset by productivity.  In our international business, reported net sales demonstrated continued strength, increasing 8.5% to $186 million in the second quarter. Organic net sales growth was also 8.5%. This reflects 5.8 percentage points of growth from FX. As Wendy mentioned earlier, our growth was primarily driven by meal prep, including private label and branded jams and jellies, private label meat-free and our branded soups brands, and non-dairy beverage growth. International adjusted gross margin was 21.6%, up approximately 260 basis points year-over-year, driven by pricing, partially offset by inflation. International adjusted EBITDA was $26 million, a 35% increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by pricing, partially offset by lower volumes in inflation. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.9%, up approximately 270 basis points versus the prior year period. Now, shifting to cashflow and the balance sheet, we generated second quarter cash from operating activities of $21 million, versus $3 million a year ago. The higher operating cash resulted from continued working capital management, including our accounts payable optimization and inventory management initiatives tied to the fuel pillar of Hain Reimagined. CapEx was $6 million in the quarter, and we now expect expenditures to be in the mid-40s for fiscal 2024. Finally, we closed the quarter with cash on hand of $54 million and net debt of $756 million, translating into a net leverage ratio of 4.2x as calculated under our amended credit agreement. We drove leverage lower than we have previously projected due to better cash flow on momentum from our fuel initiatives. Paying down debt and strategically investing in the business, continue to be our priorities for cash utilization. Consistent with our stated priorities for cash, we have reduced net debt by $91 million since the end of Q1 2023. And as we have previously indicated, our long-term goal is to reduce balance sheet leverage to 3x adjusted EBITDA or less. Turning to our outlook, we are making early progress against Hain Reimagined, especially in the delivery of fuel as planned in this foundational year of the restructuring program. We have accelerated some of the initiatives outlined in the focus pillar, primarily portfolio and channel mix improvements. This is expected to create a near-term revenue headwind as we rationalize lower margin SKUs and sales. As a result, we believe it is prudent to take a more conservative view of the balance of fiscal 2024. In addition, we expect less of a tailwind from foreign exchange than when we initially provided guidance in August. Considering these factors, as well as performance year-to-date, we are adjusting our guidance for the full year. On the bottom line, we delivered better results versus expectations through Q2 year-to-date. However, as previously stated, a tenet of Hain Reimagined is to link our brand-building innovation and channel expansion investments to the supporting generation of investment fuel. Consequently, the over-delivery in the first half of fiscal year 2024 will be utilized in the second half to step up investments to drive longer term volume growth and margin expansion.  Our revised fiscal 2024 guidance is as follows. We expect organic net sales growth of approximately 1% or more year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA to be between $155 million and $160 million, and free cash flow of $40 million to $45 million, which now reflects 2024 costs associated with Hain Reimagined. Our 2024 guidance assumes that first, currency exchange rates will not materially change from today's rates, resulting in an approximately one point net sales benefit from foreign exchange. This compares to an approximately two-point net sales benefit when we gave guidance in August. Second, net pricing will recover most of the expected cost inflation as we continue to make progress on revenue growth management initiatives. And finally, the productivity will drive gross margin expansion and fuel investments. Lastly, we are now projecting the annual effective income tax rate to be 32% to 33%. This is primarily as a result of a shift in the geographical mix of earnings, the associated impact related to global intangible low tax income, and limitations on certain deductions. While we are not providing specific guidance for the fiscal third quarter, we do want to provide some color on the shape of the balance of the year. In keeping with our expectation of momentum building throughout the year, we anticipate organic net sales growth in the third fiscal quarter to be greater than that in the fiscal second quarter, and organic net sales growth in the fiscal fourth quarter to be greater than that in the fiscal third quarter. Similarly, we expect continued sequential improvement in adjusted EBITDA growth rates.  Now, I turn back to Wendy for closing remarks.\nWendy Davidson: Thank you, Lee. Amid our company's transformation, we remain committed to driving positive change for people, communities, and the planet through better-for-you brands. Making a positive impact on the world around is core to our Hain company purpose. To that end, we're proud to share that we will soon be publishing our annual global impact report, which outlines the progress we are making towards our goals for healthier people, healthier products, and a healthier planet. You'll be able to access the report and learn more on our company website. I am encouraged that we are continuing to report sequential improvements and fuel generation through our Hain Reimagined strategy. As we outlined on Investor Day, our approach will be to pay as we go to generate fuel and reinvest in the business to deliver profitable growth and margin expansion. This is a multi-year strategy to transform the business, and we'll continue to balance the pacing and prioritization to deliver steady progress to our goals. We are pleased to see the second quarter demonstrate our progress made and the momentum in our business. The accelerating trends, coupled with recent innovation and distribution gains across growth categories, give us confidence that we will pivot to growth in the back half of the year. And the progress we're making in our fuel program, will enable us to reinvest in the business to get the flywheel spinning and to realize our potential as a growth leader in better-for-you brands. We firmly believe the best is yet to come, and appreciate you joining the call today. Thank you for your interest and for your continued support. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Salera: Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Wendy, I wanted to double-click a little bit on the snacking growth. It seems like this data that we have visibility in with the track channels, don't really capture the full picture. And so, if we think about the back half of the year, can you just maybe break out how much of the growth you expect to come from recovery and track channels from what we can see versus distribution gains/just organic sales growth in on-track channels.\nWendy Davidson: Yes, I appreciate the question. And as we said, when we leaned into Hain Reimagined on Investor Day, we were going to be driving disproportionate growth in channel expansion, especially in our snacks category. It's important to remind, there were two big drivers in the snack category in the front half of the year. In quarter one, we had an impact in Terra because we made some decisions in optimizing promotion spend and in channel mix. And so, that was a quarter one impact. Pleased to say that we actually saw Terra in growth in quarter two in both dollar sales, as well as unit growth. In Garden Veggie, it was the opposite. We had good growth in quarter one. We made some choices in promotional shift, and again, some optimization around promotional spend in our RGM initiatives that impacted Garden Veggie straws, or the Garden Veggie brand in quarter two. Really pleased that the distribution gains we've had in non-measured, so we mentioned in the earlier remarks that we now have our snacks brands in 10,000 C-stores starting in January. We obviously have the Garden Veggie Flavor Burst launch that takes place right now, and we're beginning to see some momentum even in our measured channels in the latest four weeks. So, I think the combination of cleaning up our promotional activity, leaning on our channel mix, and the work that we're seeing on TDPs, as well as velocity, combined with innovation and channel expansion in the back half, give us confidence in the snack portfolio.\nJim Salera: Great, and maybe a follow up on the channel expansion. As you guys enter a channel where you've been underpenetrated in the past, is it kind of a, you have to prove that the products can work, and so you come in with one or two SKUs, and then give the retailer a trial period to see if they want to add more? Or should we think of, there's already kind of a plan in place that we should see distribution ramp in untracked channels as you guys introduce new products and get the promotional thing right-sized?\nWendy Davidson: It's a great question, and the thing that I think we have felt all along, we know that we have beloved consumer brands. They're just not able to find them everywhere. So, the opportunity for us isn't proving the viability of the products or the viability of the brand. It's making them more available to the consumer where they're shopping. We've had great retailer take rate in alt retail, in food service and in C-store. We're up double digits in - high double digits in all three of those away from home non-measured channels. That gives us a lot of confidence as we go forward, but I don't think that this is a need to prove it. It's a need to make it accessible and available to the consumer.\nJim Salera: Okay, great. Thanks, guys. I'll hop back in the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Good morning, everybody. So, Wendy, I guess I'd love to get a better sense, or maybe I'm just not clear yet on sort of what changed or what you're seeing in the market that's leading you to want to accelerate some of these focused pillar actions, and sort of what specific actions are really being accelerated. So, are there certain parts of the business, brands or categories, where you're accelerating the sort of SKU rationalization?\nWendy Davidson: Well, remember - well, good morning, Andrew, but remember what we said on Investor Day that we would need to pay as we go. So, as we unlock fuel, we would be able to lean into investments, but also some of the simplification work that we knew would be needed, things like the work that was done with Joya last year in international, we eliminated 50% of the SKUs in the Joya portfolio, and the brand grew double digits, so a harder working core assortment in the Joya brand. We’re taking a similar approach across the entire portfolio where we have a tail of SKUs that are both adding complexity into our end supply chain. It adds added inventory both in raw and pack and in finished, but it also adds maybe unproductive SKUs in the assortment for our retail partners. So, but that obviously when you do that kind of SKU rad, it's a top line drag, and it can also be a bottom line drag. So, we knew we were going to need to pace that a bit. Because we over-delivered EBITDA in quarter one and quarter two, it puts us in a position to both invest behind some of the brand building that we wanted to do. It allows us to accelerate the adding of some of the organizational capabilities that we want, think headcount in revenue growth management and in away from home on the commercial sales side of our business, but it also allows us to accelerate some of those simplification things in SKU and footprint that we may have planned in fiscal 2025 because we didn't think we'd be in a position to be able to do it. We're in a financial position to be able to do it in fiscal ’24. So, we're going to pull those forward into quarter four.\nLee Boyce: And so, maybe I can just build upon that a little bit. I mean, the other thing is we do distribute our products into 75 markets. As we simplify our focus, it is on five key markets. So, it is an opportunity for us as well just to simplify where we've got physical assets. So, that's come into account as well. Again, we will continue to distribute into kind of broader markets, but really focus on five key markets.\nAndrew Lazar: Got it. No, that's helpful. And then, Lee, just a follow-up for you. I think you said in your prepared remarks that 4Q organic sales growth would be greater than what we see in 3Q. And I'm just looking at it and just last year, right, the comparison in 3Q in terms of organic growth is far easier than in 4Q. So, I'm just curious, what are some of the things maybe you can remind us that are still expected to dampen organic sales growth in the third quarter that would make the fourth quarter organic sales growth better? Thank you.\nLee Boyce: Yes, I mean, so, so a couple of things. I mean, we've obviously got the ramp up of our new product initiative. Part of it is also just the pacing of our investments. So, we're investing, we're stepping up investment in Q3, and then that will kind of drive, and the focus in is driving that sequential improvement in volume. So, part of it is tied into kind of the pacing of our investments. And just as kind of as a reminder overall, we said we'd have a pay as you go model. So, with what we've delivered from an EBITDA perspective through the first half, that's given us the ability to then invest - increase that investment in Q3, and then we'll see that starting really coming through into the fourth quarter. \nWendy Davidson: Well, and let me add to that. Some of those distribution gains that we said that are coming certainly in this month, think C-store and some of the away from home, it takes time. And even Flavor Burst launch, it takes time for that to ramp up. So, we've assumed that we would fully realize some of that velocity in quarter four, but it takes some build time in quarter three. So, you see some of that around the timing of those as well.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf with C.L. King. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Wolf: Thank you. Good morning. On the North American snacks business, could you unpack for me the changes in the velocity, or just the total sales for Garden Veggie and Terra? It seems to go in the opposite direction sequentially between distribution changes and promotional cadence. So, I'm trying to - like Terra, like just observationally, I saw it being promoted pretty heavily, at least at Whole Foods. So, I'm trying to get a sense of, was there a non-pro promotion aspect to this versus off promotion previously? And also, with Terra - I mean, with Garden Veggie, there's so much of it sold through, or at least an appreciable amount sold through the club. Was there a change in any - a big change in the club distribution?\nWendy Davidson: Yes, well, as we mentioned actually in some of the guidance that we gave going into the fiscal year, quarter one would have some very specific drags, one of which would be Terra, because we were making a decision to reduce the depth and frequency of large promotions, particularly in the club channel on Terra. And that was going to have a quarter one impact. That allows us to have a much more stable distribution, but also promotional activity. And I would say, and I mentioned earlier, we've seen unit volume growth, as well as dollar growth in Terra in quarter two. And in the latest four weeks, we've seen double digit dollar growth, as well as our sales on promotion are about flat to where they've been. So, we've stabilized the promotion frequency and depth to be right-sized, I would say for Terra, and we can build from there. Garden Veggies a bit different, less so in channel mix, but much more around the promotional depth. In quarter two, we didn't pace the same promotions timing that we did a year ago. So, some of that you see as a year-on-year drag. Going into quarter three, strong distribution gains on Garden Veggie, both in measured and non-measured, but what we're most excited about obviously is innovation news coming in Garden Veggie that actually creates overall brand news for the entire franchise of Garden Veggie. So, it gives us confidence as we go into the back half. But what you saw in the front half is a little bit of some of the cleanup in our revenue growth management initiatives impacting both timing and depth of volume. That's just a timing issue year-on-year.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay, Wendy, thank you. That's very clarifying. And just the follow-up is also actually with the Veggie Burst launch. It sounds like the acceptance was strong. Did it - was the acceptance what you expected, or was it actually a little better? And if it was better, did that affect your marketing plan, or was it pretty much spot on and your marketing plan's the same, just with respect to the launch?\nWendy Davidson: Well, I would say - and I encourage you to order the product. You're going to love it. So, once we tasted the product and we saw the consumer research, we were very excited about it. To be honest, we expected to have large retailer acceptance, but I would say we are - we have almost 100% retailer acceptance across both Canada and the US. That gives us a lot of confidence as we go in. We've got a little bit more feature activity because of the strength of the launch that's probably a bit more than we planned. So, what we did was, as Lee said, we're leaning into the omnichannel marketing activity and that actually has us ramping up our investment in brand building in quarter three, which will be reflected as sort of the outlook that we have in the balance of the year, because we want to make sure that we're appropriately supporting the innovation for a successful launch, both for our retail partners and for us.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. With the understanding that the data that we get especially from some syndicated providers, does not really tell the whole story on Hain. Some of the numbers we're looking at would suggest perhaps that the lifts that Hain is getting on some of its promotions may not be quite as strong as the company had hoped. I was just curious if you could comment on that, A, is that valid? And if not, I'd love to hear it. And, B, if it is valid, can you talk a little bit more about the decision to kind of invest more in the business, understanding also that not all those investments are of the promotion type of course.\nWendy Davidson: Yes. Good morning, Ken. That's a great question and we're seeing the same data that you're seeing in measured channels, and I would say it depends on the brand. So, Terra has a very effective response to promotional activity, and that is allowing us to more effectively invest our trade behind Terra, both on feature and merchandising, as well as discounting of promotions that actually gets lift. So, feel very good about the plans that the team have on Terra and the response to that. Garden Veggie is a bit different. And what we're finding is that the frequency of our promotions is more important than the depth of those promotions, and having feature activity both in our snack portfolio in the UK and feature activity in the US, are really important in the snack category. So, as a part of our revenue growth management initiatives, the team is now using some really good data analytics to evaluate trade effectiveness, to make those adjustments, and then move forward. I feel better now because of those analytics that will allow us to increase the spend in the right way to move in the direction we need to, rather than a peanut butter approach across the trade. And that's what you'll see us reflecting as we go into the back half, is leaning into some of those ROI effectiveness decisions, rather than just leaning more dollars.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes on the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. Just wanted to come back to some of the channel expansion, and could you put the 10,000 new C-stores in context? I guess is that just the low hanging fruit and you feel like there's some more wood to chop? Have you kind of made the rounds and that's likely kind of the extent of the upside. How do you think about what the runway looks like there? And then you've touched on food service opportunities in the past. Maybe can you give an update of how that might be progressing as well?\nWendy Davidson: Yes, absolutely. Well, as we said on Investor Day and before, one of the reasons why we are very bullish on away from home and non-measured channels, especially for brands like ours, is we know that they're beloved by the consumer, but they're not available on the consumer sort of everyday shopping journey. It's making them more available and accessible. So, putting them within arm's reach of the consumer. To put it in in numbers, there's about 160,000 C-stores. So, putting it into 10,000 C-stores is a good move for us, but it's a starting move for us. In a retail environment, there's about 28,000 points of distribution for retail. For food service, there's about 2 million points of distribution. The dollars per point of distribution might be smaller, but they are then mentally available to the consumer. They're building the brand because you see them everywhere you're going. That's our goal is both to have it available when the consumer is in a big retail environment, but also to have it more aware as they're moving throughout their day, throughout their week. So, C-stores is a growth vehicle. We're seeing great growth, double-digit growth in the UK, as well as double-digit growth in the US, up 18% in snacks in the US alone in quarter two. In food service, we're up high double digits as we're getting some placements of brands like Garden of Eatin with commercial restaurant chains. We're getting some of our yogurt products and some of our Celestial Seasonings tea placed where they're on the consumers sort of moving throughout their day journey. So, we feel really, really good that we're getting early momentum in our away from home efforts.\nMichael Lavery: No, that's helpful. And just to follow up on some of the second half moving parts on the top line, can you give a sense for the SKU cuts or some of the geographic rationalization, just what either the timing or magnitude of that might look like. And similar for the Flavor Burst launch, just when we think about modeling in some of the pipeline fill and just to help us capture those pieces.\nLee Boyce: Yes. So, probably you're not breaking out all those pieces specifically, but if you just think about kind of the adjustments that we made, we said for example, after the original guidance we gave, there was a percentage point pulled down due to FX. So, that's one piece. Then the other pieces in there are obviously kind of the focus initiatives, as those are broken out. And I would say there is a kind of a bit of a third element in there is, we did see some kind of year-to-date performance deleveraging a little bit on some of the volume. So, I don't think we are going to break out those pieces specifically, but you've got a percentage point, and then you can see the focus initiatives in the pull-forward is the other kind of the key element there. \nWendy Davidson: And if you thought in terms of timing, I think was your question, we will see ramp up in Flavor Burst in quarter three, and really hit stride as we get into quarter four. On the simplification initiatives, I think you will see the majority of that hitting in quarter four. And as Lee said, if you looked at our original guidance of two to four, you figure out a point of that that we pulled back is from FX, that's different than what we originally planned, and I'd call it a point or two around the simplification is about how you'd look at that. I hope that helps.\nMichael Lavery: That's really helpful, yes. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Smith: Hi. Good morning, Wendy. I wanted to ask a follow-up to your previous response about the impact from the focus pillar actions, the rationalization of SKUs and channels. You were talking about the predominance of the one point reduction of top line guidance beyond the FX adjustments being tied to those focus initiatives and those being concentrated in the fourth quarter. So, should we think of that as a mid-single digit headwind to revenue growth as we look out into fiscal ‘25 as you annualize the fourth quarter impact into next year? And should we think about SKU rationalization then hitting a normal cadence, or should there be incremental focus pillar actions in fiscal ‘25 as well?\nWendy Davidson: Yes, I wouldn't look at it that way. We will feel it more discreetly in quarter four, but it won't continue to carry out into fiscal ‘25. These are things that we had actually built in and layered into Hain Reimagined. And if you recall on Investor Day, we said that as we generated fuel, we would throttle forward and back because we'd be in a position to be able to do so. As we saw the effectiveness of brand building, we would also throttle forward and back. This is allowing us to just pull forward some of the things around, think of cleaning up inventory, stranded inventory of raw and pack, of SKUs that no longer need to exist in the portfolio, getting rid of some inventory finished goods in some of the SKU rad. It's working it through the trade. At the same time, we would expect, similar to what we saw in Joya, that harder working core to grow better. So, it shouldn't be a straight one for one that carries on into the next year. It's something you'll feel discreetly in the quarter, and then you've got a better working core as we go into fiscal ‘25.\nLee Boyce: Sorry. Just to build on that. I mean, I think that is a key point. Just as a reminder, on the algorithm overall that was presenting Hsin Reimagined, it was 3% plus. But to Wendy's point, part of that is streamlining with this winning portfolio. So, as you make some of these SKU rationalizations, it will be flow back to some of our existing products.\nMatt Smith: Great. thank you very much. I appreciate the detail and I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Good morning. Wendy, I wanted to come back to your comments in the prepared remarks about headwinds in the macro environment. And I think historically, Hain typically leaned on a notion that the portfolio SKUs to higher income households. So, it it's more insulated from the macro. Is something changing in the environment, either with more discretion among higher income households, or are you seeing maybe less trade up from mainstream consumers even? I'm just trying to better understand the context and the impact of these macro headwinds for you.\nWendy Davidson: Yes, that's a great question. If you would've recalled maybe a year ago when I first joined, we were talking about the, historically you would've expected that natural and organic as a category, tended to outpace conventional. All of that flipped upside down during COVID when people gravitated back to conventional products, and in some cases supply chains made conventional more readily accessible. We were waiting to see that consumer behavior really revert back to expectation. Really pleased. You see this in the (Nielsen) data that we're beginning to see, I think in the middle of last year, calendar year, we started to see the consumer revert back to historical behaviors. But what changed was they still wanted natural and organic products, but they want them available in more places. So, they're not just going to specialty retail anymore. They're going to food and mass and away from home. That's a great opportunity for Hain. But we also have been evaluating the move from brand to private label. Happy to say in the US market, we don't see that. Europe is a different story. We've seen the consumer much more impacted economically in Europe, and that's affected consumer behavior, both in number of shopping trips, but also the size of the basket. We've also seen private label recover faster in our international business in the industry than the brand. That benefits Hain because we actually are both private label and brand, and we're seeing the recovery in our private label business faster than our branded business, but still outpacing category. That's why you see such strength in the international business, while North America is beginning to recover. And it actually I think is a great example of the value of our geographic diversification in our business because it gives us a geographic hedge as the consumer behaviors start to normalize.\nJohn Baumgartner: So, I mean, if I build on that and look at your salty snacks business in the US, I can appreciate the shift from promotional timing and the innovation you're ramping now, but I mean, baseline volumes have been down for the portfolio since like mid-2022. Is this - building on those comments, is this a situation where some of that baseline volume and consumption has gone from Nielsen channels into non-measured, and that sort of explains, I guess, the absence of more prominent velocity growth and baseline volumes in the portfolio? Or is there something else in salty snacks, in addition to innovation and promo, that needs to be tweaked to get better same-store sales and Nielsen data?\nWendy Davidson: Yes, I would tell you that if I look back at the early observations when I joined the company and what really led to some of our focus around Hain Reimagined, one is that you actually - we need to have a harder working core. We need to have an always on support around our brands. We need to make sure that we've got the right products on shelf and available where the consumer is shopping. And we need to have really meaningful innovation that we support both at launch, but we continuously support. What's different now than I think what you would've seen in 2022, some of the challenges were, financially the company wasn't in a position to continuously support with marketing and trade. We also had some significant supply chain disruption during that year, which pulled back a lot of promotional activity, and it also had our fill rates to the trade really below average. I'm really pleased to say that our fill rates and on-shelf availability in snacks is in top tier and has been for the last 12 months. We are in an always on promotional support and marketing support behind the brands, but we've invested in really good consumer and category insights to make sure that our campaigns are meaningful, our price pack architecture is accurate, and that our innovation is meaningful to take to the marketplace. So, I think what you should see from us is, I think natural organic products. The consumer wants those products and they love our brands. We are putting ourselves in position to be better able to run the portfolio and to drive the right kind of growth, not just episodic growth quarter-on-quarter, but to have some good momentum. And as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing actually really good dollar growth in Garden Veggie in the latest four weeks in measured channels. If you add in non-measured, it's even better. Terra Chips has actually really improved, especially in the latest four weeks, but we had unit movement in quarter two. So, I feel good about the snacks recovery and pivot to growth, but you would've seen a lot of historical noise in that.\nJohn Baumgartner: Thank you, Wendy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJon Andersen: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Two quick ones. There's been a ton of discussion rightly so about the snacks business. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about a couple of the other focus areas, Baby & Kids and beverages, whether that be second half recovery behind the maybe remedy of the formula shortage, which you referred to in the prepared comments, and more broadly around perhaps innovation and channel expansion, some of the demand driving initiatives that are part of Hain Reimagined. And then second, on gross margin for the year, I think you provided an updated outlook for 50 to 100 basis points of improvement. Could you remind us, is that a little, I think a little less than what you previously anticipated and what some of the puts and takes around that change are? Thank you.\nWendy Davidson: Yes, I'll cover the categories and then flip it over to Lee. From a category standpoint, as you mentioned, so our snacks category was off, call it mid-single digits in quarter two, total company. And that was really tracing to some of this move in promotional activity. Feel very confident as we go into the back half of the year because of what we're seeing in the latest four weeks. The baby category was off double digits in total for the organization. If you take out formula, the baby kids category was actually in growth, but formula was a significant drag. We have secured supply as well as incremental supply partners to ensure our availability to have that product in the back half. It will result in double-digit growth year-on-year in the back half of the year in the formula part of baby kids and get that entire category back to growth. The beverage category was up high single digits between both North America and International. International was led by non-dairy beverage. That's actually a great category for us to be in, and we're a leader in both private label and brand, with a really powerful portfolio there that continues to perform. You would've heard us talk a year ago about some of the capacity utilization in our plants. All of that has been addressed and we're running a solid operation five days a week. Really good capacity utilization with the ability to support our customers, and a much more diversified customer contract base. Meal prep was up high single digits across both markets, in North America, led by Spectrum and our nut butters and our soups, and in international by soups, as well as jams and jellies. So, that's a portfolio that continues to deliver. And then personal care was actually up almost 2% year-on-year as a total category, and that was led by both by Alba, Avalon Organics, and then Live Clean, which is a leading brand in Canada. So, we're seeing really good bright spots at a category level. I feel good that we know what's driving both snacks and baby kids, and those are short-term acute that we see improving trends as we've started quarter three that give us confidence in the back half. Lee? \nLee Boyce: Yes, so just answering your question on margin, we are seeing good margin improvement, but as you point out, we had previously indicated 100 to 200 basis points. We've now refined that to 50 to 100. So, a couple of elements there. We are seeing some plant costs deleveraging on the lower volumes versus our initial expectations. I'd say on the flip side, again, we are - and we've talked about this a number of times, we are seeing sequential improvements driven by Hain Reimagined initiatives, but again, a bit lower than our initial expectations. I'd say the second element is really some of the mix impact that we've seen. And a prime example of that is formula. We originally thought formula would only impact Q1, but it did also bleed into Q2. We have secured supply in the second half, but again the full year is not in line with our initial expectations. I think more kind of on the positive side, we are seeing the benefits of pricing come through and the focus to RGM initiatives. Wendy had talked to a number of those. So, those are driving strategic pricing opportunities. Overall, also our productivity pipeline is delivering. And then I'd just say the third thing, and it does tie in a bit with RGM as well is, we continue to evolve our trade strategy. So, we are seeing a step up in ROIs versus history. But again, kind of what has changed as we've looked and within this current year is kind of just the expectations on the volume and then some of the mix. We will see that improve as we move forward and again, as we make these investments and we get that sequential improvement in the top line. \nJon Andersen: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthonyVendetti: Thank you. Yes, most of the questions most of my questions have been answered, but I guess other than supply chain concerns or issues with baby formula, are there any other brands or SKUs that are dragging down just overall organic growth? And if so, are any of those brands or SKUs being - are you considering jettisoning them or shutting those down or selling those at this point? Or you’re still in the evaluation stage for some of those other brands that are maybe dragging down growth?\nWendy Davidson: Yes, thank you. I appreciate the question. We feel very good about the five categories of focus and the five geographies. What I would say is, as Lee mentioned earlier, in the five geographies, we want to make sure that that's where we are focusing our most efficient assets and footprint. We’ll still distribute beyond those five, but we really want to streamline where we've got a physical footprint. In the five categories, we feel very good about the categories we're in, that they are repertoire categories for the consumer, where they're looking for better-for-you brands and products to support healthier living. But it does mean that there's opportunities for us to ensure that we've got the hardest working portfolio in those five categories. So, we will continuously be looking at right SKUs, right assortment, right brand support that's going to deliver on that company promise, and it should be a regular part of portfolio hygiene in our business, and then we should be running and driving growth across the portfolio.\nAnthonyVendetti: Okay. Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call back over to CEO, Wendy Davidson, for closing remarks.\nWendy Davidson: Yes, I really appreciate everybody joining us today. We are pleased, as we said, with the progress that we're making in this foundational year of our strategy and the sequential improvement. We feel really good about the momentum that we have going into the back half and the fuel that we've generated in the front half to enable us to be able to pull forward some of our initiatives as we go into the back half of the year. Quarter two demonstrated sequential improvement, and that's what we were looking for. We're excited to pivot to growth in the back half. And again, I want to thank everybody for joining us, but also thank our Hain team for their passion and commitment.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Alexis Tessier. Thank you, you may begin.\nAlexis Tessier: Good morning, and thank you for joining us on Hain Celestial's first quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call.

Reconciliations of non-GAAP to the nearest GAAP financial measures are available in the earnings release and the slide presentation accompanying this call. This call is being webcast and an archive will be made available on the website.  And now I'd like to turn the call over to Wendy.\nWendy Davidson: Thank you, Alexis, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining the call today. I'll begin by reviewing our fiscal first quarter results. I'll then provide a high-level overview of our Hain Reimagined strategy, which we introduced at our Investor Day in September, followed by an update on the early progress we've made. We will then review our financial results in more detail, along with our outlook for fiscal 2024. I'm pleased to report our first quarter results that deliver our second consecutive quarter of Promises Made, Promises Kept. Organic net sales were in line with our guidance of down low single digit, and adjusted EBITDA came in ahead of our expectations. As we said previously, with Hain Reimagined, we will invest as we go. So starting in quarter two and over the balance of the year, we plan to utilize the over-delivery from quarter one to invest back in the business. This is consistent with our stated plan to fund our strategy as we unlock fuel through accelerated growth and efficiencies. As we highlighted previously, the net sales decline in the first quarter was driven predominantly by baby & kids. On our last earnings call, we described headlines that we expected to face in the first quarter, the largest being baby formula, but the entire industry has experienced supply constraints. While we are working closely with industry partners to accelerate availability and bring on additional supply, we are now expecting these challenges in supply to continue into the second quarter, and to begin to recover sometime in the second half of the year.  Excluding the formula supply challenge, we are seeing progress across the business driven by our strategic focus on brand building, channel expansion, and innovation. We've leveraged our portfolio across better-for-you categories and gained distribution across platforms in grocery retail. We are making notable progress in away-from-home channels like convenience, colleges and universities, and the travel segment, which are margins accretive portfolio and provide expanded brand visibility. I will provide more details on this in a few minutes. As we've mentioned before, it is important to note that some of the bright spots in our growth may not be as clearly visible to you if you only view US syndicated consumption data. As a reminder, approximately 40% of our business is in International, and in North America, 35% to 40% of our business is in unmeasured channels. As we lean into our channel expansion strategy, this will become more pronounced. I'll now review some of the positive momentum from the first quarter. In better-for-you snacks, our non-measured snack sales were up 18% in dollars in the 12 weeks ending October 8, led by Garden Veggie. We are driving growth in Garden Veggie primarily through strength in club as well as in e-commerce and away-from-home. As we execute on our strategy for channel expansion, we have gained incremental distribution in the away-from-home channel within segments like colleges and universities, travel and convenience stores. In better-for-you baby & kids, Earth’s Best continues to demonstrate robust growth of 12% in dollars in the last 12 weeks, excluding formula, supported by strong retailer partnerships and share gains in baby food and purees. Innovation in snacks and our investment in the brand building campaign Good Food Made Fun are helping drive Earth’s Best snacks up low single digits in dollars and a 20% expansion at total distribution points. In better-for-you beverages, Celestial Seasonings bagged tea grew 1.3% in dollars in the latest 12 weeks, with both dollar and unit velocity pacing ahead of the category, and we gained share across both herbal and wellness segments. Our brand building investments are delivering us clients with the successful Magic in Your Mug campaign launched in the back half of fiscal 2023, and we have strong customer acceptance confirmed on innovation, including Sleepytime melatonin and throat cooler. Our International non-dairy beverage segment continues to gain momentum, building upon positive performance in June and growing 10.6% in the first quarter. The return to growth is being led by our private label business, but we are also seeing momentum in parts of our branded portfolio. Natumi was up 13% in the quarter. As we mentioned on Investor Day, we believe our portfolio combination of strong brands and private label in this category is an advantage for Hain across Europe.  Within better-for-you meal prep, Greek Gods Yogurt continued its standout performance in the US of 7% in dollars in the latest 12 weeks on increased velocity. Growth internationally in meal prep was led by the UK, where we continue to benefit from our portfolio, which spans both branded and private label.  Private label is historically a larger mix in the U.K., with over 40% of its unit share compared to mid-teen category share in the U.S. We are well positioned and see strong growth within discounters and private label internationally as the consumer responds to the macro environment. Our private label jams and spreads are both up double digits, gaining share in the latest 12 weeks.  And on the branded side, our Hartleys jams and all of our marmalade brands also grew double digits in the latest 12 weeks and picked up share in their respective categories. Also in the meal prep category, our soup brands continue to perform well, of 15% in dollars in the last 12 weeks, gaining 200 basis points of share. Our Cully & Sully, Yorkshire Provender, and New Covent Garden brands all grew double digits.  As you may recall from our Investor Day, these brands, these three brands, are the number one, number two, and number three in the category in this market, and these results are well before we hit the peak soup season. We are also seeing encouraging signs of stabilization in our global meat-free category. We continue to believe in the long-term growth potential of the global meat-free category as consumers are seeking veg-forward, flexitarian, and vegetarian options that deliver on taste and convenience. As we see consolidation in this category, consumers are returning to leading brands in this space. Our Yves brand, the number one meat-free brand in Canada, is gaining share despite category softness. We are up 270 basis points in fresh and 70 basis points in frozen in the last 12 weeks. In the UK, our Linda McCartney brand is seeing increased velocities in frozen of 20% in the latest 12 weeks with distribution of 12%. We are excited about our upcoming meat-free innovation, Linda's Best Burger, which will hit UK supermarkets in the spring. In the better-for-you personal care, we continue to focus on stabilizing this business. We are seeing some encouraging signs with our personal care business growing 6% in the quarter in the e-commerce channel. In addition, personal care grew in the drug channel of 70% on total distribution point growth of 160% in the latest 12 weeks.  Across the business, our performance trends are more favorable in unmeasured channels than measured channels, driven by strengths in our better-for-you snacks portfolio. Given recent distribution gains, however, we are beginning to see measured channel trends also improve as store shelf resets begin to take shape for both snacks and tea.  We are pleased to see the first quarter performance in line with our expectations, and we are reaffirming our full fiscal year guidance. I'm now excited to share some of the early progress we're making in executing our Hain Reimagined transformation strategy. At our Investor Day in September, we introduced Hain Reimagined, our strategy to pivot the business to profitable growth. It was wonderful to see so many of you there. Hain Reimagined represents a bold transformation of our business and is built upon four strategic pillars, focus, growth, build, and fuel. We are focusing our winning portfolio of brands around five consumer centric global platforms, snacks, baby & kids, beverages, meal prep, and personal care. And we will simplify our footprint in five core markets, the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, and Europe. Our growth pillar will drive brand strength, share gains, and channel expansion in three of our core better-for-you platforms, snacks, baby & kids, and beverages. We are building and enhancing critical capabilities to execute our growth plan, including improving brand building, accelerating innovation, and driving channel expansion, particularly in e-commerce and away-from-home, which has historically been underdeveloped at Hain.  And as we unlock efficiencies across our business, we are reinvesting those savings to fuel our growth plan while also expanding our margins. We are operating with an improved discipline in revenue growth management, executing initiatives against working capital, and driving end-to-end operational efficiency. Our plan is designed to deliver a compelling and achievable long-term financial algorithm with attractive shareholder returns.  The plan represents a material transformation of our P&L, influencing our pipeline growth, and driving margin improvement. Our long-term financial algorithm seeks to achieve at least a 3% organic net sales growth CAGR through fiscal ’27, with at least a low double digit EBITDA CAGR, achieving at least a low double digit EBITDA margin by fiscal year ’27. As you heard us say on Investor Day, this is our commitment, not our aspiration. And I'm excited that we're already seeing encouraging early momentum from our Hain Reimagined strategy.  Under the build pillar, we have made notable progress on expansion into margin accretive channels. We've enhanced our away-from-home capability with new, experienced industry leadership and dedicated expertise to drive growth in this important growing channel. We are pleased to share that our convenience store sales grew 14% in the last 12 weeks, driven by our snack business, which was up 18% in dollars on 10% incremental total distribution points.  In addition, we have gained incremental placement with our snack brands in North America across travel, restaurants, on-the-go retail, colleges and universities, and convenience stores. We also have plans to expand and away-from-home in the UK, which is off to a good start with soup launching in a large restaurant chain in the first quarter. E-commerce continues to be a growth area for us, accounting for nearly 10% of company sales in the first quarter. We have established a dedicated team to drive omni-channel and e-commerce and provide greater focus and support for expanding into this margin accretive channel. We are making our brands more accessible to consumers away-from-home and online, increasing brand reach and visibility at the same time. Hain has been a market leader in better-for-you for over 30 years, so we understand the evolving needs for our consumers. As we mentioned on Investor Day, we are building out our innovation capabilities and pipeline, working to develop breakthrough, scalable innovation, leveraging key insights from our global platforms and across geographies. And we are improving both our launch capabilities and our support post launch.  We now have better visibility into our innovation pipeline across our key categories and are excited about our innovation experience center that we are building out at our new global headquarters location in Hoboken, New Jersey. To that end, we are looking forward to introducing new and disruptive innovation for our better-for-you snacks platform in the third quarter. And while we can't share details quite yet, we will be supporting the launch by activating our agile and amped brand building model designed to deliver fully integrated omni-channel campaigns that drive awareness, trial, and repeat purchase, both on-shelf and online. A key part of our growth pillar is gaining incremental distribution in both existing channels and entering new channels. In addition to the away-from-home wins I mentioned earlier, our snacks, baby & kids, and beverage brands have earned incremental distribution across existing channels. The drug channel grew 5% in the latest 12 weeks. And recent distribution gains support our confidence in our ability to grow share as we progress throughout the year. As part of our focus pillar, we are simplifying our global footprint to five core geographies, the US, Canada, the UK, Ireland, and Europe and streamlining our manufacturing footprint in these five markets with efficiencies in our own production and our co-manufacturing network. We recently consolidated our meat-free manufacturing footprint in Canada and continue to look at improving our capacity utilization and our operations leverage across all of our geographies. As we aim to unlock our full potential as a leading global better-for-you company, we are committed to implementing an operating model that should enable our teams to drive greater reach and scale across our core five platforms in our core five markets.  To achieve our aspirations, we have recently established our global RDQ operating model, regulatory, R&D, and quality and made important shifts in our design work to further integrate our teams globally. These enhancements, which include progressing with development of our global centers of excellence across marketing, procurement, and R&D to deliver on the evolving needs of our consumers and our customers are already creating demonstrated value to the business. The last pillar is fuel, which will enable us to fund our growth and drive margin expansion. Our fuel program consists of three main levers, revenue growth management, working capital management, and operational efficiency. We are on track to deliver against our planned fuel initiatives for the year with early momentum in RGM as reflected in trade efficiency and effectiveness. One of our key working capital opportunities involves bringing our payment terms in line with industry benchmarks. We have begun the process and this initiative is on track to deliver working capital improvements in this fiscal year. Productivity in the first half of the year is primarily being driven through packaging automation, enabling us to improve our throughput and reduce waste in the system. We are executing against identified initiatives across our three fuel levers to unlock value so we can reinvest in our business starting in the back half of this fiscal year. Before I hand the call over to Lee to review our financial results in more detail, I want to thank the entire team for their passion and their dedication to Hain Reimagined. This is a bold plan and transformation of not only what we do, but how we are organized and how we work. You are instrumental in delivering on our strategy, but more importantly our purpose in inspiring healthier living and I am proud to work alongside you. Lee, please go ahead.\nLee Boyce : Thank you, Wendy, and good morning, everyone. As anticipated, first quarter consolidated net sales decreased 3.3% versus the prior period to $425 million. Organic net sales for the first quarter adjusted to exclude the effects of divestitures and discontinued brands decreased 2.9% versus the prior year period, consistent with our guidance of a low single digit decline. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales in the North American segment partially offset by sales growth in the International segment, as expected. We delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $24.1 million versus $36 million in the prior year period. This came in ahead of our guidance range due to lower trade spend and marketing expenditures and we expect to reinvest the beat into the business over the course of the fiscal year. Adjusted gross margin was 20.5% in the first quarter and decreased by approximately 95 basis points versus the prior year period, driven by the leverage on lower sales volume and by cost inflation partially offset by pricing and productivity savings.  SG&A increased roughly 3% to $77.2 million, representing 18.2% of net sales for the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by wage rate increases and inflation in other support costs, with marketing expenses roughly in line with the prior period as we deferred some incremental investments.  As Wendy mentioned earlier, we have also begun to make progress in executing initiatives under the Hain Reimagined multiyear global growth and transformation program we announced during last quarter's Investors' Day. During the first quarter we took charges totaling $9.7 million associated with early actions under the program, including contract termination costs, asset write downs, employee related costs and other transformation related expenses. Interest costs for the first quarter rose 73% to $13.2 million due to the higher interest rate environment, partially offset by a lower borrowing base. As a reminder, we have hedged our rate exposure on approximately 50% of our loan facility with fixed rates at 5.6% and I will come back to in a moment, we are keenly focused on driving down net debt over time.  All of these factors combine to produce a net loss for the quarter of $10.4 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.9 million, or $0.08 per diluted share in the prior year period. Our adjusted loss per diluted share was $0.04 versus adjusted EPS of $0.10 in the prior year period. And now to our individual reporting segments. In North America, reported net sales decreased 9.8% to $260.1 million in the first quarter. Organic net sales decreased by 9.3% versus the prior year period due to a sales decline in baby & kids, which as we mentioned last quarter, is a function of continued industry-wide challenges in organic formula supply. Second, the timing shift of a sun care program in our personal care portfolio.  And third, optimization of promotional activities for Terra, as we aim to unlock a more profitable growth mix over the long term. These temporary declines more than offset the bright spots of growth we achieved in other strategic platforms, such as beverages, with Celestial Seasonings bagged tea and non-dairy beverage and baby & kids excluding formula.  First quarter adjusted gross margin in North America was 20.8%, a 190 basis point decrease versus the prior period that was driven by a deleverage on lower sales volume and cost inflation, partially offset by pricing and productivity savings. Adjusted EBITDA in North America was $18.7 million, a 39.2% decrease versus the prior period, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.2%, a 350 basis point decrease from the prior year period. These year-over-year declines resulted from lower gross profits and margin on roughly flat SG&A spending.  In our International business, reported net sales increased 9.3% to $165 million in the first quarter, and organic net sales growth was also 9.3%. Our growth was mainly driven by meal prep from private label grocery as well as soup, as well as in non-dairy beverages and baby & kids. International adjusted gross margin was 20%, up 95 basis points year-over-year, driven by pricing and productivity, partially offset by inflation. International adjusted EBITDA was $17.4 million, a 16.7% increase from the prior year period, driven primarily by pricing. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.6%, up approximately 70 basis points versus the prior year period.  Shifting to cash flow in the balance sheet, first quarter cash provided by operating activities was $14 million versus cash used in operating activities of $5.1 million a year ago, or a $19 million improvement. The higher operating cash resulted from working capital management, including our accounts payable optimization initiatives, focused inventory management, and an improvement in AR recovery. Paying down debt and strategically investing in the business continue to be our priorities for cash utilization. CapEx was $6.9 million in the quarter, and we continue to expect to be approximately $50 million for fiscal 2024. Finally, we ended the quarter with cash on hand of $38.3 million, and net debt of $776.7 million, translating into a net leverage ratio of 4.3 times, as calculated under our amended credit agreement.  Note that we do expect leverage to increase and peak in the second quarter, given the timing of restructuring and an anticipated seasonal increase in net working capital and other cash outflows, before trending back down through the second half of fiscal year 2024. Consistent with our stated priorities for cash, we have reduced net debt by $70 million since the end of Q1 2023, and as we have previously indicated, our long-term goal is to reduce balance sheet leverage to not more than 3.0 times adjusted EBITDA.  And now to our outlook, while a number of the top nine headwinds we faced in the first quarter were isolated to the period, the industry-wide challenges in organic baby formula supply will continue to adversely affect our sales volume in the near term. We are working hard with industry organizations and our co-manufacturers to ensure that consumers have access to organic formula, where we play a leadership role.  We are maintaining our guidance for the full year, despite adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter coming in ahead of our expectations. Our Hain Reimagined strategy is designed to be self-funded and flexible, [indiscernible] growth, adjusting the pace of investment as we progress. For fiscal 2024, we continue to expect organic net sales to increase by 2% to 4% year-over-year; adjusted EBITDA to be between $155 million and $165 million; and free cash flow of $50 million to $55 million.  Our 2024 guidance assumes that currency exchange rates will not materially affect our performance. At today's rate, the dollar is converting at around 2% more strongly than factored into our initial full-year 2024 guidance. And if this trend continues, it would slightly dampen our overall revenue growth, but have very little effect on profitability. We also assume that pricing will recover most expected cost inflation. We have made good progress on a number of revenue growth management initiatives, ranging from pricing to trade efficiency in the mix.  And lastly, we assume productivity will drive gross margin expansion and fuel investments.  And now I turn back to Wendy for closing remarks. \nWendy Davidson : Thank you, Lee. I am proud that we delivered a second consecutive quarter of Promises Made, Promises Kept. We believe we have set a bold yet achievable plan, and we are laser focused on executing upon it. Hain Reimagined was the result of a thorough evaluation of every aspect of our business to identify inefficiencies, as well as key unlocks to drive our business.  Now we shifted to execution, and I couldn't be more excited about the journey. Hain is a pioneer in better-for-you, building upon 30 years as a market leader in natural, organic, and better-for-you food, beverages, and personal care. Our portfolio of beloved brands across global better-for-you platforms differentiates us from others in this space and provides us with a unique opportunity to capture lifelong consumers from infant to adult, both in-home and away.  We have a clear roadmap to achieve our revenue and margin growth. We have a detailed fuel program that is strong and flexible, enabling us to invest in our plans to transform the business and deliver sustainable, profitable growth. And the early results we are seeing reinforce our confidence in the strategy. Hain's size, benefits of scale in global platforms, deep consumer focus, portfolio breadth and agility enables us to out-small the big and out-big the small.  Thank you again for joining the call today. We appreciate your interest and continued support. Operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Please keep to one question and one follow-up question. The first question we have is from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning, Lee and Wendy. I want to ask you about gross margin for North America and international, where we can keep it consolidated. But I'm wondering how do you see that gross margin building through the year from the 20.5% in fiscal 1Q and do you see this year playing out with gross profit growth happening this year, offset partially by G&A? So any thoughts about timing and progress and the components of EBITDA growth would be helpful?\nLee Boyce : Yeah, so it's Lee here. Yeah, I mean, as we said, with Hain Reimagined our productivity growth will build as we go through the year and also just some of the benefits that come through Hain Reimagined is we, flex and invest behind it. So we do see that continuing to build as we go through the year. The other thing is, as well, we will get leverage on our top line as that builds sequentially, specifically as we get into the back half. \nWendy Davidson: Yeah, and good morning. I'll add a little bit to that. As we said, when we outlined what the drivers were in quarter one, there were three really discreet drivers for North America that really change as we go through the year, that actually will help us from a mixed standpoint. Then when you look in the fuel program around revenue growth management, there's quite a bit of work relative to net price realization and trade efficiency. We saw some of that trade efficiency play out in quarter one in North America. You'll see some of that as we continue to go through the year.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman : Hi, I have a quick one and then a follow up, and thank you. In light of the delay in the formula supply recovery and also the decision to reinvest some of 1Q's over delivery, I'm just curious to what extent you're still expecting improved sequential organic sales growth and EBITDA growth in 2Q versus 1Q? \nWendy Davidson: Yeah, good morning, Ken. The challenges around formula, obviously, we outlined for quarter one. They'll continue a bit as we go into quarter two. We have secured supply as we go into the back half of the year. So that gives us confidence in that particular category. Offsetting that, we've looked at where we've got early momentum in distribution gains, channel expansion across the balance of the portfolio. And some of those are actually coming on faster than we would have expected. So we would expect to be able to deliver on our expectations for pivot to growth, even in light of the challenges with formula.\nKen Goldman : Okay, thank you for that. And then for the follow up, Wendy, in the first earnings call you joined after 2Q ’23, you said that in the past few years, Hain has established a level of transparency, which you will continue. And I understand transparency comes in different forms. But historically, Hain's been one of the few public food producers to not disclose price and volume numbers. And now it's also, I think, deciding to include the impact of currency and bake that into organic sales growth, which I think is fair to say, is even rarer. So what I'm hearing from some investors this morning is a little bit of concern that this decision to become less transparent, is not necessarily in the direction that people had hoped for, and that it becomes a little harder to analyze your financials. And I just wanted to get your opinion and Lee's opinion on if those concerns that I'm hearing are unjustified, in your view?\nWendy Davidson: Yeah, you're right in what we said earlier this year, the intent is to be transparent. I also want it to be accurate. And so you will see us as we go forward, be more overt in disclosing price, volume and mix. This particular quarter, we weren't comfortable that we had the numbers exactly where we would want to feel confident in providing that to the Street. But do we expect to provide that going forward? Yes, we do. As it relates to currency impact, when it's material, we'll certainly be calling that out. But we didn't want to have quite a bit of adjustments in the numbers, but I'll let Lee provide a bit of policy there.\nLee Boyce: So currency was favorable in Q1. It was about $11 million favorable. The one thing I would call out, as you look on the year-to-go basis and kind of had it in the opening comments, it is a 2% drag versus what we had when we originally set guidance. However, there's not a material impact to EBITDA. But we did want to put that in there, that 2% headwind was seen particularly on pound sterling. But again, just for the first quarter, just as context, it really is a top-line impact, about $11 million, not a material EBITDA impact.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. \nWendy Davidson: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: I think last quarter when you gave guidance for the first quarter in terms of organic sales growth in North America, you mentioned again that the three discrete items that impacted North America sales, two of which I think were supposed to be isolated specifically to the first quarter. It was the sun care timing shift and the promotional optimization at Terra. And I think at that time you said, those two collectively might be about, or maybe it was all three, I can't remember, a sort of a 10-point hit, if you will, to organic sales in 1Q. So I'm trying to get a sense of maybe if you could sort of quantify those? And really what I'm trying to get at is what underlying North America sales would have been without those two sort of discrete items that I mentioned. And if that's what you think North America sales would, organic sales would approximate in 2Q?\nWendy Davidson : Yeah. Let me unpack a little bit relative to the categories, just the broad buckets, and then have Lee provide some follow-ups specific to North America. You're right in that the three drivers we saw for quarter one that we had called in guidance would be formula, would be really the promotional optimization on Terra, and then would be the timing on sun care. If you look in those categories, certainly the impact in snacks was Terra driven, but offset by nice growth in Garden Veggie. So that gives us confidence as we go into quarter two that the Terra impact in the snack portfolio is a quarter one challenge.  On the formula side in our baby kids category, all of the decline in the baby category was driven by formula. And as we said in the opening remarks, offset by really continued strength in baby food and purees, and especially in toddler snacks, both in the Ella's business in the UK and in Earth’s Best in the US. So as the formula situation rights itself in the back half of the year, that gives us confidence because we have secured that supply, it gives us confidence as we go forward in that category.  Personal care, we identified it, on Investor Day, we talked about this as a stabilized category. If you look at the brands underneath that the sun care business in Alba is a timing issue, and that really was a driver to the personal care piece. But we had strength in the Avalon brand, strength and Live Clean, which is a leading brand in Canada. So there's pieces and pockets of personal care that give us confidence as we go forward.  So I guess long way of saying I think there are some, those were discrete items. When we look at outside of baby formula, the balance of the categories, we feel good as we go forward. And I believe our outlook for North America, well total company has a pivot into growth as we go into quarter two. But I'll let Lee provide a bit more color relative to North America.\nLee Boyce: Yeah, I mean, I think you covered kind of all of the big points there. I mean, obviously in Q1, it was, formula was kind of the largest drag on us. Going into Q2, we do see a continued drag on formula, probably around $10 million on the revenue side but then pivoting back as we go through the balance of the year. So I think again, we'd outlined what, I wasn't here but we had outlined previously kind of the three drivers with formula being the largest one. \nOperator: The next question we have is from John Baumgartner of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. \nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning, thanks for the question. \nWendy Davidson : Good morning. \nJohn Baumgartner: First off, I wanted to ask about International. Had a nice recovery there in Q1, the plant and beverages categories bouncing back in Europe and your comments, Wendy, they sound pretty positive to the larger portfolio in the region. So if I weigh that against the segment guidance for this year, I think it's up low single digits for organic revenue. How do we think about the potential upside to that outlook and what's holding you back from being more bullish for International sales this year?\nWendy Davidson: Yeah, I appreciate the question, though, if you think about even what we outlined on Investor Day and what we guided in the last quarter, there were some very clear areas where we expected to see recovery in International. We expected to see recovery as non-dairy beverage came back, and we got to greater capacity utilization in our non-dairy beverage plants. We expected to see some recovery as we see consolidation in the meat-free category, and we expected continued strength in our jams and jellies business and our soups business. So all of those things we have seen play out. Those are, however, offset by the challenges we see in the marketplace. The European market has been more, the consumer, more acutely impacted by inflation and the economy than what we've seen here in the US. It's also a market that has more private label penetration than what we see in the US and really in North America. The benefit for us is we play in both private label and brand, and that certainly was a benefit for us in the first quarter. We see that playing out as we go into the back half of the year, but I would tell you that we've tempered our expectations based on consumer response to category, the challenges around some of the geopolitical conflicts that we're seeing, especially in Ukraine and now in the Middle East, and so I think we've been appropriately prudent as we look at what the outlook is in the back half of the year. \nJohn Baumgartner: Okay. And then just a follow-up, when we think about a new distribution, the distribution growth you're getting in away-from-home channels, how do we think about the phasing there? Are there certain selling periods where the benefits can be larger than others, where if you're loading for K-12 or university business, are there certain windows akin to shelf resets that retailers should be considering? I'm just trying to better understand any lumpiness we can expect seasonally in away-from-home based on your targeted mix of new outlets. \nWendy Davidson: Yeah, away-from-home operates very differently, as you know, than a traditional retail environment. So there's very little of sort of set reset time period, and it's much more contractual depending on the segments that we're leaning into. We will begin, and we have begun, to see incremental placements that start to generate some sales momentum. It won't be as lumpy as what you would expect to see in some of maybe the other retail environments, where there's a big load-in period, or even what some people would see in, say, restaurant business, where you might land a new item, you've got a significant increase in a particular time period, and then it comes off the menu, or it's no longer on promotion.  The segments we're going after are largely where you would expect to see regular repeat business for the product being available, so think micro-markets in the front end of hotels, think travel as you're going through airports, things like that in grab-and-go locations. Think about on-the-go convenience, and think about college and university which functions very much like a small city that have convenience stores and small retail outlets on campus. Those tend to be fairly run rate business. You land distribution, and it slowly builds over time without the big inventory load-ins that you might see on it in a retail environment. So hopefully that provides a bit more clarification. \nJohn Baumgartner: Yeah, thanks, Wendy. \nWendy Davidson: You bet.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. \nWendy Davidson: Hey, good morning.\nMichael Lavery: Just was wondering how much more color you could give us on 2Q. I know you had 1Q guidance specifically and haven't done that this quarter for the second quarter, but I guess maybe partly just trying to understand the margin acceleration that you need to hit your full year numbers, but the additional spending you've called out for the second quarter, how second half heavy should our expectations be? Can you just give us a little bit better feel for the trajectory of how you think the rest of the year plays out? \nWendy Davidson: Yeah, let me start and I'll turn a little bit over to Lee so he can provide more color. We said all along that the back half of ’24 was where we were really going to see a lift. That's when we would see our fuel programs start to really lean in, it's where we would start to see some of the early investments in channel expansion and innovation start to play out. So the shape of the year does very much have a quarter three, quarter four lift compared to a quarter one, quarter two. While we don't have the discrete impacts in North America, all three of them, we will still have formula impact in quarter two. So I would say you'll see a modest improvement in quarter two, and then I think you'll see a more material improvement quarter three, quarter four. \nLee Boyce : Yeah, I guess I would just build upon that. As we go through the balance of the year, as Wendy mentioned, if we start seeing distribution gains specifically in bagged tea, yogurt. The other thing is we've invested part of the Hain Reimagined in revenue growth management, so we get the initiatives in way there. The other piece of it really is around innovation. So we see our innovation stepping up promotional improvements in the second half. We've got a dedicated team driving improved merchandising execution, so with all of those pieces and kind of the focus on driving fuel as well. We said we'd have a flexible program here, but as we unlock and drive that fuel, you'll see that take traction if we go through the balance half of the year. \nMichael Lavery: Okay, that's helpful. And can I just add a follow-up on Garden Veggie in club? Just maybe you understand a little better, is there still distribution gains to come? Like say for Costco, would you be in all of them already? Is that a permanent item? Obviously, we've seen with ParmCrisps or some other things, there's at least some volatility you can have there. How should we be thinking about that club piece of unmeasured channels and how it looks over the next few quarters? \nWendy Davidson: Yeah, I would definitely say that, and I think in general, you should never look at anything in club as a permanent item. It's not really the nature of how that channel works. We feel good about the distribution that we have across all of the club outlets. We are also leaning into incremental distribution to make sure the Garden Veggie is available in all the points of distribution where the customer want it to be and that’s where we are seeing much more of our TDP gain is driving channel expansion. And as we mentioned in our opening remarks, we have some very strong innovation coming in quarter three that's actually had really great acceptance from our retail environment. So we feel really good that we'll have new news for Garden Veggie to add to the core news as we drive really good shelf assortments in all the potential points of distributions. \nMichael Lavery: Okay, thanks so much. \nWendy Davidson: You bet.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Andrew Wolf of CL King. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Wolf: Thank you. Good morning. Wendy, sort of following up on your commentary on some innovation coming in Veggie Straws, I think you also use the word something disruptive. Is that something different that you're referring to? And is that, if I'm right, that it's different. Is that something that also has been sort of disclosed to the trader? Is that still an internal program that you're not taking to market yet? \nWendy Davidson: We are really excited. And as you know, Garden Veggie is a core franchise for us. We're excited to take Garden Veggie into disruptive categories. And so that's where you will see us, see the innovation. It has been released to the trade for normal customer conversations to drive acceptance for store recess. It'll begin shipping in late December and you'll see it on shelves starting in January. We have pushed marketing, a bit of our marketing spend that you would have seen come out of quarter one and we pushed to later period so that we can invest appropriately behind that launch and sustain launch after it's placed in market. But we've had very strong retailer receptivity to it and the consumer research has been incredibly positive. So we're excited about it as a new platform of innovation under the Garden Veggie franchise. \nAndrew Wolf: Got it, thanks for the color. And then on the 535 basis points, gross margin expansion from price and productivity kind of lumped together. Is there any chance that can be a little bit unpacked and between the price and the productivity gains and just a sense of how that's going to flow going forward? And lastly, just kind of how the conversations are going with the retailers on price, given what, maybe not so much for natural organic, but for most companies, ingredients costs starting to normalize?\nWendy Davidson: Yeah, let me start with your second question and have Lee provide a little color on margin expansion. We, as we said earlier this year, we felt really good about the revenue growth management initiatives that have been put in place and that most of the, I call it may be blunt force instrument around pricing, most of those large broad price actions had already been, had already taken place between International and North America. You'll actually start to see more of that wraparound and price realization as we go forward. What we'll -- you'll see more from us is a bit more surgical pricing, price-back architecture, trade optimization, work that we do around net price realization on shelf. And those initiatives are starting to play out as well, but our overall productivity program, we feel is the pipeline is sufficient to offset any inflation that we have coming. So, all that we've sort of factored into the numbers without the need for us to take incremental price. \nLee Boyce : So yeah, so just building on that, I mean, as Wendy said, we're very focused in on revenue growth management. We don't have any broad pricing planned in the near term. So, but we continue to kind of evaluate the environment, manage pricing, we are looking at the margin profile. We do expect the pricing to largely cover the inflation. And we talked about an inflation range of 3% to 4%. And I would say we have an exact number, but the majority of our pricing benefits has been communicated with our customers right now.  And then from a productivity standpoint, the way you kind of think about it is 3.5% to 4% of our cost of sales. We are obviously looking to drive the outline upside there, as we use that and invest the productivity also as fuel to drive our overall growth. So those are the kind of the two ways that you can think about it. Again, the inflationary environment from when we set the original guidance hasn't fundamentally changed. And we think the pricing we've got in place right now is appropriate. So those two pieces, again, factor into our overall margin expansion expectations. \nWendy Davidson: One thing I would add to which was, so I think some of you actually subscribe to some of the data that comes from Circana and IRI, but we're starting to see a return to more accelerated growth in natural products and better-for-you than conventional in quite a few of the categories that we play in. And that tells us a couple of things. One is that the consumer has got maybe a bit more socialized in the pricing that's been passed through, but we also see a little bit more insulation in those premium products to conventional, which is a great place for Hain because that's obviously the parts of those categories that we play in.  So seeing that consumer recovery in category and the growth of natural products outpacing conventional also gives us confidence as we go forward that we're well placed and we'll continue to monitor our pricing versus both other players and categories to ensure that we're covering inflation but we're not passing too much on to the consumer. \nAndrew Wolf: Thank you. \nWendy Davidson: You bet.\nOperator: The next question we have is Jon Andersen of William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJon Andersen : Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for the question. \nWendy Davidson: Hey, good morning.\nJon Andersen: Wendy, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about, where in the portfolio, and I'm thinking about categories and brands that you expect the most traction in away-from-home, and if we think about the next several quarters, how that kind of will play out. Also on the question of away-from-home, can you just remind us of where you are kind of currently or Hain is currently in terms of penetration or mix of overall sales and where you think that could reasonably go as you kind of execute your channel expansion strategy? Thanks. \nWendy Davidson: Yeah, I appreciate the question. You know, as we talked about on Investor Day, channel expansion is a huge opportunity for Hain because we've been under-penetrated in points of distribution that makes it easy for the shopper to find our products along their journey. And away-from-home, in particular in food service and convenience stores, we've said that we think the greatest opportunities for us from a category standpoint are going to be in our snacks portfolio, it’s largely going to be in beverages, a little bit in our meal prep around meat-free, especially in Canada and the UK, and in yogurt, especially in our US market. Those are areas where we would see great opportunity. And as we mentioned, we've already begun to pick up soup business in restaurant chains in the UK. So we see in the UK, it's a little bit different portfolio.  In terms of where our business is at, and I think we disclosed this on Investor Day, a typical CPG company is going to have somewhere between 15% and 20% of revenues are going to come from away-from-home channels. At Hain, it's less than 2% of our revenues. We've planned for a modest over the life of the strategy. And as we said before, Hain Reimagined is what we've committed to in the algorithm, is our target, it's not our aspiration. If you were to do the straight line math and assume 20% of our revenues would be in away-from-home, it would get you to a larger growth number in away-from-home than what we factored into Hain Reimagined. But we want to get some traction, get the proof points, and begin to see that play out so that we can come back and commit to the street a much larger number.\nJon Andersen: And are there any margin implications of the channel expansion, positive, negative, neutral?\nWendy Davidson: Yeah, away-from-home tends to be very margin accretive. In fact, every place I've worked, it's been margin accretive because the consumer is willing to perform for the convenience factor of things on the go, and they're less price sensitive than what they would be paying for pantry loading, for instance, in a retail environment. What you need to make sure as a company, is that you've appropriately built in your cost to serve and that you've identified the end-to-end costs so that you make sure you capture either in trade efficiencies, mixed management, price-back architecture, etc.  I feel very good that the team that we've put in place around away-from-home, both in the UK business and the team here in the US, I feel really good about the revenue growth management work that the team's done for what it will take with our portfolio to be well positioned to drive that distribution. And I feel really good seeing the early momentum that the team's driving in the points of distribution that they've gained in away-from-home. So I feel like we will have some good news to share with you in the coming quarters. \nJon Andersen: Great. One last one, just on capital allocation. I think, Lee, you mentioned you're targeting $50 million or $55 million of free cash this year. What's the priority set? I assume debt reduction, leverage reduction, but just talk about that and maybe more broadly, the capital allocation priorities going forward? Thanks. \nLee Boyce : Yeah, so I think you said its two things. Its leverage reduction overall, but then we also, as we free up cash, it's also to be fuel to push behind Hain Reimagined. So again, as we look, I mean, one of the key initiatives we talked about was payables, for example. I mean, we're making good progress in the payables area. We have kind of updated our internal processes, and we're working back through with our suppliers. So we're seeing traction there. We're also coming a little bit later, but focus is on inventory. But to answer your question, it's balancing two things. It's the reduction of our leverage, and again, then using that fuel to invest behind the business.\nJon Andersen: Thanks. Good luck.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard : Good morning, everyone.\nWendy Davidson: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard : So you started to talk about the state of the consumer. I believe it was in reference to the US or the North American market. I'm just wondering if you can compare and contrast what you're seeing with consumer behaviors, channel shifting, trade up or trade down between the two regions. I'm just trying to get a sense check on whether consumer confidence is improving or deteriorating in each region? Thank you.\nWendy Davidson: Absolutely. So let me sort of broadly, we know that the European consumer has been more acutely impacted by overall inflationary environment. And in fact, inflation continues to be a higher level there than what we're seeing in the US market in particular. It's also a market that has a larger concentration or larger penetration for private label. And we've seen significant growth in discounters. So I would say in the European market, we've seen a couple of things. We've seen consumers trade down to discount locations. We've seen them trade down to private label.  The good thing for Hain is that we're in categories that the consumer is wanting regardless of the economic environment, but they are buying it from different locations and they're going to private label and brand. We're well covered there because our portfolio is both private label and brand and we see that play out in our growth. We're growing in private label faster than we're growing in the branded business to recover, but the team's well positioned to have that in that marketplace.  The North American market is different. We've seen the inflation rate was lower than what we saw in Europe. In the better-for-you category in particular, we did see the consumer adjust behavior and it's not moving to private label. So we haven't seen a growth in private label concentration, but we have seen consumers buy less units rather than buying at different locations, but we are starting to see that stabilize. The most recent data from Circana showed three of the categories that we're in, we pivoted back to, in the latest 12 weeks, growth of natural products outpacing conventional in those categories.  The one category where we still see challenge is in the snacks category, but there's significant promotional activity there on conventional products and so we're not seeing the same move to premium at a greater rate than conventional snacking, but in every other category we play in, we are definitely seeing the growth in the category for better-for-you items across all retail outlets to get back to what we would have seen two years ago in category dynamics. \nAlexia Howard : Great, and as a quick follow-up, marketing spend, can you quantify how much it was up this quarter and now that you beat on EBITDA, how much you expect marketing spend to increase relative to the previous expectation because it seems clear that you're reinvesting in the business? \nWendy Davidson: Yeah, so we, from a year-on-year basis, the marketing spend was up a relative small amount because we had spent quite a bit in quarter one last year. As you recall, then we essentially went quiet. We turned back on marketing in quarter three of fiscal ’23, ramped it up in quarter four. We're sustained at about that level because we held what was significant increased marketing spend to support the launches that will take place in quarter two and into quarter three for launch support, but our marketing spend is about where we had planned for it to be. We'll spend at the rate that we expected to for this year, which is a bit of a step up from fiscal ’23. I think what's more important is that you'll see us have sustained marketing investment quarter-on-quarter and should not expect to see that a place where we will save dollars.  So we'll drive efficiencies in our overall spend before we drive any reductions in those spend, which aligns with what we’ve said. We will get better before we spend more and we're definitely seeing the team driving better analysis on return on investment of our marketing spend for better campaigns that are better tested to then be able to ramp up our spend in the back half of the year. \nAlexia Howard : Makes sense. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. \nWendy Davidson: You bet. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question we have is from Jim Salera of Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. \nJim Salera: Hi everyone. Thanks for squeezing us in. I know a lot of questions have been asked on the away-from-home channel, but maybe if I could sneak in one more. Do you guys have a sense for which products you're replacing on the shelf in these end markets? Is it existing better-for-you products or should we see this as your entry into those formats as really being kind of an expansion of their better-for-you offerings on shelf?\nWendy Davidson: That's a great question and it would really depend on category and it would depend on segment. In the case of snacks, we see it as an and. And in many cases, our products are appealing to a consumer who otherwise doesn't have an option in those locations. So it's an incremental placement in those locations. In areas like beverage, especially in tea brands, is a replacement for something else that, you know, another brand because the Celestial Seasoning brand is the market leader in herbal teas. But in many cases, we've not been available where the consumer would expect to find us. So as the preferred brand, we're looking to drive distribution so that we're available to the shopper when they're on the go.  As it relates to yogurt, it's either incremental because they've not been utilizing something in that location. So this is the team working with those customers on this as an add and why it is a good incremental ad to their assortment. So it's really going to depend. Is it in restaurants? Is it in C-store? Is it an on-the-go retail and whether it's a binary purchasing decision or whether it's an add to the assortment? \nJim Salera: Great, that's helpful color. And then maybe I can switch gears. If we look at the Circana, the consumption data for the tea bags category, it seems like the category is kind of bebops around basically flat consumption. But private label has been doing much better, especially over the last, call it 12 months. Is there anything dynamic wise that you can do, whether it's with increased promotions, or kind of more focus on that category to normalize that and get your piece going? Or is it just consumers are trading down and it's kind of have to wait for them to readjust to the shelf prices?\nWendy Davidson: I'm not familiar with the trade downs of private label and tea because that's not consistent with the data that we're seeing. What we are seeing is obviously tea season, we're heading into that now. And we also know retailers are doing resets in preparation for tea season. So you wouldn't really expect to see a lot of tea growth at this particular point in time, but actually Celestial's done really nice. We would expect to see that ramp up as we go into tea season and as you start to see the assortments that we've already landed begin to show on shelf. \nJim Salera: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on. \nWendy Davidson: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is a follow up question from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nDavid Palmer: Thanks for the follow up, just wanted to follow up on your comments on channel mix. US measured channels is something obviously we all follow closely on. I'm wondering, for us Circana or Nielsen watchers, what should we be seeing that would be consistent with your guidance? I know FX and non-measured are going to be helps for the year, but should we still be thinking at least some growth, up low single digits or so in US measured channels starting in your fiscal second half? \nWendy Davidson: Yeah, this is where things will be challenging as we're leaning into the areas of growth. So let me sort of dimensionalize it a little bit. In our business, 40% or so is International, which is relatively a black box, I guess, unless you buy the Nielsen data in the International market. But we will try to provide a little bit of color as we go forward on where we're seeing category growth, where we're seeing channel growth, so you've got some visibility to that. Then in the North American business, so call that 60% of our business, only about 65% or so of that business is in measured channels. And where we'll be leaning in is going to be in non-measured. So we're also in the process of identifying how we provide some visibility to you in terms of tracked and measured so that you've got visibility across channels and can expect that.  But to your question on where should you expect to start to see growth? You will start to see some of our categories turn in the end market data in just those measured channels as we go into the back half of this year. You'll see it in TDP gains, and you'll see it in some of the velocities, especially in snacks and in tea. And then obviously, as the formula supply comes back, you'll see that play out in the baby category. If our baby category is muted, and actually overall end market is muted because it includes that formula detail. So you really kind of have to click down into the categories to see where the growth is at. But we'll work on providing you a bit more visibility to where we see TDP gains and channel mix going forward so that you've got a feel of measured and non-measured. \nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Wendy Davidson for closing comments.\nWendy Davidson: Yeah, I want to thank everybody for the time this morning. And as I said earlier, a huge thanks for the opportunity to be able to meet so many people on Investor Day and for your interest and support in Hain. We are very committed to returning the business to growth. We're very committed to Hain Reimagined and providing visibility to you as we proceed with the strategy. So with that, I look forward to further conversations later on today.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines."
