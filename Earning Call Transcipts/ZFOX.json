After the speakersâ€™ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference call over to Todd Weller, Vice President, Investor Relations for ZeroFox.\nTodd Weller: Thanks, operator. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to review ZeroFox's fiscal third quarter 2024 financial results. With me on the call today is Foster, our Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman; along with Tim Bender, our CFO. By now, everyone should have access to our earnings press release. This press release as well as supplemental financial information can be found on our Investor Relations website. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements, including statements related to our anticipated financial results, growth opportunities in external cybersecurity, our progress to achieving profitability and expected benefits from our acquisitions of IDX and LookingGlass. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, but rather are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements. Please review our earnings press release and recent SEC filings for a description of these material risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements made today speak only to our expectations as of today, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise them. Additionally, non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed on this conference call. Please refer to the tables in our earnings release in the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Foster.\nJames Foster: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Q3 was a record setting quarter for ZeroFox. We delivered another strong top line outperformance, while also generating positive free cash flow for the second consecutive quarter. We believe that our outperformance reflects the growing demand for external cybersecurity platform, demonstrates our team's consistent execution and validates our balanced approach to growth and increased profitability. Today, I'm going to provide summaries on key areas of our results, share a few customer success stories and provide updates on our One Platform vision and discuss our plan to close out this year. As you may have seen in our press release this morning, we reported strong results. We reported core revenue of $44 million, an increase of 89% year-over-year, and we define core revenue as total revenue, less revenue from our one large government contract. We ended the quarter with record ARR of $186 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year, and we accomplished this while also improving profitability and generating positive free cash flow quarter-over-quarter. Overall, I was very happy with our team's performance in Q3. The ZeroFox platform is relied upon by enterprise customers to solve their external cybersecurity challenges, and we continue to see demand for our platform's four strategic pillars, including protection, intelligence, disruption and response. Our continued success with enterprise customers was reflected in the 27% year-over-year growth in subscription customers with ARR greater than $100,000, and in general, our overall growth in large enterprise deals. Given the U.S. federal government's fiscal year-end during the middle of our Q3, I thought it was relevant to highlight our public sector business this call, with a very strong performance with record bookings, new customers and public sector ARR. In Q3, we signed an eight-figure renewal and expansion with strategic U.S. federal agency that is focused on cybersecurity. Through this contract and program, ZeroFox is supporting critical cyber threat intelligence, cyber defense and security operations across hundreds of federal, state and local government organizations. We also signed a multimillion dollar renewal and expansion with the U.S. cyber defense agency that is using ZeroFox to protect thousands of personnel from advanced digital attacks. Over the last three years, this customer has significantly increased their adoption of our platform, and specifically, over the last two years, has more than quadrupled their ARR with us. Our team all always takes great pride in supporting mission aligned organizations with critical capabilities. We also added two additional six-figure customers that purchased six plus modules across our protection intelligence and disruption pillars. While public sector benefit -- business benefited from the end of the government fiscal year and its seasonally strong spending, we believe there are underlying fundamental drivers that give us confidence in the future growth outlook and our One Platform approach. For example, the current geopolitical environment is amplifying the intensity and sophistication of the external threat environment and driving increasing awareness of the critical need for organizations to defend themselves against activity from nation state adversaries and organized cybercriminal groups. The days where insider threats were a top concern for CISOs are behind us. Today, our customers are thoughtfully protecting themselves from a myriad of external threats that are beyond their perimeters and most frequently beyond their borders. Turning to our on-demand response services. We experienced another record quarter resulting in year-to-date revenue growth of nearly 100%. Our strong performance was driven by continued high levels of cybersecurity breach activity, including a significant increase in large scale breaches, and our continued success in capturing market share. We signed several six-figure deals as well as three seven-figure deals, including one with a large gaming and hospitality company. The market is recognizing our differentiated vision, brand and One Platform approach to helping customers navigate the increasingly complex emergency response and notification requirements, especially for regulated organizations. Furthermore, these requirements are becoming more stringent with the new SEC cybersecurity incident disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies. While we remain optimistic about our response services business, the go-to-market engine we are building and the trust we are creating with our customers, important to remember that the response business is largely reactive and macro driven. For example, major events and cyber cleanup campaigns like MoveIT, Log 4G or the [indiscernible] and SolarWinds are largely time bound and come in waves. And as you know, the great thing about things that come in waves is that there may be peaks and valleys, but it's just a matter of time until that next great wave hit. With that, I'd like to change gears and spend a few minutes providing an update on our vision. At ZeroFox, we believe that solving the external cybersecurity challenge and problem set requires a One Platform approach. This has been the driving force behind our strategy and the development of our comprehensive unified platform with four pillars of capabilities. We continue to see adoption of the modern security Triple Crown, where security organizations will standardize on internal platforms like Microsoft, CrowdStrike SentinelOne, edge platforms like Palo Alto Networks, or Zscaler and an external platform like ZeroFox. Customers have grown tired of the complexity and cost of managing multiple external cybersecurity point products for digital risk protection, threat intelligence, takedowns and even external attack service management, a dynamic that has intensified in the current economic environment. We believe that our proven ability to provide an external cybersecurity platform that unifies protection, intelligence, adversary disruption and response is a critical component of the success of this organization and it provides us with key competitive advantages. We also believe that our technical EAS and capabilities from our acquisition of LookingGlass will provide immense value to our customers. Organizations need to understand their full external risk, their vulnerabilities in both digital and cyber scapes and have detailed information on threat actors that are attacking them. This and this alone stands for the robust capabilities required for organizations to defend themselves from these advanced external threats. Furthermore, our team is committed to protecting our customers. It's in the DNA of our company, and quite frankly, it's what motivates us. It's our passion. We're not just AI data scientists, analysts and engineers, we are true cyber defenders for our customers, and it's a responsibility that we cherish. Speaking of our customers. We had a six-figure new customer win with a large retail organization that is leveraging the power of nearly our entire platform. This customer purchased seven modules across protection, intelligence and disruption pillars to protect their external tech surface. We had another six-figure new customer win with a Fortune 500 financial services company that purchased four modules across protection and disruption pillars as well. This company selected ZeroFox based on our ability to protect multiple digital asset types, including brands, domains and a large number of credit card BIN numbers, given our ability and proven capability to do takedowns and disruption at Internet scale. We were also able to showcase our full capabilities for a new health care customer. This organization initially purchased the ZeroFox platform for digital protection. However, during the sales process, they had an urgent need for on-demand response services and capabilities, and they selected ZeroFox for both incident and breach response capabilities. This resulted in a multimillion dollar deal in Q3. This customer experienced the full value of our One Platform vision in action as we've demonstrated our ability to disrupt and respond to aggressive external cyberattacks and furthermore protect them from those future attacks going forward. Another example was with an existing technology customer. This customer initially selected ZeroFox several years ago to protect its high-value digital assets. In Q3, the customer significantly expanded the number of digital assets protected and added on on-demand response capabilities, resulting in a 6x increase in their recurring spend. In short, I'm very pleased with our team's commitment to solving customer problems and the pace of innovation of our organization. As a cybersecurity company, the pace of innovation is critical to ensuring we stay ahead of our customers' relentless adversaries. In Q3, we delivered significant advancements to our phishing and domain protection in global threat intelligence capabilities, specifically in the area of physical security intelligence. As we have always done, we will continue to leverage innovations in AI and machine learning to improve our ability to detect and disrupt threats. Large language models, generative AI and various other types of computer vision, deep learning and machine learning capabilities are commonplace in the ZeroFox platform. For example, we are now using LLMs and generative AI to help us enhance our finished (ph) intelligence and alerted capabilities as well as evaluate risk for key alerts and attacks we identified. Shifting gears, I'd like to turn our focus to the goals for Q4, as we close out what has been a strong and transformative year for ZeroFox. We will continue to execute on our strategic plan to expand our platform capabilities in preparation for next year. We will grow our customer base and we will continue to increase adoption. We will also continue to prudently invest in our go-to-market engine, our services to support and enable customers and to optimize our business to improve efficiencies and profitability. We were very pleased with our Q3 cash flow performance and believe this trend reflects our commitment to balancing growth and profitability. And before I turn the call over to Tim for a detailed review of our Q3 financial performance, I would like to share one more customer story with you. I've always enjoyed meeting with customers and hearing their goals and challenges. It's personally been rewarding. In Q3, I had an opportunity to meet with one of our top 10 customers who is also on the Fortune 10 list. During our discussion, this customer described our offering as unbeatable in the marketplace, and highlighted the significant ROI they are generating, using the ZeroFox platform each and every day. They even went up so far to say that ZeroFox was saving them hundreds of millions of dollars per year. We aid up agreeing to expand our scope for the third consecutive year, and ZeroFox also agreed to help automate and streamline another key external challenge with our platform with them. To me, there is nothing more powerful than the validation of this kind of direct customer feedback, particularly from a customer of the size and sophistication. It feels really good to know that a platform works, a team is committed and that what we're doing is really helping people and organizations around the world. In short, I love this industry. And with that, I want to thank all of our Foxes for their energy, passion and commitment throughout Q3 and certainly before that. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Bender.\nTimothy Bender: Thanks, Foster. As Foster mentioned, ZeroFox generated strong Q3 results across both top and bottom line metrics. With the exception of revenue and unless otherwise stated, all financial results we will discuss today are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. This is the first quarter where we can truly present comparative year-over-year financial information, although, the year ago quarter excluded three days as our de-SPAC transaction closed on August 3, 2022. For Q3, ZeroFox reported revenue of $65 million, an increase of 45% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $23.7 million, an increase of 51% year-over-year, and services revenue was $41.3 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year. Services revenue consisted of $20.7 million of recurring revenue from our strategic government customer and $20.6 million from our on-demand response services. The significant outperformance in services revenue was driven by another record quarter of on-demand response bookings as we benefited from continued high levels of cyber breach activity and continued success winning enterprise deals. As you've heard from Foster, we feel well positioned to continue winning enterprise service opportunities. However, given our significant performance in Q3, we currently anticipate a sequential decline in 4Q services revenue. Our services revenue continues to be less predictable when compared to our subscription revenue. Because of the unforeseen nature of response services, we would encourage investors to look at the performance of our services business on an annualized basis to assess our performance and growth potential. As of October 31, annual recurring revenue was $186 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. ARR consists of platform subscriptions, a small amount of recurring on-demand services and $83 million from our strategic government contract. We ended the quarter with a record high 1,330 subscription customers. As Foster mentioned, in Q3, we saw continued success winning larger deals. We ended Q3 with 182 customers with ARR greater than $100,000, which represented an increase of 27% year-over-year. Turning to gross margin. For the third quarter, subscription gross margin was 73%, up from 72% in Q2. For Q4, we expect subscription gross margin to be consistent with Q3 levels. As expected, services gross margin of 18% was consistent with Q2. Services gross margin continues to be impacted by a higher mix of notification services, driven by the mix of large deals. Given the continued impact from large deals in Q4, we would expect Services gross margin to be relatively consistent with Q3 levels before returning to more normalized historical levels over the course of fiscal year '25. Total gross margin was 38%, consistent with Q2. As we look to Q4, we would expect gross margin to increase slightly from Q3 levels, driven by a higher mix of subscription revenue. We continue to see opportunities to improve our overall gross margin as we scale our business and we expect our higher margin subscription revenue to become a greater portion of our overall revenue mix. Turning to operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $27 million in the quarter. The sequential decrease in operating expenses was driven by lower R&D and G&A expenses resulting from acquisition cost synergies. Our loss from operations was $2.5 million, a significant improvement from $4.8 million in Q2. Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $30 million in cash, $38 million in accounts receivable, $88 million in total deferred revenue and $194 million in total outstanding debt. In Q3, we generated cash flow from operations of approximately $1.8 million and free cash flow of approximately $1.6 million. Our Q3 cash flow performance was positively impacted by the timing of collections from our enterprise customers, and also reflects our focus on improving profitability. We are committed to enhancing our financial position and are considering various options to strengthen our balance sheet, manage our convertible debt and optimize our capital structure. We will continue to focus on sustaining our strong business fundamentals and improving profitability. Now to our outlook. Our outlook assumes no material changes in the macro environment. Demand for our external cybersecurity platform remains consistent and assumes that no incremental outsized response deals closed within the quarter. For Q4 fiscal year '24, we currently expect revenue to be in the range of $56 million to $58 million and non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $5.8 million to $4.8 million. For fiscal year '24, we currently expect revenue to be in the range of $228.7 million to $230.7 million and non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $21.4 million to $20.4 million. We continue to focus on profitability. Consistent with what we said last quarter, we expect free cash flow for Q4 to be at or near breakeven. And as we begin to look at fiscal year '25, we now expect that we will achieve free cash flow on an annual basis. To conclude, we are pleased with our 3Q results, for which we again exceeded top and bottom line expectations and are raising guidance for Q4. With that, we'd like to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Gallo with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJoseph Gallo: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. You said that you're assuming macro stays the same in your guidance, but you raised full year revenue by more than the beat in the quarter, which is really impressive. So maybe just talk through where some of the incremental positivity is coming for 4Q? And then, just on macro, how are your customers thinking about their calendar '24 budgets?\nJames Foster: Yeah. Good morning, Joe. Thanks for the question. I think we'll tag team this one here. So on the macro, I think you've got to see us execute here now. We had a really strong Q3. And so timing of subscription as well as some of those large services deals will help us, not only with the foundation for Q4, but we see some opportunity. As you saw, we raised guidance above beat for Q4. So I think that's exactly what we did. In general, with the macro environment that we're seeing right now, we haven't really seen a slowdown in large deals and we've seen some of the pressures maybe in other parts of the world that were there in previous quarters improved in the last quarter or so. So I think we're pretty bullish about Q4 and decided to kind of finish out the year strong.\nTimothy Bender: And Joe, this is Tim. I missed your second half of the question on the -- I think you're asking about calendar '20 or next year's budgets?\nJoseph Gallo: Yeah. Just as far as like the macro conversation, like when you're talking to your biggest customers, right, you said you're assuming macro stays the same, but how are they feeling? How are they thinking about calendar '24 budgets? Is that fresh P&L that you can attack?\nTimothy Bender: Was that -- again, I think it's similar just -- again, our platform is strong and we'll compete at that level. And I think from that standpoint, customers see the value in our platform and we're going to continue to win customers. So I don't think there's any real material change as it relates to how customers are thinking about spending on external next year.\nJoseph Gallo: Okay. Thanks. And just onâ€¦\nJames Foster: And I double click on that for you Joe too is we, as an organization, continue to try to strike this healthy balance between growth and profitability. And so going into Q4, profitability is still a top area that we're continuing to optimize the business around. We had nice growth in free cash flow quarter-over-quarter and we're going to continue to refine and improve the business there. We're not done growing profitability year. That's for sure.\nJoseph Gallo: You must have a crystal ball because that kind of leads into my second question, which is just great to see the second straight quarter of free cash flow positive and strong margin performance. You mentioned synergies being a large driver of the margins. How do we think about incremental synergies or leverage as we enter calendar '24? Thatâ€™s all from me. Thanks.\nJames Foster: Yeah. Thanks. We did have nice outperformance in the quarter, right? I mean, our subscription gross margin ticked up 1 point quarter-over-quarter between Q2 and Q3, a little earlier than we had in our plan, which was nice to see. We think that we'll have the ability to continue to kind of continue to run that ahead of plan or maybe even tick up a little bit in the next couple of quarters. Our long-term plan for this organization continues to tick up our subscription gross margin in a meaningful fashion in the coming years. We think we've been able to improve margin by 1 point to 2 points roughly every year, 1.5 years for the last half a decade and we can continue that same cadence for the next half a decade. So that's kind of like point number one. And I think it was -- in terms of profitability, right, the market has said and the market is rewarding those organizations that continue to find optimizations, we acquired LookingGlass two quarters ago. I mean, when you think about acquisition synergies, weâ€™ve done a really nice job with that organization. Weâ€™ve got really strong talent we brought into the fold. But our acquisition synergies and the tail around some of those things are going to take quarters still to play out. They had some leases and some other long-tail contracts that weâ€™ve synergized our platforms, but weâ€™ve just got to let those things run out. So you will see improvements and overall operating expenses, G&A and other areas of the business continue to play out in the coming quarters, which will result in higher chance of profitability.\nJoseph Gallo: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. Deferred revenue contribution was very strong in the quarter. I think it was a positive $21 million. Can you guys talk to where those payments came from? Thanks.\nTimothy Bender: Sure. Thanks, Brad. I'd say they are driven by two certainly enterprise quality deals. As Foster mentioned in the talking points earlier, we had that large eight-figure public sector deal. That was a nice renewal that came in kind of towards the middle end of the quarter. And then we mentioned the large breach response with a large gaming company and that as well came in late in the quarter. So those two alone were the significant contributors to the increase in deferred revenue.\nJames Foster: That's right. And I will say that the public sector customer that Tim just referenced was not only a renewal, but an expansion, which was nice to see that we were able to continue to kind of expand the adoption and expand the value that the government is getting to that program. And then on that large gaming contract, it was also nice to see that we extend that protection from kind of a regulated one-year requirement to a two-year contract with that organization. So we are seeing our customers kind of adopt more of the platform and feel more comfortable where they're also doing larger TCV-based contracts in addition to ACV -- large ACV-based contracts.\nBrad Reback: That's great. And Foster, maybe switching our focus to subscription revenue. How should we think about the long-term sustainable organic growth rate for that line?\nJames Foster: Yeah. Look, I think we're -- right now, if you look at the lines, we're in the 20s, Brad. We see an opportunity to improve that in the coming quarters. For fiscal '25, right, we think that there's going to be an opportunity to grow from the mid to the kind of upper 20s just based on what we've got right now. The key is balancing profitability, right? We need to be cognizant and recognize the market and where we think we will get recognized and rewarded on that ounce (ph) of profitability. As I was telling Joe, just a second ago, I think we've done a really nice job in the last two quarters putting up consecutive back-to-back free cash flow quarters where we grew it almost double quarter-over-quarter here in Q3. But we're not done yet and I think the market will expect us to continue to grow that profitability line on a quarterly basis. And once I think weâ€™ve reached the right level of profitability, weâ€™ll continue to make sure we optimize our growth as well and get efficient growth. So I think we would start with probably low 20s next year and try to outperform.\nBrad Reback: Perfect. Thanks very much.\nJames Foster: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Yi Fu Lee with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nYi Fu Lee: Hi. Good morning, Foster and Tim. Congrats on another strongly executed quarter on revenue momentum and free cash flow generation. I guess two questions for Foster and one for Tim. So thanks for publishing the external cyber threat report, especially the ones on the Middle East conflict. I was wondering, has the elevated threat environment helping the pipeline building generation as well as deal expansion activities? And is there any pushback from customers in terms of like, let's say, budget concerns because we're still in a challenging macro environment?\nJames Foster: I heard a couple of things there, Yi, and good morning as well. Look, I was talking to somebody yesterday. Just maybe something comes to mind and I think it's relatively relevant. The number of attacks and the number of successful data breaches that are out there continues to rise, right? LockBit 3.0 has been the most successful threat actor and kind of affiliate group we've seen in this space in 20-plus years. And there's changes that's happening out of the macro. And one of the things we were talking about that was the reported yesterday, was that the number of financial services companies targeted by LockBit and its affiliates in 2023 on a pro rata basis is up 50%. And so there are some tactics and techniques that are changing. I think the threat actor groups are changing and their targets are changing. And this, combined with like another really interesting thing that we continue to monitor on our side, given the amount of large breach response work we do. We see customers, in general, about 60% of the time still paying ransomware, right? And so there's this imbalance in the market that's happening right now on what exactly to do. When you've got the U.S. federal government and the FBI saying, don't pay ransomware, yet the majority of customers that we engage or know of still paying it and still getting hit, I think it becomes a real challenge. And probably the most concerning stuff that we've been monitoring inside from our intel team is organizations that have been hit with ransomware once and pay, get hit 80% of the time within three years again. And so there's a causation or correlation line on, are you getting hit again because you paid or are you getting hit again because you still haven't covered the basics? And as we've said here, like the basics require three fundamental pieces of your tech stack now to protect yourself. You've got to have something on the inside, on the endpoint. You've got to have something that separates the inside from the outside and you've got to have something on the outside protecting your external attack surface. And we see a lot of our customers that have adopted that kind of modern security Triple Crown, but there's still a lot of customers out there working on the basics and still trying to drop -- adopt those three things.\nYi Fu Lee: Thanks for the color on that Foster, it sounds like that's the Asian bank for the U.S. treasury situation. And then like moving on, right, there's a recent attack on a, let's say, cloud-native identity player on their customer support system that happened this quarter. Within their public disclosure, right, they mentioned that because client lists are compromised, right, that they may be susceptible to elevated phishing attacks going forward, right? I'm thinking about the services offered by ZeroFox, external cyber protection as well as speech (ph) response, right? Do you think there could be additional opportunity in addition to this? Because I think you mentioned there is a gaming company that you helped in addition.\nJames Foster: I think there is, Yi. I mean, one of the things that we see and the new SEC notification requirements are helping to highlight what I call visibility at the board level, making sure the boards understand their security programs, framework they've adopted, make sure they understand the notification requirements, kind of the liability now at the Board level for getting this right. The challenge so far, though is, it's very, very difficult to adhere to that SEC requirement and have full details that fast. For example, if you've been compromised or if there's been an incident, and you've got just a few days to provide some level of notification, almost 100% of the time the customers that we work with, you don't have your arms around the full potential problem set within a few days. So what happens is you notify that something's happened and that you're working on it. And then ultimately, the way this is going to play out in the market, I guess, in my opinion here is everyone's going to say it's worse than expected because they are going to set expectations on, hey, we're looking into this, we're trying to get our arms around this. And I think very few will come out and say the sky has fallen before they get their real arms around it. So they'll just say something has happened, we're looking into it. And when they come back, it will be while it's large, and this is what it looks like, and this is how it moved around internally.\nYi Fu Lee: If I just move on to for the finance question, right? Can you expand on the SEC disclosure requirement? Because requirements within four days, right? How does ZeroFox help, like, let's say, decline with the compliance requirement, right, to get the disclosure, right, what they need, the info, the intel, right, to communicate to public in such speed?\nJames Foster: Yeah. I mean I'll just point out one example because it's public. I mean, in general, we can't comment a tremendous amount on our response deals, but if a client makes it public on their behalf then we have a little bit more leniency. Caesars as an organization, putting their 8-K in Q3 that they had hired ZeroFox to help with their response services. And so that's a great example of them, an organization with a strong security program has good capabilities to identify and help kick off the response and then pull in trusted third-parties to help and then the 8-K that. And I think that's an example of where I think regulation could actually help here in the market where they're being asked to move quickly. And in general, you're going to have to work with partners to help with that and then disclose what that looks like. And they disclosed that, again, ZeroFox had been brought in to help the response, notification and protection side of the house. We're proud of that one.\nYi Fu Lee: Got it. Thanks for that. And then to end on financing my arbitrary financing update question for Tim. So on the balance sheet on cash, right, last update was that you guys could get to free cash flow positive, right next fiscal '25, right? I was wondering, Tim, if you could help us on any financing raises that you're anticipating within the next 12 months? And help us with -- can you please kind of help us with the free cash flow seasonality? How -- is a more modeling question, Tim? And thatâ€™s it for us. Thank you very much.\nTimothy Bender: Yeah. Thank you. I'll start maybe in reverse order as far as some seasonality and timing of cash flow. Again, we said it, we believe we've got certainly the ability to be free cash flow positive next year. Q1 is always our most challenging quarter. This Q1 was indeed more challenging than most. But in general, Q1 tends to be our toughest quarter from a cash flow generation standpoint, and then we tend to turn around in Q2, Q3, Q4. So I'd expect to see that same trend next year. As it relates to financing, nothing necessarily is planned at this point. I think that's a larger conversation we started touching on last -- at the last call. And kind of we'll leave it at there for that, and Foster, if you have any other comments on financing?\nJames Foster: Yeah. I mean, look, we have a convert that matures in roughly 18 months from now, beyond 18 months from now. We've just put up the best quarter in company history for the third consecutive quarter. And I think this improved profitability will actually help our optionality, and we'll show the sustainability of the company that we've built. And I think we needed to do some blocking and tackling here the last six months, last couple of quarters around making sure we saw synergies realized here in our financial statements, not just in vision decks. And I think we've done those things, which will help us on the financing front. In general, we're always looking for new investors, and we're open for business and nine to four every day, Monday through Friday soâ€¦\nYi Fu Lee: Thanks for that, Foster and congrats Tim. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Foster for any closing remarks.\nJames Foster: Thank you, operator. Q3 was another strong quarter for ZeroFox, where, as you heard, we made significant progress on many fronts. We remain excited about the opportunities in front of us and look forward to closing out our fiscal year '24 on a very strong note. Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. Have a great day. Cheers, cheers.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Foster.\nJames Foster: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Last month marked our one-year anniversary as a public company and Q2 was another record quarter for ZeroFox, where we achieved several major milestones. We delivered strong revenue growth, record ARR, recognized an acceleration on our large customer adoption and generated positive free cash flow for the first time. Furthermore, we announced that we beat our guidance, and we'll raise expectations for the second half of the year. Our ability to consistently deliver results is a direct reflection of our team's discipline, our relentless focus on the customer and our platform's ability to scale with the ever-growing external cybersecurity challenge. I'm going to provide summaries on a few key areas of our performance and continuing progress on our vision. First, I'll review highlights from our Q2 results and the continued demand we see for our external cybersecurity platform. Then I'll spend a few minutes walking you through our growth model. And finally, I'll share key areas of focus for the second half of the year. In Q2, we reported solid results across both top and bottom line metrics. We reported core revenue of $42 million, an increase of 78% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with ARR of $182 million, an increase of 22% year-over-year, and we saw continued momentum in large enterprise wins with a 35% year-over-year growth in subscription customers with ARR greater than $100,000. The Q2 demand environment from both new and existing customers was consistent with prior quarters, except for one exception. We experienced stronger than forecasted demand for our new on-demand response capabilities, which was reflected in our services revenue outperformance. We believe this was driven in part by recent surge and move-in attacks, which have impacted hundreds of organizations to date, and that number is still growing. Customers recognize us as an authoritative organization to help with external cyberattacks and these adversary campaigns are providing us with opportunities to highlight our platform's strengths. We helped one of our customers manage to an incident where over 10 million records were stolen and a brazen ransomware attack. We are operating at a scale that is far beyond most organizations in the cybersecurity industry. According to Mandiant's website, they conduct over 900 Internet response engagements each year on behalf of their customers. Today, we have over 1,100 active response engagements with customers. Our brand recognition, customer trust and proven execution, including our ability to deliver a large on-demand complex programs were factors like enterprise customer deal size is accelerating. Additionally, demand for our platform-based approach remains strong as more organizations look for continuous visibility into their external attack surface, intelligence on external threats and the ability to protect, disrupt and respond to those threats. The modern security Triple Crown includes endpoint security platforms like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne or Trellix combined with a robust perimeter provider like Palo Alto Networks, Zscaler or even Akamai and an external platform like ZeroFox. Nearly all of our customers have some sort of internal perimeter and external security combination protecting their organizations. Simply said, our platform and positioning is increasingly resonating with our customers as they look to consolidate their security stacks with a few proven leaders. Now I'd like to spend a few minutes taking a closer look at an area within our go-to-market model on how we land and expand within customer organizations. Typically, when customers engage with ZeroFox, they are looking to solve specific external cybersecurity problems or use cases. And this is especially true for reactive customers where there have been incidents in the recent past. Examples of common use cases for ZeroFox include protecting an organization's digital footprint with phishing, impersonation or account takeovers, monitoring the dark web for compromised credentials, data leakage or early warning signs of an attack or leveraging threat intelligence data and experts to improve threat prevention, detection and response efforts. ZeroFox addresses these use cases and more through a single unified platform. Our platform capabilities spans four strategic pillars, including protection, intelligence, disruption and response and each of these pillars include multiple modulars that are available for purchase. Examples of our modules include brand protection and domain protection, intelligence search, takedowns and PII removal, digital populars protection and on-demand notifications. When customers purchase our platform, there are two primary factors that drive deal scope and size. The first is the number of digital assets they protect and the second is the number of modules they can purchase to protect those assets. In new deals, it is increasingly common for customers to protect multiple assets and purchase multiple modules. For example, in Q2, the average number of modules purchased in new deals was just over three. And while new deals frequently include multiple assets, the assets being protected typically only represent a small portion of their total digital assets. This white space provides us with future expansion opportunities. In addition to increasing asset volumes, we also have the ability to cross-sell and upsell our customers additional modules. For customers that have found ZeroFox reactively or because they have experienced a security incident, we typically land with one to two modules within our response pillar first as they become introduced to the organization. To put this in perspective, let's walk through a couple of our Q2 deals. The first is a six-figure new customer win with a Fortune 500 company that included several operating lines of business. This customer chose ZeroFox Protect 40 brands 10,000-plus domains and hundreds of additional digital assets. The customer initially purchased 9 modules, including brand, domain, intelligent search, data feeds, takedowns and more. This is a big win for ZeroFox. We also had another six-figure new customer win with a Fortune 500 software company. This customer is also protecting their global footprint, and they purchased eight modules out of the gate. This customer selected ZeroFox to consolidate several of their other external threat intelligence and digital risk protection services point solutions, validating our platform approach. Due in part to the proliferation of ransomware campaigns, Q2, we saw a record number of large deals for our on-demand response services. This included two multi seven-figure deals with Fortune 1000 companies and a seven-figure deal with a new public sector customer. Shifting gears, I'd like to focus on our goals for the second half of the year. We will continue to execute on our strategic plan to expand our platform capabilities, grow our customer base and increase adoption. And we will accomplish this while also further progressing on our path to profitability. From a platform perspective, while we continuously innovate, there are two specific areas I'm going to highlight. Over the last quarter, we made significant progress completing the integration of LookingGlass and finalizing our plans for combining the prospective platform capabilities. We also launched a new free threat intelligence service that we call our daily intelligence brief and have seen some very nice pickup this summer. The second area, and I'm sure you guessed it, is artificial intelligence. As I mentioned last quarter, we have nearly a decade of experience implementing various AI capabilities into our platform. As a reminder, we have over 54 patents issued in our name today, and our innovation program is mature. As adversaries increasingly leverage AI to automate the development of sophisticated attacks, we will continue to evolve the use of our AI to ensure that we can protect our customers. For ZeroFox, this is table stakes. For example, spear phishing attacks via external platforms like social media and chat platforms are becoming exponentially better, and the success rates are rapidly increasing. Attackers that have English as a second language, for example, can now use ChatGPT to perfect a targeted attack against an individual. The days of receiving a poorly worded e-mail from a prince asking me hold a $1 million for them are long gone. Now recent advancements in generative AI and large language models are creating new opportunities for us to increase value by more broadly infusing AI in a different manner across our platform. And we're going to leverage these large language models to provide more contextualized intelligence for our customers, making it easier for them to better assess and understand risk and threats. Our customers will continue to receive the benefit of our innovation program in the quarters like they have over the past several years. While we continue to see a significant growth opportunity in front of us, we also understand the importance of balancing growth with profitability. We were very pleased with our Q2 cash flow performance and we'll continue to drive additional efficiency and leverage into the business in the coming quarters. As Tim will discuss in more detail, we continue to expect that we'll be at or near breakeven in the second half of this year. With that, I want to thank all of our Foxes for their energy, passion and commitment as we continue to protect our customers around the world. Q2 was a record quarter for ZeroFox, and we are moving as fast as we ever have. I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Bender.\nTim Bender: Thanks, Foster. As Foster mentioned, ZeroFox generated strong Q2 results across both top and bottom line metrics. With the exception of revenue and unless otherwise stated, all financial results we will discuss today are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. For Q2, ZeroFox reported revenue of $62.2 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year. Subscription revenue was $23.2 million, including $4.8 million from LookingGlass. Services revenue was $39 million, consisting of $20.7 million of recurring revenue from our strategic government customer and $18.3 million from our on-demand response services. While we expected an improved revenue performance in our services revenue for Q2, our success in capturing large deals with Fortune 500 customers was even stronger than anticipated. Given our Q2 bookings performance, we expect continued strength in services revenue in Q3. Our services business continues to be less predictable when compared to our subscription business. As we look beyond Q3, we would expect services revenue to return to a more normalized historical level. Given the potential for short-term volatility, we would encourage investors to look at the performance of our services business on an annualized basis to assess our performance and growth potential. As of July 31, annual recurring revenue was $182 million. ARR consists of platform subscriptions, a small amount of recurring on-demand services and $83 million from our strategic government contract. We ended the quarter with a record high 1,304 subscription customers. As Foster mentioned, in Q2, we saw continued success winning larger deals. We ended Q2 with 175 customers with ARR greater than $100,000, which represented an increase of 35% year-over-year. Turning to gross margin. For the second quarter, subscription gross margin was 72%, consistent with Q1 and for Q3, we expect subscription gross margin to be consistent with Q2 levels. Services gross margin was 18% compared to 24% in Q1. As we indicated on last quarter's call, we expected this margin to decline from Q1 due to a higher mix of notification services attributable to our Fortune 500 response engagements. The Q2 sequential decline was driven by an even higher-than-expected mix of large deals. Given the continued impact from large deals in Q3, we would expect services gross margin to be relatively consistent with Q2 levels, before returning to more normalized levels. Total gross margin was 38% compared to 43% last quarter. The decline in gross margin was driven by the decrease in services gross margin and the higher mix of services revenue. As we look to Q3, we would expect gross margin to be consistent with Q2 levels with margin improving in subsequent quarters. We continue to see opportunities to improve our overall gross margin as we scale our business and our higher-margin subscription revenue becomes a greater portion of our overall revenue mix. Turning to operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $28.6 million in the quarter. The increase in expenses versus last quarter was driven by continued investments in research and development, including expenses from our acquisition of LookingGlass. G&A expense declined sequentially as we did not incur professional fees for the annual audit, residual leaseback filing requirements and transaction costs in Q2. Our loss from operations was $4.8 million. Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $29 million in cash, $36 million in accounts receivable, $67 million in total deferred revenue and $191 million in total outstanding debt. In Q2, we generated cash flow from operations of $600,000 and free cash flow of approximately $400,000. As expected, our Q2 cash flow performance was positively impacted by the timing of collections from our larger customers and lower professional fees and transaction costs. Now to our outlook. Our outlook assumes no material changes in the macro environment, Demand for our external cybersecurity platform remains consistent and anticipates continued near-term strength within our on-demand services business. For Q3 fiscal year '24, we currently expect revenue to be in the range of $55 million to $57 million and non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $6.2 million to $5.4 million. For fiscal year '24, we currently expect revenue to be in the range of $214 million to $217 million and non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $27 million to $25 million. We continue to focus on profitability. Consistent with what we said last quarter, we expect free cash flow for the remainder of the fiscal year to be at or near breakeven. On a quarterly basis, our cash flow will be impacted by the timing of collections from our large customers. And therefore, we expect cash flow to be negative in Q3, followed by an offsetting positive amount in Q4. We continue to expect that we will achieve quarterly free cash flow on a sustained basis in the second half of fiscal year '25. With that, we'd like to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Gallo with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJoseph Gallo: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question, and congrats on the strong results. Guidance for the year looks like it flows through a little bit more revenue than your 2Q beat. What are you seeing in the market or macro-wise that kind of lends confidence towards doing that? Thanks.\nJames Foster: Hi. Good morning, Joe, thanks for the question. I think we had a stronger than forecasted result in Q2, which we acknowledge and which we announced this morning. And I think what we're seeing here is maybe a slight easing of some of the macro pressures we saw in the beginning part of the year and continued demand for our platform.\nJoseph Gallo: Awesome. And then, Tim, congrats on the free cash flow profitability. How should we think about profitability versus investments for growth or even acquisitions, and then ultimately, kind of combine that with how investors should think about your debt, the maturity or time line of that debt and how those repayments eventually play out. Thanks.\nTim Bender: Thanks for a good question. Well, we acquired LookingGlass just a little over a quarter ago. I think we've got plenty of opportunity to continue to sell into our customer base and realize some upside there in the coming quarters from the expanded platform. So I don't think about our current cash position, our balance sheet strength as being leveraged for acquisitions in the very near term. Although I would say, in general, we have proven to be an acquisitive company acquiring four companies in the last four years. I think maybe to go back to your other point on profitability, I think we said that we would be at or near breakeven for the rest of the year. So yes, we had cash flow positive in Q2, and we see the opportunity to remain kind of right around cash flow positive for the next two quarters. And then we've also put that we'd be cash flow positive on a sustained basis next summer as well. So I think, all in all, we were doing all the things we said we were going to do on the cash flow front. And I think that balanced approach to growth and getting leverage back into our model is the right thing for the business.\nJames Foster: Yes. And Joe, Tim, just to kind of clarify on the one question. We don't have to do anything different in our business model as far as our investments for growth, that's built into our cash flow assumptions. So we're going to continue to invest in sales and marketing and our go-to-market efforts to drive growth, and we think we can do that and manage our operating expenses to deliver the cash flow Foster just mentioned. As it relates to the debt, the large convertible note is out about two years from today, August 2025 is the due date on that. We'll likely continue the same path that we're doing right now as far as the way we're treating the interest via the pick. And listen, we're looking - as our performance continues to strengthen, we'll have conversations around how we want to deal with that as we get further down the road. But right now, 2025, August is when that matures.\nJoseph Gallo: Awesome. Thanks for the color. Congrats guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Reback with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much. A couple of quick ones. The on-demand response business, can you give us a sense of what the profitability on a gross margin perspective looks like there?\nTim Bender: Sure. Thanks, Brad. This is Tim. Historically, we've seen the margins in kind of the mid-20s. This quarter was a little bit lower as we saw some very large deals. We had a couple of deals that were materially or substantively larger than what we've seen in the past or what we used to define as a large deal. We had two deals that were much larger and those compressed margins. So I think as we get back into what would be what we call more normalized deal sizes, we would see those margins start working their way back up. But as we said in Q2 with the beat in the revenue and the large deals that had compression.\nJames Foster: I will double on one thing for you, Brad. I mean we saw some really interesting growth in our six-figure ARR customers that were north of $100,000, which is actually an accelerant over Q1, right? And so I think when large customers call you to help out in their time of need, we're finding that as kind of an early indicator of trust. And that trust we think will continue to lead to larger ongoing relationships with those customers as well. So we like that business, and we like the fact that we are one of the few trusted providers to get those calls in their time of need.\nBrad Reback: That's great. And going back to the debt position, it'd be accurate to say that you have to address that before August of '24, right, before the convert becomes current?\nTim Bender: I think that's a fair assessment. I mean, you don't have to, but I think it's the best interest of all parties that we do that, and we're -- that's something we're actively looking at. I think we have plenty of options there, too.\nBrad Reback: You do think you'll have plenty of options?\nJames Foster: I think this is a really tough debt market, Brad, in general. I mean if you look at the macro, I think anybody would say it'd be foolish to say anything, but that - we've seen some of the highest interest rates that are out there. But I think as long as we continue to perform, we'll have options prior to next August yes.\nBrad Reback: It's great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Yi Fu Lee with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nYi Lee: Good morning Foster and good morning Tim. Congrats on another strong consistent execution quarter and great upside on the free cash flow positive about one year ahead of schedule. Two quick ones for Foster and one quick one for Tim. So Foster, you talk about the Fox principle at the beginning of this fiscal year, standing for focus optimization on the platform and expect in cross-selling. And obviously, we've seen that at play this quarter. I was wondering, like because we hit the half year mark already, if you were to judge on the execution of ZeroFox so far this year, what are some of the things that you think is beyond your expectation and things that ZeroFox needs to focus on going forward?\nJames Foster: I think the will power and fortitude of our employees has just been unbelievable year-to-date. This is not an easy time to be an employee, particularly at a tech company, going through changes, and back to offices and the types of things that are happening in kind of the overall economic situation that we're in around the world. And so, I'm really proud of what our Fox have been able to do here. I mean when I think about the O and Fox Capital, I mean that O an optimization is really just making everything that we do here at ZeroFox better on behalf of our customers. I mean that's our North Star that that we talk about as a company. And I think the Q2 results show that we are getting better and stronger as a company, and it's because of the effort of our employees.\nYi Lee: Okay. I just wanted to follow-up on that, text on the color on that - on the growth opportunities, right, obviously, you guys done a lot of stuff, right? You announced Gen AI deploying these enhancements to bridge response platform to market .NET the Google cloud partnership about two quarters ago, LookingGlass integration, look - it sounds like it's looking good. How would you rank these opportunities like the most impactful upside in the lay term versus in the long-term, what do you think is the most bolus for you in the near term versus long-term? Of all these opportunities or other opportunities I might have missed?\nJames Foster: Yes, I appreciate the contextual questions. Thanks for the follow-up a longer detail. Maybe I'll answer slightly differently, I mean one of the things in our earnings call day is kind of maybe renewed focus or a first time disclosed focused on our models right. And we said that in general new customers that signed up with ZeroFox in Q2 averaged about three modules. And then we spend a little bit of time talking about a couple of customer purchases that had eight or nine modules. So, I think there's a really interesting opportunity for us, continue to make sure that our customers adopt the full breadth, and capability set of our platform. And we'll spend time there in the second half of this year, really making sure that customers adopt the platform, because ultimately, we fundamentally believe, and we've got the metrics to back it up that when you adopt more of our platform, you are better protected, and the results are improved.\nYi Lee: Okay. And then the last one is for Tim. On the financial side, obviously, you guys reached free cash flow positive about a year ahead of our schedule. In terms of like the puts and takes to make this sustainable. What are they like? Like can you give us - is it better cash collection? What's driving this upside we're seeing about a year earlier than expected. And for fiscal '25, did you mean that like fiscal second half, you are free cash flow positive, but first half is more on the negative side? And that's it for us? Thank you from the current team.\nTim Bender: Yes. Listen, I think the basic answer is not so - maybe exactly. It's just really the model is working as we scale. Certainly, acquisition of LookingGlass has helped as we picked up some solid revenue with that. But I think it's really a scale factor as you start to see our ARR is right about $100 million, and we'll cross that in Q3. So it's model scale in that regard. And then I think as far as '25, you're spot on. We do think, and you see in our script, and that there is maybe a little bit of volatility in our working capital throughout the rest of this year. But once we get into the second half of the year, I think some of the timing of working capital between our ARR collections mitigates, and we're into a steady free cash flow position.\nYi Lee: Makes sense. Thanks very much. Tim and Foster. We'll catchup soon. Thanks.\nTim Bender: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ruykhaver with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes, thank you. Good morning. So Foster, those deals that you cited with eight to nine modules out of the gate, were those deals that had been in the pipe for six to nine months or so? Or were they more reactive responses to a breach of an external nature? And maybe broadly, you can just talk about how you think these external issues could impact sales cycles looking out through the fiscal year?\nJames Foster: Yes, I heard a couple of things, Jonathan. A couple of examples I gave, what I call broad adoption of the platform, multiple pillars, multiple modules propeller and what I call long-term relationship, right? Not a near-term reactive response only for those eight or nine modules. Like in general, we've got about a few modules per pillar of our platform. So when I look at customers that are adopting six, seven, eight, nine modules that tells me right off the bat that they've adopted the platform, right? They've adopted multiple pillars. They understand the consolidated vision and approach that we have and they've gone all in on ZeroFox. When I see a customer in general that's bought one or two modules, that means one or two things quickly. It means that they've got a particular use case that's causing them some pain and they want to alleviate that pain as fast as possible. That could be because they've had an incident. That's because they maybe had an issue inside. Maybe they wanted to replace a niche provider, but there's opportunity for us to then sell the platform vision and maybe earn our seat at the table when someone starts off with just a couple of modules before they move into a full platform. So that's - maybe that answers part of the question. I heard kind of how we're thinking about the growth in the second half of the year. I think it's what yield [ph] I mean we're seeing an adoption acceleration for large six-figure ARR customers. And I think that just proves that our - the problems that we're working on continues to grow. I'm a firm believer in cyber. If your ASP is going up and your adoption and your large customers is going up, you're working on a problem that matters. And I'll tell you, external cyber matters. Every CECL continues to be worried about getting attacked halfway around the world by nation state actors by cyber-criminal groups, they're less worried about an insider threat issue. I remember, 15 years ago, that was kind of top worry, that's not the number 1 we're earn more. And external attack is what's keeping these guys up at night, and we think we're in the right place at the right time.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes, it's not like what you're saying is the demand trends are pretty strong across the entire platform. And so I guess, along those lines, how do you - how do you see the sales organization equipped to sell across protection intelligence disruption? Are they fully up to speed on handling each one of those pillars? Or is there work that you need to do there to kind of drive that execution of a more platform sale?\nJames Foster: I don't think we've ever done, Jonathan. I mean I'm a believer in consistent training and consistent enablement. I mean, the analogy here we used some of the best athletes or the best performers of all time, still trained daily. And so even if you reach the peak and what you do, you're the best quarter back to ever play, you're the best ever play your sport antennas, you still practice daily to get better. And I think our team on our go-to-market side of the house, we think is best-in-class for our space, but that's because we're - unless we focused on continuing to improve them. I would say, though, our efforts in the channel always lag our internal sales team. So there is certainly more we can do there. We're still the baby on the block, right? We're still the smallest cyber company out there. We're still the last one to go public. And so, we don't have the footprint of some of the other peers that we have out there that's envious to us right now. And so, we've got to continue to build brand awareness, and our channel continue to enable the channel, and make sure they understand our differentiated platform and approach.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Makes a ton of sense. Thank you.\nJames Foster: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Foster for any closing remarks.\nJames Foster: Thank you, operator. And as you can tell, we had a record Q2. We remain excited about the opportunities in front of us for the second half of the year. So again, thank you for joining us on the call this morning, and have a wonderful Wednesday. Cheers.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

Please refer to the tables in our earnings release and the Investor Relations portion of our website for a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Foster.\nJames Foster: Thanks, Todd. Good morning, everyone. I am really excited to speak to you today. ZeroFox got off to a strong start to the fiscal year with Q1 revenue exceeding the high end of our guidance range. I'm proud of what our team was able to accomplish given the continued uncertain macro environment and a very busy quarter for ZeroFox. In Q1, we hosted our company and sales kickoffs, announced an exciting new partnership with Google Cloud, launched our large language model capabilities at the RSA security conference, and we completed our acquisition of LookingGlass. Today, I'm going to provide you with summaries on a few key areas of our performance and continuing vision. To begin, we'll provide an overview of our Q1 results and the continued demand we see for our external cybersecurity platform. Second, we'll walk through some key customer wins that demonstrate continued success, adding large enterprise customers and cross-selling our multiple platform pillars. And third, I'll talk about our partnership with Google Cloud and our recent acquisition of LookingGlass, both of which strengthen our platform capabilities. We had a very nice start to the year. We ended the quarter with ARR of $178 million, which represents 24% year-over-year growth. We also saw another record quarter for total subscription customers where we ended the quarter with 1,251 recurring customers. And lastly, we saw continued strength in our large deals with 31% year-over-year growth in subscription customers with ARR greater than $100,000 per year. Overall, we continue to see healthy demand for our external cybersecurity platform from both new and existing customers. The Q1 demand environment was consistent with prior quarters and, thus far, is remaining more stable than the macro environment. We attribute our experience to this resiliency to that of the industry, the emerging nature of the external cybersecurity category and our go-to-market execution. The external cyber security challenge for organizations around the world continues to increase due to the attack sophistication and volume we are seeing. Specifically, we see that organizations are struggling with the sheer fact that the external attack surface for every company continues to increase. These organizations have limited visibility into its attack surface and it's not protected by traditional security controls. And finally, threats of this external attack surface, including phishing attacks, impersonations and account takeovers are increasing in automation and, thus, again, like I said, overall attack volume. The result is that organizations are increasing investment in external cybersecurity solutions with a clear preference for a platform-based approach. This aligns well with the vision driving our ZeroFox external cyber security platform, which fuses together AI-powered analysis, advanced analytics, intelligence, and automated protection to solve the external cyber challenges; the dawn of artificial intelligence for cybersecurity and the masses is finally here. AI has been a critical component of our platform at ZeroFox since inception, where we have a robust intellectual property and innovation program and over 54 patents already issued to date. For example, we have long used capabilities like natural language processing and computer vision to detect sophisticated threats. A couple of examples of using NLP to identify written languages and sentiment, or leveraging advanced AI and computer vision to identify hidden threats in high-rich media content within images and video. There is no doubt that recent advancements in generative AI and large language models will have significant impacts on the cybersecurity industry. Extending upon our program and this trend, we launched FoxGPT in Q1, which is a material advancement for our program, like I said, where we have begun to deploy a new large language model into our platform. FoxGPT optimizes security analyst workflows by accelerating the analysis and summarization of threat intelligence across large data sets. For defenders, it means that leveraging ZeroFox AI to detect and disrupt threats becomes even more critical and it saves them time. AI will be key to increasing the efficiency of security operations and reducing the time to respond to attacks. And with automation, the time to respond continues to shrink. For adversaries, it makes life easier for them. They now can develop more sophisticated threats in areas like phishing, fraud, social engineering and spam. Quite honestly, ChatGPT makes it much easier to create a written attack. Like we have always done, we will track our adversaries so that we can continue to fight back on behalf of our customers. Now, I'd like to highlight a couple of key customer wins that we believe validate the strength of our platform and market leadership position. One of these wins was a six-figure deal with a Fortune 500 media company. This customer was looking to protect hundreds of brands, social media accounts and executives from impersonations, fraud, scams and piracy. They also invested in ZeroFox's continuous dark web monitoring and on-demand investigations products. The customer selected ZeroFox because of our comprehensive platform capabilities across multiple pillars, including protection and intelligence, and our ability to quickly operationalize our platform. This was a competitive win where we displaced a legacy digital risk protection managed service provider. Another key win was a six-figure deal with a Fortune 500 real estate company. This customer wanted actionable threat intelligence to seamlessly integrate into their environment given the relentless external attacks they were experiencing, and they invested in protection across all of our platform pillars. Two quarters ago, we launched our strategic ZeroFox on-demand response platform capabilities, which includes brief response, incident response and on-demand intelligence capabilities. In Q1, we experienced strong demand across all of these areas and we were actively engaged with approximately 1,200 on-demand customers. Additionally, we had multiple large response deals that were more heavily weighted towards the end of the quarter. While the timing of these deals slightly impacted our Q1 services revenue, as Tim will discuss in more detail shortly, we believe we are set up for a strong response revenue performance in Q2. And furthermore, the overall demand for these capabilities continues to give us confidence of our fiscal year guidance. In Q1, we made further progress driving synergies between ZeroFox Response and our other platform pillars. For example, while engaged with the global medical technology company on a platform opportunity, the customer had an urgent requirement for on-demand incident response and intelligence services. We were able to demonstrate immediate value to the customer with ZeroFox Response, which serves as a positive influencer and the customer signing a six-figure platform deal to protect multiple brands and digital assets. While engaged with a large restaurant company for a data breach response, we were also able to cross-sell them ZeroFox Protection and Disruption. And last quarter, we talked about a Fortune 50 media and technology company that engaged with ZeroFox Response for the first time over their legacy incumbent provider. In Q1, we signed a six figure on-demand breach response deal with this customer, which represented a 7x increase in their ZeroFox Response investment quarter-over-quarter. Overall, I am pleased with the meaningful progress of our expanding platform and our ability to become a true cybersecurity ally for our customers. Our customers are looking for opportunities to consolidate on our platform. Let's shift our attention to two recent announcements we made in Q1: first, our partnership with Google Cloud; and second, the acquisition of LookingGlass. Both of these expand our platform capabilities and increase our value to customers. In April, we announced our partnership with Google Cloud, where ZeroFox was the first enterprise partner to integrate our external protection and intelligence capabilities with the Google Cloud Web Risk Service. This service protects end users across 5 billion devices from malicious URLs and targeted attacks. This partnership further strengthens our market-leading disruption capabilities and improves our relationship with Google. We also announced our acquisition of LookingGlass, a leader in external attack surface management and vulnerability intelligence. This acquisition accelerates our platform roadmap and external attack service management, an area that we believe is strategic to external cyber security. LookingGlass also provides us with powerful attack surface technology, including its comprehensive Internet asset and data lake. Integrating these capabilities into our platform will accelerate our ability to provide complete visibility across all Internet-facing assets regardless of type or location. LookingGlass's technology is battle tested and is being used by very large sophisticated organizations, including strategic public sector customers. We believe that strengthening our attack service management capabilities will increase the strategic value of our platform and increase our growth opportunities with existing customers. This acquisition also increases our TAM. IDC has estimated that quickly growing EASM market will hit nearly $1 billion in revenue by 2026. Additionally, this acquisition provides us with other benefits, including, but not limited to, strengthening and expanding our public sector opportunity, increasing the scale of our revenue and we believe it will positively impact our path to profitability and cash flow breakeven. We are making rapid progress with the integration. I look forward to providing you with updates in the coming quarters. This summer, we will continue to focus on executing our strategic plan to lead and grow our external cybersecurity platform capabilities and customer base and success here will be reflected in our quarterly performance metrics. We will also continue to optimize our infrastructure to support our long-term growth while laying the foundation to drive operational efficiencies and leverage. And lastly, we'll deliver more meaningful synergies across our platform, including improving our overall cross selling efforts. I want to thank all of our Foxes around the world for their energy, passion and commitment as we continue to execute on our initiatives and the opportunity in front of us. In short, Q1 was a strong start to the year and we remain very optimistic about the next few quarters. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Bender.\nTim Bender: Thanks, Foster. As Foster mentioned, ZeroFox started fiscal year '24 on a positive note. Our Q1 results include nine days of operations from LookingGlass as the acquisition closed on April 21. With the exception of revenue and unless otherwise stated, all financial results we will discuss today are non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP results can be found in our earnings release. For Q1, ZeroFox reported revenue of $45.5 million, including approximately $500,000 of revenue from LookingGlass. Subscription revenue was $18.2 million and included the $500,000 of revenue from LookingGlass. Services revenue was $27.3 million, consisting of $20.7 million of recurring revenue from our strategic government customer and $6.6 million from our on-demand response services. In the past calls, we have discussed the potential volatility of our on-demand response services. As Foster mentioned, we experienced this volatility in Q1 as we closed a multi seven-figure response deal at the end of the quarter. While the timing of deals negatively impacted on-demand response revenue in Q1, Q2's services revenue is positioned to achieve significant growth. As of April 30, our annual recurring revenue was $178 million, which included approximately $19 million of ARR from LookingGlass. ZeroFox ARR consists of our platform subscriptions, a small amount of recurring on-demand services, and $83 million from our strategic government contract. We ended the quarter with a record high 1,251 subscription customers. We continue to see a significant opportunity to both land new customers and expand platform capabilities and response services within our existing customer base. As Foster mentioned, in Q1, we saw continued success winning larger deals. Subscription customers with ARR greater than $100,000 increased 31% year-over-year. Turning to gross margin. For the first quarter, subscription gross margin was 72%. As expected, subscription gross margin decreased slightly from last quarter's 73% level due to the timing of our investments, which tend to be more heavily weighted towards the first half of our fiscal year. Given continued investments we will make in Q2, we would expect subscription gross margin to remain constant and then increase in the second half of fiscal year '24. While there is a potential for quarter-to-quarter volatility, our goal was to deliver consistent, moderate subscription gross margin improvement on an annual basis, as we have done for several years. Services gross margin was 24% compared to 23% in Q4 '23. The services gross margin increase was driven by the higher mix of revenue attributable to the platform-based component of response services. For Q2, we expect services gross margin to decline 300 basis points to 400 basis points from Q1 levels due to a higher mix of notification and enrollment services attributable to our large response engagements. Total gross margin was 43% compared to 41% last quarter. The improvement in total gross margin was driven by the higher mix of subscription revenue and the services gross margin increase. As we look to Q2, we expect total gross margin to decline as a result of the expected sequential decline in services gross margin. We continue to see opportunities to improve our overall gross margin as we scale our business, drive greater cost efficiencies and our higher-margin subscription revenue becomes a greater portion of our overall revenue mix. Turning to operating expenses. Total operating expenses were $28 million in the quarter, including approximately $400,000 of expenses from LookingGlass. The increase in expenses was primarily driven by continued investments in sales and marketing and research and development, as well as expected increases in G&A due to the timing of fees for our annual audit, residual de-SPAC related filing requirements and transaction costs related to the LookingGlass acquisition. Our loss from operations was $8.4 million. Looking at the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $28 million in cash, $46 million in accounts receivable, $66 million in total deferred revenue and $188 million in total outstanding debt. Cash flow used in operations was $18 million. Our Q1 cash flow was impacted by the timing of collections from our large government customer and transaction costs related to the acquisition of LookingGlass. We expect cash flow to significantly rebound in Q2, and the key takeaway here is that our overall cash flow expectations for the first half of fiscal year '24 are in line with our plan. Now to our outlook. Our guidance reflects our Q1 performance and incorporates the operations of LookingGlass. Our outlook also assumes no material changes in the macro environment. Demand for our external cybersecurity platform remains consistent and anticipates volatility within our services business. Our outlook also incorporates my prior commentary regarding the services gross margin for Q2. For Q2 of fiscal year '24, we currently expect revenue to be in the range of $51.5 million to $52.5 million, and non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $8.3 million to $7.7 million. For the fiscal year '24, we currently expect revenue to be in the range of $198 million to $202 million, and non-GAAP loss from operations to be in the range of $28 million to $26 million. We continue to focus on the path to profitability. We expect free cash flow for the remainder of the fiscal year to be near breakeven. Additionally, we now expect that we will achieve free cash flow on a sustained basis in the second half of fiscal year '25. With that, we'd like to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Joseph Gallo with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJoseph Gallo: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. I might have missed it. But did -- Tim, could you give the inorganic impacts for revenue to guidance? I know you noted the $500,000 of revenue in the quarter from LookingGlass, but just anything you can help with there? And then, you also noted some services linearity. Was there any subscription linearity in the quarter? And then, just anything as it relates to macro and maybe incremental macro that you might have seen versus 4Q?\nTim Bender: Yes. Thanks, Joe. I heard three questions. So, let me -- I think the first one was, if we carved out the LookingGlass piece. We expect revenue in the $14 million to $15 million range for the full year. And then, as it relates to subscription linearity, that stayed pretty constant. We saw consistent growth as we've seen in previous quarters. So, it didn't have any lumpiness that we saw in the services revenue. And then, from a macro standpoint, I'll let Foster jump in on this one.\nJames Foster: Yes, Joe, I think from a macro standpoint, we saw maybe a little more steady of environment than we were expecting. We saw consistent and kind of healthy demand off of Q4 in Europe, for example. And I think we continue to take a very conservative outlook in some of the emerging markets of the world. And as of today, continue to be surprised in the resiliency we're seeing from some of those emerging markets. It could also just be a law of small numbers, which we appreciate, too.\nJoseph Gallo: And then, maybe for you, Foster, just as it relates to AI, congrats on FoxGPT. You seem better positioned than most to kind of potentially monetize AI. I guess from your view, is AI table stakes for the cybersecurity industry? Or maybe just talk through, is there a monetization path of FoxGPT? And how we should think about those model implications?\nJames Foster: Well, look, I appreciate the question. Maybe a couple of thoughts. ZeroFox has got pretty robust intellectual property and innovation program; we have since day one. We've got 54 patents already issued in our name today with more than a dozen in the works. And so, I think for some folks that have taken products to market and don't have a real intellectual property program, I think this is going to be a tough lift for them. The large language models, generative AI, which everybody is talking about, they're not the easiest models today to apply to big data sets. I think folks that don't have backgrounds in data science and maybe even advanced algorithmic computing in their platforms, they're going to struggle with this. I don't know, we've had kind of a program in place for a long time. I mentioned it in [indiscernible], where we've used computer vision, NLP and other types of AI in our platform for several years now. So, I think this is a natural extension of what we've been doing. And to go back to maybe your prefix there, I do believe that AI as a, what I'd call, just a core feature set, will be required in cybersecurity for years to come. It's just where we're going. And the platforms that don't figure it out will be at a meaningful disadvantage and the platforms that have the ability to invest and are capitalized to invest in it, will see, I think, a real acceleration. And it will probably take one to two years to get real separation from those that have and those that can't.\nJoseph Gallo: Makes a ton of sense. Thanks, guys, and congrats on closing the deal.\nJames Foster: Hey, thanks a lot, Joe.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jonathan Ruykhaver with Cantor. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes. Hey, guys, congrats on the strong results overall. I'm wondering if you could just dig down a bit more into the strength with the plus-$100,000 customers. Just talk about that success in terms of the go-to-market, the initial land, what are the specific products driving that success, and has there been any change there in that motion over the last couple of quarters?\nJames Foster: Hey, good morning, Jonathan. There has been, right? I mean, we've only been public since August of last year. We adopted our multi-pillar platform strategy as an organization in Q3 of last year. And so, as with any kind of new strategy, one that launches additional products or capabilities, it just takes a little bit of time. And I think what we're seeing here is we are seeing really continued nice adoption of multiple capabilities within the ZeroFox platform. And I think that is increasing our large customer spend. I think the other part, which I'd love to take full credit for but can't in earnest is that the size of the problem that we're going after is predicating some real additional spend. If you think about the size of the problem, the external cyber escape and the fact that still most enterprise organizations don't have full visibility of what their external attack surface looks like and without visibility, they can't control or protect it, it's really requiring them to spend maybe a little bit ahead of what they thought, and that's why we're seeing some really nice growth in our large customers. I think the last thing I'd put in there is we're seeing more and more consolidation opportunities with our customers. Maybe it's a little bit given the macro environment, maybe it's given the maturity of our platform and company. We've hit size and scale. We're the only dedicated external cyber security company to be public right now. And so, I think our customers are getting more confidence in our abilities and they've seen it first hand over the last few years, where they feel more comfortable investing at a higher rate than maybe they did when we were start-up and still in high-growth mode.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes. And I guess, as a follow-up...\nTim Bender: Jonathan, this is Tim. Just adding more to it, we saw those $100,000 customers come from all industries and sectors, too. So, what's nice is we still have a strength in financial services, but we're seeing large customers across all industries and verticals. So that's further success that we're seeing in the large customer wins.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Okay. No, that's great. And then, just in terms of the consumption trends across the platform and the four key pillars, are you seeing that success within a discrete pillar specifically? Because protection has always been the strongest one. Is that where you're seeing the larger consumption, or is it across those pillars?\nJames Foster: I think protection continues to be kind of our foundation. It's what we've been doing as an organization the longest and it gives us opportunities to kind of land and protection and expand into our intelligence disruption and response pillars. I think that's the motion we've set up for this year, and we're seeing some success there.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes, okay. And just the last question for me, just a follow-on to the previous question on AI. It just seems to me that AI-enabled fraud and the consumerization of the ability of these adversaries to get involved in the game, if you want to call it that, but it just fundamentally changes the enterprise attack surface even more than what we see today. And it just seems to me that external security market, as a category, just becomes even more strategic. I'm just kind of curious, are you seeing that yet in terms of adversarial tactics and what are your thoughts on that broad issue?\nJames Foster: We are. I mean, I think one of the terms that we continue to kind of advise our customers on is that it is beyond the human eye in terms of visibility of determining attack versus real for the most part now. And maybe I'll give you two concrete examples to try to drive this home. One, like deepfake is at a point now where a deepfake will look as good as a real video. And so, an automated created deepfake video of an executive or an individual will look, feel and for all intent purpose be as good as a real video. And so, it's really hard to distinguish that. And then, second, as simple as it may sound, ChatGPT will, I think, change the security landscape where there will be less emphasis on training over time and more emphasis back on protection. And we've seen cycles, at least seen cycles in the last 20 years, where training has been in vogue and then protections in vogue and then trainings in vogue. Well, ChatGPT now can allow anybody in the world to create a perfect spear phishing e-mail without typos, without somebody to say, \"Wire me all your fund.\" You will get perfect e-mails in ChatGPT that will bypass a lot of training. And so, I think you're going to need to have real sophisticated external protections in place to combat some of these very acute and very targeted attacks. I think we are set up really well to execute upon this opportunity.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Marc Bachner with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMarc Bachner: Great. Thank you. This is Marc on for Brad Reback. Just wanted to ask about the IDX cross sales. I know you guys had your sales kickoff in late March. So, just kind of early results into seeing how that's kicking off? And then, also, obviously, LookingGlass and IDX both have a public sector component. So, I wanted to see what kind of synergies you're expecting there? And as that grows, a little bit of an outlook in terms of the public sector? Thank you.\nJames Foster: Yes, good morning, Marc. Thanks. A couple of thoughts, and I'll address them in order. So, one was on kind of the IDX cross-sell and how we're doing. Thanks for reminding the crowd that we did have our sales kickoff here in Q1. And so, part of our synergies that we communicated last time was that we were going to have our sales kickoff in Q1. We did that. We also had a company kickoff. And that was really setting the foundation and rhythm for us to drive those cross-sells. And we've started to see some really nice progress. I think we mentioned in our earnings call that there is some really nice deals that we saw come over. One in particular was a deal that we talked about last earnings call, where it was a starter deal and a response pillar, primarily from the IDX side of the house, plus some of the new organic capabilities we're building into that pillar now. And that quarter-over-quarter, this Fortune 500 customer, increased their spend with us on the response side of the house 7x. And so, we are very happy with that. And this customer has been a ZeroFox customer for over half a decade. So, I think that's the type of motion that we're starting to see where the awareness that we're driving into our customer base is leading to revenue opportunities. I would also say that this awareness will be rhythmic over quarters to come. I don't expect huge spikes in Q2 or Q3. I expect this to be long-term sustained increases in awareness and revenue between these pillars. And so, I like what I see there. And then, I heard a question now on public sector, if I get it wrong, keep me honest. But, are we seeing any public sector synergies, especially where given LookingGlass' kind of core customer capability set. And I think that will play out over time. My experience, public sector are longer sales cycles. They certainly have, in general, longer contract terms. And so that's the risk-reward model that's out there. We really like the customers that they brought to the table. They've been long-term, healthy customers, and they're using it at the platform at scale, and that will give us some really interesting opportunities. I don't expect any near-term big wins in the public sector synergy side of the house, just it takes time to go through those motions, but we do have a really nice healthy pipeline there.\nMarc Bachner: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Yi Fu Lee with Cantor. Your line is open.\nYi Fu Lee: Hello. Good morning, Foster and Tim. And I also wanted to extend my congratulations on the strong start to fiscal '24. So, my question is more on the pipeline generation. We know you have the sales kickoff the past quarter. I was wondering like, Foster, Tim, can you comment on the pipeline outlook right now as compared to, like, let's say, six months ago or 12 months ago? Any commentary, positive, negative, the same?\nJames Foster: I mean, I'll give you some kind of high-level qualitative commentary. Our pipeline today is bigger than it's ever been in company history. Why don't we start there. I think, as I mentioned in the very first question, we continue to be very calculated and conservative in our growth planning this year given the uncertain macro. But I think, in general, the last two quarters, Yi, we've been slightly surprised about some of the resiliency in those emerging markets in particular. I think we've done a nice job here in North America, where we've seen the markets kind of remain optimistically steady for us in our sector. And overseas, we've still seen some healthy demand. And I think there's just a kind of mixed signals we continue to watch where there's economic uncertainty in particular, industries and sectors, especially in countries within Eastern and Western Europe. But at the same time, I think there's a heightened threat environment over there. And so, people are looking at security differently than maybe some of the other areas in productivity or IT where there's maybe an option to push. We're finding opportunities where people aren't using that option to push, they're continuing with their plans. So...\nYi Fu Lee: Okay. And then, Foster, as a follow-up, I know like LookingGlass is included in the guidance, Tim -- like on the guidance. I was wondering on the Google Cloud opportunity, when do you think like monetization will take place in this? It looks significant. It's 5 billion devices and people using billions of browsers, right? So, I wanted to get your outlook on that one.\nJames Foster: We're seeing increased opportunities with some of our larger customers and partners given those capabilities right now. When we announced our integration kind of being first to market with Google Cloud, we are pretty excited. We saw some nice traction here in Q1 about interest and demand. And so, I would expect us to have more announcements in the quarters to come. But I would say, in general, with most enterprise quality deals and certainly, what we're doing with Google is an enterprise scale application, it will take a little bit of time to kind of get into the full pipe and turn into revenue. I call it that the ZeroFox internal mantra here is roadmap to revenue. And so, we've got it off the roadmap, and we're working on the revenue side with that.\nYi Fu Lee: Excellent, Foster. And one last one for Tim is, like on the financing refresher, I know $28 million in cash, $46 million AR, [$60] (ph) million in deferred revenue. I was wondering if you could like reiterate, give us a refresher on the financing lease? Like I know you mentioned fiscal -- next year, fiscal '25, you're going to inflect cash flow positive, right? Do you think -- and you said you don't need any more external financing, right, to get there and the cash is enough. Is this still the same at this stage right now?\nTim Bender: Yes. Thanks, Yi. That's absolutely right. We feel like we have the capital necessary to get to that sustained cash flow in the latter part of next year, and we feel confident in our ability to get there.\nYi Fu Lee: Okay. Thank you, gentlemen, and we look forward to hosting you next Wednesday at our Cantor [Tech] (ph) Conference. Have a good day.\nJames Foster: Yes, see you next week, Yi.\nOperator: I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Foster for closing remarks.\nJames Foster: Thank you, operator. As you can tell, we are excited about the strong start to the fiscal year and the opportunity in front of us. We are looking forward to seeing some of you today at Stifel's CSI Conference and next week at the Cantor Tech Conference in New York. So, again, good morning, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. Cheers.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
