At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Phibro Animal Health Corporation Second Quarter Investor Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and answer-session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Dick Johnson, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nRichard Johnson: Thank you, Regina, and welcome to the Phibro Animal Health Corporation Earnings Call for our fiscal second quarter ended December 31, 2023. As we said, my name is Dick Johnson, I'm the Interim Chief Financial Officer of Phibro Animal Health. I'm joined today by Jack Bendheim, Phibro's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; by Daniel Bentheim, Director and Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy and also by Glenn David, the Incoming Chief Financial Officer. Today, we'll cover financial performance for our second quarter and provide an update on our financial guidance for our fiscal year ending June 2024. At the conclusion of our remarks, we'll open the line for questions. I'd like to remind you that we're providing a simultaneous webcast of this call on our website, pahc.com and also on the Investors section of our website. You'll find copies of the earnings press release and second quarter Form 10-Q as well as later today, the transcript and slides that we're discussing on our call this morning. Turning to Slide 2. Our remarks today will include our standard forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements section in our earnings press release. Our remarks include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or US GAAP. I refer you to the non-GAAP financial information section on our earnings press release for a discussion of these measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures are included in the financial tables that accompany the earnings press release. We present our results on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude acquisition-related items, unusual, non-operational or nonrecurring items, which would include things like stock-based compensation and in this most recent quarter, Brazil employment taxes item. Also, other income and expense is separately reported in the P&L including foreign currency losses and also income taxes related to any of those pre-tax income adjustments and any other unusual or nonrecurring income tax items. So with that out of the way, let me introduce our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jack Bendheim, to share his opening remarks. Jack?\nJack Bendheim: Thank you, Dick, and thank you to everyone joining us this morning. Our second quarter showed the resilience of our business and was a positive step-up compared with our first quarter. Our core Animal Health business grew net sales at a healthy 6%, and I was especially pleased to see that adjusted EBITDA also grew at 6%, led by high-value new product introductions in our vaccine product line. A strong 31% increase in net sales of vaccines led the way for Animal Health. We are seeing the uptake of our vaccines across various regions, especially in South America. We have launched new commercial vaccines and have the added benefit of a new attached facility -- vaccine facility in Brazil. Looking ahead, we expect the continuing growth in the Animal Health business in the second half of the year. We also expect to see significant improvement in our Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products businesses as we work through inventory imbalances and as we see a rebound in demand. We have affirmed our guidance for net sales, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS, as Dick will go into in greater detail at the end of his presentation. We are continuing to invest behind our successes. We're looking to introduce additional vaccines in the Americas and have just had our best sales of a new line of nutritional specialty products for poultry here in the United States. We see vaccines, nutritional specialties and companion animal as continued growth opportunities and we're making the necessary investments to enable us to achieve our targets. I'm also pleased to welcome Glen David to Phibro as Chief Financial Officer. As we recently announced, Glenn brings over 30 years of experience in commercial and financial leadership roles, including a wealth of knowledge in the animal health industry. He brings the capabilities needed to contribute to Phibro's future success and to bring value to our shareholders. I look forward to having your questions following Dick's review of our financials. But before I hand it back to him, I want to express my gratitude today for agreeing to step in as interim CFO. As a company, we do not miss a beat. Thanks to Dick's quick return to action, and I'm thrilled that Dick will continue to be available [indiscernible] Glenn and assist Phibro as a whole. Dick?\nRichard Johnson: Thanks, Jack. So let me start with the consolidated financial performance on Slide 4, and then we'll move on to segment level performance and some other information. Consolidated net sales for the quarter were just under $250 million and that was an increase of $5.3 million or 2% over the same quarter of a year ago. The Animal Health segment grew 6%, while both Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products saw sales decline. GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS decreased driven by a substantial increase in foreign exchange losses, mostly from a major devaluation in Argentina, also driven by higher operating expenses that we referred to as selling, general and administrative expenses that included a $4.2 million charge for a Brazil employment tax issue. And third, increased interest expense driven by higher variable interest rates. Income taxes were a partial offset as they decreased $2.6 million. After making our standard adjustments to GAAP results, including the items I named earlier. Overall, adjusted EBITDA decreased $1.5 million compared to the year earlier. Animal Health adjusted EBITDA improved by $2.2 million or 6% driven by gross profit from increased sales but partially offset by higher operating expenses. Mineral Nutrition decreased almost $1 million driven by unfavorable inventory cost and slight decline in volumes. Performance Products decreased $1.5 million year-over-year due to lower product demand and unfavorable product mix. And finally, we spent more in our corporate expenses. We spent $1.3 million more than last year, which was driven by a planned increase in strategic investments. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS declined 2%, respectively, reflecting the changes in adjusted EBITDA and the higher interest expense due to the higher variable interest rates. The effective income tax rate improved, and it was a partial offset to the negatives. Now looking at Slide 5 and moving to segment-level financial performance. And let's first look at Animal Health. The Animal Health segment posted sales of about $173 million. That was an increase of over $9 million or 6% over the prior year. And within that Animal Health segment, we saw sales increase, especially in vaccines, as vaccine sales grew $7 million, a healthy 31% increase driven by product launches in poultry products introduced into Latin America, plus we saw an increase in domestic demand. In our MFAs and other category, net sales grew $4.8 million or 5% and due to demand in various international regions and also continuing growth for in demand for our processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry. Nutritional specialties net sales declined in the quarter by $2.4 million or about 6%, mostly due to reduced demand from the domestic dairy business. All of that drove Animal Health adjusted EBITDA of about $39 million, also a 6% increase as the higher gross profit from increased sales was partially offset by increased SG&A. Now moving to the other business segments on Slide 6, starting with Mineral Nutrition. Net sales for the quarter were $61 million, a slight decrease from last year due to a decline in average selling prices and also some reduction in sales volume. Mineral Nutrition adjusted EBITDA was $3.5 million, reflecting a year-on-year decrease of $900,000 as we worked through some unfavorable inventory positions. Looking at our Performance Products segment, net sales of $15.5 million for the three months reflect a $3.7 million or a 19% decline driven by reduced demand for personal care product ingredients and for industrial chemicals. Adjusted EBITDA was $800,000 for the quarter a decline of $1.5 million compared to the prior year, largely reflecting reduced sales and also reflecting unfavorable product mix. Corporate expenses increased $1.3 million driven by the planned increased strategic investments. Now if we turn to the capitalization-related metrics on Page 7, we saw positive free cash flow. And for the trailing 12 months, we now have generated positive free cash flow of $37 million, which is comprised of $74 million from operating cash flow and then invested $37 million in capital expenditures. And as a result, we ended December with cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments with $92 million on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Our gross leverage ratio was 4.4 times at the end of the quarter based on $476 million of total debt and $108 million of trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with our history, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.12 a share or $4.9 million in the aggregate. And as a reminder, about -- as a reminder, $300 million of our debt is at a fixed rate of 61 basis points plus an applicable margin of 1.75%. The remaining amount of our debt, or $176 million, is subject to variable interest rates, although offset somewhat by interest earned on our excess cash and short-term investments. Now looking at our guidance for the full year, we have affirmed our guidance for net sales for adjusted EBITDA and for adjusted diluted EPS. So no changes to those measures. We have updated our guidance for the GAAP measures to reflect recent developments, which would include that Brazil employment taxes issue additional foreign currency losses, again, mostly coming out of Argentina devaluation and then some other smaller items and the related income tax effects of those things. So in closing, we are optimistic as we enter the second half of our fiscal year. We're confident on our demand for our products around the world and look forward to seeing continued improvement in our business as we move forward. And with that, operator, let's please open the line for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nErin Wright: Great, thanks. Can you give us an update on just underlying demand trends and how you're thinking about fundamentals in some of the key livestock categories for you like poultry and dairy? And what are you expecting over the next 6 to 12 months across those categories? Thanks.\nJack Bendheim: Hi. Good morning, Erin, short question, long answer. So we are seeing around the world positive trends, I mean, the underlying [indiscernible] sort of lines have sort of come back to historic positions. One is demand has returned. I mean the effect of COVID. I think we're finally seeing coming to the end in terms of imbalances and inventory and cost of inventory, people sort of returning to -- whether it's the restaurants or schools, et cetera, et cetera. So the normal buyers have returned or returning to the market. Same time, the most important ingredient in raising animals is cost of feed, and we see a decline in both the cost of soybeans and corn, which is we turn profitability pretty much across the board. I mean, there's still some outliers, which will take some time like the dairy industry in the states. But even that, the trend is in the right direction. So and that's one of the reasons they've said we're positive. We're seeing good sales in all regions, increasing sales and we're seeing price increases holding. So again it's a reason we're optimistic.\nErin Wright: Okay. Thanks. And then adjusted EBITDA margin was strong in Animal Health. Is that just a function of the mix dynamic with the strength in the vaccines or what drove that? And you mentioned price, is that going to go kind of quantify what you're realizing in terms of price did you take another price increase at the beginning of the year in terms of your Animal Health business? Thanks.\nRichard Johnson: Yes. It's all those things, Erin. Certainly, we're seeing favorable product mix. Within Animal Health vaccines, in general, have the highest margins. So as we grow that part of our business, we're getting that favorable benefit, and that's allowing us to continue to build the business with -- by making very targeted expense investments in people mostly in certain markets, but we're able to offset that expense increment. So that's why the improvement. And I think as we grow going forward, it's reasonable to expect the kind of bottom line growth at least equal as in percentage terms to the top line growth.\nErin Wright: Okay. That's helpful. And then just if I could sneak one more in here. Like there was a recent deal on the tape for Elanco's aquaculture business to Merck. And Merck is already larger in that space, obviously, but does this change anything from a competitive standpoint for you? How big is -- or what's your commitment to your aquaculture business? Or how big is that now? Thanks.\nJack Bendheim: So we are committed, but it's a small business. So the movement of the products from Elanco to Merck will have no effect on our business.\nErin Wright: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nMikaela Franceschina: Hi. This is Mikaela on for Balaji. Thanks for taking our question. Just two for me. Can you first just remind us of how Rejensa has been tracking? And following up on the previous question, I guess, could you just talk a little bit more specifically about geographies and species that are standing out and the outlook for the rest of the year? Thanks so much.\nDaniel Bendheim: Hi. It's Daniel. I'll take the Rejensa question. We actually did not call out this year's specific guidance with regard to Rejensa in our annual. So it's part of the nutritional specialties. It continues to grow nicely, double-digit growth. But other than that, for competitive reasons, we don't call out more specifics.\nRichard Johnson: Species and geographies.\nJack Bendheim: Species and geographies. In general, poultry accelerates always across the world. For economic, for religious reasons. And we're seeing that in most of the geographies we're in for ourselves. We are increasingly focused on the cattle business. So cattle is forming a more important part of our business, but still a small relative ex US anyway, and it's dairy relative to the United States.\nMikaela Franceschina: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [indiscernible] on for Mike. Thanks for taking the questions. I was wondering, beyond the hit to the P&L, are you seeing any changes in customer behavior related to the drop in the Argentina peso? Do you have any expectation for how the impact to operations could play out based on the platform's history in the country?\nJack Bendheim: Well, the good news is Argentina has many decades of experience with economic chaos. So those folks know how to -- they know how to manage their business whether their currency is up, down or sideways. And so I think we have not seen any change in customer behavior since the devaluation, which was the middle of December. I think our customers and the industry in Argentina view this as a very positive step toward fiscal sanity and normality in Argentina. So I think we took some pain there, but we're all hopeful that it's going to be that we're good. The gain is going to be worth the pain as the business goes forward. Argentina is an agricultural powerhouse. And there's a lot of opportunity there and we like the market.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That makes sense. And then popping across the world. Can you give us an update on your operations in Israel and maybe a ballpark for the headwind you're facing if the broad drives on? And has it changed at all since Red Sea shipping has become more of an issue?\nJack Bendheim: So you know as you can tell just read the paper, it's not the easiest time to be operating in Israel. We have been successful operating our facilities and meeting our shipping commitments. Clearly, it's been more expensive as some of our people have been called out. But overall, we've slogged through this. And hopefully that this comes to on end soon and then things will return to normal soon.\nUnidentified Analyst: Much appreciated. Thanks for the time guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your next question will come from the line of Brian Wright with Roth MKM. Please go ahead.\nBrian Wright: Thanks. Good morning. Can you help us get a feel for how much of the vaccine growth year-over-year is from the autogenous vaccine?\nRichard Johnson: We don't break it out. So again for some competitive reasons. Overall the autogenous business is small compared to the regular vaccine business. It is you know I wrote the name for it, autogenous custom vaccine. And I don't know if you understand what happens but maybe we have spoken in the past. Literally, we go to farms, and we take blood samples. If they're not, basically, things are not responding well the normal vaccines, the regular vaccines. And we developed a custom vaccine for that farm that will respond to the viruses they're saying to the bacteria they're saying. We created a custom-made vaccine. It's much more expensive, but it's more effective, and we go back and sell it. So it's a retail effectively. It's a retail way. It's farm-to-farm as opposed to the wholesale way if I have a vaccine that can cover half the country.\nBrian Wright: So when you're talking about the poultry product introductions in Latin America, that's not the custom vaccine for the poultry.\nRichard Johnson: Correct.\nBrian Wright: Okay. Thank you. And then can you just remind us on the seasonality of the vaccine business?\nJack Bendheim: So overall there's no seasons. You're talking about viruses. You're not talking about bacterial [indiscernible]. So it's a year round.\nBrian Wright: Great. Okay. Perfect. And then lastly if I could just with the -- to make Glenn on -- as CFO. Is there kind of -- are you conditioning the role changing anything at all from what it has been in the past?\nRichard Johnson: And so I'm not. On the other hand, I'm showing, as you see yourself in the banks, every individual has their own way of doing things. So and Glenn's in the room, he can answer that. But I truly expect like I said [indiscernible] we are standing in the shoulders of giants. So everyone will make their changes and all the changes together make for a better job.\nBrian Wright: Great. And then if I can ask one last one since you did say Glenn is in the room. And this might be a little early, but just early thoughts, Glenn, as far as your like top priorities as you come in?\nGlenn David: Thanks. First, really excited to be here in joining Phibro. Obviously, I have a real passion to the industry and glad to join one of the key players in the industry again. And have been really impressed with the management team so far. And it's really just two or three days in. So really no ongoing hypotheses yet, but really look forward to working with the team, getting to understand Phibro in more detail and then looking to work with the team to really drive profitable growth moving forward. So more to come. And really look forward to working with the analysts and communicating with you over the next weeks and months.\nBrian Wright: Great. We'll save that one for our next quarter too.\nGlenn David: Perfect.\nBrian Wright: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Dick Johnson for any closing remarks.\nRichard Johnson: All right. Well let me add my welcome to Glenn and wish him well. And as Jack said, we'll keep working together. I'll be available for questions as needed. And with that, I wish everyone well. Thank you very much for joining us today and take care and talk to you next time. Bye now.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Phibro Animal Health Corporation FY 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker’s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dick Johnson, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nA - Richard G. Johnson: Well, thank you Regina and good morning to everyone, and welcome to Phibro's earnings call for our fiscal first quarter ended September 30th. My name is Dick Johnson, I'm the Chief Financial Officer of Phibro Animal Health Corporation. I'm joined today on the call by Jack Bendheim, Phibro's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and also by Daniel Bendheim, Director and Executive Vice President of Corporate Strategy. Today, we'll cover financial performance for our first quarter and provide an update on our financial guidance for our full fiscal year ending June 2024. At the conclusion of our opening remarks, we'll open the lines for your questions. I'd like to remind you that we're providing a simultaneous webcast of this call on our website, pahc.com and also on the Investors section of our website. Later today, you will find copies of the earnings press release and the first quarter Form 10-Q filed with the SEC yesterday as well as the slides and transcripts from our presentation this morning. Turning to Slide 2, just the standard disclaimers. Our remarks today will include forward-looking statements and actual results could differ materially from those projections. For a list and description of certain factors that could cause results to differ, I refer you to the forward-looking statements section in our earnings press release. Our remarks include references to certain financial measures, which were not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or U.S. GAAP. I refer you to the non-GAAP financial information section in our earnings press release for a discussion of these measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are included in the financial tables that accompany the earnings press release. We present our results on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted basis. Our adjusted results exclude acquisition-related items; unusual, nonoperational or nonrecurring items, including stock-based compensation; other income or expenses separately reported in the consolidated statement of operations, primarily foreign currency gains and losses; and the income tax effects related to any of those pretax adjustments plus any unusual or nonrecurring income tax items. Now let me introduce our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jack Bendheim, to share his perspective on Phibro's first quarter financial performance and the outlook for our fiscal year 2024. Jack?\nJack C. Bendheim: Thank you, Dick. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Our first quarter had some strong positives despite the overall disappointing results. Our core animal health business grew sales at a healthy 4% and I was especially pleased to see that some of the measures we have taken to counteract margin erosion helped the Animal Health EBITDA grow at an even faster rate of 6%. We saw growth across all three product categories in Animal Health, led by 14% growth in vaccines. We are seeing increased uptake of our vaccines across multiple regions, but especially in South America where we had launched several new commercial vaccines, as well as has opened a new autogenous vaccine facility in Brazil. We are continuing to invest behind our successes. We're looking to introduce additional vaccines in the Americas and have just recorded our first sales of a new line of nutritional specialty products for U.S. poultry producers. We see vaccines and nutritional specialties as double-digit annual opportunities for the short and medium term, and we are making the necessary investments to enable us to achieve our targets. We are also continuing to support our other initiatives such as companion animal. But considering the challenging macro environment we are targeting ways to curtail or delay some of the spend. As mentioned, we are in a challenging macro environment. Our Mineral Nutritional business has seen revenue drop and margins drop even more as we have recently been on the wrong side of commodity price movements and some of the inventory positions. While we anticipate our margins returning to some historical levels as we progress through the fiscal year, volumes could take longer to recover. Similarly, we see weaknesses in some of the other end markets, including dairy in the U.S. and China and our feedlot businesses in Latin America. Finally, the horrific terrorist attacks in Israel a month ago and the subsequent war have increased the costs relating to our operations in Israel. We have confidence in our ability to meet our supply commitments to customers. For all these reasons, we have decided to lower our guidance for the remainder of this fiscal year, as Dick will go into in greater detail at the end of his presentation. Before I hand it back to Dick, I want to touch on the FDA's most recent action relating to Mecadox. The FDA has been targeting Mecadox for close to a decade. Mecadox is a very important product for swine producers to help keep baby piglets healthy during the critical early period of their lives. It's been safely sold in the United States for over 50 years and continues to be available and to be used. We will continue to support this product and defend our customers' ability to use it. We are extremely confident in its safety and efficacy. With that, I look forward to hearing your questions following Dick's review of our financials.\nA - Richard G. Johnson: Thanks, Jack. Well, let me start with the consolidated financial performance on Slide 4, then move on to segment-level performance and other factors, and I'll conclude with a review of our updated financial guidance. Our consolidated net sales for the quarter ending September were about $231 million, reflecting a decrease of $1 million or 1% compared with the same quarter a year ago. As Jack mentioned, the Animal Health segment saw a nice increase, while both Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products decreased from the year earlier. GAAP-based net income and diluted earnings per share decreased, driven in part by higher SG&A expenses and notably by a $10.4 million charge for pension settlement cost. We also saw increased interest expense due primarily to higher rates, some increased foreign exchange losses, all of which were partially offset by reduced income tax provision. Our first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $18.7 million, that was a decrease of $3.5 million. Within that, Animal Health increased $1.5 million due to sales growth and favorable gross margins, which was partially offset by higher spending and SG&A. Mineral Nutrition decreased $2.4 million at the EBITDA line due to lower sales and higher costs. Performance Products dropped about $1 million compared to last year at the EBITDA line due to lower sales and driving in that -- driving gross profit down. And finally, corporate expenses increased $1.6 million year-over-year due to increased strategic investments, some of which was timing and also higher employee-related costs. At the adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS lines, we saw adjusted EPS of $0.14, that was down a third from a year earlier, driven by primarily the higher G&A -- SG&A expenses. Just as a reminder, the large one-off pension charge was -- is not included in adjusted net income, but driven by other SG&A spending and higher interest expense, again, partially offset by reduced income taxes. So now if we move to segment-level financial performance, our first quarter performance of our largest segment, Animal Health. Animal Health segment posted $160 million of sales for the quarter, that was an increase of close to $6 million or 4%. And within that sales increase, we saw, as Jack pointed out, a better than $3 million increase or 14% growth in vaccine net sales. The increase was driven primarily by poultry product introductions in Latin America and also growth in the U.S. swine sector, but there was some offset, a partial offset due to timing of deliveries in other international regions. In nutritional specialties, we saw a growth of about $1 million or 3%. And there it was driven by increased volumes in poultry products, primarily in the U.S. domestic market. And finally, MFA is another, increased about $1 million or 1%, and that increase was driven by increased sales of processing aids used in the ethanol fermentation industry. In terms of profitability for this segment, Animal Health adjusted EBITDA was $28.5 million, up 6% from the same quarter a year earlier and a 30 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin due to the improved gross profit in the segment. Moving on to first quarter financial performance in our other business segments on Slide 6 and starting with Mineral Nutrition. Net sales were $56 million, down about $3.5 million or 6% versus the same quarter last year. There was declines -- the sales declined due to lower average selling prices and reduced volumes due to a drop in demand and Mineral Nutrition adjusted EBITDA dropped even more strongly at $2 million. It was a 46% decline year-on-year, driven by the sales decline and higher costs. Looking at Performance Products, net sales were about $15 million for the quarter, down about $3 million or 8% [ph]. And this was driven primarily as lower demand for ingredients used in personal care products, and that reduced sales drove a decline in adjusted EBITDA of about $1.4 million, a large percentage decline on a relatively small base. And corporate expenses were up 13%, driven by strategic investments and employee-related costs. Turning to key capitalization-related metrics, our free cash flow for the 12-month period ending September was a positive $4 million. That's first time in some time that we've seen a trailing 12-month positive free cash flow. So that's good news and reflects a lot of work and progress we're making in managing our working capital and our cash flows. And just it was comprised overall of, over that 12-month period, of $40 million from operating activities, less $36 million of capital expenditures. We ended the quarter with a gross leverage ratio of 4.4 times. That's a simple math of $484 million of total debt divided by $109 million of trailing adjusted EBITDA. Looking at the dividends, consistent with our history, we've paid a quarterly dividend during the quarter of $0.12 a share, which is about $4.9 million in the aggregate. And as a reminder, $300 million of our debt is not exposed to rising interest rates because we fixed the variable portion of our interest rate to a fixed rate of 61 basis points plus the margin adder. The remainder of our debt is subject to floating interest rates, which are now determined by SOFR, which is the replacement for LIBOR. We also are seeing some partial offset from higher earnings, interest income earned on our short-term investments. And now let's look at our updated guidance. So if we look at those boxes on the right-hand side, we show you the new updated guidance. Just call out a couple of lines. Sales now expected to be between $980 million and $1,020 million; and adjusted EBITDA, 106 -- between $106 million and $112 million. And you see the other numbers that are driven by those two key metrics. The updated guidance reflects reduced expectations for the fiscal year compared with our previous guidance. We see difficult fundamentals in certain parts of our business, including international beef, feedlots, the U.S. and China dairy sectors, and the pace of recovery in the Mineral Nutrition and Performance Products segments, plus the cost of manufacturing disruptions and inefficiencies due to the current conflict in Israel. I would note that we expect our December quarter to be roughly similar to or less than last year, reflecting some of the issues described above. So in closing, this is a challenging environment from various perspectives, but we remain confident in the demand for our products around the world and the longer-term opportunities ahead of us. And with that, operator, if you would please open the line for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Balaji Prasad with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning everyone. This is Mikaela on for Balaji. Can you hear me. \nJack C. Bendheim: Yes.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Just wanted to dig in a bit more around the FDA's recent notice for Carbadox and the potential implications for Mecadox. As you mentioned, it seems you provided a great deal of safety data to the FDA in prior instances. So just wondering what your next steps here will look like? Thanks. \nJack C. Bendheim: Can't fully go through what our next steps are. But as I've said earlier and I think we said in our press release, this product has been on the market for 50 years. It's safe and an effective product and we have sort of been badgering the FDA. They don't like this product because it has some carcinogenic products in it. But by law, as long as there's no leftover carcinogenic products in the meat, it's safe to use. And we've proven that, and we've seen some of that over, and we've tested it up on the FDA with us over these last 50 years. So there might be some mindset changes in the FDA, but this product is used by most of the hog producers in the United States. And again, it's safe and effective.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thanks. And just one follow-up, can you just remind us of how Rejensa has been tracking? Thanks.\nDaniel M. Bendheim: I'll take that. This is Donny. So Rejensa continues on sales out to grow nicely. It's not immune to the kind of slowdown we've seen in the vet channel throughout the industry. So the pace has slowed a little bit, but overall, we continue to be happy with its growth and it's getting planned.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ryskin with Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nMichael Ryskin: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. And Dick, welcome back. It's been a while. I want to ask first on some of your comments regarding further outlook for fiscal year 2024. You specifically called out OUS, international beef feedlots. Just wondering if you could expand a little bit on what's going on there. We often hear about U.S. beef feedlots and herd contraction and some of the pressures there, but not as much discussion as what's happening internationally, so any color could be really helpful?\nJack C. Bendheim: I mean the color is around our business in Latin America, where -- which is generally it's the higher cost of grain, which has put pressure and turned some of these businesses and some of the production of beef into loss businesses. So we've seen drop in volume and fewer cows on the feedlot, which translates for us into fewer products sold. We see corn prices starting to drop. They were in the 7s, and now they're down into the 6s. USDA is projecting higher -- projecting higher production of corn in the United States. So the prices have dropped further, and we see that business should turn around. And that's basically been the driver.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay. So it sounds like it's primarily macro-driven and tied to input costs, especially feed costs and hopefully, that will be relatively quick to turn around, is that the right interpretation?\nJack C. Bendheim: Exactly. I mean that's what we're seeing, and that's what we're seeing also in the dairy business.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay, great. No, dairy was actually going to be another one of my questions. So then if I could ask on the vaccine strength. I mean that's been a really good business for you for a while now, but you really emphasized that this quarter that vaccines, especially in LatAm, was doing really well. Is that any particular product introduction that should be called out or is it a broad portfolio effect, I know you guys did an acquisition a couple of years ago where you brought in some novel vaccine technology. Is that what we're seeing the benefits of, if you could just add it to the vaccine strength, that would be great?\nJack C. Bendheim: So it's a few products that we have developed. I mean the novel technology that we've been using is the TAbic or the -- our ability to tabletize a vaccine, which makes it easier to use in the field. And the combination of both those things, we're seeing growth in the market. I mean you always remember that you also need to see the virus, and we are seeing the virus in these markets. So the virus is spreading and with the virus spreading, we have a very effective product and the vaccine follows.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay, great. If I can squeeze in one last one. Some comments again on your -- I think you mentioned you want to control cost or control the spend just a little bit in companion -- in the companion business. Could you expand on that, is that new product development, is that anything -- any promotions or sales efforts tied to Rejensa, just kind of like where are you pulling back a little bit in that part of the business?\nDaniel M. Bendheim: Yes, I'll take that, Donny again. So it deals with our pipeline. I think we have strong stage gates throughout. And when a product misses a stage gate, we kind of look at it again. One of our products in our pipeline, dealing with one of our oral care products, we have two oral care products in the pipeline, one for dog, one for cats. In the dog product we decided to slow down on our spend there because it doesn't -- we're really looking at the opportunity in light of the results we're getting. So we are curtailing our spend in that respect.\nMichael Ryskin: Okay, really helpful as always. Thanks a lot guys.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Brian Wright with ROTH MKM. Please go ahead. \nBrian Wright: Thanks, good morning. Two real quick questions. Just was trying to get a little more understanding the detail about the pension settlement and that -- I've read the 10-Q, but just trying to understand what exactly happened there?\nRichard G. Johnson: Sure. So I think first, let me say that for the corporation, this was a noncash event. In other words, we funded -- we put money into the pension plan years ago. So this was a transaction that happens inside the pension plan, and it's something that many, many corporations have been doing. We essentially got -- an insurance company agreed to irrevocably assume the liability for paying those future benefits for a group of people that are in the pension plan. And so basically, the -- on a present value basis, the insurance company took over the precise number is there, but it was $24 million. The insurance company took over a $24 million present value of a liability and the pension plan took $24 million of its assets and paid the insurance company to take over that liability. So -- and then from there on, you get into some accounting recognition rules where we had to recognize this $10 million charge, but again, a non-cash item to the corporation, to Phibro.\nBrian Wright: Okay. So that's still off the books as far as the insurance company has that obligation, there's no counterparty risk impact that's being recorded here in that $10 million charge?\nRichard G. Johnson: No, there's no counterparty risk. In the insurance company, we were very careful to only consider transferring this liability to very highly rated insurance companies. So this is -- I forget how the rating system works, but this is a very highly rated, very financially stable insurance company who has irrevocably assumed the obligation to pay these benefits over time in the future.\nBrian Wright: Okay, thanks. And then just one detail on the follow-up. Of that -- of the gross debt, how much is characterized as first lien?\nRichard G. Johnson: Fundamentally all of it. It's -- with the exception of a small -- I think it's around $11 million, every -- the remainder of the gross debt is all within one credit facility. It's broken into various pieces. There's a revolver piece and a term loan piece, but it's all supported by the same collateral package.\nBrian Wright: Okay, thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question will come from the line of Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nLinda Bolduc: Hi, thank you. This is Linda Bolduc on for Erin Wright. So we have two questions. Can you speak to the dynamics you're seeing across the core MAF business and how are you thinking about the dynamics for the balance of this year?\nJack C. Bendheim: Just can you repeat the first question?\nLinda Bolduc: Yes, yes. Can you please speak to the dynamic [Technical Difficulty] business and how are you thinking about that dynamics for the balance of the year there?\nJack C. Bendheim: Sorry, you cut out on the -- your question is something about the dynamics of the MFA sector and what was the rest of the question?\nLinda Bolduc: And how you're thinking about dynamics for the balance of this year?\nJack C. Bendheim: So the MFA business, which translates to mean medically feed additives, is a very, very big category. In other words, any product that is -- that has registrations is -- comes into that category. And it's -- we don't know exactly. I would say, worldwide, it's a $3 billion to $4 billion business and shared by a few producers and a few generic producers, and it's a very strong business. It's the most efficient way to get products into the animal, whether it's a chicken, a pig or a cow. And we've seen, depending on disease pressures, but we've seen that to be always a steady business. And we see that growing in line with what we've always talked about, population and economic growth. That's been our history with this product, and that's how we see it going forward.\nLinda Bolduc: Thank you. That's helpful. And one quick follow-up, on Performance Products, can you remind us of any key drivers there in your overall commitment to that business?\nRichard G. Johnson: Our key products are there's a couple of smaller segments within -- or kind of businesses within that segment. One of the important categories is we represent end-market ingredients for personal care products. So importantly, some ingredients for -- that would sell to toothpaste manufacturers, ingredients that go into shampoos, other products like that. And then our -- the second piece of that business is copper-based products, where that's a legacy business that Phibro has had for a long time. We have said that the business is opportunistic, it's not core. It's a relatively small part of the company. It's cash flow positive. It's not something that is terribly distracting. So up until this point, we've retained the business.\nLinda Bolduc: Thank you.\nOperator: With that, I'll hand the call back to Dick Johnson for any closing remarks.\nRichard G. Johnson: Well, it's nice to be back on the phone with folks and enjoyed the Q&A this morning. We thank you for your time and your interest in Phibro, and we'll talk to you again on our next earnings call. So everybody, have a nice day, and hope you're doing well. Take care. Bye now.\nOperator: That will conclude today's call, and we thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."
