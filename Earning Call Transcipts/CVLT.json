I’m, Michael Melnyk, Head of Investor Relations and I’m joined by Sanjay Mirchandani, Commvault CEO and Gary Merrill, Commvault CFO. An earnings presentation with key financial and operating metrics is posted on the investor relations website for reference. Statements made on today’s call will include forward-looking statements that are of Commvault. Future expectations plans and prospects. All such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the cautionary language in today’s earnings release and Commvault’s most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. Commvault does not assume any obligation to update these statements. During this call, Commvault's financial results are presented on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP measures can be found on our website. Thank you again for joining us. Now I'll turn it over to Sanjay for his opening remarks. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mirchandani: Thank you, Mike. Good morning and thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to report our Q3 results exceeded expectations including double-digit year-over-year growth across our most important KPIs. By our own metrics, this was an exceptional quarter. We also set the stage for the future by introducing market-leading innovation. With Commvault Cloud, our revolutionary platform for cyber resilience. Some financial highlights include total revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $217 million. This was driven by a 31% increase in subscription revenue, which now represents more than half of our total revenue. Total ARR, the primary metric we use to measure underlying growth, grew 17% year-over-year to over three quarters of a billion dollars. Subscription ARR grew 29% year-over-year to $571 million, and is now over 75% of total ARR. SaaS ARR increased 77% year-over-year to $152 million, and we expanded operating margins by 180 basis points year-over-year while continuing to repurchase shares. These results reinforce that Commvault’s products and services are in more demand than ever, especially as companies grapple with how to keep their data secure, compliant, and resilient in a world increasingly under threat of cyber-attacks. For two years now, we've discussed how the volume, intensity, and sophistication of cyber-attacks would require a radically different approach to cyber resiliency. Gone are the days when perimeter security alone would suffice. It's just a matter of time until the bad actors get in. So rather than just looking at prevention, CIOs and CISOs alike are putting a heavy emphasis on recovery and resilience. This transition has fueled the most important pivot in our 27-year history. In November, we introduced Commvault Cloud powered by Metallic AI. This platform brings together the best of all worlds. Industry-leading data protection combined with data security, data intelligence, and recovery. Commvault Cloud offers the fastest, most reliable recovery of any solution on the market today. With our platform, data can be restored from anywhere to anywhere, rapidly, reliably, and at massive scale. The platform provides AI capabilities, giving customers automated and predictive recovery, threat intelligence, and operational efficiencies to deliver true cyber resilience. No longer will organizations need to make unnatural choices between SaaS and other data center workloads. With our platform, we support more workloads than any other vendor in our space. And we do all of this at the lowest total cost of ownership. We scale the platform, integrating with major hyperscalers, as well as leading cyber security and AI companies like Avira, Darktrace, Databricks, Microsoft Sentinel and Palo Alto Networks among others. I'm pleased to share that customers, partners, and industry analysts have been raving about. For instance, one customer told analyst firm Enterprise Strategy Group, quote, “We're a highly regulated industry. Commvault Cloud was the only solution we found that gives us the flexibility and assurance that satisfied our auditors. Because of Commvault Cloud, I can assure our leadership team that we are protected and we all sleep better at night”. IDC Research Vice President Phil Goodwin said, “This announcement realigns Commvault's products to meet customer preferences and sets the company on a path to be very competitive in cyber resilience”. And we continue to introduce major innovations in the platform that solve critical customer challenges. For example, with our clean room recovery offering, we are closing the gap that exists between incident response planning and readiness. Our new clean room recovery capabilities enable customers to thoroughly and cost effectively test their recovery plans. It also provides them with a safe, on-demand environment to recover. It is this kind of groundbreaking innovation that sets us apart from the competition and helps us take share and land new business. In fiscal Q3, we added another 500 subscription customers, bringing our total to almost 9,000. Subscription customers now represent well over half of our total active customer base. A couple of examples include a large state agency that detected security gaps with its incumbent vendor. This new customer turned to Commvault for immutable Air Gap ransomware protection, anomaly detection, and an improved cyber resilience posture. And we also helped the Fortune 500 Capital Equipment Company eliminate its patchwork of vendors and move their workloads onto our unified platform. This allowed them to modernize and improve their cyber resilience posture, better protecting them from ransomware with a lower total cost of ownership. To expand our perspective and keep us at the forefront of innovation, we also established a Cyber Resilience Council comprised of security visionaries from top cyber, cloud and government organizations. The council would advise on security trends and cyber threats, which will shape product development, strategy and partnering opportunities. It is chaired by Melissa Hathaway, a thought leader in cybersecurity and digital risk management, who served in two presidential administrations. We're two months away from closing our fiscal year and I couldn't be more excited about our momentum as we approach fiscal year 2025. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to discuss our results. Gary?\nGary Merrill: Thanks Sanjay and good morning everyone. I am pleased to report strong revenue and earnings outperformance in Q3. Starting with the top line, total revenue was $217 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year and significantly outpaced our Q3 expectations. Our total revenue growth was highlighted by a 31% year-over-year increase in subscription revenue to $114 million, reflective of both solid double-digit growth in term software licenses and an accelerating contribution of SaaS revenue. Our execution was strong as large software deal close rates improved sequentially and we delivered against our largest term subscription renewal quarter of the fiscal year. This execution resulted in term software deals over $100,000, up 25% year-over-year, driven by increases in both average selling price and deal volume. Q3 perpetual license revenue was $15 million as these perpetual licenses are generally sold in limited verticals and geographies. At the current run rate, we believe that the headwinds to our reported total revenue growth for perpetual license sales are normalizing as we exit the current fiscal year. Q3 customer support revenue, which includes support for both our term-based and perpetual software licenses, was $77 million, down just 1% year-over-year. Q3 and fiscal year 2024 continue to benefit from the continued trend of fewer conversions of perpetual support contracts to term software licenses. Year-to-date, customer support revenue from perpetual licenses represents 54% of total customer support, with a balance coming from term software and related arrangements. This compares to approximately 60% in fiscal year 2023 and 75% in fiscal year 2022. At this trajectory, we expect customer support revenue from term-based software licenses to become the majority of our customer support revenue next fiscal year. Moving from revenue results to ARR. Q3 ARR was $752 million, representing 17% year-over-year growth and continues to reflect the underlying strength of our business when our revenue is presented on an annualized basis. Subscription ARR, which includes term-based software arrangements and SaaS contracts, increased 29% year-over-year to $571 million. Within subscription, SaaS ARR grew 77% year-over-year to $152 million, driven by new customer acquisition and strong expansion with existing customers. Q3 SaaS net dollar retention rate, or NRR, was a healthy 125%. Now I'll discuss expenses and profitability. Fiscal Q3 gross margins increased 90 basis points sequentially to 82.9% and includes continued improvement in our SaaS gross margins. Fiscal Q3 operating expenses were $132 million, up 9% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of our planned go-to-market investments throughout fiscal year 2024 and higher marketing spend during the quarter, including our shift event in New York City. Overall, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue was 61%, representing 100 basis points of leverage year-over-year, consistent with our objective to manage expenses relative to revenue results. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of approximately 2,900 employees, last sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. Our current headcount balance includes additional inside sales teams, renewal and related customer success teams to support the customer journey and our accelerating velocity sales motion. Non-GAAP EBIT for Q3 increased 21% year-over-year to $47 million. And non-GAAP EBIT margins increased 180 basis points year-over-year to 21.5%. Moving to some key balance sheet and cash flow metrics. We ended the quarter with no debt and $284 million in cash, of which $88 million was in the United States. Our Q3 free cash flow grew 45% year-over-year to $43 million. Through the first three quarters of the fiscal year, we generated $121 million of free cash flow, an increase of 20% year-on-year. The biggest drivers of free cash flow were SaaS deferred revenue and the strength of our software subscription renewals, which typically include upfront payment on multi-year contracts. In Q3, we repurchased $51 million of stock under our repurchase program, resulting in year-to-date repurchases totaling $134 million, representing 111% of year-to-date free cash flow. Now I'll discuss our outlook for fiscal Q4 and the full fiscal year 2024. All of the following guidance metrics are based on current foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal Q4, we expect subscription revenue, which includes both the software portion of term-based licenses and SaaS, to be $111 to $115 million. This represents 20% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This Q4 subscription revenue outlook reflects continued momentum in our new customer and expansion business, but a smaller renewal pull in fiscal Q4 relative to Q3. As a result, we expect total revenue to be $210 to $214 million. At these revenue levels, we expect Q4 consolidated growth margins to be in the range of 81% to 82%, and EBIT margins in the range of 20% to 21%. We continue to execute some foundational go-to market changes, which include amplifying our discrete focus on our land and expand opportunities, scaling our motion to secure our growing subscription renewal base, and investing to capitalize on our fiscal year 2025 growth objectives. These investments are reflected in the range of our Q4 margin guidance. Our projected diluted share count for fiscal Q4 is approximately 44.5 million shares. Now, I want to give an updated outlook on the full fiscal year 2024, which includes, once again, raising our total revenue and total ARR expectations for the full year. We expect fiscal year 2024 total ARR growth of 15% year-over-year, which reflects a 100 basis point increase over our prior guidance. We now expect subscription ARR, which includes term-based licenses and SaaS, to increase 25% year-over-year, and reflects a similar 100 basis point increase over our prior guidance. From a revenue perspective, we now expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $420 million to $424 million, growing 21% year-over-year at the midpoint, reflecting the continued momentum in our business and is a $9 million increase at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance. At these revenue levels, subscription revenue will exceed over 50% of our total revenues for the full year. We expect total revenue to be in the range of $826 million to $830 million, reflecting an $11 million increase at the midpoint compared to our prior guidance. Our improved fiscal year 2024 total revenue outlook reflects the seasonally stronger subscription software trends that we usually experience in the second half of the fiscal year combined with the ongoing momentum of our SaaS offerings. Moving to full year fiscal 2024 margin, EBIT and cash flow outlook. We continue to expect gross margins of 82% to 83% and non-GAAP EBIT margin expansion of 50 to 100 basis points year-over-year. We are also maintaining our expected full year free cash flows of $170 million. As of December 31st, we had $122 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization and we expect to continue with our existing practice of repurchasing at least 75% of our annual free cash flows. Year-to-date, we are pacing well ahead of this target and we intend to continue the share repurchase momentum during the current quarter. For details and trends on all of our key metrics, please take time to review our investor deck contained on the investor relations section of our website. Operator, you can now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Thanks guys, for taking the question and congrats on the good quarter. I guess the first question, and I appreciate that you're not going to give guidance looking out into fiscal 2025, but I'm just curious with the momentum you're seeing in subscription and obviously the SaaS business as well, how do you guys start to think about seasonality and in particular thinking about the March quarter? And I guess I'll layer into that. How do we think about the customer support growth as that starts to, the rate of decline starts to ease and maybe we return to growth as we look into next fiscal year?\nGary Merrill: Hey, Aaron. Good morning. It's Gary. Nice to hear from you. I'll start off. You asked a couple of different things. Maybe I'll start with the Q4 piece of it, the current March quarter perspective. So Q3, just looking back at the quarter we just finished was a really significant quarter for us by our own measures. It's one of the best, if not the best quarter we've ever had. We're really starting to see that cyber is changing the way that people are buying. Some of the trend that we saw during that quarter gave us the confidence to raise both our Q4 and full year numbers. As you mentioned about specifically subscription revenue, our guide is less than about 20% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. What we're seeing and what we're expecting in fiscal Q4 is continued momentum in that land and expand motion. Also, the SaaS revenue that we're now generating is a tailwind and provides more predictability to our P&L. Those together will see a slightly smaller renewal opportunity in fiscal Q4 relative to Q3. That's also reflected into our guidance as fiscal Q3 had the largest renewal pool we've ever had in our history. We think those trends, along with continued execution and some really good acceleration in our partner ecosystem is really going to help us set the foundation for next year. What's also helping, as you mentioned, relative to our total revenue is what's happening in the customer support revenue. And what you see there is that the declines year-over-year are starting to get mitigated and now down into the low single digits. Some of that's reflective of fewer conversions that I mentioned on last call. We continue to see fewer conversions that then eliminate some of the headwinds we see in support. So some of those headwinds will get mitigated going into next fiscal year, which would also provide some of that continued momentum, we'll see.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, Gary, I appreciate that. Let me maybe kind of double-click on that and just ask more succinctly, do you think the customer support revenue can turn to growth as we look into next fiscal year?\nGary Merrill: No, I would say, as I look into next fiscal year, I would say flat to slightly down is what I would expect on a full-year basis. Aaron is what I would expect at this point. I think by the end of next fiscal year, the term component, like the maintenance and support piece from our term licenses, will become the majority of that customer support. But I think that will take us into the back half of next year, which means that on a full-year basis, we'll slightly be kind of probably low single digits down.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, that's helpful. And then the final quick question, on the term side, can you just talk about what you're seeing from a term perspective, the term length of the deals you're engaged with? It sounds like large deals have improved. The macro might have eased. So just kind of any updated thoughts on what you're seeing, any kind of term lengths or term compression dynamics?\nGary Merrill: Yes, absolutely. So what we continue to see now is stabilization in our term length. Last quarter, we saw, I'd say, the first quarter stabilization. This quarter, we saw another quarter stabilization. On the subscription side, our average term is still rounding to about two years. But that stabilization, which is also demonstrated by good execution, but also demand for our cyber-resilient products, is also giving a little more predictability in there. The other piece there, and that's also critical to this, is how we align with the partner ecosystem. Those bigger deals and larger transformational projects are tied with some of the new modern partner ecosystem, whether it be hyperscalers or others. And they also provide some foundational support for keeping that term length healthy.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Hey, Aaron and Sanjay, I'll just add one more point. As customers start really moving and pivoting to the hybrid model and hybrid cloud workloads, our platform allows them to do that mitigation and move their workloads and have the same technology support them, both in the cloud and data-centric. So we're seeing that as well. That's helping as well.\nAaron Rakers: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Ma with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nHoward Ma: Great. Thanks. And impressive results. I have a question first for Sanjay. Sanjay, if you were to dissect the outperformance in the quarter, I guess between the general spending environment maybe improving, it looks like it might be an in secular tailwind of a consolidating or increasing infrastructure and security budget. That versus your own internal execution, so new product initiatives and go-to-market execution. And I understand it might be hard to separate the internal from external. But if you were to force the stack rank, the internal versus external, I'm curious what your thoughts would be.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Well, I would say it's probably 75% for this quarter that passed, 75% internal. And I would say that because really, Howard, Gary touched on this. Our own business transformation, moving our install base of customers and our new customers into a more routable format as well as a subscription-oriented format is actually working. Our subscription renewal tailwind is kicking in. So the stuff that was a headwind for us two, three years ago is actually becoming a nice tailwind. And this last quarter was testimony to that. We've also been, we've talked about our execution internally, really aligning our sales force, our marketing campaigns, our demand generation campaigns, all the things that you'd expect to avail of the opportunity in front of us around cyber. So that's kicking in nicely as well. And green shoots on some of the demand we're seeing on cyber resilience. And the third is the new platform, the platform, the actual Commvault Cloud-powered by Metallic AI platform that we're seeding into customers at this point. Technologies like cleanroom [ph] recovery are really beginning to get customers' attention. So if you, not perfect math, but I'd say 75% of what we're seeing is a combination of what we're doing and good execution alongside the fact that we're solving the problem externally. We're solving a really hard problem for customers. Cyber threats are real, and what we're able to do for them is meaningful.\nHoward Ma: Okay, that's really good color, and thank you for quantifying that, Sanjay. I have a follow-up for Gary. Gary, with the recent launch of Commvault Cloud and these new security bundles, can you give us some numbers around initial traction in cross-selling these security modules to existing customers as well as adoption by net new logos? Thanks.\nGary Merrill: Yes, good morning, Howard. I'd like to help begin this morning. So a couple things is, as you know, our announcements related to our new platform, Commvault Cloud just hit the market just a couple months ago, okay? So where we're focused now is on demand gen. So in starting to see some of the early benefits that we start to see in our pipeline and in the funnel that we're creating, that's also reflected in our Q4 outlook, okay? What this will do is it's going to give us an amazing opportunity for expansion as well. None of that is reflective in our results for Q3. So our results in Q3, as Sanjay said, was about executing against the pipeline. We had strong close rates that accelerated quarter-on-quarter. And what we're seeing now is building that demand gen for next fiscal year and the ability to cross out through our install base. We finally have a platform that makes the buying process for customers easy between software and SaaS and facilitates that expansion opportunity to go from our foundational model that we have today all the way through the cyber resilience offering that we've announced.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Yes. And Howard, Sanjay here, it's quite honestly, it's still early to quantify in dollar terms, the impact, but we're very, very positive about it from what we see as the pipeline builds. I'll give you some, I'll just give you an anecdotal point of view. The number of conversations I've had with security teams and CISOs since we launched on November 8th has been unprecedented. We're seeing really deep dives on the fact that what we call shift right, our ability to really take the customer journey and make sure that protection and then resilience are at the core of how they think about cyber recovery is key. And we're having deep conversations, proof of concepts more than we ever have because we've been able to really bring to light the completeness of the platform.\nHoward Ma: Thanks guys, really exciting stuff. Thanks.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Thanks Howard.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Fish with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJames Fish: Hey guys, great quarter. Just building off the last few that we've asked around cyber resiliency strength. Look, I know it can be hard to really parse out, but what percentage of customers are buying the cyber, buying for cyber-security use cases at this point or what's really the exposure to cyber budgets rather than kind of the traditional backup and recovery? How often is a chief information security officer, for example, in the room as you guys are in that final pitch?\nSanjay Mirchandani: Hey Jim, it's Sanjay. I just sort of touched on that in the previous Howard's question. We're seeing a lot of security conversations. And by the way, this wasn't our first foray into security. We've had security in our product for a long time. Last June, we announced a series of innovations and then we followed it up in November and we continue to follow that up now. Data, even before cyber resilience, data protection without information security was pointless. There was nothing there. So we had security built into our overall data protection platform, which we've extended end to end with our cyber resilience capabilities. Okay, let me give you an example. And I've said this for a long time, data protection and data security are merging and I think they've officially come together. So if you're recovering from a breach or a threat or an attack and you're recovering data, you can't just blindly bring data back. You have to make sure that you're threat scanning that data for any vulnerability that may have been, that may have been added since you backed up, okay, or new in the environment. So threat scanning, which was a typical security shift left capability is completely integrated with recovery capabilities. So that's what we've been doing. And so it's very hard to sort of segregate and say this is security versus this is protection. It is resilience. And we've been doing this for a while. I mean, yes, customers may talk to us and say, hey, we want to talk about data protection, but it's really with light of the fact that the threat that they're protecting against the cyber. So it's all one platform, one capability.\nJames Fish: Makes sense, Sanjay, I appreciate that. And Gary, you had mentioned, you guys are looking to invest on the go-to-market side. Just can you elaborate a little bit more on the details there, how many heads should we be looking for you guys to add in this upcoming quarter in order to hit those objectives? Is it going to be mainly on the inside sales team or looking more at the kind of field. Thanks guys?\nGary Merrill: Yes, thanks, Jim, and good morning. Yes in some of my prepared remarks, I had to talk about investment. So I think foundational to what Sanjay and I have always talked about, it's about profitable and responsible growth. So that's all, that is our foundation. But as I look at it in the next year, some of the investments that we're starting to make is to really be able to capitalize on the growth opportunity that's in front of us. We're seeing the world of cyber resilience come together to give us this amazing opportunity to hopefully accelerate growth. And with that does require some level of investment. And it's more about making sure that we continue to generate the demand around cyber resilience, make sure that we are targeting the right buyers and the decision makers that can help drive the decisions related to cyber resilience. And more and most importantly, continue to make sure we have the right resources and campaigns around accelerating our SaaS model. What some of these investments require is that alignment, especially into the partner ecosystem. So if I look at the partner ecosystem, there's really three key pieces that we're focused on. Number one is hyperscalers. We're starting to see some great acceleration with hyperscalers. We did the largest amount of revenue ever through marketplaces this quarter. And we want to capitalize on that momentum. It's also building out the MSP route, especially with our SaaS focused product. And third is a lot of these large transformational cyber projects are totally integrated with the GSIs and Lines. Okay, so if you're trying to think about some of the areas that are important to us to capitalize on the growth, they're the key areas we're focused on.\nJames Fish: Makes sense, great quarter guys.\nGary Merrill: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Your line is open.\nRudy Kessinger: Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions and I'll add my congrats to what looks like a great quarter, some really good numbers here. On SaaS, a growth re-accelerated last quarter a bit, sustained this quarter at 77% SaaS ARR growth. The net new SaaS ARR is just really impressive. Could you talk about just when you look at the growth in Metallic quarter-over-quarter, just what percent of that new SaaS ARR is coming from cross sales versus new customers? And also, do you have any conversions in there yet? Or is it still mostly true organic ARR growth?\nGary Merrill: Hey, Rudy, thanks Gary. Good morning and nice to hear from you today. One of the key things that we look at to relate to SaaS is how we look at sequentially from an ARR basis, okay? And hitting the 152 million ARR, the sequential growth we had from last quarter to this quarter with an old pipeline. So in a numerical, we had the highest sequential increase in SaaS ARR, which is shows to the acceleration we're seeing in the as-as-a-service delivery model. Okay? And it's a combination of two things as you highlighted. One is, I'll call our lane and expand, new business. And we're still seeing the majority of that from upsell. Okay? Upsell meaning more of the same workloads, our primary workloads. We're starting to see the cross-sell start to commit, but it's still relatively less than the additional workloads of similar functionality. Now, in introducing with the new cyber resiliency offering, we're setting ourselves up for that cross-sell opportunity as we get into the next fiscal year. So we look the next fiscal year for that. But the key driver on the 125% NRR has been upsell. The other key piece though is the maturing renewal cycle and driving to really strong gross removal rates. So we're doing a very good job of now maturing and having a fully mature renewal cycle as well. So those pieces are help driving that momentum.\nSanjay Mirchandani: And Rudy, Sanjay, I think you didn't directly ask the question, but new customers, part of our land, a new customer acquisition, momentum with our SaaS workloads is growing in the hundreds every quarter. And the attach, the cross-sell of software with SaaS is actually quite something we appreciate and are working on because, which is also testimony to our single platform strategy as customers move to the hyper cloud. So they start with one workload and then quickly move into a data center based workload because you may have products that you want to back up in a different way in the data center. So not only do we look at cross-sell within the SaaS offers, but also cross-selling between software and SaaS and having a single platform with the capabilities we have enables that hybrid journey for customers. So they can start anywhere either in the cloud or on premise and then go both ways. That's a key differentiator for us.\nGary Merrill: So Rudy, that's all true growth. There's one last piece of your question I wanted to finish on is that what we're seeing in Metallic is not candlelizing over from converting or install base. You asked that question specifically and we're not. That's not part of the current play or which driving the business. This is all about net new business.\nRudy Kessinger: Great. That's all very helpful color. I guess just one quick last one on SaaS. Again, you mentioned the record net new SaaS ARR and Q3. If I look back last year at seasonality, your net new Metallic ARR and Q4 was a good step up from Q3. Should we expect to see that play out again this year? I know you're not guiding specifically the SaaS ARR, but just giving your months into the quarter, how should we expect new SaaS ARR to come in for the March quarter versus December?\nGary Merrill: I'll take that Rudy. It's Gary again. I think the seasonality you saw last year from fiscal Q3 to Q4 is fair for something like we would expect for this year. I think we saw roughly 15 or so million sequential growth. I think sometimes like that or slightly more it's what our objective would be is to keep that momentum going. We have a strong pipeline going into the quarter and we're seeing our close rates continue to improve as well. So we're optimistic about where we're going to lay into the fiscal year. We're not calling, but we're trying to get.\nRudy Kessinger: Great. That's it for me. Thanks for taking the questions again and congrats again.\nGary Merrill: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is open.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes, I noticed a nice pick up on the America's reach in that 16% year-on-year. Was that kind of broad based across verticals or was there any particular verticals that stood out for you?\nGary Merrill: Yes. Hey Eric, it's Gary. I'd like to hear from you again this morning as well. Our America's had really strong quarter from a total perspective. Our America's business was up 16% year-over-year really driven by that subscription revenue as well. Just the total subscription revenue in the America's was up 43% year-over-year. And what we're seeing is really strong traction on some of the larger deals. The larger deals on renewals is well as kind of larger land and expand deals. Our new, I'm sorry, our big deal, so what we say kind of those term software deals over $100,000 were up almost 50% year-over-year. So it's all tied to driving the cyber resilience message and making sure that we are helping our customers solve those difficult problems. Not vertical specific. Last quarter we talked a lot about Fed. This quarter it was more broad based across the vertical stream tied to executing against the renewal stream and the larger deals.\nEric Martinuzzi: Got it. And then the buyback program, I know you haven't given us a view for FY 2025, but you've been relatively consistent of at least the past couple of years about this greater than 75% of the annual free cash flow. Is that the intent going forward here or are you going to revisit that when you've lost it the current plan?\nGary Merrill: Yes. So our current guidance will continue to hold. We believe right now that our buybacks are a key part of our responsible growth strategy. And our publicly facing data guidance of at least 75% of free cash flow is a good modeling trend. As you can kind of tell through the nine months, we're well ahead of that. We're north of 100% of free cash flow because we're opportunistic also in the market and we see the value that we have as a company and our ability to continue to drive shareholder value.\nEric Martinuzzi: Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open.\nJason Ader: Thank you. Good morning guys. I just wanted to ask about the revenue growth outlook. I know you've talked about I think what 6% to 7% growth CAGR from the 2021 Analyst Day. I'm not sure maybe you've updated that but just wanted to get a sense of whether you are reiterating that. Do you think it could be higher and then more specifically as we think about 2025 FY2025 without pinning you down on guidance right now do you think the growth could be higher in revenue growth could be higher in 2025 than 2024?\nGary Merrill: Okay. Hey Jason, it's Gary. Good morning. I'll hit a couple of these points. So first revenue growth for us is ultimately an output of what we're seeing from an ARR perspective. So let me start let me start there and we're seeing really strong growth. If you look at our ARR growth of 17% this quarter is really strong and we're seeing that across all of our corporate businesses. Our Q4 guidance implies that we'll end up this fiscal year on the top line right roughly in that 6% revenue growth. We have an amazing opportunity to accelerate as we move forward. Obviously we have not given guidance for FY 2025 yet. Clearly our expectation that FY 2025 growth will be higher than FY 2024. Right and as we start to get work towards our next call next quarter we will give a little more clarity on four-year FY20 actual results but we but most importantly is we see the opportunity in the market. That's key. So as we see the opportunity in the market we can continue to build on the momentum from the quarter we just had and clearly where expectation is that our growth next year will be higher than this year on the top line.\nJason Ader: Got you. Okay great. And then another one for you Gary. Can you give us a sense of how much revenue in a given quarter is actually effectively let's call it in the bag at the on kind of day one of the quarter and in terms of and that would include renewals. Let's just assume you're going to get the renewal there. I know you don't always get 100% but let's just assume you're going to get the renewal and then committed contracts which I guess would be support and SaaS. So those two things combined how much of your revenue in a given quarter is actually coming from those sources today?\nGary Merrill: We don't quantify specifically right I'll say what's the contractual revenue we have in the bag on Q1 or day one of the quarter. Though as you look at a couple key pieces we just close our SaaS ARR so you can take our SaaS ARR and divide it by roughly four and you could that's almost guaranteed you get that piece and the other piece is customer support right that's very predictable. So when you look at just those two pieces SaaS and in customer support you have a very strong starting point to the quarter. It's how we see it. The renewal piece then we strive leverage and the incremental that goes over our land business. I think we're all closed is that on a relative basis each quarter becomes more and more predictable than the previous with some of these foundational pieces and that's what we kind of focuses on in increasing product of predictability sequentially as each quarter goes.\nJason Ader: Okay. Let me just ask this in a slightly different way I don't know if you're going to answer it but I'm going to try. Of your $100,000 plus deals today how much are actual renewals versus basically new business or upsell business?\nGary Merrill: Both are healthy contributions. Both are. We can't get into the specifics. We're not getting into those specifics but they're both they're both very healthy contributions.\nJason Ader: And it's obviously a lot higher today than it was a couple years ago.\nGary Merrill: Yes that's right.\nJason Ader: All right thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Blakey with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nThomas Blakey: Hey good morning guys and great execution here and solid results. Congratulations. Just want to maybe piggyback on Jason there on the potential renewal opportunity. You're pretty clear about saying that fiscal 3Q we just passed was a very large opportunity for the company. I think one of the largest, I think Gary said, in that fiscal 4Q would be lower. Maybe Jason literally just asked this, but will the renewal opportunity that it seems like you have a solid grasp around this, will the renewal opportunity in fiscal 2025 be bigger or the same as fiscal 2024?\nGary Merrill: Got it. So, hey Tom, it's Gary. And I'll jump in and maybe give you a little foundational piece that will help [Indiscernible] 25. Fiscal Q3 is typically our largest because it's tied to all the accounting year and deals we've done over a corporate period. And fiscal Q4 will be modestly lower. So, not significantly, but lower. Okay. So, that means that the signality of the second half is always stronger than the first half of any fiscal year. And that trend, as I look into next year, will continue. On an overall basis, I would expect the renewal population next year to be larger than the renewal population this year, but not by the same amount that we saw this year. Right? This year had a larger sequential year-over-year. Next will be larger, but to a much lesser extent.\nThomas Blakey: Much less from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024, but higher than fiscal 2024 nonetheless. That's helpful. Thank you, Gary. And maybe Sanjay, in the context of the expanding opportunity set that you have here with regard to cyber resilience, we agree with you in terms of the convergence of data recovery and data security the last couple of years here. Talk to us about maybe incentives and the capacity that you have internally to have a combat in terms of attacking the opportunities as you climb up to the CISO suite there.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Sorry, what was the last part of your question?\nThomas Blakey: So, in addition to incentives, what kind of capacity do you have or need to be continued to build out to kind of approach the CISO suite in terms of discussions?\nSanjay Mirchandani: I mean, incentives, we continue to fine tune that as needed, obviously, within the comp plans. But really what's more important is the investment and focus we put around enabling our sales force and our ecosystem on our new capabilities around cyber resilience. Kind of unprecedented how much time and effort we put and cost we put into getting that right. And that's an ongoing journey. We've also brought in some really, really seasoned security, we call them field CTOs, to really enable our customer conversations alongside our field. We've got some specialists as well that understand security inside now, practitioners. We've also announced recently a cyber, our cyber resilience board, which is a board of absolute luminaries in the field of cyber security, headed by Melissa Hathaway, who was an advisor and part of two presidential administrations on security and cyber security. So we're really amping not just the product, but also the capability, the thought leadership around it, and enablement within that. So there's a lot of work going on. And yes, I'd be wrong for me to forget, we've also, as part of the platform, it's a subtlety, but it's an important piece, which is we've actually gone, we've shifted left. In other words, we have integrated and continue to integrate and continue to increase the ecosystem of connections into what we call the identify and defend, the perimeter security folks, and making sure that the technology our customers use to defend the perimeter and manage it is something we integrate with because it makes both sides, the recovery and resilience side, which we do, and the defend and identify side that our partners do, and working together, we make the customer safer. And so there's a lot of work that we've been at. We announced it all in November, but we've been at this thing for a long, long time. And lots to do. Lots to do. Everybody we hire, we try and bring in with a security background, quite simple. As simple as that, as a litmus test. Okay?\nThomas Blakey: The follow-up there would just be with regarding to the security your budgets at firms who have had, been ever expanding probably for the last decade or more. Do you envision that this is -- your initial conversations are along those lines. You mentioned TCO and your preamble. Is this a combalt kind of like taking wallet share and consolidating vendors, or is this more of a, and who would those vendors be, or is this more of just a continued expansion?\nSanjay Mirchandani: I think, Tom, I think the fact that the two pieces that have traditionally been separate are coming together from a solution point of view, like the ART platform. Just we've seen customers at the table with the IT organization, the infrastructure team, as well as the security team. And they're working together, rightfully so, to solve a complex issue, a hard problem. And I think they quite, we're seeing the budget sort of munch together in many customers to say, we, this is not just a data protection piece or a data security piece. It has to be together. So I think we're actually seeing deficiencies for customers with the approach we're taking. It does make it easier because you're not, you don't have internal sort of friction inside a customer.\nThomas Blakey: Okay, just, yes, that's helpful. And just one very quick one, sorry to have four questions here, but the gross margin guidance was impressive, Gary. Just maybe talk about the moving pieces there, specifically with regard to Metallic and the cloud scaling here. That'd be helpful. Thank you, guys.\nGary Merrill: Yes, for sure. And I can wrap up with that question with you. So from a gross margin perspective, getting stability in the gross margin is important. And there's two pieces. One is when you see acceleration in our subscription and a chunk of that you're going to buy subscription term software, they're very high gross margins. So when we get good renewal and good land expand growth, we're going to see gross margin momentum. The key piece though, to our gross margin is getting stability and leverage on our staff gross margins. Okay, we're working very clearly towards our goal of getting into that 70% plus range of gross margins. A year ago, we were in the 50s and we're now well on our way towards that objective over time of getting to 70% plus. And you're starting to see the leverage that we're getting right now on driving improvements in the gross margin on that.\nThomas Blakey: Very true. Great, thanks guys. Great quarter.\nGary Merrill: Thank you.\nOperator: My apologies. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, thanks guys. Thanks for the quick follow up. I'll be brief here. Obviously a lot of momentum around the cybersecurity and the resilience attributes of the business. I'm just curious like architecturally as we think about the data center and what's evolving, overall around AI, are you starting to see any engagements with customers that you could distinctly say that AI is actually driving this kind of change of sentiment or investment cycle for your business as enterprises kind of scrubbed through and think about their data and how they're going to leverage that more, from an AI perspective going forward?\nSanjay Mirchandani: I mean, the answer, the short answer is you can't have a conversation without AI coming up. That's just a fact. Now, what we've done is Aaron, we've kind of, I'll turn your question on its head a little bit. And what we've done is look at what we can do for customers that makes their life better because of AI. Now, we've had AI in our technology for many years, but mostly in machine learning type and automation type scenarios. Now, with the newer generation of AI, our first foray into really delivering value, not just AI washing our technology, but truly delivering value falls into three primary buckets. One is operational scale and resilience, giving them the ability to really work with large volumes of data with deep degrees of automation. Okay, and so the operational AI just enables that, and that's in the product today. The second is really threat and risk management and assessment. So with the number of risks, the threats and the volume of data that's been written and restored, AI can do a wonderful job helping customers really do the anomaly detection, really do the cyber, get real cyber resilience. So we've built a lot of that into the product. And the one that I think is getting great traction, which I think has immense value, is predictive recovery. The complexity of recovering data with absolutely solid clean backups for a customer who's just been breached is very complex because of the sophistication of the breaches. And the time span between entry and payload. And so we're using AI to help customers really get a great starting point and then applying AI across a clean room recovery scenario to really help customers truly be resilient and recover. At the end of the day, that's what matters. And so these are the three, I'm oversimplifying it, but these are the three big buckets under which we've applied AI in the first avatar of our technology. And it's continuing. We have a very rich and robust roadmap and everything I've talked about exists. So there's no AI washing it, of which there's a lot going on right now. And we have to be, we have to be very, we take a very conservative approach around this because at the end of the day, it's mission critical data that we're working with for our customers.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Thanks, Aaron.\nOperator: This concludes the question and answer session. I will turn the call over to Mike Melnyk for closing remarks.\nMichael Melnyk: Thanks everyone for joining this morning.

Sanjay?\nSanjay Mirchandani: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I am pleased to report our Q2 results exceeded expectations, and we improved across our most important KPIs. Total ARR, the primary metric we use to measure underlying growth accelerated 18% year-over-year to $711 million. Subscription ARR grew 32% year-over-year to $530 million and is now nearly 75% of total ARR. SaaS momentum accelerated with Metallic ARR, up 77% year-over-year to $131 million. Metallic-SaaS net dollar retention rebounded to an impressive 130%. And we delivered improved profitability while continuing to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Beyond these impressive financial results, we also received numerous industry accolades, including being named the leader for the 12th consecutive time in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant. We also ranked highest in six of seven categories in Gartner's latest critical capabilities for enterprise backup and recovery software solutions report. And once again, GigaOm named us a Leader and an Outperformer in its most recent GigaOm Radar for Hybrid Cloud Data Protection for Large Enterprises. We're extremely proud of this recognition. We're laser-focused on being a trusted partner to our customers by protecting their data from the threats of cyber threats, significantly reducing ramp at hybrid class complexity and infusing AI-enabled automation to tackle new and evolving data protection and security challenges. And we're just getting started. Next week, at our Commvault Shift Customer and Partner event, we will highlight how we are shifting from data protection to leading the charge in cyber resilience. We're going to introduce a radically new approach that empowers customers to stand up to today's nonstop and escalating cyber threats. We're bringing together what we're known for best-in-class data protection and combining it with exceptional data security, recovery and -driven data intelligence. Cyber resilience like this has never been possible until now. The time has never been better. According to a recent IDC study, most enterprises expected imminent attack. 61% of respondents believe the data loss in the next 12 months is likely to occur due to an increasingly sophisticated attack. It's clear a new standard in cyber resilience is required, and that's what we're going to deliver. Commvault has always prided itself on delivering the best technology that customers need at the right time, case in point. 4 years ago, we challenged ourselves to address an emergent need in the market, enterprise-grade cloud-native data protection as a service. We made some bold moves, disrupted from within and took a new modern approach to launch Metallic, our industry-leading hypergrowth SaaS platform. We vastly simplified how we secure and defend data for any workload regardless of where it is and in the process. We revolutionize data protection as a service. Since then, we've gained over 4,000 customers and surpassed $130 million in ARR. And just last week, Commvault was named the leading vendor in GigaOm's cloud-based data protection sonar report. The authors noted \"Metallic protects a very broad range of cloud workloads that will be tedious to fully enumerate\". The building on the overwhelming success of our platform, we're now taking the opportunity to apply everything we've learned in data protection and combining it with powerful new innovations in data security, AI and recovery to deliver the most advanced cyber resilience platform in the industry. Next week at shift, we will unbaled this to the world along with some exciting new ecosystem partnerships that will enable us to transcend the category. Today's problems cannot be solved with yesterday's approach. It's time to shift how we think about resilience. We hope that you can tune into the exciting event. Now I'll turn it over to Gary to discuss the numbers. Gary?\nGary Merrill: Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that our strong revenue and earnings outperformance in Q2 was driven by acceleration across our key KPIs during the quarter. Q2 total revenue was $201 million, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Our total revenue growth was led by subscription revenue of $98 million, an increase of 25% year-over-year. As a reminder, subscription revenue includes both our term software licenses and our SaaS offerings. We saw double-digit growth in term software licenses combined with an accelerating contribution of SaaS revenue, which was up over 80% year-over-year. Subscription revenue is now approaching 50% of total revenue compared to 42% one year ago. Term software license growth was driven by strong performance in renewals and its existing customer expansion during the quarter, with our subscription net dollar retention remaining within its historical range. Overall term software deal volume increased year-over-year driven by continued improvements in our philosophy motion. Q2 perpetual license revenues were $14 million. As a reminder, our go-to-market motion is led by subscription. So perpetual license license sales are generally sold in certain verticals and geographies. At the current perpetual license revenue run rate, we believe the headwind to our reported total revenue growth from these perpetual license sales to start to normalize as we exit the current fiscal year. Q2 customer support revenue was $77 million, which includes support for both our term-based and perpetual software licenses. Fiscal year 2024, customer support revenue had benefited from fewer conversions of perpetual support contracts to term software licenses compared to prior year. Year-to-date, customer support revenue from perpetual licenses represents 55% of total customer support, with the balance coming from term software licenses. This compares to approximately 60% in fiscal year 2023 and 70% in fiscal year 2022. At this trajectory, we expect customer support revenue from term-based software licenses to become the majority of our customer support revenue next fiscal year. Moving from revenue to ARR. Q2 ARR growth accelerated 18% year-over-year to $711 million, and subscription ARR, which includes term-based software arrangements and SaaS contracts, grew 32% year-over-year to $530 million. These growth metrics reflect the underlying strength of our business, when our revenue is presented on an annualized basis without the impact of subscription software term length compression. SaaS ARR finished the quarter at $131 million, an increase of 77% year-over-year. We saw healthy growth in new customers, as well as expansion within our existing customer base. SaaS net dollar retention rate for Q2 accelerated to 130% versus 118%, we reported last quarter. Now I'll discuss expenses and profitability. Fiscal Q2 gross margins were 82% and reflect a 150 basis point year-over-year impact from our accelerating SaaS revenue, which carries a higher cost of sale than software. Fiscal Q2 operating expenses were $121 million, up 2% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, operating expenses declined 310 basis points year-over-year to 60% of total revenue, driving EBIT margin leverage, as we manage our people, facilities and third-party expenses by focusing investment on our most critical priorities. We ended the quarter with a global headcount of 2,900 employees, reflecting a 1% decline year-over-year. Our current headcount balance includes an additional inside sales teams for renewables and related customer success teams to support the customer journey and our accelerating velocity sales motion. Non-GAAP EBIT for Q2 increased 19% year-over-year to $42 million, and non-GAAP EBIT margins were 20.9%, a 210 basis point improvement year-over-year. The strong earnings and EBIT margin expansion was driven by continued operating expense discipline relative to our top line revenue. Moving to some key balance sheet and cash flow metrics. We ended the quarter with no debt and $283 million in cash, of which $93 million within the United States. Our Q2 free cash flow was $40 million and our first half fiscal year 2024 free cash flow was $78 million, up 10% year-over-year. The biggest driver of free cash flow is SaaS deferred revenue and the strength of our software subscription renewals, which typically include upfront payments on multiyear contracts. In Q2, we repurchased an additional $31 million of stock under our repurchase program. And at the halfway point of fiscal year 2024, we have repurchased $82 million of stock, representing 106% of our first half free cash flow. Now I'll discuss our outlook for fiscal Q3 and the full fiscal year 2024. We continue to believe that ARR and free cash flow to be viewed as primary KPIs of our underlying business momentum. All of our following guidance metrics are based on current foreign currency exchange rates. For fiscal Q3, we expect subscription revenue, which includes both the software portion of term-based licenses and SaaS to be $106 million to $110 million. This represents 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect total revenue to be $206 million to $210 million with year-over-year growth of 7% at the midpoint. At these revenue levels, we expect Q3 consolidated gross margins to be approximately 82.5% and EBIT margins of approximately 21%. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we are executing some foundational go-to-market changes, which includes amplifying our discrete focus on our land expand opportunities while also scaling our motion to secure our growing subscription renewal base. We will continue to hire field resources and additional inside sales reps focused solely on the SaaS velocity market as we refine our segmentation model. These continuing investments are reflected in our margin guidance. Our projected diluted share count for fiscal Q3 is 44.7 million shares. Now I would like to give an updated outlook on the full fiscal year 2024, which includes raising both our total revenue and total ARR expectations for the full year. We expect fiscal year 2024 total ARR growth of 14% year-over-year, which reflects a 100 basis point increase over our prior guidance. We now expect subscription ARR, which includes term-based licenses and SaaS to increase 24% year-over-year. From a revenue perspective, we now expect subscription revenue to be in the range of $408 million to $418 million growing 19% year-over-year at the midpoint. At these levels, subscription revenue will exceed over 50% of our total revenues. Our updated guidance reflects a mix shift from subscription revenue due to a lower number of conversions from perpetual support contracts to term software compared to the prior year, as well as continued measured spending for lower multi-year transactions in a relative high interest rate environment. As a result, we expect total revenue to be in the range of $812 million to $822 million. This is an increase compared to our prior total revenue range of $805 million to $815 million. Our improved fiscal year 2024 total revenue outlook reflects strong renewal activity, the ongoing momentum in our SaaS velocity business and the seasonally stronger trends that we historically see in the second half of the fiscal year. Moving to full year fiscal 2024 margin EBIT and cash flow outlook. We continue to expect consolidated gross margins of 82% to 83% and non-GAAP EBIT margin expansion of 50 basis points to 100 basis points year-over-year. We are also maintaining our expected full year free cash flow of $170 million. As of September 30, we had $174 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization, and we expect to continue with our existing practice of repurchasing at least 75% of our annual free cash flows. We view share repurchases as a primary use of excess cash. Year-to-date, we are pacing well ahead of our annual share repurchase target, and we intend to continue the share repurchase momentum during the current quarter. For additional details and trends on all of our key metrics, please take time to review our Investor deck contained in the Investor Relations section of our website. In closing, we've built a durable and multifaceted revenue model that should allow us to exceed ARR, total revenue and earnings objectives over the long-term. We are excited about the future, and we look forward to hooting many of you at our SHIFT events in New York City next week. Operator, you can now open the line for questions.\nQ - Aaron Rakers: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on the execution in the quarter. I guess my question is, just help me understand a little bit more. It looks like clearly, your ARR updated guidance is a little bit lower than your prior guide, 24%. On the subscription side, I should say, relative to 27. And then obviously, revenue a little bit lower at the midpoint. Can you just -- I know you made some comments in your prepared remarks, but could you unpack that change in the guidance a little bit further?\nGary Merrill : Hey, Aaron, it's Gary. Good to talk to you this morning. And I think specifically, I think you're asking about Q3, the Q3 outlook or the full year outlook first. Let me just clarify you are asking.\nAaron Rakers: Yes, I'm talking more full year, the 24% versus prior 27 in the $408 million to $418 million versus the prior $420 million to $430 million.\nGary Merrill : Got it. Okay. Awesome. Well, first of all, let me just reflect a little bit on the first half. We're really pleased with the first half, especially where we ended up at fiscal Q2 on all of our guided metrics, making sure we accelerated past everything. From a full year perspective, as kind of I thought about the second half in particular, coming off of the first half. I'm also pleased that we did raise our ARR guidance. Previously we -- we're guiding to 13 instead of that to 14 as well as our total revenue also increasing our guidance on total revenue. A lot of that is reflective of a lot of the success even we're seeing on the SaaS business as well, right? When we drive that SaaS -- that SaaS success, and we're able to hit $131 million of ARR. A lot of that does not show up in reported revenue or reported revenue expectations. But as I think about the subscription revenue specifically, I think, directly at your question, there's a couple of things that are going on there. We are seeing fewer conversions, so conversions from our existing perpetual support contracts being converted to term software licenses. In today's interest rate environment, those conversions usually come with a multiyear commitment, doing a three-year commitment and some of the interest rate factors and the cost of money as well as where customers are in their cloud journey at the same time. So we're seeing just some declines year-over-year modestly on the conversion fees as well as the continued trends on term subscription length. So when we sell term subscriptions, our average term is now down to about two years. So while that keeps ARR total, and we see the momentum on ARR, it could have a little bit of a short-term impact on the reported revenue results And then thirdly, just keeping in mind that we're watching the mega deal, the real big deal trends in the spending environment and being cautious on the procurement and approval cycles that are out there today.\nAaron Rakers: Yes. That's very helpful. I appreciate that color. So maybe just the final question, sticking with that topic. How would you characterize the linearity in this quarter, the demand? Have you seen any customers push out projects or delay spending in this environment at this point, or is it just more cautionary on the macro, the geopolitical environment as more so we look forward?\nGary Merrill: More cautionary. We do not see trends that deteriorated. Our trends that we're seeing in the business on close rates and linearity are consistent with what we've seen over the past few quarters. But relative to the geopolitical nature of what's going on and just being cautionary on the time it takes to close some of those big deals.\nAaron Rakers: Thank you, Gary \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Howard Ma from Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. \nHoward Ma: Great. Thank you for taking the question. So I also want to better understand the lower subscription ARR and revenue guidance because that seems to be the only negative in an otherwise stellar print. Is the -- so I understand the change in -- the lower migrations from perpetual maintenance to subscription, I didn't think the impact was that big. Can you comment -- I guess for Gary, can you comment, are there any other factors such as -- I mean did you -- were there any deal pull forwards in Q2? Are you like in the back half, are you expecting any renewal push outs? Because I believe this year, it's a pretty back-end weighted -- or second half weighted rather renewal year. And then just given the Metallic strength, too, I wouldn't -- wouldn't continued strength in Metallic at least on the ARR side, I understand it takes time for ARR to transit over to revenue, but wouldn't that offset some of the perpetual migrations? Thanks.\nGary Merrill: Yes. Thanks, Howard. Maybe first, quickly on the SaaS side of the Metallics. So the ARR accelerated actually higher than we've seen in current periods, right? If you look at the ARR for SaaS, we went from $113 million to $131 million of ARR. That sequential increase we're seeing on the SaaS side is accelerating faster than we'd actually seen over the past prior quarters. So, you can kind of see that as you turned out the SaaS ARR and the acceleration there, coupled with Howard, the -- what we saw on the net salary retention rate of 130%. So, really a good focus on driving that net dollar retention. When I look at the guidance on subscription, it's -- the biggest factor is fewer conversions and how you can see that also is you'll see the strong overperformance on the customer support side, right? So if you look at the custom support revenue, and you see the acceleration there, meaning the acceleration relative to the prior expectations, that's where you kind of see -- that's where you see the offset. And that's where you see the offset on the positive side there. And it's just the fewer conversions we're doing about -- on pay for about half of what we did last year is what I kind of see just based on current pipeline metrics, we're on basically about half of the conversions that we did last year, which is just a transitional in the customer environment as well as monitoring the term length of our deals, right? So, getting it down to about two years on average.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Hey Howard, it's Sanjay. We're just trying to be realistic given we're looking out for the whole year. If there's -- it's just a mix shift. In my mind, there's nothing -- we added, what, over 500 customers in the subscription mix in Q2. Metallic is growing at a very healthy clip. We grew 77% ARR year-on-year. So, this isn't -- don't read into this in anything, but we're just looking at the pipeline and being very pragmatic about what the mix shift might be and that's it. I mean business -- we had a very good quarter, and we've raised ARR for the year, and we've raised revenue for the year. So, it's in my mind, as straightforward as a mix shift inside of the customer buying patterns, whether it be interest rate or where they are in their cloud migration journey.\nHoward Ma: Thank you, Sanjay, and Gary. I do want to -- as a follow-up, I do want to hone in on Metallic because as you guys mentioned, it was a really strong quarter for Metallic and are accelerating to 130%, which is up from, I believe, 118% a quarter ago and then 125% is the quarter prior. Can you just remind us what is the rank order of drivers of growth for Metallic between workload expansion and cross-sell of additional Metallic products? And then on the growth rate, again, very strong, but it has been pretty variable. Is it -- should we expect this kind of variability going forward?\nGary Merrill: Hey Howard, it's Gary. I'll hit that. So, there's really good key things. The acceleration that we saw in Metallic's net dollar retention drove by a few things. There's the foundation, first of all, what I mean by the foundation is we're at the point now that we have a matured renewal motion. So, when we get that mature renewal motion and we see really strong renewal rates, it limits any of the downside on the net dollar retention. So, it's built with the foundation. And that foundation is really the focus on what we're doing on onboarding and adoption. So, driving to get the customers onboarded, get them to their first back up, get them fully adopted, then that drives the expansion opportunity. The other thing that we now have is an integrated motion between our customer success and our field sales teams. So, their customers' success teams are driving the adoption with the field teams combined driving the expansion. So, it all starts on accelerating the time to first back up and the time to consumption. As I think about the split between, I'll use cross-sell and upsell, we're seeing the majority of the expansion being driven by, at this point, upsell, which is generally more of the same product. However, we're now seeing more than 2x growth on some of those mission-critical or the emerging workloads that we see whether it's sales force dynamics, threatwise, hybrid cloud, databases. The dollar value of those are now up 2x year-over-year. So it's less of a contribution because it's less of a percent of the total, but the contribution now is starting to become material, even though the majority of it is driven by upsell. So we're getting it from all ends. Just in summary, we're getting that mature rental motion. We're getting the upsell, getting them adopted, so we can get expand on more of the same products. And now we're starting to see the cross-sell start to kick-in as well.\nHoward Ma: Okay. Thank you.\nSanjay Mirchandani: And Howard, I'd like to add a little bit on just overall, some color on the SaaS business. It is the driver of growth. It is growing well. It's a vehicle by which we land hundreds of new customers a quarter. Our security capabilities that we've integrated the Security IT, which is our delivery platform inside of Metallic for our customers is doing well. Gary talked about the go-to-market capabilities. And we're investing for the future with mission-critical workloads. We thought -- I quoted -- I think it was Giga [ph] that talked in this one report about having -- we had more hyper cloud and more mission-critical workloads out there, there are two TVs to compete. It's -- you have to be one step ahead of the customer. You have to be ready for the workhouse they want to protect. And that is exactly what we've been doing. And we -- the NRR, we sort of -- we mentioned last quarter that it was -- we thought it was an anomaly and we would get it back to normal sort of pattern. And I think we got that, and we'll keep -- we'll keep focusing on it. So it's still a young business. It's three years old in effect, we're very happy with where it is, but there's a lot to do.\nHoward Ma: Sanjay, it's great to see the Metallic growth engine kicking in and congrats on the strong quarter.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Thank you, Howard.\nGary Merrill: Thanks, Howard.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Fish from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJames Fish: Hey guys. Thanks for the questions. Maybe building off of the past couple here. I guess, how should we be thinking about net retention rate for Metallic this year and sustainably, like what are you guys internally kind of targeting for the next couple of years? Just trying to understand if some of this material boost in net retention rate is just catch up from like last quarter, for example, or sustainable. And two kind of the points you both have made here, what makes you confident that some of the Metallic strength here isn't due to substitution of your term business, especially if we're talking more mission-critical workloads moving on to Metallic?\nGary Merrill: Yes. Hey Jim, it's Gary. I'll start at all. I think the -- we're not guiding explicitly to this asset. I think if you see what's kind of at our level of majority of our SaaS business, meaning in that $130 million-ish of NRR. I think world-class NRR rates are somewhere between 120% to 130%. I think 130% is a little on the high-end on a sustainable piece that we delivered this quarter, especially as the base continues to grow every quarter. If we're somewhere in that range of 100 to 125, right, so bracketed somewhere between last quarter and this quarter on a consistent basis and working towards that, I think that's probably -- I think that's a good measure. We are seeing --\nSanjay Mirchandani: We have – less than 120 to 125.\nGary Merrill: Yes. Sorry, 120 to 125. Sorry, just to clarify that Jim. And then from more of the hybrid cloud mission-critical workloads, we are start seeing some very good growth on that -- on the SaaS business. Now, that growth right now is incremental. It's not enough to be truly cannibalizing the term-based software licenses from an actual deal perspective. Though customers are in the early innings of their cloud journey, right? So, they are taking the time, and that shows up in ASPs and the length of deals were in the early part of their cloud journey and cloud innings of migration. They're taking the time to make sure they measure their spending, and they're only committing to periods right to measure it with what they see in the near-term.\nJames Fish: Got it. Helpful. And just remind me here. What really happened at the end of the quarter that essentially SaaS ARR accelerated, but we saw a deceleration secondly, in Metallic revenue that now revenue is actually outpacing ARR. Was it more of a back-end loaded quarter for Metallic? Should -- with it being about 77% ARR growth, should we be expecting stable Metallic revenue growth for fiscal Q3 essentially versus fiscal Q2?\nSanjay Mirchandani: No, I think stable. Any Metallic contracts that we signed in the second half of the quarter have very, very little revenue impact. So, linearity has less of an impact because you just don't get anything -- not much of anything, sorry, not much of anything, once you get past the first half of the quarter or linear to Metallic was relative to prior quarters. So, nothing unusual there.\nJames Fish: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rudy Kessinger from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nRudy Kessinger: Hey thanks for taking my questions guys. It's great to see the dollar-based net retention rate rebound on Metallic. I guess the flip side of that is when I look at the growth in Metallic ARR from new customers, both on a dollar basis or as a percentage point of growth basis, it was down this quarter versus last quarter. I know your subscription customer adds continue to be about five quarter. But if you look at your new customers on Metallic, are you seeing customers start smaller just given the macro conditions and financial constraints that customers have, or what are you seeing from a new perspective on Metallic?\nGary Merrill: Hey Rudy, it's Gary. I'll hit that and good to hear from you. At the first half of the year, we're in a good shape Metallic on the new customer. I think probably somebody your math hit it on. We were probably a little stronger in Q1 on new customer. And then in Q2, existing customer was relatively a little stronger than new. But over the first half, that's kind of now evened out. And a business this young, it's hard to look at just one quarter as a long-term trend. We look back over two, three, four, five quarters to make sure that our trajectory on both our new existing or happening, and we're pleased with where that is. So, we're not reading into the one quarter. We still saw over 500 subscription new customers added during the quarter, and the vast majority of those are SaaS. So, we're still seeing it. Now, yes, the deal sizes and the ASPs are smaller. They're smaller, but we're okay with that because if I go back to the commentary I made on the net dollar retention and that focus on adoption, time to first backup recovery and then driving expansion and workload expansion, we're betting on the future and our ability to drive that expansion as well.\nSanjay Mirchandani: And -- and this is Sanjay, Rudy. The smaller ASPs is kind of part of the plan because we have a velocity business where we land smaller deals. We have marketplace business, which a smaller deal. We have MSPs that bring in smaller deals that we expand over time. So, it's a mix. We sell to the enterprise and we sell through MSPs. We said we've got the whole range.\nRudy Kessinger: Okay. Got it. That's fair. And then I hear you on the conversion, seeing fewer conversions, I guess, just if we look at your term license subscription business, if you strip out conversions, as we start to tweak our models for next fiscal year, I know we got a couple of quarters ago for this year. But ex-conversions, subscription license, a single-digit growth business going forward? Is that a low double-digit growth business going forward? What should we be expecting there just over the near to immediate term?\nGary Merrill: Yes. So we're not giving obviously the longer-term guidance. But even if I talk a little bit about what we saw in Q2, what we saw in Q2, you can kind of interpolate that our term license offer grew double-digits, right? So within subscription, our term software license grew double-digits, and that's with are conversion down substantially year-over-year. If you look at the guidance that I gave for fiscal Q3, the quarter that we're currently in, it's a very similar trend, where we're guiding to roughly double-digit within there will be double-digit term software growth year-over-year with same situation, conversions down year-over-year. So we're driving that growth and we're doing that regardless of the conversions. The conversions are a little variable in there, which is fine. I think they'll stabilize over time. We're just kind of giving scenarios based on currently what we see and where we see customers kind of in that journey.\nSanjay Mirchandani: There's definitely -- there's definitely customers are in that hybrid cloud journey, where they've got to make some tough calls, rearchitect, rebuild, shift, migrate, mission-critical workloads, not just independently but stacks into the cloud. And that's hard. And as -- and part of what we're going to talk about next week is how we're going to help customers do that. So when you look at the complexity of that, it's – you have to look at it and say, if I was the customer, how would I think about it? I'd say, okay, I got to get to the other side before I make a shift on something. So if you see -- if you look at the term, when you look at the license model or you look at going from software to SaaS, these are important decisions in the journey with the hybrid cloud. After that security and cyber risk, so there's a lot of factors, and we are very well positioned to – to help customers through that, and we are, which is why we see the momentum in our security capabilities and customers using that, adding up 500 new customers on the software, subscription and SaaS platform. So I wouldn't read into it too much, I would say it's -- they're in the crosshairs of sort of getting from one side to the other in critical mass, and that's what you're kind of seeing there\nRudy Kessinger: That's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the good SaaS figures in the quarter.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Thank you\nGary Merrill: Thanks, Rudy.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi from Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nEric Martinuzzi: Yes. The perpetual license for the year, I think in past quarters, you've talked about expectation for $40 million to $50 million for fiscal 2024. Given you're at about $27 million here at the midpoint, are you still thinking in that $40 million to $50 million range?\nGary Merrill: Yes. Eric, it's Gary. That's correct. The trend we've seen in the first half of the fiscal year, I think our trend for the second half will be at -- will be at similar. We'll be at similar paces, maybe slightly less as the motion is fully now dedicated to drive the term subscription and SaaS business, we still have some vertical that are out there that still buy perpetual, but those verticals become limited every single day. So the range of 40% to 50% is still there.\nEric Martinuzzi: Okay. But given the $27 million in the front half that would mean 23% would be the metric you would expect?\nGary Merrill: Yes, it would be the high end of the range. Yes, we'll be the high end of the range. Yes.\nEric Martinuzzi: All right. And then it looked like outperformance international, international revenue, I think, was up 12% in the quarter. Just curious to know if you expect that -- is that just kind of a revert to the mean, or are we expecting that to outperform for the remainder of the year?\nGary Merrill: Yes. Eric, I'll take that. It's Gary again. So, very pleased with both of our regions. Our Americas business in total was up about 4%, and our international business was up, as you said, 12%. So both businesses returning to growth, which is that acceleration of total revenue growth of about 7% year-over-year, which we're pleased with. Our EMEA business is driving some growth. We're now seeing some really good acceleration on as well the subscription adoption. The Americas was more mature first and now the international business is driving with some of that really strong subscription adoption. The deal sizes in international are a little bit smaller relative to the Americas. So some of the lumpiness you can get on the Americas on the mega deals and some of the term -- the term length topics we've talked about is less prevalent international. So we're able to drive the really strong velocity business in the international markets.\nEric Martinuzzi: Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.\nGary Merrill: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJason Ader: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask you first on the outlook for customer support revenue. As more of that mix comes from term do you expect the year-over-year decline to start to subside? You're down 9% in customer more in fiscal 2023 this year is going to be something I guess, slightly lower than that. But do you expect as we move forward into 2025 and 2026, so we should see that continue to -- the declines continue to subside.\nGary Merrill: Yeah. Jason, it's Gary. I'll take this question as well. So you've already started to see that even if you look at fiscal Q2 actual, it's one of the smallest declines we've had in quite some time. And the key driver to that is now a higher percentage of that customer support revenue is being driven by term. This year, we're on a pace where we'll get that amount of customer support related to term software license is probably to be somewhere 45%-ish to 50% roughly. And as we enter into next fiscal year, it should be the crossover year -- crossover year, meaning that as next fiscal year, the majority of customer support revenue will be derived from the term-related software contracts. That natural motion will then start to flat line the impact. And then what that does, it will start to alleviate some of the headwinds that had on the total revenue growth. A big piece of our total revenue growth becomes the impact of the customer support. And as we get into next fiscal year and the fiscal year after that, that will start to moderate. And you would expect the impact year-over-year or the decline to be significantly less than we've seen in prior years, including this year.\nJason Ader: Got you. So the only, let's call it, the only sort of more significant headwind will be perpetual license line. Do you have any -- like you talked about 40% to 50% sort of towards the high end of that range this year in perpetual license revenue? As we move forward into '25 and '26 with pinning you down on specific guidance, do you think that will sort of continue to trail off sort of modestly, or do you think it will actually be more of a sharp falloff?\nGary Merrill: Modest. I think it will be modest. There will be similar to the impacts on total revenue as the customer supports us. If we end up somewhere, say, this year at the high end of that $40 million to $50 million, call roughly $50 million. Then as we get into next year, we're likely to be in that range, but probably more towards the lower end of that range. So you're talking variability is not significant on a revenue number that's obviously over $800 million.\nJason Ader: Got you. Got you. Okay. Great. And then, Sanjay, I've got one for you, just on the SMB and mid-market dynamics, less about competition, but it's more about how SMB and mid-market customers are actually purchasing and procuring backup software and backup services. Can you just talk through, how you guys have -- let's call it, adapted your strategy because, it does seem like more of that market is shifting towards as a service offerings.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Sure. So for that particular segment, we've -- I think we mentioned in a couple of calls prior to this, Jason, that we've invested in a velocity motion, which loosely translates to ISRs plus a channel motion that allows us to go up the velocity of the smaller customers. That's number one. In addition, we've also been working with a growing MSP community and many customers, as you mentioned, like to work through that. The third is marketplaces as the hyperscalers sort of promote their marketplaces, we see customers being able to sort of tap into that motion and available software or SaaS right through that. So those are just some examples of how we're enabling -- our technology can be more accessible to our customers in the way they like to purchase.\nJason Ader: And one quick follow-up and I'll see the floor. But on the metallic business, Sanjay, can you give us a sense of how much of that business is coming from sort of SMB mid-market customers versus enterprise?\nSanjay Mirchandani: I think it's -- if the trend has been fairly consistent, the enterprise side of our business is about one-third enterprise, roughly one-third mid-market, and one-third SMB. It's not by design necessarily. It seems to be following that. And I'm actually quite pleased with it because it derisks our business but also gives us a chance to grow in the areas that we haven't historically like the SMB and the lower mid-market.\nJason Ader: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Blakeley from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTom Blakeley: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Just a couple, Sanjay, if you could go back to that hybrid cloud journey answer you gave a prior call questioner. Is that company-specific, or could you talk to just the greater view in the industry in terms of things being complex and it seems to be a bit of a pause, hybrid cloud spend has received a bit of an uptick in the last few quarters, if not longer, as there's been a deceleration in public cloud spend in general. I just wanted to, kind of, maybe if you could clarify that or give any color it would be very helpful. And then just secondly, for -- on the NRR for Metallic, the split-up between capacity growth and new services, if you could? And if security, maybe it's a premature question, but is security impacting that NRR, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Okay. Let me process those. So the hybrid cloud journey, my thinking there is the fall. The customers -- think about it a little bit, first of all, as a trailing indicator. So it's about utilization. It's about workloads that use the commitment that customers have made in the hybrid cloud or the public cloud services. And what we're doing is helping customers through those difficult journeys because as the easy workloads move to the cloud, it gets harder and harder to move entire stack of mission-critical capabilities and run them entirely on public cloud services or hybrid cloud capabilities. And that's what I was referring to and we're helping customers, whether it be through moving that data, whether it's their infrastructure, whether it's their data security, whether it's applying intelligence incentive data management across that stack data into light. Tere's a lot of things that move into the hybrid cloud open up. And we're across a lot of those use cases and a lot of those outcomes. So that's where I was going. And it's not so much a -- whether it's increasing or decreasing in spend from a public cloud capability, it's really the utilization and making sure that customers are getting the value that they anticipated from that journey to the cloud. I was a CIO. It's moving mission-critical workloads, into a cloud or any other platform is -- it requires a lot of -- it is complex and requires a lot of thoughtful list and the right choices. And that's what we're trying to help our customers with. So that's my -- I want to pause there. Did I cover your question?\nTom Blakeley: Yeah. Yeah. Just maybe a follow-up there, before we get to the NRR, does that imply from a trailing indicator perspective that there might be some pent-up demand for Commvault in that regard?\nSanjay Mirchandani: As the short answers, I would hope so. Because as customers move to the -- and a lot of what we're going to talk about next week, Tom, is about where we see the customer journey? Where we see them sort of having to make tough decisions? Where -- what are the hard problems there helping them with -- on data? Do they have to make choices between software and SaaS? The security models using AI. These are recovery capabilities when -- in the life of cyber resilience. These are all important decisions that have to be made as the journey to the cloud becomes more-and-more pervasive for our customers. And we're trying to be one to two steps ahead of them in anticipating that. So I would hope so.\nTom Blakeley: And then just on the $130 million is a strong number. Just any type of commentary on the mix of capacity growth and new services there and possibly if securities impacting that would be helpful. Thanks.\nGary Merrill: Sure. Hey Tom, Tom its Gary, I'll take that one. Relative to the 130% of net dollar retention, as you think about the drivers of what drove that from an up-sell versus cross-sell, about two-thirds of that comes from up-sell. Meaning, up-sell more of a similar capacity or licenses or seats and about third or roughly there comes from cross-sell, which benefits of the cross-sell motion, whether it be dynamics, whether it be our security offering, the hybrid cloud for VMs or databases, they're all contributing factors. Absolutely, security is part of that. But we're seeing a little bit more on the up-sell and about third of that expansion on the nor driven from cross-sell.\nTom Blakeley: Thanks Gary. Thanks guys.\nOperator: We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Michael Melnyk for closing remarks.\nMichael Melnyk: Thank you for joining the call today.

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mike Melnyk, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMike Melnyk : Morning, and welcome to our earnings conference call. I'm Mike Melnyk, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by Sanjay Mirchandani, Commvault's CEO; and Gary Merrill, Commvault's CFO. An earnings presentation with key financial and operating metrics is posted on the Investor Relations website for your reference. Statements made on today's call will include forward-looking statements about Commvault, future expectations, plans and prospects. All such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Please refer to the cautionary language in today's earnings release and Commvault's most recent periodic reports filed with the SEC for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to be materially different from those contemplated in these forward-looking statements. Commvault does not assume any obligation to update these statements. During the call, Commvault's financial results are presented on a non-GAAP basis. A reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP can be found on our website. Thank you for joining us. Now I'll turn the call over to Sanjay for his remarks. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mirchandani: Thank you, Mike. Good morning. I'm pleased to report our Q1 results met our expectations and position us well for fiscal year 2024. Let me share some highlights. Total ARR, the metric we use to measure the growth of our recurring revenue streams, increased 15% year-over-year to $686 million. Our subscription ARR grew 32% year-over-year to $500 million. Metallic, our hyper growth SaaS platform grew ARR 72% year-over-year and now exceeds 4,000 customers. All of these showcased the strength of our subscription-based recurring revenue model that we've been driving to over the past several years. And we did it while delivering 22% EBIT margins and continuing to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. Our strategic objective is clear: to be the leading cloud first data protection company in the industry. This requires constant innovation, execution excellence and the ability to rapidly evolve with the ever-changing data protection market. Our customers have reached inflection driven by 4 major forces that are shifting the data protection demands and expectations of the modern enterprise. One, they're experiencing unique and complex challenges on their hybrid cloud journeys. Two, customers shouldn't have to choose between a software and SaaS. At this point, it should be a natural and seamless decision with a modern unified platform. Three, the world of data protection and data security are converging and require customers to consider a new approach. And lastly, the advancements in artificial intelligence have opened the door to improved customer experiences and increased value. Let's discuss each of these. The first and perhaps most important is the industry-wide move towards the hybrid cloud. According to a recent report, 82% of IT leaders say that they have adopted hyper cloud, nearly half of which are embracing multiple public clouds. As a result, data is distributed across multiple environments. It's fragmented and in flight. Managing this new reality can become untenable in cost, complexity and security delivered at scale. To manage all of this, today's hybrid enterprises are doing nothing at all or a patchwork of anything from basic cloud native backup to point solutions. Some SaaS, some software, each intended to solve a piece of the puzzle. Rather than holistically simplifying and managing everything, this only increases more complexity and cost. This is where Commvault comes in. Which leads me to the second major force. Customers create the power and simplicity of a single as-a-service solution. Today, customers are forced to make on natural choices that are inefficient and unsustainable. Instead, they need the best of both software and SaaS in a single solution. Our cloud-based data protection platform does just that as software or SaaS on the same control plane. Not only do we help customers reduce complexity, our unified platform has the best total cost of ownership and greater value than any solution that we compete against, cloud native or software. This is revolutionary for the industry and positions us as the company to beat within the category. And both existing and new customers are embracing this technology. I'll discuss 3 examples. First, we won an M365 deal with Netcare, a publicly traded South African health care company. The company cited the simplicity and cost efficiency of our single platform versus the existing cloud native solution as the key decision-making criteria.  Second thesis, a SaaS-based student learning system chose Commvault to drive 6-figure cost savings versus its cloud native tools. Third, a Fortune 1000 food manufacturer and an existing Commvault software customer expanded with our SaaS solution to protect thousands of Office 365 users. With each of these customers, we were the natural choice, given our proven mission-critical capabilities, our ability to operate between technologies and workloads our cost advantages and our capability to accommodate future cloud use cases on our platform. These examples are consistent with the trends we've seen every quarter since the launch of our SaaS platform. 40% of our SaaS customers use another Commvault product and 30% use multiple SaaS offerings. Software and SaaS are complementary and accretive to our business, which brings us to the third course. As a line between data protection and data security players, customers are rethinking their approach to modern cyber resiliency. Ransomware threats are on the rise again in 2023. Data from cryptocurrency trading firm chain analysis indicates cyber ransom payments, more than doubled in the first half of 2023. And a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, Note that cybercrime will account for $10.5 trillion in costs by 2025. Of course, ransomware is only part of the modern era of pervasive autonomous threats in conjunction with other malicious data exfiltration and data destruction activities. This is increasingly driving the need for a layered security approach that includes predictive threat analytics to defend both backup and production workloads and ironclad cyber resilience in the case of a breach. No amount of preemptive defense can take the place of unfailing rapid recovery and no amount of security is 100% successful. The two must operate hand in hand. Building on the early success of our Threatwise Cyber Deception offering. In June, we offered new security capabilities across our portfolio. These were designed to help customers proactively and reactively secure defend and recover their production workloads while strengthening their backup infrastructure. These advanced security features are managed and delivered through the simplicity of our new cloud command interface, which provides global visibility and smart insights across all workloads, monitoring backup health and security posture. We also expanded our security ecosystem to include product integrations with Microsoft, Palo Alto, [Central One] and CyberArk. While others in the industry provide limited point solutions, Commvault offers a platform that protects and enables customers to recover both production and backup environments. Finally, the fourth force impacting data protection is the topic that's driving an unprecedented frenzied adoption of AI across every enterprise. The rise of generative AI is ushering in a new era, one that is increasingly automated and autonomous and moving faster than one can imagine. We've been using AI and machine learning for years in our technology and our operations. Further leveraging AI-driven automation across our platform, we can help customers rapidly recover and also constantly optimize manage and control every aspect of their data protection capabilities. We're continuing to incorporate AI-based road maps across our offerings, and we'll take a very considered point of view around the right way to apply this new technology as it matures. Our organization's secure, defend and recover their most precious asset, the data, is fundamentally changing these forces. The bottom line is we can no longer look at each separately. The future of our industry depends on our proven ability to offer a seamless automated and cost-effective approach to these hard problems. In the fall, we'll be announcing some exciting capabilities and offerings that will further empower customers and redefine the industry. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to discuss the numbers. Gary?\nGary Merrill : Thanks, Sanjay, and good morning, everyone. Coming off a strong finish to fiscal year '23, we are off to a solid start to fiscal year '24. As a reminder, we have recast our P&L presentation effective this quarter, which is led by our term license software and SaaS offerings, which are now approaching 50% of total revenue. The revenue from these arrangements is referred to as subscription and combining them in a single line item allows the investment community to have an enhanced understanding of our results. Our fiscal Q1 results were driven by 11% year-over-year growth from our subscription business, which increased to $97 million as a result of the accelerating contribution of SaaS revenue. Q1 perpetual license revenues were $13 million. Our go-to-market motion is led by subscription. So perpetual license sales are generally sold in certain verticals and geographies. Q1 customer support revenue was $77 million, which includes support for both our term-based and perpetual software licenses. The year-over-year decline was in line with our expectations. As a result of the cumulative impact of the strategic conversion of certain perpetual customers to our subscription offerings. Moving from revenue results to ARR now. Total ARR in Q1 was $686 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, outpacing our annual growth expectations. In Q1, subscription ARR, which includes both term-based arrangements and SaaS contracts grew 32% year-over-year to $500 million, crossing a major milestone and nearly doubling over the past 8 quarters. As Sanjay noted earlier, SaaS ARR continued its strong growth, up 72% year-over-year to $113 million. SaaS net dollar retention for Q1 was 118%, with our SaaS offerings being a primary driver of customer expansion. Now I'll discuss expenses and profitability. Fiscal Q1 gross margins were 82.9% and reflect a 70 basis point year-over-year impact of our accelerating SaaS revenue, which carries a higher cost of sale than software. Fiscal Q1 operating expenses were $119 million, down 3% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with a global head count of approximately 2,800 employees, including additional inside sales reps we onboarded during the quarter to drive our velocity SaaS motion. We are managing our people, facilities and third-party expenses by focusing investment on our most critical resources. We will continue to evaluate our resource base against the market demand environment. Non-GAAP EBIT for Q1 was $44 million, and non-GAAP EBIT margins were 22%. The strong earnings result was driven by continued operating expense discipline relative to our top line revenue. Moving to some key balance sheet and cash flow metrics. We ended the quarter with no debt and $275 million in cash, of which $81 million was in the United States. Our Q1 free cash flow was $38 million, up 76% year-over-year. Key drivers of free cash flow, our deferred revenue from SaaS and the strength of our subscription software renewals, which typically include upfront payments on multiyear contracts. In Q1, we repurchased $51 million of stock under our repurchase program, representing 135% of Q1 free cash flow. Now I'll discuss our outlook for fiscal Q2. We continue to believe that ARR and free cash flow should be viewed as primary KPIs of our underlying business momentum. For fiscal Q2, we expect subscription revenue, which includes both the software portion of term-based licenses and SaaS to be $95 million to $99 million, representing 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect total revenue to be $193 million to $197 million, with year-over-year growth of 4% at the midpoint. At these revenue levels, we expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 82.5% and EBIT margin of approximately 20%. As I mentioned on our last earnings call, we are executing some foundational go-to-market changes, which include amplifying our discrete focus on our land and expand opportunities while also scaling our motion to secure our growing subscription renewal base. We continue to hire additional inside sales reps focused solely on the SaaS velocity market as we refine our segmentation model. Some of these investments will continue into fiscal Q2, and we expect that these go-to-market refinements should drive enhanced field sales productivity as we exit the fiscal year. Our projected diluted share count for fiscal Q2 is 45 million shares. As of June 30, we have $205 million remaining on our existing share repurchase authorization. We expect to continue with our existing practice of repurchasing at least 75% of our annual free cash flows. Finally, as noted on Page 2 of this morning's earnings press release, we are also reconfirming our existing guidance for all provided metrics for the full year fiscal '24. We remain confident in our full year outlook given the ongoing momentum in our SaaS business and the seasonally stronger trends we historically see in the second half of the fiscal year, including a larger term software renewal opportunity and potential for improved large-deal traction. I will now turn the call back to Sanjay for his closing remarks. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mirchandani: Thank you, Gary. Our customers are facing hard problems as they modernize their data protection approach across a hybrid cloud environment, our ability to offer them a streamlined unified approach that is powered by AI will be a welcome change and a true differentiator in our industry. We're the only company with a tested track record, vision and proven execution to deliver this value at scale. Now we'll take your questions.\nMike Melnyk: And for the -- to begin Q&A. Can we take the first question, please?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.\nAaron Rakers : A couple if I can, real quickly. I'm just curious, guys, congrats on the execution in the quarter. Just given the current macro backdrop and the spending environment that some are concerned about with regard to enterprise. I'm just curious of how you would characterize the linearity through the quarter, deal activity? Any kind of deals shrinking in terms of size or any push outs? And just kind of -- overall kind of context of what you're seeing from enterprise customers spend wise right now?\nGary Merrill: It's Gary. I can take this question. So our linearity from a fiscal Q1 perspective is what we typically see in our fiscal Q1, some of the macro trends that other companies have mentioned, we're obviously also experienced. But we have not seen, from a linearity perspective, the impact on that. I think we were consistent with some of the recent trends in the market is the deal size value, okay? We do see some pressure on the ASPs of our larger deals. And most of that is driven really by term length, okay? So the quantity of the deals and the volume of the enterprise deals is still strong. It's still actually consistent with even year-over-year levels. But what we do see a little bit of a downtick in the ASPs on compression of term as customers are continuing their journey to the cloud, right? They continue to focus on optimization of the workloads that they have and being able to make sure that they're ready for their next turn. And with some of that, they take a little bit of a step back and some of the deal size lengths start to compress a little bit. Our average length of our term deals in fiscal Q1 was about 2 years.\nAaron Rakers : And just to give some context, that was any -- what was that last quarter? What was that a year ago?\nGary Merrill: Yes. We're down -- our average term on our subscription deals is down about 10% year-over-year. And it's mid-single digits decline sequentially.\nAaron Rakers : Yes. Yes. That's helpful. I appreciate all that color. As a quick follow-up, I'm just curious, one of the things that we've thought about on the Commvault story as we moved into fiscal '24 was just -- this base of renewal opportunity setting itself up and really comping relative to what the subscription revenue looked like 3 years ago or so. Can you help us appreciate the cadence of the renewal base of business through this year? And it sounds like a potentially a pretty material step-up into the back half of the year when we look at the metrics you're giving around renewals and net dollar retention, et cetera, just help us frame that.\nGary Merrill: Sure. Aaron, I can touch on that also as well. The renewals in our business typically follow the linearity that we typically see across the broad portfolio of our go-to-market motion, which means that we'll see a higher renewal value in the second half. So that goes for both renewal opportunities and conversion opportunities. we'd expect probably about 60% in the second half versus relatively maybe 40% roughly in the first half. And some of those -- the term length discussion I had on your previous question applies to the renewals. As some of our renewals also see some of the -- those things change in dynamics on term length as well.\nAaron Rakers : Yes. And then the final question, and I'll cede the floor, is you beat operating margin this quarter, 22%, I think you guided around 20%. I know you're guiding around 20% this next quarter. So appreciating that you gave the full year -- reiterated the full year guidance of up 50 to 100 basis points year-on-year. I'm just curious to how you're thinking about the flow-through of operating margin. Is there incremental investments you're making relative to what you thought of coming into this year, why wouldn't we see some upside to that $50 million to $100 million continue to flow through as we think about the back half of the fiscal year as well?\nGary Merrill: Aaron, at this point, we're keeping our guidance for the full year for all the reported metrics consistent, there's obviously opportunity for operating margin leverage and expansion, especially as the top line accelerates, which we'd expect some of that to happen, as I mentioned, more in the back half. So where I'm sitting here today is that fundamentally, all the core tenets of our business are consistent, and we're confident in where we're at for the first half. And I think maybe revisiting where we're at, exiting Q2 for the back half is what we'll look to do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Howard Ma at Guggenheim Partners.\nHoward Ma : I have a question for Sanjay and also a question for Gary. I guess I'll start with Gary. It's actually two questions. I mean the first is a shorter one. But I guess I'll start with -- can you address the reason for the Metallic net retention rate dip, it was down by 7 percentage points versus last quarter?\nGary Merrill: Thanks for the question. So don't -- we don't look into 1 quarter as a trend for the long term for Metallic. When you look at the net dollar retention, at 118%, we still believe it is a strong result and it's still driving a lot of expansion. Typically in the net dollar retention calculation, right, the base gets bigger and bigger and bigger, which also contributes to it. So that's good. So we have a growing base. So therefore, you'll start to see the calculation kind of moderate in kind of in that 118% or so. But from an actual expansion opportunity, we're really pleased with where we're at to be able to grow off that. We're now approaching 4,000 Metallic customers. So the ability and the opportunity for us to drive that number through that 4,000 customer base is an amazing opportunity that we look forward to kind of driving in the second half.\nHoward Ma : Okay. That's fair. And my second question, it's related to what Aaron was asking, can you just talk about, Gary, the key underlying assumptions that give you confidence in achieving total and subscription ARR guidance this year? And as we model out the balance of the year, can you just talk about any notable year-over-year comps? So you mentioned the back-end weighted -- or the second half weighted renewal cycle in response to Aaron's question. Can you also talk -- is there anything else we should look out for? For instance, I know fiscal 3Q is probably an easier year-over-year comp this year. But just anything else with respect to subscription or Metallic.\nGary Merrill: Yes. A couple of things, Howard, I can touch on. So first, before I get to the second half, even by looking to the current quarter, we're in fiscal Q2, typically, that's our seasonally soft this quarter, especially in Europe. But as we start to look at the second half of the year, we're still confident in the opportunity -- in the guidance that we gave for the second half. If you look at that subscription revenue line each quarter, we get a nice tailwind of recognized revenue from SaaS. So the predictability of our subscription revenue starts to firm up every single quarter because a larger portion of that becomes SaaS revenue, which is the amortization of the ARR. When I take that, Howard, and I tie it to seasonally stronger, especially on the large deal expectations on the term license software that we typically see in the second half. All of that still contemplates all of the kind of macro trends we currently see today. We haven't seen anything substantially worse since I gave guidance roughly 90 days ago. So we're still confident in kind of what we see. The only really, I'll say, notable change that we're seeing some modest change in is the term line, which I already addressed. But despite that, we're still confident in those full year numbers.\nHoward Ma : Okay. That's helpful. And for Sanjay, can you just talk about where Commvault is in with respect to the go-to-market evolution and if investments such as -- you've -- you've built out a dedicated inside sales force for Metallic. You have expanded partnerships with Salesforce and AWS and not to mention your exclusive relationship with OCI, are these already starting to benefit Metallic? Or are these additional legs of growth to come?\nSanjay Mirchandani: Little of both. So these are investments. They are fueling up multiple engines of growth for Metallic. Traditionally, our salesforce has carried the bag for Metallic alongside our partners. We're seeing great progress with the large hyperscalers on go-to-market across the world actually. And we are also building out our own velocity inside sales engine as one of the other engines. So they're all coming together nicely in different stages. And we think over the course of the year, you'll see us share more about how these are working and coming together. So it's a strategy we set, I think, late last year, fiscal year, and we're rolling it all out as we speak. So we're quite pleased with where we are. .\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Fish from Piper Sandler.\nJim Fish : Gary, for you, with going through the transition, I know we've talked about this at great length, but where are you with perpetual maintenance contribution? And really, the crux of my question is when you expect perpetual maintenance to be the minority in the sense of ARR and revenue trends start to converge as opposed to the large divergence we have this year? And is there any way to think about what you're seeing with perpetual maintenance renewal rates versus this point last year?\nGary Merrill: Yes. Thanks, Jim. I can handle that. So a couple of different pieces, I'll talk to you first, and I'll get to your specific question on revenue. But first, if you take a look at ARR, that we're now up to well over 70%. We're approaching 75% of our ARR from perpetual from the nonperpetual base, so from subscription and SaaS. So you can see we're making excellent progress there. When I translate that to the P&L, and specifically how that gets reflected into that customer support revenue line, okay? A larger portion of that continues to be driven by subscription. And if I kind of take a step back and can maybe quantify that for you. About a year ago, I would say about 70% of our customer support revenue was driven from perpetual contracts. That's now down to 60% a year later. So we're driving a minimum of about 10 points change in that balance. So I think where you're going is as we kind of roll that forward a little bit over the next 1 to 2 years, we'll start to see that subscription to be the primary driver and more than the majority of what's driving that. some of what you're seeing, Jim, if you look at kind of the year-over-year growth of that customer support line, you see it kind of start to moderate, right? It's kind of in line with the expectations of that customer support line, but it's starting to moderate with the annual decrease that we're starting to see on a quarterly basis.\nJim Fish : That's very helpful. And Sanjay, for you, how the new marketing campaign has gone in terms of building net new pipeline? And is there any concern around the Office 365 competitive environment that you have some of your competitors out there being aggressive on price or even Microsoft coming in and just one day kind of bundling it into, say, like an E5 or E7 or whatever they want to come up with at that point?\nSanjay Mirchandani: Well, we -- Jim, hopefully, you've seen our new marketing campaigns, and we're a lot more bold, up for direct. It's been having some great impact on the funnel and the pipeline. We're getting -- and it's bringing a lot of hits to our freemium sort of SKUs on Metallic, it's working the way we want it to. And there's a lot more visibility around what we do. So overall, in our new approach with marketing, we're very pleased and the impact is starting to have. There's a lot of excitement there. On Office 365 specifically, I think you're referring to Microsoft's recent announcement on some archival capabilities, of which we're part. It's more of a platform kind of announcement. It legitimizes the need for Office 365 backup, which for the longest time, customers were made to believe they didn't need it. And what they really need is a life cycle of data management on one of the most used apps in most enterprises. So we have -- we believe we have the best approach to that, the best solution there. Competitive pressure has always been there. and it's not a pricing. It's also important for customers to understand where their office data is written to, so you could get a service that looks like ours, but the data is written to some cloud, you don't know or to some data centers, you don't know. Ours is end-to-end, all the Office 365 is end-to-end on Azure and everything that comes with that. So we -- it's a value proposition. We think we've got a great value proposition. It dovetails wonderfully with our software capabilities, which is important for customers. It's not an island to itself. And we have competitive SKUs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi from Lake Street Capital Markets.\nEric Martinuzzi : Yes. Sanjay, just curious on the outlook geographically. As we look at Q1, the America is roughly flat, international up about 1%. Are we looking for any change in that based on the full year guide? Is that -- would we still see for roughly similar growth rates for the 2 different geographic segments?\nGary Merrill: Eric, it's Gary. I can jump in and handle the question on geographic. Yes. So the performance overall for fiscal Q1 was roughly the same. The Americas, as you stated, was roughly flat year-over-year. International was up 1% year-over-year. Within international, relatively though, we're seeing stronger results throughout Europe relative to Asia Pacific. As I think about trends geographically into the second half, I would expect a little more growth out of the Americas. As a lot of the renewal opportunity we have, right? We have a much higher renewal opportunity in our subscription software business, which gives us some of that transparency into the opportunity in the second half, but much of that is concentrated in the Americas hub region.\nEric Martinuzzi : Okay. And then you talked about continued investment in sales into Q2. Can you give us some specifics there as far as the number of reps that we currently have and how many more we plan to add in Q2?\nGary Merrill: Yes. So Eric, if I think about some of the work that we're doing within go-to-market, it's really driven around that discrete focus that we're trying to provide in our business and trying to build and enhance new routes to market. So much of what we're doing is reallocation of resources through the business to provide that discrete focus tied to 3 key areas. One is driving net new land and expand business. And second is continuing to secure our renewal motion. And the third is building out that velocity motion solely dedicated on SaaS. So if we think about where any incremental, I'll say, net new investments are primarily coming from, it's primarily coming from the third, as we build out that inside sales motion to drive that velocity piece of the market dedicated to SaaS. So all of that is reflected within the guidance. Much of that happened during fiscal Q1. And there's just some final pieces that will move towards into fiscal Q2.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Ader at WB.\nJason Ader : Yes. Thank you. Sanjay, can you give us just a quick competitive landscape and market share update both for the enterprise side of the data protection market and also the mid-market?\nSanjay Mirchandani: Yes. So it's -- from a competitive point of view, I shared some of the direction that we were taking, where the forces we see in the market and how our portfolio lines up very uniquely, where customers are headed and the hard problems they have. Over the course of the past couple of quarters, we've done a few things that are that are separating us in the short term very well. So I'll give you an example. The -- we launched a support for data domain -- boost on data domain, which is -- which gives us incredible performance in that installed base, and that's a large installed base. And we're seeing a lot of good traction, for example, in that, okay? That's just one example. We're also seeing some of our competitors struggle in a tough macro environment, okay? We've always been focused on responsible growth, and we'll continue to. We continue to innovate. We continue to streamline our go-to-market. We've ramped up our marketing. And we're definitely taking share in SaaS. It's white space. We're growing there. And I think as the platform goes with the new security enhancements that we've put out, nobody does what we do. And now coming in the fall, we've got a whole bunch of new capabilities that we're bringing to market based on customer input. So we feel very well positioned technically. And I'd say, over the last couple of quarters, we're definitely taking share from some of the more legacy players.\nJason Ader : Who do you run into the most in the enterprise? And then who do you run into most in the mid-market today?\nSanjay Mirchandani: I mean it's never clear -- it's never just -- nobody else there. It's always competitive. You see the usual suspects. And as -- and in the mid-market, we're also starting to get some good penetration with Metallic. And so we're seeing some of the smaller players, niche players there. It's the usual suspects.\nJason Ader : Okay. And then, Gary, for you, just -- did you provide any guidance on customer support -- the customer support line for FY '24?\nGary Merrill: Yes, absolutely. The trends that you see from a customer support line will continue into Q2 and into the back -- into the back half of the year. I would expect that the customer support line will be down on a year-over-year basis for full year FY '24, somewhere in that mid- to high single-digit range from year-over-year, which is kind of where we're currently trending now though. I think one of the things that's important and it follows up, I think one of the questions that Jim had asked about that customer support line is that is we're quickly approaching where the majority of that line will become subscription revenue related from a customer support and not perpetual. And currently, we're about 60% is perpetual. I think we'll get to close to 50-50 by the end of the year or early next fiscal year, which then helps over the longer term actually to moderate that line and some of those declines will start to fade away.\nJason Ader : Okay. So just to be clear, when you do a term license, that's a subscription, you separate out the support part from the software and that goes into customer support. Is that the right way to think about it?\nGary Merrill: Confirmed. Yes.\nSanjay Mirchandani: Jason, it's Sanjay again. I just wanted to add one more thing. One of the things we're getting some lift from is vendor consolidation. As customers sort of look at spend and commitments and what they've got in the installed base, they're looking to consolidate. And we're a great consolidator in that space. Also, as data security spend and data protection spend come together with -- in this environment, the TCO equation, we win. And so those are some of the trends we're seeing that are assisting giving us lift as we take share. I mean just one data point with Metallic, we've exceeded 4,000 customers. That's a customer acquisition machine. And so we are taking share. And if you think that 60% of those customers are new to Commvault and 40% of those customers very quickly have another Commvault product that is not SaaS, you see the stickiness of what we've got there.\nJason Ader : Got you. So 60% of the 4,000 or net new --\nA –Sanjay Mirchandani: Roughly net new to --\nOperator: I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Sanjay Mirchandani, President and CEO, for closing remarks.\nMike Melnyk : Thanks, Amber. This is Mike Melnyk, Investor Relations. Thanks for joining today. As a reminder, all our earnings materials are available on the Investor Relations website, and feel free to reach out to us for any follow-up. Thanks for joining, and we'll speak to you again in the fall.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
