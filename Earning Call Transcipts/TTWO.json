I will now turn the conference call over to Nicole Shevins, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin.\nNicole Shevins: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining our conference call to discuss our results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 ended December 31, 2023. Today’s call will be led by Strauss Zelnick, Take-Two’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Karl Slatoff, our President; and Lainie Goldstein, our Chief Financial Officer.

Our press release and filings with the SEC may be obtained from our website at take2games.com. And now, I will turn the call over to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Nicole. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I’m pleased to report that we achieved solid results, including net bookings of $1.3 billion. Our performance reflects our unwavering commitment to quality, the ongoing contributions from our outstanding portfolio, which is one of the strongest and most diverse in the entertainment industry, and our immensely talented creative teams. During the period, Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, the Red Dead Redemption series and Zynga’s in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast, exceeded our plans, driven by engaging new content, partnerships and activations. This was partially offset by some softness in mobile advertising and sales for NBA 2K24. 2K is implementing measures to enhance performance for the title, such as offering new events and promotions and delivering an exciting and engaging content lineup. We expect lifetime net bookings for the title to be in line with NBA 2K23. Due to these factors, a planned release moving out of the fourth quarter and increased marketing for Zynga’s new hit mobile title Match Factory!, we’re lowering our full year outlook. While the timing of Match Factory!’s user acquisition expense will reduce our profitability in the current fiscal year, we believe that this investment will allow us to grow our audience meaningfully and increase the lifetime value of the Match Factory! franchise. We have always managed Take-Two for the long-term and we have great confidence in our groundbreaking pipeline for fiscal 2025 and beyond, which we believe will enable us to grow our net bookings, increase our scale and enhance our profitability. At the same time, our teams are always looking for ways in which we can operate at the highest level of efficiency, which is one of our core tenets. We’re currently working on a significant cost reduction program across our entire business to maximize our margins while still investing for growth. These measures are incremental to and even more robust than our prior cost reduction program, and we aim to achieve greater operating leverage as we roll out our eagerly anticipated release schedule. Turning to the performance of our titles during the quarter. Momentum for Grand Theft Auto remains phenomenal. Sales of Grand Theft Auto V exceeded our expectations during the holiday season, and to date, the title is sold in more than 195 million units worldwide. During the quarter, Rockstar Games released its holiday update for Grand Theft Auto Online: The Chop Shop, which captured the highest number of active users in several years, including the largest ever increase in new Grand Theft Auto Online accounts, driven by the variety and depth of new vehicles in robberies, positive community sentiment and the game’s inclusion in various subscription services. The Grand Theft Auto series is also benefiting meaningfully from excitement surrounding Rockstar’s announcement of Grand Theft Auto VI and the release of its first trailer, which, at 93 million views in 24 hours, broke YouTube’s records for a non-music video launch and, along with partner channels, became the biggest video debut ever. Rockstar’s recent partnership with Netflix to launch the GTA Trilogy is also a resounding success, quickly yielding the highest rate of installs and engagement on the subscription services game platform. In addition, Rockstar’s membership program, GTA+, continues to grow rapidly, powered by enhanced benefits for members, including a rotating assortment of classic Rockstar titles. Red Dead Redemption 2 also surpassed our plans, as our exciting holiday promotions and events resonated deeply with players. To-date, the title is sold in more than 61 million units worldwide. During the quarter, Rockstar Games supported Red Dead Online with free updates, including the new All Hallows’ Call to Arms locations, a trio of new Dead of Night maps and a Hardcore Telegram Mission alongside the return of the Halloween Pass 2. NBA 2K24 remains the number one basketball simulation experience in our industry and, to date, is sold in over 7 million units. Unit sales for the Gen 9 version of the game are growing at a double-digit percentage increase over last year due to an enhanced gameplay experience and wider console availability. As players migrate to Gen 9 platforms, we are seeing significant declines in demand for our Gen 8 offering. Players have been highly engaged with many of NBA 2K24’s new features, including a Season Pass that helped average revenue per user grow 30% year-over-year. On October 6, 2K and Gearbox Software launched the Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch. We’re pleased to expand further our beloved franchise by enabling players to make some mayhem at home or on the go with this thrilling high stakes adventure. Now turning to Zynga. We’re very pleased with the team’s ability to create successful new mobile games, including Peak’s Match Factory!, which launched on iOS in November and Android in late December. The title is a top 30 grossing game on the Apple App Store in key target markets, such as the U.K. and the U.S., and has shown stellar retention and monetization metrics on par with previous category-leading Peak titles such as Toon Blast. Based on these excellent metrics, we see strong long-term potential for the title, and we’re planning to invest in new features and a robust marketing campaign to capitalize on its popularity with consumers and to scale it further. Zynga’s other recent release, Top Troops, increased its engagement by more than 10% over last quarter, propelled by the launch of new features and semi-monthly battles. Looking ahead, the team is focusing on new brand collaborations, player competitions and social and community engagements. Overall, Zynga’s in-app purchases exceeded our expectations with significant sequential improvement compared to last quarter. This was led by Toon Blast, which materially outperformed, delivering its highest ever average revenue per daily average user and over 50% growth in its daily in-app purchase revenue compared to last quarter. While we’re encouraged by the trajectory of Zynga’s in-app purchases, its ad revenues were below our expectations due to some changes that we’re implementing in the hypercasual business, including a heightened focus on our profitability and the launch of new features that deliver blended monetization. Our direct-to-consumer business continues to grow and enjoyed a record holiday season. Our teams are working actively to add more titles each quarter to this highly accretive owned distribution channel. Looking ahead, Zynga has numerous titles in development and soft launch that we’re eager to release worldwide in fiscal 2025 and beyond. It bears noting that launching hit mobile titles is both highly complex and challenging, and we’re gratified by Zynga’s unique ability to release new properties to capture mind share and market share. In closing, although we’re lowering our outlook for the year, we believe that our company’s potential is vast and unique, driven by our creative talent, our owned and controlled intellectual property and our groundbreaking new pipeline for fiscal 2025 and beyond. As we execute on our strategic priorities, we believe that we’ll deliver an array of unparalleled entertainment experiences that can captivate, engage and redefine our industry for audiences around the globe. I’ll now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I’d like to thank our teams for delivering another solid quarter and adding to the continued positive momentum of our business. I’ll now turn to our upcoming launches for the balance of fiscal 2024 and beyond. This quarter, Private Division and Evening Star will launch Penny’s Big Breakaway, a 3D platforming game. Private Division will share more news about this exciting release shortly. On March 8, 2K and Visual Concepts will launch WWE 2K24. The title will feature several franchise advancements, including the 2K Showcase...of the Immortals, celebrating 40 years of WrestleMania, four new match types, two new MyRISE experiences and much more. We’re thrilled to build upon our long-standing partnership with WWE and to continue to set new creative benchmarks for this franchise. At The Game Awards in December, Private Division announced No Rest for the Wicked, an action role-playing game from Moon Studios, creators of the critically acclaimed Ori and Blind Forest and Ori and the Will of the Wisps. The title will launch Early Access on PC in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 with a full release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S and PC thereafter. We will reveal more information about the game on March 1 during the label’s Wicked Inside digital showcase. After 13 years, we are pleased that 2K will return to tennis and broaden its sports offerings with the upcoming release of Top Spin 2K25. Developed by Hangar 13, the title was poised to provide an incredibly realistic and engaging tennis simulation featuring the world’s top players and courts. 2K will share more details in the coming weeks, including an expected launch date. Zynga continues to deliver on their outstanding pipeline with their much anticipated titles, Star Wars Hunters and Game of Thrones: Legends, each slated for global release in calendar 2024. We are encouraged by both games’ performances and soft launch and are confident that they will resonate with broad audiences when they debut worldwide. At the same time, Zynga’s hypercasual studios plan to release a steady cadence of mobile titles for games that has the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher monetization and profitability. And as always, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Looking ahead, we remain highly optimistic about what we believe to be the strongest and most exciting development pipeline in our company’s history. I’ll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks Karl and good afternoon everyone. We delivered solid holiday results, including net bookings of $1.34 billion, which was within our guidance range. I’d like to thank our talented teams for their commitment to creativity, innovation, quality and value, which allows us to provide outstanding entertainment experiences for our players across the world. Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto Online, the Red Dead Redemption series and Zynga’s in-app purchases, led by Toon Blast, exceeded our expectations. This was partially offset by softness in mobile advertising in NBA 2K. Recurrent consumer spending declined 7% for the period and accounted for 75% of net bookings. This was slightly less than our outlook, driven by weakness in mobile advertising and NBA 2K, which was largely due to the effect of lower unit sales on its in-game monetization. Recurrent consumer spending for Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership was up notably. During the quarter, we launched several mobile titles, including Top Troops, Match Factory! and NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition for Apple Arcade as well as Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Switch. GAAP net revenue decreased 3% to $1.37 billion, and cost of revenue declined 1% to $688 million, which included an impairment charge of $53 million and $177 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses decreased by 10% to $808 million. On a management basis, operating expenses rose 4% year-over-year and was favorable to our guidance due to lower marketing and personnel expenses. Turning to our guidance, I’ll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are lowering our outlook to reflect the softness we are currently experiencing in mobile advertising and NBA 2K24, a planned release will be out of the fourth quarter and increased marketing for Zynga’s new hit mobile title Match Factory!, which we believe will enable us to scale it more meaningfully to reach its full long-term potential. Our revised net bookings forecast is $5.25 billion to $5.3 billion. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 51% Zynga, 30% 2K and 19% Rockstar Games. And we forecast a geographic net booking split to be about 60% United States and 40% international. We are projecting recurrent consumer spending of 1% compared to fiscal 2023, which includes a full year of Zynga, partially offset by a slight decline in NBA 2K. Grand Theft Auto Online is expected to deliver modest growth for virtual currency and GTA+ membership. RCS is expected to represent 79% of net bookings. We plan to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office build-outs and larger footprint. We now forecast GAAP net revenue to range from $5.27 billion to $5.32 billion. Our total operating expenses are now planned to range from $3.55 billion to $3.56 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, we continue to expect operating expense growth of approximately 14% year-over-year due to a full year of Zynga and increase in personnel marketing expenses and higher depreciation, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our prior cost reduction program announced last year. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal fourth quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.27 billion to $1.32 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes WWE 2K24 as well as Penny’s Big Breakaway from Private Division. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, Toon Blast, our hypercasual mobile portfolio, Empire & Puzzles, WWE 2K24, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends and Match Factory!. We project recurrent consumer spending to decrease by approximately 5%, which assumes flat results for Zynga and a decline for NBA 2K with Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership are expected to be up. We project GAAP net revenue to range from $1.32 billion to $1.37 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $896 million to $906 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 17% year-over-year, driven by the additional marketing expense for Match Factory! that I mentioned previously, higher personnel costs and an increase in depreciation, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our prior cost reduction program that we announced last year. Looking ahead, our teams remain committed to efficiency. We’ve begun a rigorous analysis to identify additional areas for cost optimization. The expected savings are incremental to our previously announced cost reduction program, and we expect that it will be more expansive. We believe that these measures will enhance our margin profile and position our business for greater operating leverage in the future. In closing, while we are disappointed to have lowered our outlook for the year, we are exceedingly confident in our growth prospects. With our industry-leading portfolio and passionate teams, we believe that we are poised to deliver the best content in our industry, reach new record levels of operating performance and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you for your continued support. I’ll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I’d like to thank our colleagues for enabling us to achieve our goals and deliver another solid quarter. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We will now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Please proceed.\nEric Handler: Yes, thank you and good afternoon. Wonder if you could maybe give a little meat to the bone, so to speak, with your cost-cutting program. How much cost or net savings have you generated so far? What do you think this next plan could do and over what time?\nStrauss Zelnick: Lainie will take that.\nLainie Goldstein: Sure. So for the synergies with Zynga, we realized over $100 million in savings and the original cost-cutting program that we announced previously was over $50 million. So we do expect this plan to enhance our margins, both by reducing costs from our existing cost base and avoiding future costs and they will be incremental to these other cost-cutting programs that we had and even more robust than the prior cost reduction program. And next quarter, we will be in a position to give a little more details on the plan.\nEric Handler: Helpful. And then with regards to the advertising weakness that you are seeing, is that all related to what’s going on with the hypercasual business or does it extend also to in-game advertising for casual games?\nStrauss Zelnick: This is Strauss. So it’s basically the hypercasual business, and we’re really optimizing the business from profitability. So there’s always a balance. We’re also seeing that we can actually have in-app payments in our hypercasual business. So it’s really moving to a hybrid model, and we’re very excited about that. There’s great opportunity in that business.\nEric Handler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you. I guess, first, with some of the momentum and investment for Match Factory! and the game delay, is there any update to your fiscal ‘25 or ‘26 forecast?\nStrauss Zelnick: Lainie is going to take that.\nLainie Goldstein: Currently, it’s the middle of our budgeting process. At this time, the number is tracking a little above $7 billion for net bookings for the year and given the typical shifts and tweaks that occur in our forecasting process. And this amount is still huge growth over this year. And our pipeline is groundbreaking for next year and beyond, and our teams are making excellent progress on game development. And nothing material has changed with regard to the lifetime value of our portfolio. And both will provide our initial outlook for fiscal year ‘25 when we report our Q4 and full year fiscal year ‘24 results in May.\nDavid Karnovsky: And then just on Match Factory! It looks to be the most substantial new launch for Zynga since the acquisition. Want to see if you could speak kind of more broadly to the process of launching new mobile games, whether this reflects any kind of broader improvement in UA or content generation there? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: I think so. I mean, I’ve said repeatedly in the past few years that the hardest thing that anyone in the industry can do is create a new mobile hit. It’s super hard. And so much so that one of our big competitors just decided they weren’t going to try it anymore. It was off the table. We stuck with it and so did some of our competitors. So clearly, the market’s becoming more receptive and more reactive. There’s a big title from one of our competitors, Monopoly GO!, which is a huge hit. And we’re gratified obviously here to see so much traction already in Top Troops and Match Factory!. And Match Factory!’s already a top 30 title in the U.S. and UK Apple App Stores with lots of continued traction in the rest of the world, and it’s really just beginning. We are supporting the title in the quarter, and that’s not money that we could possibly recoup in the quarter. So to put some color around the guidance change, that’s really good news, not bad news. That’s going to be a very profitable expenditure that will come back to us in the next fiscal year. Because of the way we structure UA, we structure for relatively quick paybacks compared to the industry because we’re conservative. So I do think – look, I think the team in Zynga is doing a phenomenal job delivering great properties. It starts there. It always starts there. And yes, I also believe the market’s becoming more reactive. Remember, the market was down for the first time in its history in 2022, and it was flattish after that. And there were no new hits for years from us or anyone else. That’s clearly changing. I think it puts further evidence on the table that being exposed to mobile through the Zynga acquisition was a really, really good thing for this company, and we’re highly optimistic going forward.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nDoug Creutz: Yes. I wonder if you could be a little more specific relative to the guidance cut to the fiscal year, how much came from the title delay on the top line versus the other factors you cited. And to what extent the delay of the title out of the year might have impacted your operating income? Because presumably you will be marketing for it less. Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: Lainie?\nLainie Goldstein: So for the full year, when you look at the changes that we made to the fourth quarter forecast, the biggest drivers were towards the user acquisition spend and marketing for Match Factory!, then the lower mobile advertising that we were seeing, updating expectations for NBA 2K24 and the shift of an unnamed title out of the year. So those are the top four primary reasons for the change.\nDoug Creutz: In that order?\nLainie Goldstein: Yes, that was the order of magnitude.\nDoug Creutz: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question is from Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nAndrew Marok: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Good commentary on the Netflix tie-up with the GTA Trilogy. I guess going back to maybe how that came about, what made you guys want to partner with that kind of fledgling mobile gaming platform and be one of the first major third-party titles out there?\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, we have to balance all the different elements that go into choosing how, where and when to distribute our titles. And as our titles enter the catalog, we can be flexible about how to distribute. We tend to support all emerging platforms as long as they serve consumers and as long as the terms under which we support the platforms make sense to us.\nAndrew Marok: Great. And then maybe a little bit more of an esoteric question, but interested to maybe dig into that hypercasual commentary. Is there anything that’s maybe changed in the last few months or quarters with player behavior in hypercasual games that they’re now willing to do in-app purchases?\nStrauss Zelnick: All about quality. I think Rollic has been really focused on making more and more robust titles. Remember, hypercasual came about as a business where you’d actually look at hundreds of games a month and put them out into the market and see what would stick and then a game would stick for 3 months and then roll off. And what’s happening now is Rollic has title. Rollic, we believe, is a leader in the space, has titles that are much more durable and long-lasting and turning into games that could be games that last for years. We hope that, that will happen. And as those games are more durable and offer more playing value to consumers, there’s an opportunity in certain of those games to have in-app purchases, so really, moving from hypercasual to hybrid casual. But it’s all about quality and meeting the consumer where they are. And the story of the entertainment business is always a move to quality. And remember, we’re still, in many ways, in the nascent business. Interactive entertainment is roughly 30 years old, mobile’s roughly 12 years old, and these are early-stage businesses. And they started off as glorified toy businesses and then they turned into entertainment businesses and now they’re year-round entertainment businesses. All of that’s great news for a company like ours. We are the number two pure-play interactive entertainment company on earth, and it’s still early innings. And we’re seeing a lot of movement in mobile. Our 3-part strategy includes the word innovation. And innovation means that even if you start as hypercasual, if consumers want you to go upmarket and give them something that’s deeper and more compelling and more long lasting, you have to be there to do it. I would say our hypercasual team, led by Barak Verdal in Istanbul, is first class.\nAndrew Marok: Great. Appreciate the detail.\nOperator: Our next question is from Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBenjamin Soff: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. A follow-up on the GTA Trilogy for mobile. Does this provide a blueprint for how to bring more of your titles to mobile in the future? And just curious if you see an opportunity for additional partnerships with Netflix for additional mobile titles going forward as well? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: We – I’m not sure this is a model for mobile distribution, because ultimately, it all depends on how you define mobile. We think of mobile as a game that you typically play on your phone, and we have a big portfolio of games like that. And we’d love to do more with Netflix, who wouldn’t, as long as the consumers are happy to be there and as long as the economics of those arrangements make good sense.\nOperator: Our next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed.\nDrew Crum: Okay, thanks. Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So on NBA 2K, I think it was enjoying some pretty strong engagement in RCS trends into the early part of fiscal 3Q, at least. Any thoughts or explanation around what transpired thereafter? And just any more additional color you can give us in terms of your expectations for fiscal 4Q.\nKarl Slatoff: So – I’m sorry. Sorry, Strauss. The NBA has – the game has been incredible for NBA 2K24, and that continues to be the case. We still have very strong momentum around RCS, also driven specifically by our Season Pass. The Gen 9 SKU is performing incredibly well. We’ve got double-digit growth over 2K23 at this point. Yet, the real story here is that Gen 8 is actually underperforming our expectations. And I think as people transition more towards Gen 9 and experience all that NBA, the franchise, has to offer in the Gen 9 SKU, then you’re going to see continued growth in that franchise. So we feel really great about where the engagement is. Engagement in the title is fantastic. It really is – any sort of softness that we’re seeing is really a story about the Gen 8 product at this point.\nDrew Crum: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Martin Yang with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed.\nMartin Yang: Thank you for taking my question. The two-part question regarding GTA trailer’s reception, do you see a meaningful uplift for themselves due to the trailer performance on YouTube? And then given that strong performance, do you think that – could be future marketing events for GTA could be planned in conjunction with potential updates from other games, GTA, Red Dead? Does that change your view on how to market to GTA VI in the next 12 months?\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, we’re really gratified that the announcement of the trailer was a huge event online, and then the trailer debut between YouTube and other marketing partners set a record for a video to view. So we couldn’t be happier or more excited by the initial trailer. And I do think that excitement around GTA VI has had a halo effect on the entire franchise. We’ve now sold in 195 million units of GTA V, and GTA Online continues to perform above our expectations. So I do think all things GTA lead to more excitement. As far as the marketing programs, I think Rockstar is particularly expert in marketing their titles and, I think, is considering all the appropriate angles.\nMartin Yang: Got it. Thank you. And then another question regarding marketing is we’ve seen Judas and Top Spin with trailers and the revealers or teasers without a release date. Is there overall philosophy to market new games change? Or is it still largely based on studio level decision on when they will release or announce the release dates for new games?\nStrauss Zelnick: Marketing is really driven by our labels and our studios, and we don’t have a fixed march to a release from particular marketing needs.\nMartin Yang: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Timothy O’Shea with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nTimothy O’Shea: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Back on Grand Theft Auto. We’ve spoken about the Grand Theft Auto trailer. My question is really, is there a way to quantify or maybe compare what you saw in terms of all this anticipation for GTA VI compared with how the level of anticipation that you saw for GTA V ahead of that games announcement? And then I had a follow-up.\nStrauss Zelnick: It is possible to do research around that. And our sense is that the anticipation is much higher, much, much higher. On the other hand, 195 million units to date is nothing to sneeze at. So we stopped well short of making predictions about how the title will do, but clearly, anticipation is running very, very high.\nTimothy O’Shea: Yes. Thank you. That’s very helpful. And then just quickly, can we talk about how you make the decision about when to launch a game like Grand Theft Auto VI, like who makes the call, what motivates them? Assuming this is game quality, game finish polish, maybe there’s a desire to hit a specific launch window or really anything else that might influence Rockstar’s decision about the timing of when to launch this game. Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: We’re seeking perfection. And when we feel we’ve optimized creatively, that’s the time to release. So – and we’re all in this together. In terms of motivations and incentives, the financial incentives of everyone who works at this company are aligned with those of the shareholders. So we essentially have – call it what you will, we have profit sharing plans throughout the company at the operating level. And at the senior level, compensation is driven largely by TSR. So our goal is to align the interest of everyone who works there with the interest of the shareholders. That keeps us all pointing in the same direction. So you are right, there is inherent tension potentially between getting something to market and creating perfection, but this company errs on the side of perfection.\nTimothy O’Shea: Thanks, Strauss. Yes, anticipation is pretty high around here too. So we look forward to seeing again.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Please proceed.\nMike Hickey: Hey Strauss, Karl, Lainie and Nicole. Thanks for taking our questions. Lainie, just curious on your updated ‘25 view, I think this is two quarters it’s come down a bit, maybe now more than the last quarter. And I think I heard you said that maybe ‘25 and ‘26 is sort of the same. So, any color you can give us in terms of sort of bridging where you were for ‘25 versus what you are thinking now? And if in fact you are still thinking ‘25 and ‘26 together is kind of where your original guidance was. And then on the cost cutting, obviously, we are seeing a lot of that in the industry. I don’t know if it’s unprecedented trials or not, but no doubt, it’s significant. And you have already gone through one round. Just sort of curious your motivation here to take another sort of big cost reduction, especially given what it look like, the next 2 years, you are going to have pretty significant growth given your pipeline coming to fruition. Thanks guys.\nStrauss Zelnick: Lainie?\nLainie Goldstein: Hi Mike. So, for fiscal year ‘25, as I mentioned, it’s really driven by changes in the release schedule. And obviously, that will move some of the titles out into years going forward because the lifetime value of our portfolio hasn’t changed. So, we should – we do expect to see growth in fiscal year ‘26 over ‘25, so that hasn’t changed. So, it’s just a regular process of re-forecasting and updating the business. And this time, we are working on our budget. So, that’s where the numbers are falling out.\nStrauss Zelnick: And Mike, in terms of cost reduction, as I have said and as you know, we have a three-part strategy that’s supported us well through thick and thin. And that is, first and foremost, to be the most creative company, also to be the most innovative and, finally, always to be the most efficient company in the entertainment business. And that’s a big challenge. And we mean it, and everyone here means it. And I think that it’s time to take another look at efficiency and make sure that everyone is focused on the things that really matter and only the things that really matter and put ourselves in a position where we have the opportunity for great operating leverage as these titles come to market and as the revenues flow through the system.\nMike Hickey: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Strauss, I just wanted your opinion on this recent Disney and Epic deal. Obviously, you have your own strong IP, but we are just curious how you think that might impact access to license IP maybe for the industry at large, if we continue to see this type of tie-ups? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: It’s a good question. I only know what I read in the release and what you also read. What I read was that they are making an investment in a leading company, Epic, which is – obviously has a spectacular franchise in Fortnite. And then there was some talk around sort of creating a Fortnite/Disney ecosystem. And I don’t know exactly what that means, but I am not betting against my friends at Epic or Disney. And I wish them well. So, I guess it remains to be seen, but they are two fine companies. I think anything that’s good for consumers and it creates excitement in our industry is good for Take-Two because it keeps people engaged with the properties that we bring to market, and we have the best collection of owned intellectual property in the business, bar none. And we are the number two player in the space, so – and we would like to go from here. So, I see it as a net positive for the business, and we will see how they do with it. But I am certainly not betting against them.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nOmar Dessouky: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Back in May, on your fourth quarter call, you gave a $1 billion operating cash flow guide. And since you have updated us on the fiscal ‘25 top line outlook, I was wondering if you could also update us on the fiscal ‘25 operating cash flow outlook and any puts and takes around that? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nStrauss Zelnick: Great. That’s Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: So, Omar, we haven’t updated that number. We are still working on our budget right now. We would expect that number to change along with the release schedule changes, and it will depend on when the titles are released during the year of when the – a UFCF will be collected.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. So, maybe riffing off of Brian’s question about kind of Epic and Disney, thinking about Grand Theft Auto online, do you see any potential for Grand Theft Auto to be a trans-media property, which maybe involves brands and IP from franchises outside of Take-Two? Yes, that’s the question.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. Look, we really do prefer that our labels talk about what’s going to go on in the title creatively. And I could riff endlessly and share my opinions, but I prefer to hear from Rockstar. And they will talk about what’s coming in due time.\nOmar Dessouky: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Shaw with UBS. Please proceed.\nChris Shaw: Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Just going back to the Zynga deal, at the time, you had talked about revenue synergies that would come through in time. Can you just remind us where those initiatives stand today and how your thoughts might have evolved since you closed the deal? And then second question, just any early learnings you can give us on the iOS fee changes in Europe and how this might inform your mobile strategy going forward? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I mean we have made great progress across the-board, including on the revenue side. The biggest area of synergy so far has been our direct-to-consumer initiative, which is a collective initiative to offer the consumer the ability to purchase in-app currency for mobile games directly. And that’s been exceedingly successful, rolled out very quickly and quite profitable, and there is a lot more upside to come. There are numerous other areas on which we are making progress. We are kind of ticking the box with that one by itself. And in terms of game store changes, this will – there is a lot of moving parts here. And some of the decisions you mentioned in Europe and some of the decisions in the U.S. are contradictory. So there is a lot of dust left to shake out. But on balance, I remain of the view that I have stated years ago that distribution costs will come down meaningfully. They already are.\nChris Shaw: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.\nClay Griffin: Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Curious if you guys have a reaction to speculation. I suppose that Microsoft maybe looking to take some of the titles that were formerly exclusive to the Xbox platform and making those more widely available. It seems at least part of that rationale, if it’s true, maybe around just the cost to develop big titles. And Strauss, love to get your thoughts on particular areas of development that are particularly sticky as it relates to cost? Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Well, the big console titles are expensive and time-considering to create. And if you want to make the very, very best, it takes a long time and it costs a lot of money. I really don’t want to speak for Microsoft and their strategy. There has been a lot of noise around that lately. I have no doubt that they will express where they’re heading. I would just say that if you take a look at their market cap now compared to a few years ago, you don’t want to bet against that management team.\nClay Griffin: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Strauss for closing remarks.\nStrauss Zelnick: First, as always, I want to thank our teams for delivering such great work, with such extraordinary commitment. Everything that goes on here is a team effort and we are all aligned, all in this together and all working to do our level best to create the best entertainment for our consumers and to do it within the four walls of superb company with a great culture. I also want to thank our shareholders for their continued support. We are really excited about what is to come. Thanks for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."

Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. We delivered another consecutive quarter of excellent results highlighted by net bookings of $1.44 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance and management results that exceeded our plans. While we expect continued macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe that we're well positioned for the holiday season and are reiterating our fiscal 2024 net bookings guidance of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. Looking ahead, I'm exceedingly optimistic about our company's multiyear growth trajectory and our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders. Our development pipeline is robust and diverse and we're getting closer to delivering the groundbreaking titles that our audiences throughout the world have been anticipating eagerly. Our unwavering commitment to being the most creative, the most innovative, and the most efficient entertainment company gives us great confidence that our offerings will surpass our players' expectations and set new standards of creative excellence in our industry. Now turning to the performance of our titles during the quarter. Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online continue to surpass our expectations, an outstanding achievement for two titles celebrating their tenth anniversaries. To-date, Grand Theft Auto V is sold in approximately 190 million units. Grand Theft Auto Online experienced continued momentum due to the rollout of new gameplay and items from the San Andreas Mercenaries update with new seasonal events, vehicles, modes, clothes and weapons driving sustained engagement and net bookings. Our GTA+ membership program continued to grow and we're deepening our relationships with our player communities through new offerings, which now include access to a rotating assortment of classic Rockstar Games titles. During the quarter, Rockstar Games announced that CitizenFX, the team behind the FiveM and RedM role-playing communities for Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2, officially joined the label. With their immense passion and creativity, CitizenFX has been pivotal in expanding the possibilities of user-generated content around Rockstar's leading titles. We're excited to see them continue to build these creative communities and help them thrive into the future. We're also thrilled by today's announcement from Rockstar Games founder Sam Houser that the eagerly anticipated first trailer for the next Grand Theft Auto will be revealed this coming December. As the label approaches its 25th anniversary next month we congratulate Rockstar Games on their constant innovation in the pursuit of the highest quality interactive entertainment. Red Dead Redemption 2 surpassed our plans and has sold in more than 57 million units to date. Rockstar Games continues to support Red Dead Online with new content including bonuses for the naturalist and bounty hunters, and new free roam missions and events. In addition, Rockstar Games expanded the audience for the franchise with the launch of Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch. On September 8th, 2K and Visual Concepts once again redefined the number one NBA simulation experience in our industry with the successful worldwide launch of NBA 2K24. With exciting new features and next generation enhancements, the title is off to a great start and to date has sold in over 4.5 million units. NBA 2K24 features new season pass options that provide players with the opportunity to earn even more rewards as well as a new seasonal progression that tracks and combines my career and my team into one linear reward system. Engagement has been phenomenal with season pass and virtual currency bookings exceeding our plans and driving double growth in ARPU compared to NBA 2K23. Our franchise extensions continue to perform extremely well including NBA 2K Mobile, NBA 2K Online in China, and the recently launched NBA 2K24 Arcade Edition on Apple Arcade. I'd like to thank 2K and Visual Concepts for continuing to bring innovation and creativity consistently to our beloved franchise. 2K continues to support LEGO 2K Drive with its second drive pass season and the Creators Hub and PGA Tour 2K23 with additional pros and gear. In addition, the label harness the power of our industry leading catalog with the launch of the Borderlands Collection Pandora's Box, which bundles together all six acclaimed Borderlands Games and their previously released add-on content into a single offering at an amazing value. We have great respect for the team at Gearbox, and we value deeply our long-term relationship. Zynga once again delivered solid results during the quarter and we remain pleased with its ongoing performance. We continue to benefit from Zynga's ability to create engaging new games, which is a distinguishing capability of our mobile business. For example, Rollic successfully launched PowerSlap, based on the world's first regulated and sanctioned slap fighting promotion. The title is highly entertaining and to date has experienced more than 1 billion slaps across training and matches. With the launch of this new mobile game, Rollic has now had 22 titles reach the number one or two spot in the US Apple app store. We'd like to thank the entire team over at TKO including Ari Emanuel and Dana White for their strong partnership as well as our colleagues at Rollic created this title from inception to release in just eight weeks. Zynga also recently launched Top Troops and Match Factory, both of which delivered excellent KPIs and soft launch and appear to have strong long-term potential for our portfolio. And Star Wars Hunters continues to hit important milestones as we approach its planned release date in calendar 2024. Karl will discuss these titles in greater detail. Other highlights from our mobile business this quarter include our advertising bookings grew year-over-year driven by the addition of Popcore, contributions from strategic partnerships and our efforts to increase adamant inventory in many live games. We continue to make excellent progress in our profitability initiatives, including expanding the number of mobile games to leverage our direct-to-consumer platform. As we convert additional players, we're gaining new insights that we believe will better serve our players' preferences. We remain optimistic that over the next few years, most of our mobile games will leverage this highly accretive owned distribution channel. In addition, we continue to enhance the profitability and performance of our hypercasual business with multiple new games scaling rapidly and several games generating revenue from in-app purchases in addition to ads. Our live games portfolio also continued to deliver. Social Casino maintained steady performance coming off a great first quarter driven by new bold beat features which drove strong results, particularly in Zynga Poker. Additionally, we implemented new updates and events across many games, including Top Eleven and Dragon City, which drove audience growth as well as increased engagement in core systems, leading to better retention and monetization. We stand at an exciting time in our company's history with numerous growth opportunities ahead of us. As we deliver on our strategic priorities, we have the potential to create unparalleled entertainment experiences, engage broader audiences throughout the world and ultimately enhance our scale and margin profile. I'd like to thank all of you for your continued support, and we look forward to delivering our next phase of growth. I'll now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I'd like to thank our teams for delivering another strong quarter and adding to the ongoing positive momentum of our business. I'll now turn to our recent and upcoming launches for fiscal 2024 and beyond. On October 3rd, Zynga Socialpoint Studio successfully launched Top Troops, a new mobile game that blends strategy, RPG and merge mechanics to create a thrilling medieval fantasy adventure of combat and conquest. This marked the studio's first worldwide launch under Zynga following our combination last year. The game has seen positive player reception with an average rating of 4.38 on Google Play and 4.5 on the Apple App Store. Engagement has also been fantastic with over 2 million hours played in over 70 million battles fought since its worldwide launch date. 2K and Gearbox Software expanded the audience of our beloved Borderland franchise with the October 6th release of Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition for Nintendo Switch. The game now allows players to make the mayhem at home or on-the-go in a thrilling high-stakes adventure filed with genre-defining shooter-looter action. On October 20, 2K and Visual Concepts launched the WWE 2K23 Bad Bunny Edition across all platforms. Global phenomenon Bad Bunny is featured on the cover of the edition, which also includes a new playable version of this in-game character wearing the peril that he wore WWE Backlash 2023 live event. Zynga's Peak Games studio, the makers of Tune Blast and Toy Blast released Match Factory, a new puzzle game for mobile where players connect identical items, sort tiles and clear the board in a mesmerizing 3D environment. In soft launch, we observed strong engagement and modernization metrics as well as very positive player response as indicated by App Store review scores, which gives us optimism about the long-term potential for this new mobile title. Private Division has several exciting release as planned for this fiscal year. On November 28th, Roll7 will release their critically acclaimed and wildly imagined a third-person shooter skater, Rollerdrome for Xbox Series X and S and PC as well as Xbox Game Pass for both platforms. Also during the fourth quarter, Evening Star, founded by the industry veterans behind Sonic Mania will launch Penny's Big Breakaway, a kinetic Yo-Yo 3D-platformer for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch and PC. 2K and Visual Concepts are hard at work on WWE 2K24, the next installment of our popular Wrestling series, which will launch during the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, we continue to see great engagement and feedback from audiences enjoying Star Wars Hunters in soft launch across multiple territories. There are several exciting new elements that we are working hard to get into the game causing us to move the title's worldwide launch window to calendar 2024. Private Division is working with Weta Workshop on Tales of the Shire, a game set in the Middle Earth universe and inspired by the books of JRR Tolkien. The team recently released a teaser trailer showing fans a glimpse of the project, which is planned for release in calendar 2024 during our fiscal year 2025. Also, Zynga plans to globally launch Game of Thrones Legends, an all-new RPG puzzle oriented mobile title. In addition to our full game releases, our labels will continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our key offerings. Our hyper-casual studio plan to release a steady cadence of mobile titles for games that have the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher monetization and profitability. Looking at the balance of this fiscal year and beyond, we are highly optimistic about what we believe to be the strongest and most exciting development pipeline in our company's history. I'll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks, Karl, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I'll discuss the key highlights of our second quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2024. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. We delivered another great quarter, which demonstrates the enduring strength of our catalog, our ability to deliver deeply engaging post-launch content and our commitment to disciplined execution. At the same time, our teams continue to make excellent progress advancing our development pipeline, which gives us confidence in our multiyear growth trajectory. I'd like to thank our incredible teams worldwide for their hard work and passion for our business. Now moving onto our results. We achieved net bookings of $1.44 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance reflects better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto V and Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Redemption. During the quarter, we released NBA 2K24, Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for Switch and PlayStation 4. Borderlands Collection, Pandora's Box and PowerSlap. Recurrent consumer spending declined 7% for the period, which was in line with our outlook and accounted for 78% of net bookings. GAAP net revenue decreased 7% to $1.3 billion, while cost of revenue increased 24% to $884 million, driven by an impairment charge of $220 million and $190 million amortization of acquired intangibles. Operating expenses increased by 3% to $959 million and included $165 million of loan impairment, representing a partial impairment of one of our reporting units. On a management basis, operating expenses were flat year-over-year, which is favorable to our guidance. This was driven by lower marketing expenditures, some of which shifted to later this year. Turning to our guidance. I'll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. The largest contributors to net bookings are planned to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends, Merge Dragon and Zynga Poker. We expect the net bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 49% Zynga, 31% 2K, 18% Rockstar Games and 2% other. And we forecast our geographic net booking split to be about 65% United States and 35% international. We are projecting the current consumer spending growth of 4% compared to fiscal 2023, which assumes an increase for NBA 2K as well as Zynga since we will own the business for a full 12 months this year. For Grand Theft Auto Online, Virtual Currency and GTA+ membership is expected to be flat. RCS is expected to represent 78% of net bookings. We plan to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow and to deploy approximately $150 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office build-outs and larger footprint. We continue to forecast GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion. Our total operating expenses are now planned to range from $3.53 billion to $3.55 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, we continue to expect operating expense growth of approximately 14% year-over-year due to a full year of Zynga, an increase in personnel and marketing expenses and higher depreciation of office build-outs and capitalized IT expenses, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program. We remain vigilant in our efforts to optimize our cost structure and reduce discretionary costs where possible, while still investing for growth. Now moving on to our guidance for the fiscal third quarter. We project net bookings to range from $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion compared to $1.4 billion in the third quarter last year. Our release date for the quarter includes two mobile titles Top Troops and Match Factory as well as Borderlands 3 Ultimate Edition, all of which have been released. The largest contributor to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon blast, Red Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, Words with Friends, Merge Dragons and Zynga Poker. We project the current consumer spending to decrease by approximately 5%, which assumes a modest decline in our mobile business, which is being partially offset by expected growth in NBA 2K. The Grand Theft Auto Online, virtual currency and GTA+ membership is expected to be up. We project GAAP net revenue to range from $1.29 billion to $1.34 billion. Operating expenses are planned to range from $826 million to $836 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 7% year-over-year driven by higher personnel and depreciation expenses, which are being partially offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost savings initiatives. In closing, there are many exciting upcoming catalysts that we believe will enable our company to achieve new record levels of financial performance. Powered by our incredible talent, we believe that our projects in development will set new standards for creativity and engagement in our industry while also significantly enhancing our financial profile. We'd like to thank all our stakeholders for being on this journey with us, and we can't wait to share more details with you. Thank you. I'll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for enabling us to achieve our goals and to deliver another strong quarter. To our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one -- and I just have one follow-up. The first one, in last quarter, you reiterated your fiscal '25 and '26 guidance. I think you announced Sam Houser mentioned, we'll get a trailer for Grand Theft Auto, I think, in December. How are you feeling about those two years? And any reason why you mentioned those two years in the reiteration of guidance?\nLainie Goldstein: Due to shifts in our pipeline, our expectations are that net bookings will now be below $8 billion, but not necessarily. So it really isn't a big change, and we expect growth in 2016 as well.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thank you. And then kind of just turning to high-level question. The acquisition of FiveM seems super interesting. In that it could allow you guys to maybe learn more about user-generated content and find ways to monetize that and expand your audience. What's the broader thought of making an acquisition like that and how it fits in, not just with Grand Theft Auto, but maybe the company as a whole?\nStrauss Zelnick: We're really excited about it. I mean, to be clear, this is a small economic opportunity right now and a small cost to us. We want to be where the consumer is and what's going on in role playing and really in two ways. Number one, the people are actually playing in old playing servers and number two, the people are watching what they're doing on Twitch. Both are really interesting. The actual people playing is a relatively modest audience. It's in the hundreds of thousands. But the people watching, that's a huge audience. And we're interested in first of all making sure that our intellectual property is protected. We're also really interested in meeting the consumer where the consumer is. And for certain consumers bonding is a really important activity. And finally, people are consuming our intellectual property, we would like to monetize it if we can. We think this gives us an opportunity to do all of the above.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Please proceed.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing with players who engage with GTA+? Are there different how they interact with the game versus someone who's not a subscriber.\nStrauss Zelnick: We don't see materially different behavior. We think it's a great addition. We're thrilled to engage with our consumers in this way. And it's a learning experience, but it's also gratifying that GTA+ continues to grow and be more and more relevant to more and more consumers.\nEric Handler: Then, Lainie, maybe you can just a quick clarification. At least on a GAAP basis, advertising was down. Is there a difference between GAAP revenue for advertising and advertising bookings?\nLainie Goldstein: Yes. There is -- in the gap there is some deferral of some of the advertising. So that's the difference between us being up in the quarter versus the gap showing flat.\nEric Handler: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nDoug Creutz: Hey, thanks. Just wondering if you could give any more color on the write-down you took in the quarter. I'm guessing that had to do with some of your mobile assets, but whatever other color you can give, that would be helpful.\nLainie Goldstein: So we recorded an impairment charge of $220 million related to intangible assets and $165 million of goodwill representing a partial impairment of one of our reporting units. And this is as a result of an updated long-term projection for that reporting unit, but we're not giving any more details other than that.\nDoug Creutz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Marok with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nAndrew Marok: Thanks for taking my questions. So over the last couple of weeks and months of trying out some different additions of content for GTA+ subs, thinking about the Trilogy in particular. I guess kind of what learnings have you had from the different types of content included in the subscription and how it drives uptake?\nStrauss Zelnick: That's the kind of detail that we typically leave to our labels. So we probably don't have much more to add today except what I said earlier which is we are thrilled that Rockstar is offering a subscription to avid consumers, and we think it bodes really well for the future.\nAndrew Marok: Right. Appreciate that. And then one more, if I could. I heard a lot about some of the coming titles in mobile, kind of a greater prominence of licensed IP with things like Star Wars, Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings. Just any difference in thinking as to the value of licensed IP on mobile versus console and PC. Thank you.\nKarl Slatoff: So this is Karl. The fact is we do value both, both can be very, very valuable. Obviously, owning the IP in any context and also in mobile, the margin potential is much higher because you own it full and outright. Obviously, with licensed IP you have to pay royalty. But the mobile market is tough to break new IP. It's tough to get attention. And it comes out -- you can't argue with the fact that having a known brand out there is a way for you to get attention. So it's a give and take. I would say our perspective hasn't changed. In a perfect world, we would focus exclusively on owned IP. But the truth is when we see a good license that we think would have -- we have a great idea for a game for and if Zynga folks want to take it to market, then that's something that we're going to continue to pursue.\nAndrew Marok: Right. Much appreciated. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you so much for taking the question. Maybe one bigger picture, one first for Strauss. You've seen a lot of media inflation and increases in subscription prices, broadly in the media landscape. How do you think about striking the balance between pricing and attracting a wider array of audience when you think about the content pipeline you're going to bring to market over the next couple of years to capture the right mix between those two dynamics? And then second question would be, are there any guardrails we should be keeping in mind in terms of the evolution of the DTC platform? And what piece or cadence that might continue to evolve as a percentage of the mix?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. I mean you don't want to generalize to our business too much from what's going on in linear entertainment because the increase in subscription pricing and linear entertainment is really a reflection of the fact that too many streaming services were underpricing to acquire customers and then they realize those customers were not durable and the LTVs were upside down. So they were basically adjusting their pricing to make sure that the LTVs are potentially positive. And I think there's still more pain to come for some of those services, and I can wax eloquent if you want, although it has nothing to do with our business. In terms of pricing for any entertainment property, basically the algorithm is the value of the expected entertainment usage, which is to say that the per hour value times the number of expected hours plus the terminal value that's perceived by the customer in ownership if the title is actually owned, not say, rented or subscribed to. And you'll see that, that bears out in every kind of entertainment vehicle. By that standard, our frontline prices are still very, very low because we offer many hours of engagement. The value of the engagement is very high. So I think the industry, as a whole, offers a terrific price-to-value opportunity for consumers. That doesn't necessarily mean that the industry has pricing power or wants to have pricing power. However, there is a great deal of value offered. And look, it's our strategy here to deliver much more value than what we charge consumers. It's always been our strategy here. We want to make sure the experience is first class, and the nature of the experience is not just the quality of what we offer, it's also what you pay for it, everyone knows that anecdotally. So that's how we look at it. There have been precious few price increases in the business. The price increase, for example, the $70 for certain frontline products was the first price increase in many years after many generations. So again, I think we offer a terrific value to consumers. On the second question?\nKarl Slatoff: DTC.\nStrauss Zelnick: Regarding the direct-to-consumer platform, we think there continues to be a great deal of upside there, again, for consumers and also for our margins. It's still a relatively small part of our business. There's a great opportunity for growth. To be clear, we will always work with third-party retailers. We want to be where the consumer is. We value our third-party retailer relationships, they do provide marketing support. That's important to us. There are times when consumers want to have a direct relationship. We can do both. We can do all of the above. It is not our strategy to bring everything in-house.\nEric Sheridan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel. Please proceed.\nDrew Crum: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. So Strauss, you mentioned that the business is well positioned for the holiday season. What's driving that confidence? And how would you assess the health of your consumer? And then separately, I know it's just a subtle change to RCS, but what's behind the adjustment to that figure for the second half, given your fiscal 2Q is in line? It looks like just based on the commentary around the net bookings mix of Zynga, but just want to confirm that. Thanks.\nKarl Slatoff: So speaking to the confidence of our holiday season. Look, simply, I think it's the strength of our catalog and the strength of our products and a lot of our releases are must-have releases. And any time you're heading into a holiday season, and I think everyone around the table and on the phone is hopeful that we're going to have a very strong hardware season this year. We do have a lot of titles that we think are sort of go-to titles for people to engage with. Besides -- and also, you're obviously -- we're also working off of the results that we've had to date, which are very strong. So the momentum feels positive. We've got a great lineup in place. And it looks like it's going to be a pretty good holiday season from a consumer perspective, particularly in the gaming space.\nLainie Goldstein: And for the RCS, the main driver is the reduction in Zynga's business for the remainder of the year. So we forecasted some of our titles including a more muted expectation for the holiday based on the current trends. And we're also continuing to focus on profitability in hyper-casual, which is reducing our top line but enhancing our margins. And then there's also some shifts in the pipeline, including Star Wars: Hunters.\nDrew Crum: Helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nOmar Dessouky: Hi. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to get a little bit of clarification on what you said about shifts in your pipeline causing your fiscal '25 guide to be not materially below $8 billion. Is that because of shifts in your very largest AAA games in the pipeline, your smaller AAA games in the pipeline or your mobile games? If you could provide some clarity on that, I'd appreciate it. Then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes. We haven't even issued initial guidance for the year. We do that in the spring of the New Year, and that's when we'll give a lot more specificity around the release schedule. However, I want to reiterate, we are going to be shy of $8 billion in fiscal '25, but not materially so.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. Right. No problem. So then the other question is, obviously, super happy to see Sam Houser's message about Grand Theft Auto VI -- next Grand Theft Auto trailer coming soon. On September 26th, the SAG-AFTRA voted to approve strike authorization for video game performers covered under the Union's Interactive Media Agreement. Now they haven't actually strike yet, but there are negotiations. And I wanted to know whether if voice actors and motion capture actors were to go on strike, would it slow down the production of the next Grand Theft Auto at Rockstar. Does Rockstar have the type of employment contracts that would allow the workers, the actors to work through a strike?\nStrauss Zelnick: Negotiations are expected to resume next week. We're optimistic and value all of our talent greatly, and we value excellent labor relations and we're looking forward to reaching an agreement that serves everyone well. That's always been my approach. I've been involved with labor negotiations in every entertainment industry there is in my career. They've always worked out just fine. In the event that they don't work out just fine, now we are completely protected.\nOmar Dessouky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark. Please proceed.\nMike Hickey: Hey, Strauss, Karl, Lainie and Nicole. Great quarter guys. Thanks for taking my questions Two questions. The first one, Strauss, I'd be curious sort of your updated thoughts on AI here. It seems like the technology is -- at least the unlock here is accelerating in some of the use cases that we're seeing in terms of product and productivity seems very remarkable. So just curious what you're thinking there, if that's different or not? And then the second question, on the trailer in early December, curious what sort of impact you could think -- you think that might have on other Rockstar product catalog product. Obviously, it's already been strong. And I'm curious if that would be a catalyst boost for your catalog. And I'm curious on Grand Theft Auto Online, the sort of the strategic value of that live service given the vitality it has into the release of GTA next. Obviously, that's the set up you haven't experienced before. Thanks, guys\nStrauss Zelnick: Mike, look, we've been in the AI business since the dawn of this industry. Our entertainment properties are created largely in and by computers, and we value tools and we create those tools internally, and we license external tools as well, and the new developments in AI are really exciting. And I've said publicly and repeatedly that I believe that they'll help create efficiency and in certain instances, allow us to do things that we haven't been able to do before. But it's going to allow that for our competitors as well. So I think the tool sets that come out of these recent developments will be commoditized quickly. And the efficiencies that we see, others will see. Do I think that generative AI is going to make hit games? No. Do I think that the need for creative people will go away? Absolutely not. I think, if anything, better tool sets just raise the bar. They give us the opportunity to do more and do better. So the changes will be menial work probably is reduced or eliminated, high-level work is enhanced in importance. So I think you'll see shifts in what we can do with our games. So you mentioned product. I think you'll see some shifts in product, positive ones, I hope. And you mentioned productivity, and I think you will, for sure, see shifts in productivity, but I'm not sure those shifts will drop to the bottom line because typically, when we've generated productivity with tool sets, we've just set our sights higher. And that's our story. Our strategy is to be the most creative, the most innovative and the most efficient company in the business and AI, I think, probably ticks all three boxes. But don't expect the price tags to go down, just expect everything to get better and competition probably to become more intense for people who are not able to avail themselves of the resources that we can afford. With regard to the expected trailer that Sam Houser posted about today, we're as excited as anyone else. And do I think there will be an impact on our catalog revenue? Potentially. Things are already going really well in that space. And with regard to GTA Online, I mean, it's one amazing story that here we are 10 years later after the initial release and GTA Online is going strong. Why is it going strong? Because it's phenomenal and because Rockstar continues to supply content and updates and engage consumers and entertain them more effectively than, frankly, anyone else in the business. As long as we keep doing that, we'll be very well positioned, indeed.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed.\nClay Griffin: Yes, thanks. Good morning. I couldn't help but notice that Nintendo announced a live action film, Zelda film. I know -- for Strauss, I know this question comes up all the time. I guess maybe we'll close it this way. What's your relative willingness and perhaps even Rockstar's willingness to partner and find ways to extend Red Dead Redemption IP, Grand Theft Auto IP, just because it has been so successful from a marriage perspective. Just wanted to get your updated thoughts on that.\nStrauss Zelnick: We've spoken about this many times. If we're willing to use the company's balance sheet to make a movie or a television show, then in the event of great success, we would benefit from it. But we're not prepared to use the company's balance sheet that way because the risk/reward profile is unappealing to us. They're very difficult businesses. I've been in them successfully. They're super challenging. They're not what we do. We'd much prefer the risk/reward profile of the business we're in. So that means that the only way we can be in that business is through a license arrangement with a third party. And let's put it in context. Mattel announced, they said that their profits -- expected profits from licensing the Barbie IP for a movie would be about $125 million. Now Barbie is a massive, massive hit and it's extraordinary hit. So you don't want to posit a massive hit and look at the numbers that way. Even in a really good news scenario, the license fees would be a fraction thereof for many of our properties, not really enough to be meaningful here. And we have to weigh that too against the risk of failure. And the hit ratios in the motion picture business are vastly lower than they are in the interactive entertainment business. Our hit ratios for console properties are in the 80% or 90%. The hit ratio for a well-run movie studio is around 30%, which is to say there's a 70% chance that the movie that we license could fail. And so in success, the number, in terms of the benefit to our bottom line, is it's not de minimis, it's not 0, but it's not really material to what we do around here. And in failure, we run the risk of compromising the underlying intellectual property. So it's a high bar. We have licensed 2 properties. We've licensed Borderlands to Lionsgate's picture coming. We've licensed BioShock. We're looking forward to that as well. And we have other titles in discussions, not anything ready to announce, but we're going to be very, very selective and very careful.\nClay Griffin: Makes sense. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\nBrian Fitzgerald: We've been seeing more discussion of intrinsic in-game advertising, things like in-game billboards. And it seems like brand advertisers are getting more and more comfortable with in-game advertising. What are your thoughts on the broader opportunity there beyond mobile, beyond games within games, and maybe as well as your outlook for take this owned ad business and how that evolves? Thanks and Congrats on the quarter.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks. I mean you understand what we're already doing in mobile. So I don't think you want me to cover that. You alluded to that. With regard to console titles, we have advertising when it makes sense creatively and feels organic to the title. So for example, in NBA, if you go to a basketball game, you're going to see advertising in the arena. So it's perfectly reasonable to see the same kind of advertising in our game. But we're not going to do product placement where it's inappropriate, so that we can create a small amount of revenue. First of all, the numbers aren't huge. But secondly, anything that we do that takes a consumer out of the experience is problematic. So years ago, and I don't mean to take a potshot, but I'll do it anyhow. Years ago, there was a Bond movie, and James Bond, everyone knows he only drives an Aston Martin. He's only ever driven an Aston Martin. I don't know which iteration it was, but there was one iteration where they clearly made a deal with BMW and all the cars in the movie were BMW. And look, it ruined the movie for me. Because I -- to me, every time I saw BMW, I was like, wow, look, a little bit of product placement right there, a little bit of an advertisement. That's a disaster. So it's perfectly fine in basketball. It's perfectly fine in WWE. It's not perfectly fine in that title where advertising doesn't fit. As a result, I don't think you should expect that the numbers will be really material, although again, we do have an advertising business when it makes sense. That's completely separate, again, at the risk of being repetitive, from the mobile advertising business. That's a growth category for us. Our mobile advertising was up year-over-year. We feel really good about that.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks, Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: I think those are all the questions we have. I just want to say thank you again for everyone joining us today. We're thrilled with the results, and the results are driven by the creativity and passion and commitment of our colleagues, all 12,500 of them all around the world. They work really hard every day, and we get to talk about it here. But the work is done at the studio level, at the label level, at the corporate level. This is a company of great commitment to our strategy of creativity, innovation and efficiency, and we have a culture of ambition, hard work, excellence, seeking and kindness. And I'm really proud of that. This is a really unusual place. If we pursue our strategy and we do it in a way that's consistent with our culture, we've seen over and over again to do well. We're proud of that, and we feel very optimistic about the future. Thanks so much for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that fiscal 2024 is off to a strong start, highlighted by first quarter net bookings of $1.2 billion, which was at the high end of our expectations, and management results were in line with our plans. Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and NBA 2K23 exceeded our projections, which illustrates the long-lasting benefits of producing the highest quality offerings and amassing one of the strongest and most diverse portfolios in entertainment. In keeping with our core values of creativity, innovation, and efficiency, this quarter, we introduced new intellectual properties, advanced the development of our eagerly anticipated pipeline, and maintained our vigilance with cost management initiatives across our organization. Turning to the results from our titles for the period. Grand Theft Auto V continued to outperform and to date, the title has sold-in more than 185 million units. On June 13, Rockstar Games launched San Andreas Mercenaries for Grand Theft Auto Online, which offers six new major story-based missions, as well as new Los Santos operations, Hangar upgrades, Smuggler Source and Sell Missions, seven new vehicles, and more. The update also includes a range of fan-requested experience improvements, as well as the Career Progress feature, offering players a new way to track their progression across criminal careers and claim rewards. San Andreas Mercenaries continues to deliver high value content post-launch using a phased approach that is driving sustained engagement and Recurrent Consumer Spending. This June, Grand Theft Auto Online recorded more players than any other June in its history outside of the height of the pandemic. GTA+, Rockstar’s premium membership service for GTA Online on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, offered exclusive options for members to test drive and purchase an array of vehicles, and we are continuing to see strong growth in GTA+ adoption with each passing quarter. We were pleased with the performance of Red Dead Redemption 2, which has sold-in more than 55 million units to-date. Rockstar Games continues to support Red Dead Online with new bonuses and rewards, including free apparel inspired by the RedDeadFashion subreddit, and seasonal content such as April’s Condor Egg Freemode Event. NBA 2K23 exceeded our plans and the title has now sold-in over 13 million units, representing a 11% year-over-year growth, driven by higher demand, especially on Gen-9 consoles, as well as a more tailored promotional cadence. This incredible performance marks the title’s second-highest sell-through ever -- with only NBA 2K20 achieving higher unit sales. Engagement with NBA 2K23 remains strong, with approximately 2.6 million Daily Active Users delivering Recurrent Consumer Spending that exceeded our expectations. Our franchise extensions with the NBA continue to perform extremely well and NBA 2K23 Arcade Edition remains one of the top games on Apple Arcade. WWE 2K23, which is the highest-rated game in our wrestling franchise’s history and the second highest-rated sports simulation title of the year, experienced strong engagement throughout the quarter, with players logging nearly 22 million hours of gameplay and facing off in 170 million matches. 2K and Visual Concepts continue to support the title with a series of 5 DLC packs that can be purchased individually or as part of a Season Pass. 2K also continues to support PGA TOUR 2K23 with additional pros, courses, and Clubhouse Passes. In May, 2K and Visual Concepts launched LEGO 2K Drive, the first game in a multi-title partnership between 2K and the LEGO Group. Following the launch, our teams released the first of four Drive Pass Seasons for the title, which features 100 levels and new content inspired by the Fast and the Furious Saga. Also in May, Private Division and Piccolo Studio launched After Us on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC, which has been praised by critics for its striking visuals and game world. Zynga had a solid start to the year, performing in-line with our plans, and we are pleased with the ongoing progress of our mobile business. Ad revenue grew approximately 11% year-over-year, driven by the addition of Popcore and our ability to open new inventory supplies in our portfolio. Toon Blast has been introducing strong feature releases such as the Toon Race event, which drove outperformance versus our forecasts and helped the game recently surpass $2 billion in lifetime gross bookings. We made excellent progress on our profitability initiatives in mobile. We expanded our offerings on our direct-to-consumer platforms and continue to believe that, over the next few years, the majority of our mobile games will leverage our highly-profitable, proprietary distribution channel. We continue to enhance the performance and profitability of our hyper-casual business, with multiple new games scaling quickly and several titles generating bookings from in-app purchases in addition to ads. A few key highlights of Zynga’s live services during the period include: Empires & Puzzles grew quarter-over-quarter, driven by the new Path of Giants battle pass featuring daily and weekly challenges to unlock rewards. Rollic’s Twisted Tangle reached the number one Free Game spot on the U.S. Google Play store. Social Casino again delivered strong results, driven by Hit It Rich's best quarter in two years, and Game of Thrones Casino’s second best quarter in its history. Casual games continued to improve participation and engagement, with Words With Friends launching the new Club Daily Puzzle and Harry Potter: Puzzles & Spells adding Bonus Levels and Special Delivery prize events. With numerous games in development and soft launch across Zynga’s studios, we are excited to start delivering several new offerings in the coming months. Turning to our outlook, we are reiterating our prior guidance of $5.45 to $5.55 billion in net bookings for fiscal 2024. We remain highly optimistic about our future and our ability to deliver record results in the coming years. Lainie will provide more details on our outlook shortly. In closing, as we continue to execute our strategy, we believe that we can increase significantly our scale and prominence within the industry, grow margins, and pursue the vast opportunities to engage even larger audiences around the world. Led by the passion, creativity, and innovation of our world-class development teams, Take-Two is in a powerful position to set new benchmarks for our player communities, which we believe will drive long-term returns for our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Karl.\nKarl Slatoff: Thanks, Strauss. I’d like to thank our teams for a strong start to the year. Turning to our announced launches for fiscal 2024. Yesterday, Rockstar Games announced that the beloved Western experiences, Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare would be coming to the Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 for the first time in a new single package, arriving August 17. In a new conversion by Double Eleven Studios, the Switch and PS4 versions bring the two classic experiences together again for new players and original fans to enjoy across modern consoles, including backwards compatibility with the PlayStation 5. On September 8, 2K and Visual Concepts will celebrate the 25th anniversary of our industry defining NBA 2K series and once again redefine basketball simulations with the launch of NBA 2K24, featuring the iconic Kobe Bryant as the game’s cover athlete for the second time in the history of the franchise. Players will be able to celebrate Bryant’s legacy and replicate his skills in the brand-new Mamba Moments mode. Players in the U.S. and Canada can also purchase the WNBA Edition of the game exclusively at GameStop, featuring WNBA All-Star Sabrina Ionescu, as this year’s cover star. NBA 2K24 will introduce cross-play, a community requested feature for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S. Available in every multiplayer mode, players will be able to compete with or against others from around the world in dynamic co-op matches, thrilling online tournaments, or casual pick-up games between new generation consoles. The title will also introduce ProPLAY, a groundbreaking new technology that directly translates actual NBA footage into gameplay. 2K will have more to share on NBA 2K24 in the coming weeks. In addition, 2K and Visual Concepts remain hard at work on WWE 2K24, the next installment of our popular wrestling series, which set new creative and critical benchmarks with last year’s highly successful release. In June, Private Division and Evening Star announced Penny’s Big Breakaway, a new 3D action platformer from the team behind Sonic Mania. This kinetic yo-yo adventure is expected to launch in early 2024. Zynga’s Star Wars: Hunters, which offers players the opportunity to join the greatest hunters from across the Star Wars galaxy is expected to launch later this fiscal year. Players will engage in thrilling third-person combat in a range of competitive game modes across battlegrounds from the iconic worlds of Star Wars. Also in mobile, Social point’s latest game, Top Troops, a medieval fantasy-themed title in the PvP merge genre is progressing well in soft launch and is expected to launch worldwide this fiscal year. In addition, our hyper-casual studios will release a steady cadence of mobile titles throughout the year, focusing on games that have the potential for enhanced retention rates and a mix of in-app purchases and advertising to drive higher monetization and profitability. Our labels will also continue to provide new content and experiences that drive engagement and recurrent consumer spending across many of our offerings, including Grand Theft Auto Online, Red Dead Online, WWE 2K, LEGO 2K Drive, PGA TOUR 2K, Kerbal Space Program 2, and Zynga’s mobile portfolio. Throughout fiscal year 2024, we look forward to launching additional releases from what we believe to be the strongest and most exciting development pipeline in our company’s history. I’ll now turn the call over to Lainie.\nLainie Goldstein: Thanks Karl and good afternoon everyone. Today, I’ll discuss the key highlights from our first quarter before reviewing our financial outlook for the full year and second quarter of fiscal 2024. Our combination with Zynga closed on May 23, 2022, which affects the comparability of our results relative to last year. Additional details regarding our actual results and outlook are contained in our press release. We had a strong start to the fiscal year, powered by our portfolio of iconic, industry-leading intellectual properties. As we approach our next phase of growth, our teams continue to make excellent progress advancing our development pipeline and capitalizing on our revenue-driven opportunities and synergies. We also partnered together to maintain our focus on efficiency amidst the challenging macroeconomic backdrop and cautious consumer spending trends. I’d like to thank our incredible teams worldwide for their determination and passion for our business. Now, moving onto our results. We achieved net bookings of $1.2 billion, which was at the high end of our guidance range. In the current backdrop, many consumers are purchasing established franchises and those that offer great value, and our catalog stands at the intersection of these two trends. Accordingly, our performance reflects better-than-expected results from Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, and NBA 2K23. During the quarter, we launched Marvel’s Midnight Suns for Gen 8 consoles, Lego 2K Drive, and After Us. Recurrent consumer spending rose 38% for the period, which was above our outlook of 35% growth, and accounted for 84% of net bookings. The outperformance was primarily driven by Grand Theft Auto Online and NBA 2K23. GAAP net revenue increased 17% to $1.28 billion and cost of revenue increased 39% to $606 million, driven by $187 million of amortization of acquired intangibles. We also recorded an impairment charge of $18 million, related primarily to capitalized software and development costs for an unreleased title, which affected our management results compared to our guidance. Operating expenses increased by 25% to $883 million. On a management basis, operating expenses grew by 46%, which primarily reflected a full quarter of Zynga, higher personnel costs, and depreciation related to office buildouts and capitalized IT expenses. Turning to our guidance, I’ll begin with our full fiscal year expectations. As Strauss mentioned, our business is performing well, and we are reiterating our net bookings outlook range of $5.45 billion to $5.55 billion. Largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Merge Dragons, Words With Friends, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Zynga Poker. We expect the Net Bookings breakdown from our labels to be roughly 51% Zynga, 30% 2K, 17% Rockstar Games, and 2% Other. And, we forecast our geographic net bookings split to be about 65% United States and 35% International. We continue to forecast recurrent consumer spending growth of 5% compared to fiscal 2023, representing 78% of net bookings. Mobile trends are projected to remain stable, with Zynga’s ad business continuing to deliver growth. We expect to generate approximately $100 million in non-GAAP adjusted unrestricted operating cash flow, and deploy approximately $180 million for capital expenditures, primarily to support our office buildouts and larger footprint. We continue to expect GAAP net revenue to range from $5.37 billion to $5.47 billion. Our total operating expenses are expected to range from $3.38 billion to $3.4 billion as compared to $3.45 billion last year. On a management basis, our operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 15% year-over-year, due primarily to a full year of Zynga, an increase in personnel and marketing expenses, and higher depreciation of office buildouts and capitalized IT expenses, which are being partially offset by the realization of synergies from our combination with Zynga and savings from our cost reduction program. As we announced previously, our teams are taking extensive measures to review our cost structure and reduce discretionary costs whenever possible to offset the current consumer backdrop and inflationary environment, while still investing for growth. Now moving onto our guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We project Net Bookings to range from $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in the second quarter last year. Our release slate for the quarter includes Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare for Switch and PlayStation 4, and NBA 2K24. The largest contributors to net bookings are expected to be NBA 2K, Grand Theft Auto Online and Grand Theft Auto V, our hyper-casual mobile portfolio, Empires & Puzzles, Toon Blast, Words With Friends, Merge Dragons, Red Dead Redemption 2 and Red Dead Online, and Zynga Poker. We project recurrent consumer spending to decline by approximately 7%, which assumes modest declines in our mobile business; NBA 2K, driven by changes to its summer promotional cadence; and Grand Theft Auto Online; as well as a reduction in DLC revenue from several titles that were released in prior years. We expect GAAP net revenue to range from $1.26 billion to $1.31 billion. Operating expenses are expected to range from $811 million to $821 million. On a management basis, operating expenses are expected to grow by approximately 5% year-over-year, driven by last year’s acquisition of Popcore and higher personnel costs, which are being partly offset by the Zynga synergies and our cost savings initiatives. In closing, we are confident that the actions our teams are taking this year are preparing us for a strong trajectory of growth. Through our collective efforts, we continue to believe that we are positioning our business for a significant inflection point in fiscal 2025 that will culminate in us delivering new record levels of operating performance next year and beyond. We thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support, and we look forward to delivering on this exciting next chapter. Thank you. I’ll now turn the call back to Strauss.\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Lainie and Karl. On behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to thank our colleagues for delivering a strong start to the fiscal year. And to our shareholders, I want to express our appreciation for your continued support. We'll now take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Yeah. I just have -- I just had one question. Lainie called out consumer weakness kind of continuing. Could you just give an update on where you think the consumer is at. Is there a particular segment that's weaker than others? Just kind of an update on where you think the consumers are today. Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: Yeah. I mean I love that people are debating whether we're going to be in a recession from the point of view of a digital entertainment company, we've been in a recession for the better part of 18 months. The market for interactive entertainment was down meaningfully in 2022, down for the first time in the history of the mobile business over 10%, pretty much across the board. Things are looking a lot better. The year-over-year comps have stabilized. We're seeing growth in the console market. It's early, but we are seeing some growth. Mobile sort of flat, slightly down. We hope that will improve. I do feel like we're all seeing some green shoots across the economy. But it definitely is a mixed picture depending on the U.S. So in the context of the entertainment business, live entertainment is doing great. But in the context of entertainment that people consumed at home during the pandemic, it's been challenging for a while. And again, I think it's beginning to normalize, but it's early days yet. When asked a couple of calls ago what I thought would happen in the economy, I said that I thought it would bottom out in June, July. And that by the end of calendar '23, we begin to see some good news and then we'd be in reasonably good position from an economic point of view in early '24, and I continue to believe that that's what will happen.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on that with -- around media, I guess, if Hollywood stays in a recession, is that a positive, negative or does it not matter for video games?\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, we live within the entertainment ecosystem. So we would never wish for any other industry to have a problem. But if the strike means that new content can't be delivered, then I suppose it could be some small positive benefit for our business. But we aren't counting on that. We're certainly not hoping for it.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thank you so much guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Handler with ROTH MKM. Please proceed.\nEric Handler: Good afternoon and thank you for the question. Strauss, I wonder if you could just talk about with mobile advertising how much -- how many of your games beyond the hyper casual business have integrated advertising now?\nStrauss Zelnick: Some, and we are moving in that direction selectively. Look, historically, for games where you could make in app purchases, less than 10% of the audience actually spent. So we are fielding a game for 100% of the audience and monetizing 10% or so, perhaps a bit more often a bit less. And it's our view that we ought to be monetizing 100% of the audience. So if someone's going to spend, that's great. And if they're not going to spend, then we ought to be able to monetize through advertising. The question is how do you do that and create a high-quality experience. And I think the answer is we can do that. We can distinguish among those audiences. We're not there yet, but I think we're moving in that direction.\nEric Handler: Thanks. And just as a follow-up, I wondered if you could -- willing to give any specifics about how much of the mobile revenue at this point is on the DTC platform and how that's progressing?\nStrauss Zelnick: So we don’t actually give out that percentage. Some of our competitors do. And so one of our biggest competitors, I think, has gone on the record to say it’s about 25% and I think that’s a good number. We’re not remotely in that vicinity. There’s plenty of room for growth. I would note that Zynga’s advertising net bookings were up 11% year-over-year. So it’s really good news. And we’re really happy about the growth of our direct-to-consumer platform and what that can mean for consumers and also for us.\nEric Handler: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Please proceed.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey. Good afternoon, Strauss, Karl, Lainie. Two quick ones for me. Last quarter, we talked about obviously achieving north of $8 billion in bookings next year and north of $1 billion in operating cash flow. I'm just kind of curious if those are still the right boggies for next year. And then just secondly -- and I apologize if I missed this. Any changes to this year? Is it slate? I saw we've got the $18 million impairment charge here. But I guess relative to where we were three months ago, is there any change to this year's release slate. Thanks so much.\nStrauss Zelnick: So the answer to question one is, yes, and Lainie will answer question two.\nLainie Goldstein: Sure. So for question two, there has been some movements within the back part of the year within the slate, but we’re still able to achieve the same guidance for the year, so reiterating our guidance. So just some small changes within the slate, but it has nothing to do with the impairment charge. So the year is still the same.\nMatthew Thornton: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nMatthew Cost: Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe I'll start just by asking about mobile M&A. I mean that was historically a very big part of Zynga's business. It seems like the market may be starting to fall out there in terms of deal activity after the three for the past year or two. I guess do you see an opportunity to lean back into M&A at the Zynga business number one. And then number two is just, Lainie, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that some changes to the promotional cadence for NBA 2K. I was wondering if you could just give a little more detail about what those changes are and the size of the financial impact? Thank you.\nStrauss Zelnick: So on the deal side, it's hard to know. In terms of our strategy, we think we're in a position to grow organically. We have a lot of new releases coming from Zynga. We're really excited about them. As you know, hit ratios are very low in the mobile business. So we're not claiming success until it occurs. But we do feel really good about some new launches. And in terms of the promotional cadences.\nLainie Goldstein: So on NBA 2K 24, we expect to be up from 2K23 -- but 2K23 versus 2K22, there is some less promotional timing in this quarter versus what we did with 22 last year. So that's why we expect the title to be a little bit down versus last year.\nMatthew Cost: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Creutz with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nDouglas Creutz: Hey. Thanks. You alluded to this a little bit earlier, you and others have talked about how difficult it is to launch a new mobile title these days. We did see, however, a few months ago, competitive of yours launched scope we launched MONOPOLY GO, which is shot to number one in the App Store charts rapidly, has had a lot of success. As you have observed that, is there anything that you would sort of any lessons you would draw from their success that you think could -- you could apply to your own games that you have coming out soon?\nStrauss Zelnick: Look, I think it's an established intellectual property that's been known and beloved for a very long time. And if you combine that with a high-quality expression, I think you can do very well. We don't -- we obviously don't know what they're spending to be in the position that they're in. I do know that we're very focused on profitability. So we're being careful to make sure that our user acquisition spending reflects a high lifetime value for our customer.\nDouglas Creutz: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nEric Sheridan: Thanks so much. Maybe just one bigger picture question. As you continue to sort of integrate Zynga moved further away from the acquisition. Curious your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about elements of AAA titles having sort of cross-promotion, cross-play across elements of console and mobile and how that might inform some of your development cycles in the next couple of years or some of the pipeline dynamics that fed back into some of the bookings longer-term framework from last quarter. Thanks so much.\nStrauss Zelnick: We continue to believe there's an opportunity there. We do have titles coming that will offer an opportunity to engage on console and also in mobile. We don't think it's something that you have to offer, each title will stand alone. And a question you didn't ask, but we've also discussed the possibility of creating new mobile titles based on core Take-Two intellectual property. And that's something that we're also potentially excited about. In all instances, the consumer experience, the quality of the title is what governs, not the business model. So we have to create something great that consumers want. If we do, they'll show up and if we don't, they won't.\nEric Sheridan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mario Lu with Barclays. Please proceed.\nMario Lu: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. The first one is on NBA 2K. You guys mentioned the upcoming cross-play feature was largely asked on by the community. So that being said, curious if there's any data points you could share in terms of how impactful this speech will be in terms of user engagement or recurrent consumer spending? And then is there any reason why it was not included on PC in the last June?\nKarl Slatoff: So this is Karl, Mario. So look, we're very excited about cross play. It's something that our customers have been asking for and something that's natural for NBA. So obviously, we don't do anything in -- we don't put any new boats into a game unless we think that's going to have a significant impact on the experience for the consumer. That's something the consumer is going to love. And as end up leading to increased engagement. And obviously, as we say, when you get increased engagement, you get increased monetization and then everyone's happy in that regard. So all of these decisions are economic decisions, but it starts off first with the experience itself. And at this point, we're very confident that 2K is tracked and not on cross play experiences, and we're looking forward to that. And as it relates to PC and Ogan (ph) in terms of -- it's really just again allocation of resources, these decisions.\nMario Lu: Got it. That makes sense. And then just on a separate note, in terms of the topic of charging a higher price for users to get access to a game like early access during the launch, I noticed it wasn't included NBA 2K preorder pricing. Is this an opportunity in the future or is just something you guys opted out of? Thanks.\nKarl Slatoff: Yeah. We have – most of – it’s funny you say a higher price because when we have some early access games in the market right now, we typically would offer them at a lower price because it would imply that there’s more to come in the game, and it’s not necessarily the final version. We have seen the early access models out there in terms of holding back access and making people pay more for earlier access – that’s not something that we’ve done to date. I would never say never. But honestly, that’s a marketing decision. And our priority is really making sure that the game comes out, comes out in a timely fashion as the best experience possible. That’s something that makes sense. So it’s down the line, we could experiment with it. But to date, that has not been something that we’ve looked at.\nMario Lu: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Karnovsky with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you. Just on the bookings by label, I wanted to follow up on the guidance for Zynga. I think that's down slightly on the maintained bookings figure. So I wanted to see if you could walk through the adjustment there. And then sticking with mobile, you talked about hyper casual focus on releasing games that retain better, have a higher mix of IP spend. Just wanted to see if you could unpack the thinking behind the strategy there, what the traction has been and maybe how that impacts the ad revenue potentially from Rollic and Bapcor. Thanks.\nLainie Goldstein: So for the bookings for Zynga for mobile, there are some game shifts within the year. So there was some reforecasting of some of the existing games, and that's what has changed within mobile.\nStrauss Zelnick: And then in terms of the hyper casual business, what we've seen is that there are some gains, particularly with the acquisition of Bapcor that are a bit stickier than the typical hyper casual business. And they have the opportunity to engage consumers for longer periods of time and also potentially lead to not just necessarily monetizing through advertising, but also monetizing through in-out purchasing. So we're starting to see that. We're starting to experiment with that. And we think that there's a market there for us. I think that people have been -- we've been calling is the hybrid casual market where you have the ability to not only monetize with advertising, but also in out purchases just because the experiences are a bit deeper and they last a little bit longer. So we think that's very exciting. I don't know that it's going to necessarily impact the advertising opportunity overall, but it certainly creates new opportunities within that purchases for us.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Omar Dessouky with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nOmar Dessouky: Hi. Thank you for taking question. So you didn't change your full year guidance. And I wanted to know, I think David Karnovsky asked the question and you talked about Zynga a little bit. I wanted to know what -- whether your implied like-for-like guidance on mobile has changed at all since the last time you guided. And then within that, do you expect advertising to grow on an organic basis, that is excluding Bapcor. And I have one more question.\nLainie Goldstein: So we just mentioned that Zynga has changed a little bit because there was movement in the release schedule and some updates to the forecast. So we did have some changes in the rest of the year. So there were some changes in the release schedule. So there were some ups and downs within the year. But overall, we've kept the entire year the same. So we were at the higher end in the first quarter, but we kept -- we reiterated the full year -- and then in terms of expecting advertising to grow, yes, we do expect it to grow in the full year.\nOmar Dessouky: Organically?\nLainie Goldstein: Organically, yes.\nOmar Dessouky: Okay. Great. And then the other part of the question I wanted to ask was in terms of your direct-to-consumer channel, I think Strauss said that the majority of mobile games in a few years will leverage that channel. So you have a lot of games. We've counted well over 100. Not all of them are your big winners. I think there's a long tail of games. So I guess I wanted to ask, is it that the biggest games -- the biggest games are going to be on your DTC platform or is it just the sheer number of games? Because I'm trying to get a sense of how much revenue could potentially flow through that channel, if you understand what I mean?\nStrauss Zelnick: Yes, I do understand what you mean. It really varies game by game. So if the game is not suited to direct-to-consumer and it may not be because of its style, it's the interaction that consumers have with the title, then there may not be an opportunity even though it's a big title and then there are other titles where it's a terrific opportunity. Again, we haven't established a number that we're shooting for, but I did quote the number that a competitor has outlined. And I think that number is kind of the high end of the possibility.\nOmar Dessouky: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Please proceed.\nMichael Hickey: Thanks, Strauss, Karl, Lainie, Nice quarter, guys. Thanks for taking our questions. Curious Strauss, sort of big picture -- pardon upon, Curious what you're thinking on film opportunity. I know you're not Trim bandwagon guy, so -- but maybe this isn't that hard not to notice the results here from Super Mario Brothers and The Last Of Us. And this is an area where historically, it's been a challenge for Game IP to have success in new mediums. It looks like the formulas kind of involved the creative piece to the original game and have great story lines. And when you look at your portfolio of IP, you've got a ton of opportunities. It would seem like you certainly have a creative talent, you definitely have a great storyline. So two questions on that Strauss. Curious if your creative teams are motivated to expand their IP into new entertainment mediums like film or streaming episodic content. And then curious if you think IP expansion into new beam-like film can sort of complement your growth strategy over the long term. Thanks, guys.,\nStrauss Zelnick: Thanks, Mike. We think it's probably a relatively small opportunity economically. We're not going to use our balance sheet to invest in film and television projects. Those are typically very challenged asset classes with which I'm quite familiar. And to point out two success as notable as they may be, lies the fact that there are many, many failures where money was lost. So far, we've taken a very selective approach to licensing and we do have a Boelens (ph) movie coming from Lionsgate, and we have BioShock movie coming as well. We're excited about both. And selectively, we could see licensing in the future when there's a creative imperative and an economic opportunity. I think you're right. The reason there's been success lately was because you had great IP and then there was a great project that was made from it. And the reason you've had failure in the past is that the expression of the IP just wasn't very good despite people's best efforts. It's a really hard business. And we're not going to bet this company's future or the value of our intellectual property based on someone else's execution in another area of the entertainment business. So we'll continue to be very selective indeed. Even if we did take a broad-based approach -- in the absence of investing ourselves, the economic opportunity in the context of the much greater economic opportunity for our core business is limited.\nMichael Hickey: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Thanks. Two quick ones. Strauss -- not to get wrapped around the axle with semantics, but you said, hey, we had a phased approach when you were talking about GTA Online. Anything to call out there is a difference or an evolution how you're marketing and delivering incremental content or now it's just more of the normal MO? And then second question is on NBA 2K23 added to PlayStation Plus game of the months, that kind -- that definitely contributes to strong engagement, but we're curious whether or not you also see a meaningful uptick in RCS there among those PlayStation plus players, point being, if they are waiting to engage with it once it's in subscription service. Is there a lower propensity to spend in the game or no, actually, we see an uptick in RCS there as well.\nStrauss Zelnick: So on the first question, by phased approach, I was referring to delivering somewhat smaller chunks of really high-quality content as opposed to waiting for a longer period of time to deliver something that's much larger. And both approaches can work and of late, the phased approach has been working really well. However, there's not one right approach. It varies with what the team has in mind creatively at any given time.\nKarl Slatoff: And then in terms of the things like subscription services or game in a month, where the consumer is necessarily buying the individual game. Obviously, we don't do these things unless we think there's a significant economic opportunity for us to do so. So you can -- if you see it going in some of those services, you can assume that, that math has been done. And yes, we do see an uptick in recurrent consumer spending generally because we bring a lot of new players. And those players are valuable players. And as long as they’re engaged with the game itself, the engagement is strong and the conversion to RCS is very strong. It’s all about – and again, it varies cohort to cohort and varies game to game. But if we do drive significant engagement from folks who are coming into the game, we are seeing very favorable reserves as it relates to monetization.\nBrian Fitzgerald: Awesome. Thanks, Karl. Thanks, Strauss.\nOperator: Our next question is from Benjamin Soff with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.\nBenjamin Soff: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to dig back into the revenue breakdown by studio. It looks like the percentage for Rockstar and other went up. And I'm just wondering if that's a function of sheer shift from the things you talked about with mobile or if your expectations for those segments that actually improved? And if so, could you talk a little bit more about that? Thanks.\nLainie Goldstein: So the update for Rockstar is based on the momentum in their current business. So there's some GTA 5 unit sales, some the Red Dead updates and some virtual currency with the GT Online updating. So it's just overall reforecasting of the business.\nBenjamin Soff: Okay. Got it. And then just can you talk broadly about the competitive environment in the industry and whether you think it will be sort of at this level more competitive, less competitive, six months or 12 months from now?\nStrauss Zelnick: I think it will be about the same. It's always hard to know. It's a very competitive business at any given time. But ultimately, we're really competing with ourselves because if there's a lot in the market that consumers want, generally speaking, they'll go consume it. And if there's nothing that they want, it's not like they consume the next best. They just stay away. So we have to deliver the highest quality properties. And if we do that, they'll show up in good times and in bad. I mean you're seeing that even in a mixed economy. The best titles still full big audiences.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.\nStrauss Zelnick: I just want to take a minute to thank our teams again for delivering a superb quarter, and we're really thrilled with the way this year is unfolding. Our titles continue to be a phenomenal quality. We're really excited about our upcoming releases. And obviously, very excited about the future beyond this fiscal year. And we also want to thank all of you for attending the call for your great questions. And naturally, we're grateful to our shareholders for their continued support. So thanks so much, and have a great evening.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you again for your participation."
