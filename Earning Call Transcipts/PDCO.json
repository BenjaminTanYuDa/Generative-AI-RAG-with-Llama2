Now, I’d like to hand the call over to Don Zurbay.\nDon Zurbay: Thanks, John, and welcome, everyone, to Patterson’s fiscal 2024 third quarter conference call. I will begin my remarks today with the highlights of our consolidated results and then a review of our core strategic objectives and the progress we are making toward those goals before providing details on the financial performance of each of our segments. I’ll start with some key highlights. Our team executed well and successfully navigated a dynamic environment to deliver year-over-year sales growth and gross margin expansion. On the topline, year-over-year internal sales increased 0.3%, driven by continued above-market sales growth in our Dental Consumables and Production Animal businesses, demonstrating the deep, differentiated value proposition we provide customers across our end markets. Our initiatives to drive margin improvement continue to prove successful as we’ve expanded gross margin for Patterson as a whole by 30 basis points when compared to the same period a year ago. This result reflects our continued focus on efficiency, including working strategically with manufacturers, driving improved mix, exercising expense discipline and leveraging our cost structure. On the bottomline, our financial results reflect ongoing cost discipline measures balanced against the continued strategic investments Patterson is making across our businesses to further enhance our long-term performance and profitability. We also returned nearly $150 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Ultimately, Patterson generated an adjusted EPS of $0.59 for the third quarter. Looking forward, we are revising our fiscal 2024 earnings guidance to reflect our expectations for the fourth quarter, including continued headwinds in the Dental Equipment market, which I will provide more detail on shortly. For fiscal year 2024, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings in the range of $2.30 per diluted share to $2.35 per diluted share. As we move forward, we remain confident in the resilience of our end markets, the strength of our business and Patterson’s competitive positioning and value creation potential. Our confidence is underscored by our decision to repurchase approximately $125 million of shares during the third quarter and steadfast commitment to our long-term strategy. Our team remains dedicated to executing against our long-term strategy, which, as a reminder, is designed to achieve four core objectives. First, drive revenue growth above the current end market growth rates. Second, build upon the progress we’ve made to enhance our margin performance. Third, evolve our products, channels and services to best serve the customers in our end markets. And fourth, improve efficiency and optimization. Leveraging our strong balance sheet, we continue to invest across the business to drive progress on these strategic objectives during the third quarter. This included investments in our distribution capabilities and software offerings to further differentiate Patterson as a partner of choice for our customers. I’d like to highlight just a few specific examples that we’ve been working on to demonstrate our progress. First, the recently expanded dental distribution facility in Montreal, Canada is open and operational. This state-of-the-art facility, equipped with a modern software system and advanced fulfillment infrastructure, will enhance our ability to serve our Canadian customers effectively and efficiently. This modernization effort enables Patterson to further optimize our sales effort, gain deeper insight into our customer needs and identify potential gaps in our offerings in this market, ultimately allowing us to bring Patterson’s full value proposition to bear for our customers in Canada. We’re excited about the opportunity our investment in Montreal can bring, as we’ve seen the benefits of similar investments in other geographies. Our fully automated, next-generation Animal Health fulfillment center in the U.K., which we call the Big Shed, has already fueled accelerated revenue growth and strengthened our market position in the region. During the third quarter, Patterson also continued to invest behind our robust suite of software solutions in both our Dental and Animal Health segments. As we’ve discussed previously, we believe the opportunity for growth within software is meaningful and we’re investing to enhance our existing products, drive productivity gains and cater to evolving customer preferences. For example, during the third quarter, our Dental business announced a relationship with Pearl, a leading AI solution provider for the Dental business. This will enable us to integrate Pearl’s AI pathology detection feature set, called Second Opinion, into Patterson’s Eaglesoft practice management software. Second Opinion uses AI to help dentists detect conditions commonly diagnosed in X-rays. It’s a great example of the way we’re investing in our existing solutions to create enhanced value for our customers. We’re also partnering with Pearl to build integrations with our Fuse cloud-based practice management software and Dolphin practice management software. Those integrations will be announced at a future date. On the Animal Health side, we’ve continued to invest in Turnkey, a market-leading enterprise resource planning system for cattle producers. The majority of U.S. cattle on automated feed systems are managed by the Turnkey platform. Our recent investments have focused on empowering cattle producers to make more data-driven decisions as they leverage Turnkey to run more efficient, profitable businesses. We have confidence in the investments we are making for the long-term growth and success of Patterson, especially as we continue to build a track record of driving returns from our strategic investments. Last year, Patterson completed acquisitions of Dairy Tech and RSVP and ACT. Today, Dairy Tech, which provides pasteurizing equipment for producers, is operating as a Patterson-owned brand and is continuing to perform ahead of our internal projections with strong margin contributions. Meanwhile, our team is continuing to expand RSVP and ACT’s geographic reach to serve more veterinary and staffing and video-based training services and needs across additional states, as well as data extraction and conversion services. As we’ve said before, we remain committed to managing the organization with a keen focus on cost disciplines. We continue to focus on running a rigorous process for this discipline and return on our investments that leverages best practices and advanced operational excellence across the enterprise. As we enter the final quarter of fiscal 2024 and look forward to fiscal 2025, we continue to believe that the strength of our team, the resiliency of the Dental and Animal Health end markets, and our comprehensive value proposition make Patterson well-positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation over the long-term. Now I’ll provide more detail on the financial performance in each of our two business segments during the fiscal third quarter. Let’s start with Dental. In the third quarter, Dental segment internal sales increased 2.5% year-over-year, driven by robust performance in consumables. We believe both our consumables and equipment business performed better in the overall market during the third quarter. The Patterson team’s steadfast focus and execution has enabled us to consistently deliver above-market growth in consumables over the past year. In fact, if you take a look at the four fiscal quarters prior to Q3, we delivered an average quarterly year-over-year consumables growth of just over 5%, excluding certain infection control products. We built upon this track record in the third quarter, achieving over 6% growth in the category, and when excluding certain infection control products, just over 7% growth. We attributed our continued success in consumable growth to Patterson’s differentiated value proposition for Dental customers. It is rooted in strong execution on the deep relationships we have built with our Dental customers over time, thanks to a mature and knowledgeable sales force that acts as a true partner to Dental customers of all sizes, from independent practices to DSOs and everything in between. Our team is consistently seeking to be an indispensable partner that supports dentists with everything they need to run their practices, allowing them to focus on what’s important, patient care. Our consumables performance during the quarter was also supported by consistent patient traffic, reflecting the Dental end market’s resiliency and ability to drive demand despite inflationary pressures. Patients continue to prioritize essential dental care, even when they might be cutting back on some of the other discretionary spending. In the Dental Equipment business, internal sales declined on a year-over-year basis about 2%, as improved performance in high-tech equipment was more than offset by declining core equipment sales, as we lapped post-COVID supply chain delays. Our results demonstrate two key points. First, the variability of the Dental Equipment category and how equipment sales, whether high-tech or core, can fluctuate year-over-year and quarter-to-quarter. During the third quarter, this bore out with lower-than-anticipated sales performance in our core equipment category. Second, in our fiscal 2024 third quarter, equipment demand was challenged by continued macroeconomic pressures, including comparatively higher interest rates and less capital availability than the year-ago period. We expect these dynamics to continue to shape our equipment performance in the fourth quarter and have revised our 2024 full year adjusted UPS guidance accordingly. We have navigated economic cycles successfully in the past. We remain confident in our ability to overcome these headwinds by continuing to work strategically with our manufacturing partners and by delivering comprehensive support that enables our customers to streamline operations, optimize resources, and ultimately, focus on patient care. What’s most important are the longer term trends. The growing use of digital technologies enables dentists to offer an improved patient experience with a higher level of oral healthcare. That improved experience for both dentists and patients drives demand for innovation and supports a long runway of growth over time. When new technology enters the marketplace, Patterson is best positioned to sell, finance, install and service that technology for the complete lifecycle of those investments. Finally, Dental internal sales in our value-added services category were roughly flat compared to the prior year period. Value-added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers to enhance the customer experience, drive loyalty and help make Patterson an indispensable partner to their practice. The Dental value-added services category includes software and e-services, the foundation of a modern dental practice, and remains a long-term growth opportunity for Patterson. We are confident that continuing to invest in and promote our cloud-based software helps maximize our value-added services offerings and will deepen our comprehensive value proposition to our customers. Looking ahead, we believe the Dental market remains stable with healthy underlying fundamentals, including an aging population, practice modernization and a direct link between the patient’s oral health and overall health. We remain confident in our team’s ability to effectively navigate a dynamic environment and achieve our long-term goals. Now let’s move on to our Animal Health segment. During the third quarter, Patterson’s Animal Health segment internal sales decreased 1.5% year-over-year, as above market growth in the Production Animal business was more than offset by reduced sales in the companion animal business. Our Animal Health team achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin improvement of 22 basis points, further building upon their track record of year-over-year operating margin expansion in six of the last eight fiscal quarters. This excellent progression is testament to the Animal Health team’s disciplined execution of the margin accretive initiatives that we have put in place. In companion animal, our internal sales in the third quarter declined by low-single digits. This performance reflects our own strategic decisions and continued discipline to focus on more profitable business in the quarter in ways that modestly reduced our topline growth while supporting our margin enhancement initiatives. This includes working closely with vendors who reward us for our extensive value proposition. We remain committed to driving continued margin expansion while sustaining healthy topline performance within a stable end market. Over the long-term, we expect the companion animal market to grow in the low-single digits, building upon the substantial growth this market has experienced since the onset of the pandemic. The health of this end market is supported by strong fundamentals and positive long-term trends in pet parenting. On the Production Animal side, thanks to our team’s outstanding execution, third quarter internal sales grew by low-single digits in a dynamic market environment. We believe Patterson continues to outperform the broader Production Animal market due to the strength of our omnichannel presence, highly tailored distribution strategy and comprehensive offering across species. Across the Animal Health segment, our value-added services category delivered robust double-digit growth during the quarter, reflecting continued demand for a suite of software solutions and e-services that resonate strongly with customers. Similar to our Dental segment, our value-added services offering is a differentiator for Patterson and enables us to support the full lifecycle of equipment for our customers. We’re confident that the opportunity for continued growth within software remains significant. We continue to invest in existing solutions to better leverage our strong foundation, add to our capabilities and address evolving customer preferences. As we look ahead, we believe our Animal Health business is positioned for continued success. Now, I’ll turn the call over to Kevin Barry to provide more details on our financials.\nKevin Barry: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our third quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on January 27, 2024, and then conclude with our outlook for the remainder of our fiscal year. Let’s begin by covering the financial results. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal 2024 third quarter were $1.62 billion, an increase of 1.0% over the third quarter of one year ago. Internal sales increased 0.3% compared to the same period last year. Gross margin for the third fiscal quarter 2024 was 21.7%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year period. Beginning with our fiscal 2024 second quarter, we began providing the financial metric adjusted gross margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts gross margin for the impact of the mark-to-market accounting related to our equipment financing portfolio and the associated interest rate swap hedging instrument. The accounting impact of the mark-to-market adjustment impacts our total company gross margin, but not the gross margin within our business segment. And as previously mentioned, the net impact of interest rate fluctuations between the swap and the equipment financing portfolio has minimal impact on net income. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our adjusted gross margin was 21.6%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the year ago period. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were 16.8% and unfavorable by 70 basis points compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. A portion of the unfavorable comparison is attributable to expenses associated with the strategic investments we made to enhance our distribution capabilities and software offerings in the quarter. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.7%, a decrease of 50 basis points compared to the third quarter of last year. Adjusted operating margin includes the adjustment for the interest rate swap mentioned previously. For the remainder of fiscal 2024, we intend to continue exercising expense discipline, while also prioritizing the margin enhancement initiatives that have been yielding results within our business segments and for the company overall. Our adjusted tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 23.3%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the prior year period. Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $47.7 million or $0.52 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the third quarter of last year of $53.9 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $55.0 million or $0.59 per diluted share. This compares to $61.1 million or $0.62 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. This decrease in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal third quarter was primarily due to lower sales of Dental Equipment and increased operating expenses compared to the prior year period. Now let’s turn to our business segments, starting with our Dental business. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, internal sales for our Dental business increased 2.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Internal sales of Dental Consumables increased 6.3% compared to one year ago, despite being impacted by continued price deflation of certain infection-controlled products. Internal sales of non-infection-controlled products increased 7.2% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to the year ago period. This negative impact from infection-controlled product deflation has steadily moderated over the past year and we expect the year-over-year deflationary impacts to normalize by the end of fiscal year 2024. Internal sales of Dental Equipment during the quarter decreased 2.4% compared to one year ago. Our equipment category continues to be impacted by headwinds related to macroeconomic concerns, a higher interest rate environment and selling price declines. However, during the third quarter, digital X-ray and CAD/CAM equipment categories posted positive sales growth, reflecting the desire for many dentists to continue investing in technology to modernize their practices. Internal sales of value-added services in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 decreased 0.2% over the prior year period. Value-added services, including our software offerings, represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make us an indispensable partner to their practice. We remain confident in the investments we have made in this important category and the continued progress on our long-term strategy. Adjusted operating margin in the Dental segment was 8.9% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, which represents a 130-basis-point decrease over the prior year period. Increased operating expenses related to our SAP implementation and warehouse expansion in Canada, along with investments in our software and technical service business, drove the unfavorable comparison in adjusted operating margin on a year-over-year basis. Now let’s move to our Animal Health segment. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, internal sales for our Animal Health business decreased 1.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Internal sales for our total companion animal business during the quarter decreased 3.8% over the prior year period. Positive internal sales performance from our NBS business in the U.K. was more than offset by a decline in internal sales in the U.S. companion animal business. Internal sales for our Production Animal business in the fiscal third quarter increased 1.1% compared to the prior year period. Our Production Animal team continues to execute well in a challenging market and our omnichannel approach across several species continues to pay off with sales growth above the overall market. The adjusted operating margin in our Animal Health segment was 4.4% in the fiscal 2024 third quarter, an increase of 20 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margins in our Animal Health segment were up in the fiscal 2024 third quarter and additional operating expense discipline drove the operating margin increase on a year-over-year basis. Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, our free cash flow improved by $11.9 million compared to the same period one year ago. This is primarily due to a decreased level of working capital in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 compared to the prior year period. Now turning now to capital allocation. Our capital spending in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $51.2 million, which is $8.8 million higher than the first nine months of fiscal 2023. This increased spending reflects the investments we are making in our distribution capabilities, as well as software and value-added services. We continue to execute on a key capital allocation strategy of returning cash to our shareholders. In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We also repurchased approximately $124 million of shares during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, returning a total of $148.8 million to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases. And through the first nine months of fiscal 2024, we have returned $289.6 million to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Let me conclude with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. Today we are revising our fiscal 2024 GAAP earnings guidance to a range of $1.99 per diluted share to $2.04 per diluted share, and our adjusted earnings guidance range to $2.30 per diluted share to $2.35 per diluted share. We have made these revisions to our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share guidance to account for the current macroeconomic environment and aforementioned conditions in our end markets that we believe are likely to persist for the remainder of our fiscal 2024 year. And now I will turn the call back over to Don for some additional comments.\nDon Zurbay: Thanks, Kevin. Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to thank the entire Patterson team for their continued hard work and commitment to our strategy of serving our customers. As we conclude fiscal 2024, we remain focused on navigating the current environment by staying true to our strategic objectives and achieving operational excellence. Our efforts are concentrated on executing to end our fiscal year in a position of strength. We are confident that the strength of our team, the resiliency of the Dental and Animal Health end markets, and our comprehensive value proposition make Patterson well-positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation over the long term. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I will be glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Cherny with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cherny: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe if we can just start on equipment, both from a revenue growth perspective, as well as subsequent margins. I know this isn’t the first quarter you’ve talked about macro-oriented pressures, but obviously the trend on challenges in the equipment side have been challenging. As you think about not only ending the year but diving into 2025, how do you think about where your visibility stands, be it the health of the backlog, how you think about the backlog conversion rates, and what that means, especially as we kick off into 2025, knowing obviously full well you haven’t actually given a 2025 color yet?\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. Thanks, Michael. Well, I think, we’re watching the backlog closely and we think while our fourth quarter guidance, we talk about some of the macroeconomic pressures on the equipment side of the business. I think, for us, we think that ultimately the strength of that market and our position in it is really going to be what carries the day and so I think if you’re looking forward to FY 2025, and obviously, being careful here, trying to help you, but being careful about our comments, I think, we think that as we move into FY 2025, there is -- we should see improvement. We should see improvement in the equipment side of the business and that’s kind of what we’re thinking about as of right now.\nMichael Cherny: Okay. And then as you think about that potential for improvement, how do you think about the internal spend levels? And what I mean by that is you talked about trying to drive ongoing operational improvements. I know it’s something that’s been a big part of your work, basically, since you joined the company, Don. Where do you think you are in terms of operational efficiency across the organization and what are the puts and takes that you can control on your own to offset any potential variability on demand curves?\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. So I’ll maybe start and then Kevin can add here. But I think, we think we have a lot of opportunity here. I think I mentioned this in the past, but when we put Kevin Pohlman in place in the Chief Operating Officer role, a big part of his responsibilities really relate to how to get the efficiencies out of the business that we really, we tapped into, but not had really tapped into significantly. As we look across the business and look across our three businesses and how we operate. So there’s a lot of good work being done in this area. Some of it is short-term gains and things that we could get at right away that we’ve worked through, but a big part of that are things that take a little more time and kind of by definition, those are the things that are going to take us more time to get at and we’re working through those right now. So, I feel really good about the opportunity there. I think when we looked into this idea and we put Kevin in place, he’s doing a great job and it’s kind of bearing out like I thought it would. So more to come on that, but maybe I’ll ask Kevin if he has any comments.\nKevin Barry: I think a good example of that here in our fiscal 2024, we’ve had a real focus on investing in some of those opportunities in our logistics network. And we came online with two new distribution centers in our network, one in the U.K., one in Canada, and that team’s done some really good work to leverage our capital spend this year into initiatives that, to Don’s point, will start paying out with better efficiencies in that part of our operation going forward. So I think that’s a good example of things that we’re doing now that as we go forward, we see -- we’re putting our capital to good work. It’s going to bear some fruit in the expense line going forward.\nMichael Cherny: Appreciate the color. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJon Block: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Maybe just one on each side of the business. Dental Consumables continues to certainly be one of the highlights and maybe, Don, just your thoughts at the mid-single-digit growth is sustainable going forward or were some of these results more one-time due to the challenges that a competitor was having. And maybe just taking a step back, can you speak to the tailwinds that you think you got or lack thereof from the competitor’s challenges over the past few months? And then I’ll ask my follow up.\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. Thanks, Jon. So a few things. Obviously, there’s a little bit of art in terms of trying to pin down the exact benefit from the challenges of our competitor. So it’s a little bit difficult to calculate with precision. But I think if you take a look at the four fiscal quarters prior to Q3, we’ve been delivering in this area just over 5% growth when you exclude the certain infection control products. And so, that’s kind of been our baseline and really that continued in the quarter. Our best estimate right now of the impact of that is that it added about 2 percentage points to that growth. So you could think about the 7% growth we had not excluding infection control products as really probably more in the 5% range, which is consistent with kind of where we’ve been. And for us, we tried to take a pretty disciplined and sustainable approach to what happened there. And so, we were looking for share that we think is something that we can sustain and hold on to. But really, the story for me is less about that and more about just the continued execution of the team in the market here at the 5% level over an extended period of time.\nJon Block: Got it. That was very helpful. Thanks for that color. And then just to pivot to Animal Health, the down low-single-digit, I think that was a number for companion animal seems to have lagged the industry of late. And you talked a little bit about why in terms of, I guess, I’ll sort of call it margin integrity. I think you may have alluded to that last quarter as well. So, importantly, does this have another call it two quarters or so until you lap it? And then looking forward into your next maybe fiscal year, do you see any access for Animal Health distributors and the companion animal side for call it access to increase products, certain product lines coming to light in coming quarters? Thanks guys.\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. Well, on the first question, I think, yeah, we’re taking a very disciplined approach in this area. I think when you’re dealing with the margin profile there, we have a disciplined way of looking at profitability by customer and a lot of data. And you’re right, for us, it’s been important to take that disciplined approach to the customers and profitability and make sure that we’re serving the customers that value are our proposition and that we feel like we can earn that profitability with. Your question on, we did mention that last quarter. It’s a continuing dynamic this quarter. I’m not sure we’re going to completely lap it in the next two quarters. This has actually been going on for some time and we’ll see how the industry evolves that -- you could probably think about it as lapping in two quarters, but there could be some holdover. I just think, it really proves our approach here on all three businesses, but particularly as you look at the Animal Health businesses and their margin profile. This is an extremely important initiative for us. Yeah, there -- there’s some innovative products coming. We’re excited about it. So, without going into maybe details on exactly all the things that are there, we have some good plans for the companion business.\nKevin Barry: Maybe the one thing I’ll add, Jon, is just, as we have planned for and expect kind of the topline performance we’ve seen in the companion business. But that team’s done a good job of holding the business model to the margin profile. They’re expanding the way we expect. So to build on Don’s point, I think, we’re doing this in a planful disciplined way.\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. And I think, one thing you could -- we mentioned in the call, but you could look at the RSVP and ACT transaction as an example here, where it’s not only innovative products that are coming, but we’re looking to expand our service offerings as well into higher margin, more sustainable EBITDA streams.\nJon Block: Got it. Thanks for the color, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bednar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nJason Bednar: Yeah. Hey. Good morning. I want to build a bit on some of the questions that have been already asked here this morning. But maybe starting first with margins. I know the Dental Equipment performance here in the quarter probably doesn’t help a whole lot, but the other side of the business and consumables was pretty strong as you called out. You talked about your share gain. That’s traditionally a higher margin business and that growth that you got in the quarter should be enough to give you leverage. So I guess my question is, why didn’t it come through in a better way or a bigger way? And can you help maybe with what margins would have been if not for some of those distribution and software investments that you were making that weighed on profitability in the quarter?\nKevin Barry: Yeah. Jason, I think, what I point to is, within the quarter, we did see our gross margins expand for the company. And so while there are some puts and takes from a mixed standpoint, like you point out within our business, gross margin, you’re right, gross margin, consumables mixes favorable in the Dental business, but also, candidly, the Production Animal Health business to lose that a bit. So, but net-net, we did grow our gross margins in the quarter. And the issue from an operating margin standpoint was on the expense line. And to your point, you’re right, we talked a little bit in Q2 about how, we are making some investments in the business and we expected our expense burden here in Q3 to be a bit higher and normalize here as we go into Q4. And that really does relate to the kind of those distribution facilities coming online here earlier in the quarter, as well as the ongoing investments we are making in our software capabilities. I don’t know, I don’t quite have a basis point to give you in terms of you strip all that out with what’s normalized. I think we -- as we go away, we’ll tell you, I think, is going into Q4 here and beyond, we’re obviously very focused on leveraging our operating expenses and getting that back in line so that, we do see that as a tailwind to the op margin performance of the company.\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. Jason, I mean, I would just add one thing. I mean, our -- just at a macro level, our P&L margin initiatives also, a big part of that is really just built on leveraging sales growth. So, when you look overall at the business, our sales growth was 4% in the first quarter and the last two quarters has lagged behind a bit just because of the equipment dynamics. So that makes the leveraging story more difficult, but as we move forward and get that growth rate back in line, I think you’ll see the results of that.\nJason Bednar: Okay. Maybe one follow-up and then another question. Just what should we expect in terms of maybe the spend that comes out that was maybe elevated the last quarter to fiscal second quarter and third quarter that comes out as we go forward into the fourth quarter and think about 2025 numbers? And then shifting over to Animal Health, your next year of comps are easier. But I guess what I’m curious about here is whether you have visibility on that companion business turning the corner. Is your visibility on patient traffic getting better? Are there some branded products that are turning generic that might be an opportunity for you? Can you help us with whether there’s any shift in direct versus agency at the turn of the calendar year that we should be aware of as we model out the upcoming quarters?\nKevin Barry: Yeah. I think maybe on your first question about the OpEx, I think, what I’d say is for Q4, we typically see better leverage on our OpEx than we do earlier in the year and I expect that trend to continue. So, basically, to say it another way, I’d expect our OpEx percent of sales to decrease from where we were back here in Q3 into Q4, similar to what it did last year. And then, I’m sorry, I was thinking about your first question, Jason, was the second question on companion.\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. Yeah. And I think, Jason, so we’re not, again, trying to be pretty helpful for you as much as possible. But I think, as we get into this, we’re still working through our budgets for fiscal 2025 and kind of the dynamics that we think will play into that. So we’ll probably try to stay a bit disciplined and that’s a great question as we get into next quarter’s call and talk through the budget for the year.\nJason Bednar: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Baird. Please go ahead.\nJeff Johnson: Hi, guys. I joined late in all disclosure here, so I apologize if any of this has been asked. But, Don, I joined as you were answering, I think, it was Jon Block’s question, just on kind of the share pickup or growth points you seemed to point to from some disruption from one of your competitors here in the last few months. I couldn’t tell in your answer if you thought those two points were sustainable or if you’d probably get that back and go back to that 5% number you alluded to kind of in the prior quarter. So, one, just if you could clarify that. More importantly, when I look at the consumables market in North America, I don’t think it’s growing 5%. I mean, it seems like there’s a little value seepage from kind of premium branded down to lower price branded or private-label and I’m sure you guys are in that trade down that’s happening. And I think on, volumes, I don’t think are growing more than probably low-single digits at the very best. So where are you getting that 5%? We’ve heard that some of the online discounters have been stagnant, if not maybe even losing share the last couple of years. Is it coming from some of the value added competitors? Just where do you think at 5% you’re getting kind of what I think is probably a couple of few points above market growth over these last four or five, six quarters? Thanks.\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. Thanks, Jeff, and too bad you missed all the prepared comments. It’s all brilliant. But I think the 5%, when we look at this, it really is across the Board. I mean, I think, I know that sounds a bit like a pat answer. But when we look through it, I would say, that’s the best way I can explain it to you. There’s not a specific area that I would point to that says, here’s where we’re doing so much better than anywhere else. I think it’s just been across the Board. And so, to us, that feels good. I think we feel like our value proposition here in our process there is working. On the sustainability of the 2%, we try to take a disciplined approach, as I mentioned, to this and work with share that we thought could be sustainable for us. So I think that particular piece of it, we have optimism about our ability to keep it. As it relates to the sustainability of a 7% growth rate, I won’t necessarily comment on that. I mean, it’s a very competitive market. We like the trend here and it’s a trend over a longer period of time. So I think it’s showing up as not just a one-time situation, but I wouldn’t necessarily assume that we can keep up at 7% going forward.\nJeff Johnson: Well, and then, I guess, just the follow-up question, and again, hopefully this wasn’t covered or I’m not asking you to repeat anything. But basic equipment, you have a little bit less exposure -- some less exposure to DSOs maybe than some of your competitors. So I think you’re a good look at kind of what the private practice dentist is doing from an office remodel, office expansion standpoint in that. And we know prices settled out in basic equipment probably closer back down to flattish levels over the next 12 months relative to some elevated pricing in the past 12 months. So just where kind of is that volume growth on the basic equipment side in the private practice channel? Do you think there’s still expansions and remodeling going on? Do you expect that private -- the basic equipment market to be closer to flattish, up or down a little? Just any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. No. I think there’s definitely an opportunity here for sure in the private practice as well. It moderated in the quarter, but again, as we’ve mentioned before, three-month looks are hard. So we would probably want to look at it as we move forward at more, I wouldn’t say, historical norms, but you may want to look at the core equipment market over time here as you move forward as flat to slightly up.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Allen Lutz with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAllen Lutz: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Dental patient traffic trends have been all over the place over the past six months or so. Can you speak to the trend that you observed during your fiscal 3Q and any comments on the January exit rate and what you’re seeing so far in February? Thanks.\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. Well, I guess, I would say, from our perspective, I mean, I know there’s been some movement up and down to some extent, but I would say generally we view patient traffic as being pretty steady and favorable over the longer term here and that’s kind of our view in terms of what we think happens as we move forward.\nAllen Lutz: Okay. Great. And then following up on a question around SG&A, I know it was up a little bit around strategic investments and software spend. Can you just speak to the duration of those investments? I’m not looking for any commentary on 2025, but just trying to understand when should we expect those spending trends to normalize a bit? Thanks.\nKevin Barry: Yeah. I think, for the portion of it that was related to some of those big distribution investments we made this year, those kind of have normalized here in Q4. So we’re seeing those kind of step down. But we continue to invest in our software portfolio. Those will be more sustaining as that team continues to work on those product feature sets and some of that’s capital, some of that’s expense and so that will be more sustaining in our business as that part of the portfolio grows. So you will see a bit of a step down here in Q4 going forward related really to those warehouse expansions.\nAllen Lutz: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Lin with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nJustin Lin: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, just on the equipment side, what are you seeing in terms of pricing headwinds on the intramural scanner side? Your competitor has talked about that for a while. So just curious to see how that dynamic plays in your Dental Equipment business?\nKevin Barry: Yeah. We’ve -- I think we’ve talked a bit about over the past number of quarters, the pricing pressure in those categories. I think we’re starting to see some stabilization there. We’re starting to sort of lap it. It might have another quarter or two of that headwind, but it certainly seems to be stabilizing from what we see in our data on those high-tech categories.\nJustin Lin: Got it. And value-added services on the Dental side specifically is about flat year-over-year. Can you talk about what drove that? Seems a little wide compared to how that business has done historically in the past, call it six quarters.\nKevin Barry: Yeah. So just to remind you that those, that category encompasses kind of a variety of the services we provide our customers, including our software portfolio, our tech service repair portfolio. There can be some seasonality and puts and takes within our tech service business and those software businesses quarter to quarter. So, like you said, we’re kind of flat this year, this quarter for that portfolio. But I think we’d say that, that was one quarter over the long-term. We still expect that part of our business to grow faster than the overall as we continue to invest there.\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. I think that would be an important category to look at, again, like many of our categories, but that’s an important one to look at over longer periods of time.\nJustin Lin: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS. Please go ahead.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I do want to talk a little bit about 2025 and while I’m not asking for specific guidance, I just want to think about when we think about headwinds and tailwinds as we bridge to 2025, the things that you can control in terms of investment spend and capital deployment. Should we think about those as being incrementally a headwind, a tailwind in terms of investment spend or the way you deploy capital this year was a little bit more aggressive than historical in terms of share buyback? Just thinking about the things that you can control, what might be incrementally positive or negative to earnings growth for next year versus what we saw in fiscal 2024?\nKevin Barry: Well, I think, I’ll start and Don can chime in. Specifically, on the share buybacks, you’re right. We have returned a lot more capital to shareholders this year, and as a result of that, there will be a share tailwind going into Q4 here and into fiscal 2025. That will help us from an EPS standpoint. So that’ll certainly be a tailwind going into next year. For some of the capital expenses we’ve had this year, we have had an elevated amount of CapEx this year. As we get into our budgeting cycle this year, we’re going to be evaluating what the right level is like we always do. It might step down a bit going into next year as we lap some of those investments maybe this year. But I still think we’ve got some really good investment opportunities internally that we want to fund and we’ve got the balance sheet to do so. And Don talk about…\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. I mean, I think, Kevin brought up a good point at the end there. I mean, it is elevated. Some of the particular projects that we’ve talked through here will go away. But we do and are finding more and more opportunities internally that are good investment value for us in terms of use of our capital. So I would expect us to continue to be aggressive to find all the internal projects we can that are going to benefit us in the future.\nKevin Caliendo: And if I can ask a quick follow up on Dental Equipment. There is -- I think some of the messaging we heard from your competitor yesterday was that maybe demand was going to come back a little bit in the second half of calendar 2024. And I guess what I’m not asking for any of that, but do you think demand is elastic based on price where the prices have come down enough where now there’s increased demand or was it purely macro interest rates and now that that’s a new normal, things can recover. I’m just interested in your take on sort of what’s driven equipment, both digital and core demand in either category, whether it’s price, economics, interest rates or the like?\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. So we -- I would say both of those factors have factored in pretty significantly to what’s happening here in the equipment market. I think it’s also why it’s been a little difficult to call exactly where we’re going. I think, again, as we move into for us -- as we move into our fiscal 2025, which starts in May, I think, we feel like early in the year, we may not see it, but to your point later in the year, I think, we will see some improvement. One of the factors here, too, is just we’re a little bit tied to the innovation cycles and innovation, and we need that as well to help that dynamic. So as we move into the latter part of the calendar year, maybe the latter part of our fiscal year, we hope that’s part of the equation that we think will drive that.\nKevin Caliendo: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering if you could talk about the contribution of private-labeled products in the quarter, particularly Dental. And then as sort of a follow-on, how do you think about the opportunities within specialty? Is that something that you have interest in sort of expanding a presence in that market, obviously, you’ve seen very much above-market growth without that, so I’d just be curious how you’re thinking about that at this point in time?\nKevin Barry: Yeah. So on the private-labeled side, Elizabeth, I’d say, without giving the specific number, but that continues to be an area of focus for the team, especially as we’ve expanded some of the portfolio offerings in our private-label. We’ve seen positive growth there and we continue to see good adoption by our customers, and it’s a big part of, I think, how we’re growing the way we are. So I think that continues to be a real big focus for us and it’s paying some dividends in the market.\nDon Zurbay: Yeah. I think on the specialty side, that’s obviously a segment of the market that we’re not significantly in. So without kind of giving away anything on our strategy, we certainly, over time, love to be in that area. It would need to be the right entry point, the right kind of transaction. So it’s hard to say as we move forward whether that’s something that will be part of our portfolio in the future.\nElizabeth Anderson: Got it. And then if we just think about the 4Q cadence, can you remind us of the impact that you guys saw in terms of incentive comps and sort of the outperformance that you had in equipment in the fourth quarter of last year?\nKevin Barry: Yeah. I mean, I think, what I maybe point you back to, Elizabeth, is kind of like to Jason’s question. I mean, we -- even with that comp last year, we still saw our typical, we see some good leverage in the fourth quarter and I expect to see that again this year. There are a number of puts and takes in the OpEx arena here this fourth quarter as well. So I’d just say that we expect to see some moderating spend in the fourth quarter on some of those initiatives we talked about, and again, I see a step down as a percent of sales from where we were in Q3.\nElizabeth Anderson: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Nathan Rich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning and thanks for fitting me in. Just maybe a couple of clarifications at the end. I think I wanted to go back to the revised outlook for equipment and maybe just how that breaks down between core and digital. I understand core was softer in the quarter. Is that really what drove the revision to the outlook and the competitor yesterday, I think, talked about the kind of robust kind of investment plans from practices on the more traditional side. So if that’s what’s driving your revised outlook, just would be curious to get your view there?\nKevin Barry: Yeah. I think it’s fair, Nathan. Obviously, we’re talking about a slightly different timeline, I think, than our competitor is, but as we kind of narrow in here on the last couple of months of our fiscal year and we’re looking at that whole environment, we certainly could see core was a bit softer here in Q3. And as we consider Q4, we built that in for the next couple of months here.\nNathan Rich: Okay. And then, Kevin, I wonder if you could kind of give us a rough sense of maybe how the investment spend has been split between the Dental and Animal Health segments versus what might be in corporate. I guess it sounds like all else equal kind of would expect to step up in margins as a result of that spend stepping down. So just curious where we should see that show up in the P&L?\nKevin Barry: Yeah. I would say, we are not -- in terms of the distribution investments we’ve made, that’s fairly split. There was a significant one on Animal Health and on Dental. So that’s fairly split. The software investments we’re making at this point are more focused on the Dental portfolio. So that’s where that one’s going to run a little bit longer than Animal Health.\nNathan Rich: Great. Thanks very much.\nDon Zurbay: Okay. Well, that’s -- I think that’s all our questions. So we’re going to sign off and thank you all for the time today and interest in Patterson Companies and we’ll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting today at 10:00 a.m. Central Time for a period of one week. Now I'd like to hand the call over to Don Zurbay.\nDon Zurbay: Thanks, John, and welcome, everyone, to Patterson's Fiscal 2024 second quarter conference call. I will begin my remarks today with highlights of our consolidated results before providing more details on the performance of each of our segments. Our team executed well against the evolving backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty and other industry factors that had varied impacts on discrete categories within our Dental and Animal Health segments. I'll start with key highlights and strong performance in the quarter. In the Dental segment, Patterson's broad and resilient consumables portfolio enabled us to deliver sales growth above market growth amidst steady patient demand. And our core equipment category delivered solid year-over-year growth despite a tough comparison to last year's strong second quarter performance. In Animal Health, our market leading production animal business achieved strong sales growth primarily due to the leading omnichannel presence that Patterson has built to best serve producers. And in both of our business segments, our value added services categories, including our software offerings, achieved significant growth that outpaced overall sales and sales within the Dental and Animal Health segments. Offsetting these results, we experienced softer than expected demand in two areas of our business. Macroeconomic conditions impacted our performance in the high tech dental equipment categories, and our companion animal business was impacted by a decline in vet clinic visits and spending. Ultimately, we delivered second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.50. We also returned $86 million in capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchases. Looking forward, we believe that macroeconomic and industry challenges are likely to persist for the duration of our fiscal year. We, therefore, have adjusted our fiscal 2024 guidance to reflect our revised expectations for the year. We now expect to deliver adjusted earnings in the range of $2.35 to $2.45 per diluted share, a decline of 4% at the midpoint of our previous range. We remain focused on executing against our proven strategy, which, as a reminder, is designed to achieve four core objectives; first, drive revenue growth above the current end market growth rates; second, build upon the progress we've made to enhance our margin performance; third, evolve our products, channels and services to best serve the customers in our end markets; and fourth, improve efficiency and optimization. Despite a more challenging macroeconomic environment during the second quarter, we continued investing across our business in service of our long term strategic objectives. This includes investments in our distribution capabilities, software offerings and value added services to further differentiate Patterson as a partner of choice for our customers. We are focused on managing Patterson for the long term because we are confident in the strength and resilience of our end markets and in Patterson's ability to perform for our customers and our shareholders. I'd like to touch on some of the targeted investments we made during the second quarter that we expect will drive our efficiency and optimization over the long term. First, we recently completed the expansion of a distribution facility dedicated to our Dental business in Canada. We believe the expanded facility in Montreal will enhance our ability to serve customers on the east side of the country and add state of the art features that will drive efficiencies. Second, we successfully completed the implementation of our ERP system in Canada. This is an important milestone in our ERP rollout, connecting our US and Canada operations to provide greater visibility across our North American operations to drive meaningful efficiencies. And finally, Patterson also continued to invest behind our robust suite of software solutions in both our Dental and Animal Health segments. As we've discussed previously, we believe the opportunity for growth within software is meaningful. And we're investing to build upon our strong foundation, add to our capabilities and address evolving customer preferences. In our fiscal 2024 second quarter, we added technical personnel and other resources to our Dental software team and are pleased with the progress we have made toward an even stronger offering and customer experience. We're building a track record and driving returns from our strategic investments, and we expect that performance to continue. For example, last year, Patterson completed acquisitions of Dairy Tech and RSVP and ACT. Today, those businesses are performing even better than our expectations. The Dairy Tech owned brand is a positive margin contributor in our production animal business and the RSVP platform for veterinarian staffing is solving today's most critical challenge for our animal health customers. And to meet that demand, we continue to expand RSVP to serve more of Patterson's customers. As we move through the second half of fiscal '24, we plan to continue to balance our investment strategy with cost discipline to calibrate our expenses appropriately within the macroeconomic environment. I am proud of the Patterson team and the way we are navigating a dynamic macroeconomic environment to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders. We continue to believe that the strength of our team, the resiliency of the Dental and Animal Health end markets and our comprehensive value proposition make Patterson well positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation over the long term. Now I'll provide more detail on the performance of each of our two business segments during the fiscal second quarter. Let's start with Dental. In the second quarter, Dental segment internal sales declined 0.2% year-over-year. As I mentioned, our consumables category performed very well in the quarter with 3% internal sales growth, including the negative deflationary impact of certain infection control product prices. Excluding those infection control products, we saw a nearly 5% sales growth. We attribute this strong performance to a few key factors; first, steady patient traffic for standard dentistry; second, our long-term consistent commitment to strengthening our relationships with our customers; third, our broad and resilient Dental consumables portfolio, including an expansive suite of private label products, which targets our customer base; and finally, the strong execution by our team. Taken together, these factors enabled Patterson to perform well in the consumables category and insulated us from macroeconomic headwinds that caused some patients to postpone specialty procedures. On the Dental equipment side, internal sales declined 6% year-over-year. Patterson achieved continued growth in core equipment during the quarter, even on top of last year's strong growth. However, this growth was more than offset by declining sales of high tech equipment during the quarter. Our digital and CAD/CAM businesses faced industry headwinds from the broader economic environment as well as lengthening upgrade cycles and continued pricing pressure. Moving forward, we are encouraged by the fact that our manufacturing partners have indicated long term plans to invest and innovate in these important product categories. This is a testament to the continued long term demand for these types of products. And when there's new innovation, Patterson has a leading capability to sell, finance, install and service all Dental equipment. And finally, Dental internal sales in our value added services category increased approximately 3% over the prior year period. Value added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that enhance the customer experience, drive loyalty and help make Patterson an indispensable partner to their practice. Dental value added services continued to grow at a pace exceeding the rate of the Dental segment sales overall and remain a key strategic focus and significant growth opportunity for Patterson. We are dedicated to continuously deepening Patterson's Dental value position and positioning ourselves for continued success in a healthy and attractive market that is supported by enduring trends, including an aging population, a drive towards practice modernization and heightened awareness of the link between oral health and overall health. We remain confident in our team's ability to effectively navigate ongoing macroeconomic and industry challenges and achieve our long term goals. Now let's move on to our Animal Health segment. During the second quarter, Patterson's Animal Health segment internal sales increased 0.2% year-over-year. Even in environment of modest growth, we're seeing evidence that Patterson's deep and broad value proposition across species and multiple channels continues to be a driver of our success. In companion animal, our internal sales declined by low single digits as veterinary clinic business decreased and spending moderated. As I mentioned, we attribute this decrease to moderation in the companion animal industry [hastened] by a tough economic climate for consumers navigating inflation and other challenges. However, it's important to put this quarter into broader context of the long term health of this end market. As we look ahead, we expect this market as a whole to grow in the low single digits over the long term, supported by positive long term trends in pet parenting. On the production animal side, second quarter internal sales grew by mid single digits. A strong performance in production reaffirms the strength of our omnichannel presence, highly tailored distribution strategy and comprehensive offering across animal species. Those strategies executed by our talented and tenured team enabled us to continue to win new business and outperform the broader production animal market. Secondarily, our performance also benefited because of the more historical timing of the annual fall run and movement of cattle to feed yards. Across the Animal Health segment, our value added services category grew rapidly due to increased demand for our software solutions and equipment services, as well as new programs to drive revenue and operational efficiency in freight. We're also confident that the opportunity for continued growth within software remains significant, and we continue to invest in existing solutions to better leverage our strong foundation, add to our capabilities and address evolving customer preferences. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin Barry to provide more detail on our financial results.\nKevin Barry: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our second quarter of fiscal '24, which ended on October 28, 2023 and then conclude with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. So let's begin by covering the results for our second quarter of fiscal '24. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal '24 second quarter were $1.65 billion, an increase of 1.6% over the second quarter of one year ago. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects of currency translation, contributions from recent acquisitions and the net impact of an interest rate swap increased 1% compared to the same period last year. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was 20.5%, an increase of 30 basis points compared to the prior year period. Beginning with our fiscal '24 second quarter, we have also provided adjusted gross margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure that adjusts gross margin for the impact of the mark to market accounting related to our equipment financing portfolio and the associated interest rate swap hedging instruments. We will provide this additional non-GAAP financial measure going forward as it adjusts for the impact of interest rate fluctuations net of the mark to market swap adjustment within the P&L. In particular, this adjustment classifies the gain or loss on the interest rate swap from other income expense to net sales to align the swap impact with the impact on customer financing net sales. Remember, the accounting impact of the mark to market adjustment impacts our total company gross margin but not the gross margin within our business segment. And as before, the net impact of interest rate fluctuations between the swap and the equipment financing portfolio has a minimal impact on net income. For the second quarter of fiscal '24, our adjusted gross margin was 20.6% compared to 20.8% in the year ago period. We provided these comparative numbers for the second quarter and on a year-to-date basis, and we have included reconciliations for the first quarter in today's press release. Importantly, during the second quarter of fiscal '24, both of our business units posted a year-over-year increase to their respective gross margins compared to the prior year period. The initiatives we have put in place to improve gross margin, working more closely with strategic vendors who reward us for our sales performance, drive improved mix, exercise expense discipline and leverage our cost structure, have translated into improved gross margins for both of our business units. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the second quarter of fiscal '24 were 16.5% and unfavorable by 70 basis points compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, our consolidated adjusted operating margin was 4.2%, a decrease of 80 basis points compared to the second quarter of last year. Note that our adjusted operating margin now includes the impact of the interest rate swap adjustment mentioned previously. In the second half of fiscal '24, we plan to continue to effectively manage our expenses, while executing on the margin initiatives that have been yielding results within our business segments and for the company overall. Our adjusted tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was 25.1%, an increase of 90 basis points compared to the prior year period. Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was $40 million or $0.42 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the second quarter of last year of $54.1 million or $0.55 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the second quarter of fiscal '24 was $47.3 million or $0.50 per diluted share. This compares to $61.2 million or $0.63 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal '23. This decrease in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal second quarter was primarily due to lower sales of Dental high technology equipment and increased operating expenses compared to the prior year period. Now let's turn to our business segments, starting with the Dental business. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales for our Dental business decreased 0.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. Internal sales of Dental consumables in the fiscal second quarter increased 2.9% compared to one year ago despite being impacted by continued price deflation of certain infection control products. Internal sales of non-infection control products increased 4.7% in the second quarter of fiscal '24 compared to the year ago period. This negative impact from infection control product deflation has steadily moderated over the past year and we expect the year-over-year deflationary effect to continue moderating and fully normalize at the end of fiscal year '24. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales of Dental equipment decreased 6.3% compared to one year ago. This quarter, core equipment posted positive growth that was more than offset by a decline in the digital X-ray and CAD/CAM product category as compared to the prior year period. We believe the year-over-year decline in these two categories was the result of macroeconomic concerns on some equipment purchasing decisions as well as selling price declines within the imaging categories. Internal sales of value added services in the second quarter of fiscal '24 increased 3.1% over the prior year period led by the continued growth of our software business and increased year-over-year contribution from our technical service team. Value added services, including our software offerings, represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make us an indispensable partner to their practice and these valuable offerings are also mix favorable to our P&L. The adjusted operating margin in Dental was 9.4% in the second quarter of fiscal '24, which represents an 80 basis point decrease over the prior year period. While gross margins in the Dental business for the second quarter of fiscal '24 improved year-over-year, increased operating expenses related to our SAP implementation and warehouse expansion in Canada along with investments in our software and technical service business drove the unfavorability in adjusted operating margin on a year-over-year basis. Now let's move to our Animal Health segment. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, internal sales for our Animal Health business increased 0.2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. Internal sales for our companion animal business in the second quarter of fiscal '24 decreased 3.6% over the prior year period. Strong sales performance from our NVS business in the UK was more than offset by declines in the US companion animal business. Internal sales for our production animal business in the fiscal second quarter increased 4.1% in the quarter compared to the prior year period. Our production animal team continues to execute well in the market and our omnichannel approach across several species continues to pay off with sales growth above the overall market. The adjusted operating margin in our Animal Health segment was 3.6% in the fiscal '24 second quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from the prior year period. Gross margins in our Animal Health segment were up in the fiscal '24 second quarter and an increase in operating expenses on a year-over-year basis drove the operating margin decrease compared to the second quarter of fiscal '23. Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first six months of fiscal '24, our free cash flow improved by $28.0 million compared to the same period one year ago. This was primarily due to a decreased level of working capital in the first sixmonths of fiscal '24 compared to the year ago period. Turning now to capital allocation. Our capital spending in the first 6 months of fiscal '24 was $33.5 million and $6.7 million higher than the first six months of fiscal '23. This increased spending reflects the investments we are making in our distribution capabilities as well as software and value added services. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal '24. We also repurchased approximately $61 million of shares during the second quarter of fiscal '24, thereby returning a total of $85.9 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Let me conclude with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal '24. Today, we are revising our fiscal '24 GAAP earnings guidance to a range of $2.04 to $2.14 per diluted share and our adjusted earnings guidance range to $2.35 to $2.45 per diluted share. We have made these revisions to our GAAP and adjusted earnings per share guidance to account for the macroeconomic environment and uncertainty that we believe will persist for the remainder of our fiscal '24 year. Now I will turn the call back over to Don for some additional comments.\nDon Zurbay: Thanks, Kevin. Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to thank the entire Patterson team for their continued hard work and commitment to our strategy serving our customers. Looking forward, the macroeconomic challenges we experienced during the second quarter do not change our strategic objectives or confidence in the health and attractiveness of our end markets. We continue to believe that Patterson is well positioned to drive enhanced growth, profitability and value creation as we execute our strategy over the long term. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I will be glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brandon Vazquez with William Blair.\nBrandon Vazquez: Maybe just to start, there's a lot of moving pieces on the macro side, kind of hard for us to see through it all, but you guys have a good exposure in both Dental and Animal Health. So maybe as you look at your updated guidance, can you talk a little bit about what is assumed in kind of the end markets for both of those segments for the rest of the year?\nDon Zurbay: So I think if you kind of break things down a little bit, our consumables business on the Dental side, as you could see, we had another strong quarter. So we expect that trend to continue. On the equipment side, that's kind of where we're talking about the guidance revision is really the equipment, specifically the high tech equipment. We're expecting that market to be somewhat soft as we go through the rest of our fiscal year or the second half. And then on the Animal Health side, another really strong performance in our production business, and there's a lot of good reasons for that, that are sustainable. So that business, we'd expect to benefit from that. And then on the companion side, we saw a little bit of a slowdown in visits and spend. Again, we think that's a bit of an enduring dynamic as we go through the rest of the year. Think if you kind of peel back from that, we're talking about and putting into place some cost actions to help ourselves in the back half of the year. And some of the disruption in the industry that everyone's been focused on will get us some benefit as well. So when you kind of put all that in the hopper that got us back to a $0.10 reduction in the guidance as we move through the back half.\nBrandon Vazquez: And then maybe as a follow-up, kind of staying on equipment is first just clarifying, it sounds like in the past, we've talked about equipment a lot being lumpy. You might have a down quarter, then up double digits quarter, but this seems like it's different, this might be a little bit more sustained decline through the rest of the year. So just clarifying that. And then any -- you guys have a unique view on financing a lot of this equipment. Any notable kind of read throughs that you would make to the financing of the equipment business or delinquencies changing? Is it just higher interest rates are making people less willing to finance? Anything you could call out there?\nDon Zurbay: And maybe I'll take the first question and kick it over to Kevin for the next. I think the dynamics in the equipment business for us, it was a little bit different. It's lumpy, as you know, and we've said that repeatedly, hard to really take trends from one month, even three months. I think in this case, it was particularly interesting because a lot of the slowdown really happened right at the end of the quarter, which is what we would talk about in terms of the miss for the quarter on our expectations was really driven late in the quarter, which is, as you can imagine, harder to mitigate. But if you take the longer view on the year, that's where we think, okay, this is the dynamic we saw. We're going to be obviously monitoring that as we go through Q3 to see how much of that was really just timing versus slowdown and then with some cost actions and then that sort of thing, we're going to -- the plan is to help mitigate that. And then maybe I'll let Kevin answer the question on the financing.\nKevin Barry: So like Don said, within the quarter here, we did see growth in our core equipment. And the declines that offset it were really in the 2D and 3D imaging and CAD/CAM spaces, and those are pressured. We saw some unit demand pressure as well as continuing price pressure in the market, some downward ASP pressure that hit that. And from a financing standpoint, you're right, we do in-house financing and it really is mostly directed towards those categories. So that's most of the stuff that we finance. And we're working internally and we've obviously raised our interest rates as the overall external market's gone up. But we're looking internally and working with our manufacturers on promotional strategies to keep driving demand in those categories as we go through the year, and financing is certainly a lever that we'd be looking at.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jon Block with Stifel.\nJon Block: Don, just for the guidance, you missed the quarter by roughly $0.08 relative to consensus. So you lowered by $0.10 for the full year. So the back part is sort of unchanged and I know that can be a little bit difficult to tease out because you guys don't guide specifically by quarter. You're saying you expect the macro to remain challenging. I guess where I'm going with this is it would seem that the full year would come down by more because, again, the quarter miss was almost a full $0.10. So maybe you could just talk to that, like what do you -- what are you building in with anything as a buffer? And maybe what I'm trying to get at, are there any tailwinds from Henry Schein share gains in there that would be offsetting, call it, a weaker core as we work our way throughout fiscal '24?\nDon Zurbay: And one thing I would mention is that in this particular quarter, Q2, our -- so it's an $0.08 miss from Street consensus to our reported results. In this quarter, I think there was a bit of a disconnect between consensus and maybe where we were expecting things to be. So I would view it a little bit like that number, $0.08 is a bit less for the miss in our perspective. And then we're taking that out of the second half. But yes, definitely. Look, the three main things I'd call out in the second half that we're considering are the slowdown in the high tech equipment market but continued strength in our consumables, in our Dental consumables portfolio, continued strength in our production business, doing things -- some things to mitigate some of the weakness we're seeing in companion and then stack on top of that, the cost actions we plan to take in the second half and any benefit from some of the competitor disruption that we're going to have in November, particularly. And that's kind of -- we put all that into the math formula and those are the main things I would call out to some puts, some takes, but it nets out to the $0.10 move we did in the guidance.\nJon Block: And maybe just to push you on Part B of that first question, your competitor's Web site was down from some point in mid-October. So you did have a good Dental consumable number in a weakening market, up 5% ex-PPE. So was that a -- sorry to frame it this way. Was that a clean number or do you think you saw some of that in the month of October? And have you started to -- have you continued to see some tailwinds for the month of November? And then I'll just ask my follow-up.\nDon Zurbay: So the benefit in October, it was a two week period. So the one thing I would caution against is too much calculation on simple math for any of this just because of the reality of putting new customers into your system, making transitions, customer ordering patterns, et cetera, it never works out that way. But the benefit for us in October was approximately $2 million of revenue.\nJon Block: And then just to shift gears a little bit. Can you guys just talk about the Dental -- call it the backlog with equipment and where that sits? And I just called it out because you got now back to back negative Dental equipment results, but core is doing well. The culprit seems to be high tech but I think core usually has the longer like lead time. And so I'm just trying to match almost like core orders, if you would, to your results. So maybe if you could just touch on to a certain extent to the backlog.\nDon Zurbay: Well, we want to try to be very helpful here but not get too far ahead of ourselves on forward-looking type information. I guess I would just say that the dynamics we saw in the quarter which were that core was solid for us, but that the high tech equipment showed some softness, particularly late in the quarter. The backlog looks good. I think there's still good investment happening but it's more targeted. And we expect that core could hang in there, but the high tech, we're going to show some continued weakness here for a period of time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Baird.\nJeff Johnson: So Don, maybe I can just ask for two clarifying questions from answers you just gave here. But one, you talked about a disconnect maybe between consensus in the second quarter versus what the company internal expectations might have been. EPS for the quarter was down 20% year-over-year. And so I guess, one, what would have been in the quarter that you would have internally been expecting such a sizable year-over-year contraction? And two, again, kind of is it just the cost actions and some of the cost savings that you're now going to be kind of ratcheting into the model that helps you get back to kind of flattish EPS or even low single digit EPS growth that's implied in the second half guidance?\nDon Zurbay: I think it's a combination of cost actions and some of the benefits we're seeing. Maybe I'll turn it over to Kevin Barry for a few more comments on that.\nKevin Barry: I think what I'd say about the quarter specifically, Jeff, in terms of our expectations, last year, in Q2, we had a few onetime benefits in stock comp and incentive compensation that we knew were not going to repeat this year. So we have that baked into our expectations. And then we also knew that here this quarter, we had some investment spending that was going to hit. And that really relates to the software investments we're making and some of the fulfillment center and ERP investments Don mentioned in his comments. So we knew that we had that swing happening in our OpEx line for the quarter. And then I think we're -- and so that was all baked into our expectations. And I think what deviated from our expectations like we've been saying was the high tech equipment that really happened late in the quarter where it was a bit late for us to react to. So that was sort of what our Q2 estimate was built on.\nJeff Johnson: And then, I guess, just one follow-up just on the Schein question, the tailwinds, given their cyber issues. The 2 million number you cited, Don, for the back two quarters for the last two weeks of October, that's a number, frankly, that's in line, maybe even a little lower than I'm hearing from some of the private dealers that are out there that are probably 4, 5, 6 times smaller than you. So that number just sounds very low to me. One, how do you get to that number? I'm sure it's hard to tell what customers may be are incremental or coming to you because of Schein cyber issues. But then how do we think about maybe the third quarter impact where obviously, those Schein issues have continued for several weeks into the quarter. I'm sure you don't wish ill on any of your competitors, but it is an issue that obviously we're watching closely. So how do we think about maybe the third quarter contribution from some of those share gains that might have happened on a temporary or we'll see longer term basis?\nDon Zurbay: Yes, I would reiterate what you just said. I never wish [Technical Difficulty] on any one particular competitor. I mean this does not benefit anyone really. But there was two weeks left in the quarter when this really just started to come to light. And so again -- so for us, I would kind of point people to the idea that it's not linear to get started. There's a lot to that to get people into your full to start their ordering, to make sure that your own customers are serviced appropriately. And again, the other thing I'd say, frankly, is we compete vigorously for our -- to obtain business, but so do our competitors, including that competitor. And so they were working to keep their customers. So that's how you kind of look at that. I would say we're not going to, unfortunately, be able to give too much color on November and we're actually -- we just finished the November month. So we're in the process of closing and starting to mine out all of that information. I would say that I think we have a pretty good process to get at a number that has some precision to it. So I feel good about the 2 million number that we gave for the quarter. As you get into November, we'll see how that's played out. The thing that November had that October didn't is that some of the initial setup, some of the things that just sort of reacting to what happened was behind us, and we were able to focus a little bit more on just trying to help those customers out.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo with UBS.\nKevin Caliendo: I want to get back to the Dental equipment stuff and talk a little bit about selling price versus delays in ordering and to account for how much is actual price -- average price declines versus decision making, and if you think those decisions are being delayed or just canceled. Meaning like are we waiting, are we waiting for December or are we pushing everything out a year? Or are these just like this isn't the right time, come back to us next year or maybe would they expect prices to come down? I'm just trying to understand the behavior of what's happening in the market.\nKevin Barry: I think it's tough to make one blanket statement with kind of all the purchasing decisions that are out there in the market. I think what we're seeing in our business is sort of a combination of -- just when we look at the data, we do see some -- here in the quarter, we saw some unit price declines in our CAD/CAM business. We saw a bit more of a mix of trade ups as opposed to new unit sales. And then in the, I guess, the imaging categories, we are seeing average selling prices come down a bit. And I think as we put all that together and we've built our forecast, there's always a replacement cycle on these types of equipment. For a practitioner at a certain point, they just need to replace the piece of equipment, that's how it's kind of baked into the baseline of our business. And like I said earlier, our teams are working on the right promotional activities to drive new demand over and above that as we go through the quarter to try to break through some of those purchasing headwinds we're seeing. And like I said, some of that might show up in financing promotions, other promotions that we would do. Now from a timing standpoint, does that manifest in the next two months, six months, one year, kind of depends customer by customer what their individual affiliation is. What buoys us a bit is as we looked and as our results have come in, and we've been talking about the consumables business and even when we kind of strip out some of the market noise, we still see really good underlying patient demand for kind of the core hygiene restoration-type treatments that's kind of our bread and butter for our business. So we know that people are still going to the dentist and that traffic should buoy the investment decisions of some of the practices out there.\nKevin Caliendo: And just a quick follow-up to that is, are you seeing different behaviors from DSOs versus sort of individual practices, are DSOs being more conservative in any way, shape or form?\nKevin Barry: I think it's fair to say we've seen some of the expansion activity on the DSO side slow down compared to before. But I think the same dynamics play out. It really kind of depends practice by practice what their traffic is, what the kind of state of their equipment is and what opportunities they see to invest in their practice to drive better ROI, which is what our sales team is really good at working through with our customers. So I'd say there are probably a fewer de novos than prior years, but similar dynamics within the core practices.\nKevin Caliendo: And if I can ask a follow-up to Jeff's question. Do you think that there is any permanent share changing that has happened due to what happened with your competitors and their cyber attack? Meaning like is there -- has there been any -- what you think is permanent market share gains for you because of what happened to them?\nDon Zurbay: I think it's too early to tell on that. We had -- part of our strategic view on this was, as you can imagine, we would like to be looking at and working with potential customers that could be long term. So that's our focus but it remains to be seen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.\nSameer Patel: This is Sameer Patel on for Elizabeth Anderson. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about OpEx. You kind of mentioned that this is a bit elevated related to SAP integration as well as that facility expansion. What are some of the levers you can pull to moderate those costs? And also, what sort of step down should we kind of expect in the next quarter related to the completion of those two projects?\nKevin Barry: I'll start, and Don can add any color he has. In terms of the step down, I think as we go through the rest of the year, the timing of those investments we've been talking about are a bit offset. We'll see a wind down a bit in the expenses related to the SAP implementation and the Canada and NVS warehouse expansions, those have kind of gone live here right now. So we'll see some of that in Q3 but kind of moderating into Q4. But I think that's going to be a bit offset as our software investments were sort of built to accelerate more as we go through the rest of the year. And as Don has been saying, we're still very committed to that part of our business, and we see the real long term potential there. So we're going to work to protect those investments as we go through the year. And offsetting that in terms of the cost actions that Don mentioned, it's the things that really are kind of under our discretionary spend. We're going to be looking more closely at discretionary travel and professional fees and things like that, that is -- when you're having a year like this, you tighten your belt on. And we'll be doing those sort of activities here as we go through the year to make sure that we can deliver on our commitments and also make space for the investments for the long term of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Allen Lutz with Bank of America.\nAllen Lutz: One for Kevin. You said that equipment was weak over the past two weeks in the quarter. Can you talk about the consumables trend that you saw over the quarter? Was October any different than September, is there anything to call out there? And then any insight into what you're seeing early in November?\nKevin Barry: I wouldn't call out any big trend shifts we saw month to month within the quarter. And I think Don kind of walked through the impact you saw very late in the quarter. But honestly, if you kind of step back a bit and look at our -- kind of how we've performed this whole fiscal year going back to May for us, we continue to see really strong performance by our team on the consumables line. We've had this PPE headwind that we've been working through. And when you strip that out, we think our team is performing and executing really well with our customers. We think we were on a trend to get some share even before the end of the quarter here. So I wouldn't call any big trend shifts within the quarter. I think our teams are executing really well and it's showing up in that consumables performance.\nDon Zurbay: And maybe just one point of clarification. I think on the weakness we saw in the equipment sales were really more -- I would characterize it more as really for the month of October not really just the last two weeks.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of John Stansel with JPMorgan.\nJohn Stansel: Just one on production. Can you give us a bit of a sense of how that should fit within cattle, pork, dairy? Sounds like -- I know pork was stronger last quarter. Kind of what was driving that acceleration in growth, it sounds like? And then any way to think about that from -- I know you've done a fair number of acquisitions in the production space. Would that mid single digit growth translate to more of an internal number? And then, I guess, final part of it. Just anything to call out on the seasonal timing shift that you mentioned as we think about the back half?\nKevin Barry: Yes, I'll try to cover that. I mean I think the one thing I'd say about our production animal business is -- and we've talked about this in prior calls. That team has done an excellent job of really kind of diversifying both the species that we serve and then how we reach the veterinarians and producers that work in those industries. And so quarter-to-quarter, we see some ups and downs between swine, dairy and beef. But really, this quarter was good performance across all. The timing of the fall run, it's always kind of rattles our Q2 and Q3 every quarter, and so a little bit of art and science to figure out exactly what the impact is going to be. And so I think -- but again, I think the message really there is that we've got a team that's servicing their customers really well, gaining some share. And that diversified and kind of omnichannel presence we have is really the differentiator for us so we can really meet the customer where they are. On the acquisition side, the key acquisition that we've made in the production animal business is a company called Dairy Tech, which is an owned brand now that really services the dairy part of our business. And I'd say at this point, it's a relatively small part of that overall portfolio, but it's performing really well. It's providing a service that those dairy customers really value. That integration has gone really well from our expectations and how that team is performing. But from an overall numerical standpoint, it's relatively small from an overall impact.\nDon Zurbay: All right. Thanks for all your time today and interest in Patterson Companies, and we will talk to you in three months.\nOperator: I'd like to thank our speakers for today's presentation, and thank you all for joining us. This now concludes today's call, and you may now disconnect."

This call is being recorded and will be available for replay starting at 10:00 AM, Central Time for a period of one week. Now, I'd like to hand the call over to Don Zurbay.\nDon Zurbay: Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. Patterson had a strong start to fiscal ‘24, building upon our momentum across the business as we continue to deliver value for our customers and shareholders. A few highlights from our first quarter. On the top line, year-over-year internal sales increased approximately 3% with growth across both the dental and animal health segments. Our initiatives to drive margin improvement were successful as we achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion across the company, and the dental and animal health segments. We returned $55 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases and we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 25% from the same period a year ago. Given these results, we remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2024 earnings guidance. As a reminder, our guidance accounts for our commitment to deliver year-over-year internal sales growth and adjusted operating margin expansion for the total company and across both our dental and animal health segments. Our performance during our fiscal ‘24 first quarter illustrates the continued execution of our proven strategy, which as I shared last quarter is designed to achieve four core objectives: First, drive revenue growth above the current end market growth rates. Second, build upon the progress we've made to enhance our margin performance. Third, evolve our products, channels, and services to best serve the customers in our end markets. And fourth, improve efficiency and optimization. Our team is aligned around various strategic initiatives to advance each of these core objectives. Today, I'd like to highlight just a couple of specific examples that we've been working on in early fiscal 2024 to demonstrate our progress. First, our focus on private label. During the first quarter, we benefited from continued growth in our private label portfolio, which includes the collection of owned brands with strong market equity. These include brands we've built like the Patterson brand in dental, in the Aspen and Pivotal companion vet products, as well as acquired brands like Dairy Tech in the production animal business. We have invested in this important category by adding new SKUs and our sales team is highly engaged and motivated to drive sales growth in this margin accretive category. We continually evaluate opportunities across our businesses, but believe there is a distinct opportunity within animal health to further expand the private label portfolio to meet evolving consumer preferences. In fact during fiscal ’24 we expect to add more private labe; products to our animal house offering than ever before. Over the past several years, our private label sales growth outpaced the sales growth of products manufactured by our strategic partners. The results are paying off and in addition to generating above market growth, our focus on private labels supports our other core objectives. Another recent example relates to our efforts to improve efficiency and optimization. As we've said before, this objective includes not only a rigorous focus on cost discipline, but also targeted investments to leverage best practices and advance operational excellence across the enterprise. We have recently been implementing a strategic modernization of our fulfillment facilities and capabilities. This includes investments in new technology such as robots and cobots to automate order picking, enhancements for our teams to ensure the right skills and expertise to operate the more modern facilities and substantial expansions of our fulfillment capacity. Just this week, we are opening a brand new fulfillment center in the U.K., we call the [Big Shed] (ph) that will double our capacity in the region. This fully automated next generation facility is not just larger. It's more sustainable, more efficient, and further advances our channel capabilities. We also recently completed a technology overhaul to our fulfillment center in Southern California and are close to opening an expanse facility in Montreal, Canada. In addition, we have similar projects underway in several other locations. These strategic investments in our fulfillment centers can help alleviate capacity constraints and the modernization of our facilities is expected to enhance growth. These are only a couple examples of some of the many initiatives we have underway. Taken together, our strategic areas of focus build upon our strong foundation and success over the past several years to further differentiate our position in the market and drive enhanced growth, profitability, and value creation over the long-term. Now I'll provide some updates on each of our segments during the fiscal first quarter. Let's start with dental. Dental segment internal sales increased 2%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal ’23, due to strong growth in consumable and value-added services, which includes our software offerings. We also achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion in the fiscal first quarter, due to our dental team's ongoing focus on our margin enhancement initiatives. Our value proposition continues to resonate with all types of dental customers. From individual practices to group practices, we seek to create a seamless experience by offering a comprehensive suite of product and solutions that help dental practices grow, become more efficient, and provide improved patient care. In the consumables category, dental internal sales increased approximately 5% in the fiscal first quarter, compared to one year ago. Excluding the moderating deflationary impact of infection control products, internal sales for our non-infection control consumables increased nearly 7% year-over-year. Overall, we believe the demand we are seeing for consumables products speaks to the resiliency of the dental market, and our ability to drive growth above the current end market. Looking at dental equipment internal sales in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 decreased 6%, compared to the year ago period. Our team delivered growth in our core equipment and CAD/CAM categories that was more than set by a decline in digital technology, which experienced a sequential decline in sales following a strong fiscal 2023 fourth quarter. This dynamic is typical of the variability of the equipment category and further demonstrates how equipment sales can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter for a variety of factors. Over the last eight quarters, our average quarterly equipment internal sales growth was 4%. Dentists continue to invest in their practices and look to Patterson when they do. We anticipate that demand for equipment and technology will drive our manufacturing partners to continue introducing new innovations and technologies. Patterson is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this demand, thanks to our expertise in selling, financing, installing, training, and servicing the latest technologies and equipment. And finally, dental internal sales in our software and value-added services category increased approximately 6% over the prior year period. Value-added services represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers that help make Patterson an indispensable partner to their practice, including our leading technical service offering. This category continues to grow at a rate exceeding the overall rate of the dental segment. The strong results we have been delivering in the value-added services category are testament to our customers recognizing the full life cycle support and services that Patterson provides. And as an added benefit, these valuable offerings are mixed favorable to our P&L. Maximizing our value-added service offerings, particularly in the software category, is a key part of our strategy with a meaningful opportunity for growth. Looking ahead, we believe the dental market remains stable with healthy underlying fundamentals, including an aging population, practice modernization and the direct link between a patient's oral health and overall health, which we believe will continue to serve as tailwinds and help drive performance across our dental segment over the long-term. Now let's move on to our animal health segment. During the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 animal health internal sales increased 4% year-over-year, with growth in both companion animal and production animal businesses. We also achieved year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion in the animal health segment, building upon our excellent track record of margin improvement over the past few years. We benefit from the depth of our offering and omnichannel presence expands a wide range of animal species and offers comprehensive solutions for diverse customers. In companion animal, our internal sales in the fiscal quarter increased by mid-single-digits, as we executed well within this healthy and growing market. As we've said before, we've been modeling mid-single-digit revenue growth for our companion business over the long-term. On the production animal side, fiscal 2024 first quarter internal sales grew by low-single-digits, despite ongoing headwinds within the cattle market, we have continued to deliver sales growth in this part of the animal health business. This is a testament to our team's performance and the diversification of our production business. Across the animal health segment, our value-added services category achieved strong growth that can be attributed to sales of our software solutions and equipment service, as well as operational efficiencies. Expanding our investments in software and value-added services remains a priority for us and is core to our objective to position Patterson animal health as the leading provider of technology, software, data insights, services, and products to the animal health industry. Our team stands ready to help our customers identify the right set of solutions to streamline their workflows and run their practices efficiently, all backed by our unbeatable service and support. Now I'll turn the call over to Kevin Barry to provide more detail on our financial results.\nKevin Barry: Thank you, Don, and good morning, everyone. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover the financial results for our first quarter of fiscal ’24, which ended on July 29th 2023, and then conclude with our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year. So let's begin by covering the results for our first quarter of fiscal ‘24. Consolidated reported sales for Patterson Companies in our fiscal ‘24 first quarter were $1.6 billion, an increase of 3.5% over the first quarter of one year ago. Internal sales, which are adjusted for the effects currency translation and contributions from recent acquisitions increased 2.8%, compared to the same period last year. Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 was 20.2%, a decrease of 25 basis points, compared to the prior year period. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by 40 basis points this quarter by the mark-to-market accounting adjustment from rising interest rates on our equipment financing portfolio. As we have mentioned in prior earnings calls, any positive or negative impact related to our equipment financing portfolio is nearly offset by our corresponding hedging instrument, which is reflected in the other income net line on our P&L, so the net results has a minimal impact on our adjusted earnings per share. This dynamic also occurred in the first fiscal quarter of last year, and the positive impact of the mark-to-market accounting calculations of 10 basis points. When normalizing for the mark-to-market accounting adjustment in both periods, our gross margin rate in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 was 20 basis points higher than the first quarter of fiscal ‘23. Remember, the accounting impact of the mark-to-market adjustment impacts our total company gross margin, but not the gross margin within our business segments. Importantly, during the fiscal first quarter, both of our business units posted a year-over-year increase to their respective gross margins, compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for the first quarter of fiscal ’24 were 17.2% and favorable by 40 basis points compared to the fiscal first quarter of ‘23. In the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, our consolidated adjusted operating margin 3.0%, an increase of 15 basis points, compared to the first quarter of last year. Again, when normalizing for the impact of the mark-to-market accounting in both periods related to gross margin. Our consolidated adjusted operating margin in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 expanded by 60 basis points over the prior year period. I am pleased with the team's efforts to continuously improve and deliver on our commitment to drive operating margin expansion within our business segments and for the total company overall in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24. The initiatives we put in place to improve gross margin, to work more closely with strategic vendors, who reward us for our sales performance, drive improved mix, exercise expense, discipline, and leverage our cost structure has certainly translated into a higher level of profitability and financial performance for Patterson. Our adjusted tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 was 23.5%, an increase of 110 basis points, compared the prior year period. Reported net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. for the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 was $31.2 million or $0.32 per diluted share. This compares to reported net income in the first quarter of last year of $24.6 million or $0.25 per diluted share. Adjusted net income attributable to Patterson Companies, Inc. in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, was $38.6 million or $0.40 per diluted share. This compares to $31.7 million or $0.32 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal ’23. This 25% increase in adjusted earnings per diluted share for the fiscal first quarter is primarily due to the sales execution and operating margin expansion in both of our business segments. Now let's turn to our business segments, starting with our dental business. In the first quarter of fiscal of ’23, internal sales for our dental increased 2.1%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal ’23. Internal sales of dental consumables in the fiscal first quarter increased 4.6% compared to one year ago and were impacted by continued price deflation of certain infection control products. Internal sales of non-infection control products increased 6.9% in the first quarter of fiscal ’24, compared to the year ago period. This negative impact from infection control product deflation has continued to moderate over the past year, and we expect the year-over-year deflationary effect to continue moderating and fully normalized by the end of fiscal year ‘24. In the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, internal sales of dental equipment decreased 5.7%, compared to one year ago. As Don mentioned, sales in the equipment category can vary from quarter-to-quarter and these dynamics apply to each of the specific product categories as well. This quarter, core equipment and CAD/CAM sales posted positive year-over-year sales growth, but were more than offset by a decline in the digital x-ray category, compared to the prior year period. Internal sales of value-added services in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 increased 5.8% over the prior year period, led by the increased year-over-year contribution from our technical service team and continued growth of our software business. Value-added services, including our software offerings, represent the entire suite of offerings we provide to our customers to help make us an indispensable partner to their practice and these valuable offerings are also mixed favorable to our P&L. The adjusted operating margin in dental was 7.4% in the first quarter of fiscal ’24, which represents a 35 basis point improvement over the prior. This operating margin performance reflects the efforts of our dental team to improve margins through effective pricing and mix management and continued expense discipline to deliver operating margin expansion for the first quarter of fiscal ‘24. Now let's move on to our animal health segment. In the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, internal sales for our animal health business increased 4.0%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal ‘23. Internal sales for our companion animal business in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 increased 5.1% over the prior year period, which included strong sales performance from our [NVS] (ph) business in the U.K. Internal sales for our production animal business in the first quarter increased 2.5% in the quarter, compared to the prior year period. Our production animal team continues to execute well in the market, and internal sales in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 delivered particularly strong growth in the swine category, compared to the prior year period. The adjusted operating margin in our animal health segment was 4.0% in the fiscal ‘24 first quarter, an increase of nearly 80 basis points from the prior year period. Our animal health team continues to drive business with strategic manufacturer partners who value our ability to deliver increased sales, while also exercising expense disciplines, they delivered operating margin expansion for the first quarter of fiscal form. Now let me cover cash flow and balance sheet items. During the first three months of fiscal ‘24, our free cash flow improved by $35.7 million compared to the same period one year ago. This was primarily due to a decreased level of working capital in the first three months of fiscal ’24, compared to the year ago period. Turning now to capital allocation. Our capital spending in the first quarter of fiscal ‘24 was $17.1 million and $2.5 million higher than the first quarter of fiscal ‘23. This increased spending reflects the investments we are making in our distribution capabilities, as well as our software and value-added services. We continue to execute on our strategy to return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.26 per diluted share, which was then paid at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal ‘24. We also repurchased $29.5 million of shares during the first quarter of fiscal ‘24, thereby returning a total of $54.9 million to shareholders to dividends and share repurchases. Let me conclude with our outlook for the remainder of fiscal ‘24. Today, we are reaffirming our fiscal ‘24 GAAP earnings guidance range of $2.14 to $2.24 per diluted share and our adjusted earnings guidance range of $2.45 to $2.55 per diluted share. And now I'm going to turn the call back over to Don for some additional time.\nDon Zurbay: Thanks, Kevin. Before we open it up for Q&A, I want to thank the entire Patterson team for a great start to fiscal 2024 as we made progress to build upon our momentum across the business. We're continuing to deliver on our proven strategy and combined with the resilient end markets in which we operate. I'm confident that we are well positioned to drive enhanced growth profitability, and value creation over the long-term. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin and I will be glad to take questions. Operator, please open the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Jason Bednar from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJason Bednar: Hey. Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Yes, Don or Kevin, I want to start, you know, the dental consumable performance was really strong really seems to defy expectations that I think many have out there on the dental market at the moment. I heard the private label commentary, but could you unpack a bit more where the strength is coming from that's supporting that 7% underlying growth in consumables? Any procedure categories to call out where you're seeing notable strength or anything of note on, you know, BSOs, pricing, share gains, anything like that?\nDon Zurbay: Yes. Thanks, Jason. You know, we're trying to be helpful here. We're not going to probably break down pieces, but quite honestly, we saw strength across the board. I think, you know, patient traffic is steady. We feel really good about that. All customer types performed, you know, and the salesforce really, I think, is just, hitting on all cylinders right now. We think the momentum, the key to this quarter and last quarter are just kind of where we're at right now is just, the continued momentum in the business. So, you know, not to be able to break that down for you, but, honestly, it was across the board.\nJason Bednar: Okay. Alright. No, that's helpful. I'm sure others will have probably have questions there as well. But, maybe just for a follow-up, I did want to ask, I mean, Don you highlighted those corporate investments don't think we've heard, you know, those kind of specifics in the past that sounds like you have a lot of wheels in motion across your facilities, your distribution network. Are you able to quantify all the investments you've made, with some of that automation work and what the ROI or payback you're expecting for some of those investments?\nDon Zurbay: Yes. Well, if you look at, our CapEx spending this quarter is above last first quarter. And I think what you're going to see is as we go through the year, that'll continue to be the case, you know, all of these projects go through a rigorous process, that we have internally to make sure that the ROI, you know, gets above our cost of capital and that it had all, you know, is the financial payoff, as well as all the other benefits we're getting from it. So we're pretty excited about each of these investments. Obviously, you know, we're not going to see the benefits of these, quite yet, but wanted to highlight some examples of the types of things that we have that are going to keep the margin improvement moving in the right direction. And when we make the commitment to continuously improving the margin. I think this is an example of how that works. So, you know, pretty excited about all of them. I think more to come and what I really like is the team is continues to think about the next thing and the next opportunity.\nJason Bednar: Okay, great. Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nNathan Rich: Great. Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Wanted to start with a question on margins. Don, you reiterated expectations for operating margin expansion for the total company, as well as both segments. I guess any change in your expectations for the overall level of margin expansion, I guess, particularly with respect to the dynamics you're seeing in the corporate segment? And then any comments or thoughts on just cadence of margin improvement over the balance of the year?\nDon Zurbay: I'll maybe let Kevin get into a little of that. I think, you know, I think overall, you know, we're still committed to the margin improvement story both at the corporate level and in each of the business units. And, you know, if anything's changed, it's minor. I think our expectations are the same as they were, as we entered the year.\nKevin Barry: Yes. We, you know, we got off to a good start here in Q1 with both of our business units expanding both their gross margins and their operating margins. And so we're seeing that momentum at the business unit level. You alluded to the corporate segment just a reminder, this is a dynamic that we have related to our equipment financing portfolio, whereas the forward interest rate curve changes, we have to mark that portfolio to market, which does create some noise in our corporate segment and our overall margins, which is offset with the hedge we have in our other income line below operating profit. This quarter, it was a bit of a headwind as the forward rate curve increased in that portfolio. And so and that's why we try to give you guys, kind of, the adjusted number, so you can see kind of what that noise taken out of it, how we're performing underneath it. So, you know, we are not going to guess where interest rates are going to go from here, but we'll continue to kind of have that dynamic as interest rates change. But, again, I think you can strip that out and see the underlying momentum there. And then the other thing on phasing, I'd say is that, you know, I think we expect similar cadence where we typically see some leverage as we go through the year, you know, Q1 is typically our lowest op margin level for the year, but as we have higher sales quarters, we typically see leverage on the op margin line for the rest of the year.\nDon Zurbay: I think, I just, you know, maybe want to reiterate, when you take out the dynamics of the accounting that Kevin mentioned, which you need to do, and look at our margin. I mean, our gross margin was up 20 basis points in the quarter. Like, Kevin mentioned and operating margin up 60 basis points, which I think was notable and I -- you know, want to make sure people understand that dynamic. It's kind of confusing.\nNathan Rich: Great, that's helpful. And then, I wanted to ask on the U.S. companion animal business, I know you said overall companion was up 5.1, but I think Kevin, you kind of called out NVS is maybe the main driver of that. Could you comment on how the U.S. companion animal business did? And, you know, any change to your outlook for that business, you know, just giving kind of the overall kind of traffic and level of demand that you're seeing in the market?\nKevin Barry: Sure. I can jump in and Don can add -- that we saw growth in both segments. We saw particularly the strong growth in our NVS business, which is, we want to, you know, call them out, they're performing really well in that market. And this is in advance of some of the investments Don mentioned, what you think are even going to accelerate that business further. But the U.S. companion business also did grow in the quarter. Now we're going to -- as you'd expect, we're not seeing the same level of growth as we have over the past couple of years as that market has, you know, kind of moderated a bit from the heights of the pet, pandemic bloom. But -- and in the overall market, we still see spending up, even as visits have come down a bit. So pet teams are executing really well and are -- and they are growing, you know, in the market, so…\nDon Zurbay: Yes. I think, you know, the 5% is off a fairly tough comp, as Kevin mentioned, with some of the dynamics in the market that were in place last year.\nNathan Rich: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Baird. Your line is open.\nJeff Johnson: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Don, I wanted to start on your equipment number that down 5.7%. You know, obviously, we've seen many times in the past from you and other companies push hard. It's kind of the fiscal end of year to make some numbers and then the next quarter has a bit of an overhang here. How much of that did -- was an impact this quarter? I mean, obviously, you talked about digital x-ray being down, but I'm hoping you can help us maybe disaggregate, kind of, end market tenure of end markets versus just some timing of when you closed your fiscal year and then made a big push last year and had a bit of an overhang to deal with, in this first quarter? Thanks.\nDon Zurbay: Yes. No doubt, Jeff, and I think you've seen that in the past. And there's a lot of reasons for it. Obviously, you know, there can be a fourth quarter push, we do budget and forecast for that. And I think, as you mentioned, you know, the digital category sometimes is the one that may see more variability on that kind of dynamic. So, you know, this gets back to, for me, just back to the whole notion of looking at it in the three month increments, particularly [Indiscernible] as you're bringing up in the fourth quarter, first quarter kind of realm. I think the -- if you just looked across the six month period, which might be a better way to think about all that, you know, our equipment sales were up 8% Q4 and Q1 over last year. And then I think the -- so I would just highlight that we -- you know, we keep watching this category, as you all do, I think, in terms of the economy and things. But, all we're seeing is just the -- our customers, desire to continue investing in their practice and that's just not slowing down. It's a good patient traffic, and it's kind of translating to the practices wanting to continue to invest.\nJeff Johnson: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just on the EPS guidance, you're obviously up 25% year-over-year this quarter. I think your guidance for the year is low-single-digit to mid-single-digit growth year-over-year to full-year. So that would kind of imply kind of flattish EPS over the next three quarters on a year-over-year basis. Just remind us, one, why would that be the right level of EPS growth after a strong start here on the EPS line of the year? And two, how much conservatism versus other factors we might have to be taken into account there.\nDon Zurbay: Yes. Yes. I think this really actually -- I think this mostly relates just to a bit of phasing on the year. I think that we had a tough comp -- or we had an easy comp in Q1 and obviously, a tough comp in Q4, and there's some other dynamics within the year, but I think it relates more to that than anything. And so when we kind of look back and say, even with all that phasing, we're comfortable with the guidance we've given for the year and that growth even though it comes a little bit different for each quarter.\nKevin Barry: Yes, I think the other thing I'd add, Jeff, is there are some -- while we do expect the business to continue to grow over the course of the year, there are some internal investments we're making that will ramp up a bit here into the rest of the year that we think are great investments for the long-term of the company. But we're going to have a little bit of spending that will come through in the back half of the year, too.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Your line is open.\nKevin Caliendo: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess one question I had to ask is around what you saw in July. That's the month we don't get to see from anybody else. I'm just wondering if trend through the quarter was consistent or not? I understand on the equipment side, what happened with ordering and timing. I'm just wondering, as you exited the quarter, did you think the demand for equipment changed at all from the beginning of the quarter or from second quarter. We're just trying to get a read on what's going to happen over the rest of the calendar year into next year.\nDon Zurbay: Yes. No, Kevin, I appreciate the question and a good one. I -- for us, I think the quarter really played out kind of in normal fashion. I don't -- I wouldn't highlight and we probably wouldn't say too much about intra-quarter phasing. But I guess I would say that I don't think that there was nothing notable from my perspective on how the quarter played into the first 2 months versus the last one.\nKevin Caliendo: Okay. That's helpful. And also just thinking about with equipment, where are you in terms of relatively speaking, in terms of backlog, whether it's core or digital. Has that normalized? Or do you feel like the backlog in either of those are elevated or lower or normal? Any color around that would be super helpful.\nKevin Barry: I think -- this is Kevin. I think what we'd say the core equipment demand continues to be strong. Those supply chains have normalized, I think we'd say, compared to what we were talking about a couple of past year or two. So the lead times aren't as long as they used to be. So that sales cycle has shortened for us, which is good. And then for the digital categories, those sales cycles are pretty quick. We can turn around those orders and installs fairly rapidly, the consults obviously not as complicated as a new office build out. So we don't really think about those in terms of backlog just because the cycle is pretty quick. But I'd say, like Don said, we're seeing healthy demand in the market. Our sales teams are executing really well to help their customers find the right investment for their practice and feel good about the rest of the year.\nKevin Caliendo: Do you think that interest rates are the economic situation has held up ordering in any way, shape or form on some of the higher cost equipment in the category? I'm just -- we've heard anecdotally this from -- in the channel and from some of your peers and manufacturers. Just wondering how real you see that as being any kind of impact on the market?\nDon Zurbay: Yes. I think marginally, not in a significant way, though. And again, we're pleased with the momentum in the business, but the momentum in the market, too, in terms of -- again, in terms of practices willing to invest in their business and it continues. So it's a little more challenging, I think, but still make sense, I think, when they run the math.\nKevin Caliendo: Fantastic. Thanks so much, [Indiscernible]\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of John Block from Stifel. Your line is open.\nJon Block: Great. Thanks, guys. Good morning. I guess I'll go back to the underlying Dental consumables, which were seemingly, I guess, the revenue highlight for the quarter. You've got inflation impact starting to diminish. I guess what I'm trying to go with this is, what was the approximate price contribution in fiscal ‘23 for Dental consumables? And how do you see that playing out in fiscal ‘24? I'm just trying to focus on that pricing contribution because I think we all want to arrive at how underlying volumes are trending and if the price contribution for consumables is sort of closer to normalized levels as we currently sit here today.\nKevin Barry: Yes, Jon, this is Kevin. Yes, I think we would say that the pricing certainly is kind of more at historical norms, the kind of low-single-digit pricing. As we've looked at our internal data, here, we certainly -- part of our Q1 performance was price contribution, but it was also a positive volume contribution. So we saw units grow this quarter as well. So it wasn't just the one or the other. I think we expect that for some of those infection control products that we've been tracking that year-over-year deflationary impact is going to continue to be a drag for the next couple of quarters. The prices have stabilized but we're still going to be comparing back to a higher kind of ASP basket for those products from last year. So I think as we -- so we'll be dealing with that dynamic for the next couple of quarters. But I think for -- if you kind of look at the category as a whole, we'd say, we're seeing volume contribution as well as kind of more normalized historical price contribution for dental consumables.\nJon Block: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then just maybe a small handful as part of the second question. For Dental equipment, should we still expect mid-single-digit growth for the year? Obviously, fiscal 1Q was down. You got a really tough comp in 4Q. So do we still think you can land at mid-single-digits for the year? And Kevin, still tax rate of 25% for the year. Is that correct? You were shy of that for the quarter. And did your messaging change a little bit on the deflationary for the infection control. I thought before that was supposed to ease in the back part of the year? And maybe in your prepared remarks, you sort of said that continues to the end of the fiscal year, maybe some clarification there?\nKevin Barry: Yes, I'll take a couple of those. So yes, on the deflation, I think what I'd say is we really saw the prices kind of stabilize at a new level in our Q4 of fiscal '23. So it's probably -- Q2 will have a headwind. Q3 will have a smaller headwind. Q4, it should be pretty marginal sort of how we see the pricing dynamics playing out for, Jon. And then on the tax rate, yes, we'd still say about 25%. We're seeing a step-up this year in our tax rate due to some changes in the U.K. tax law, as well as some historical deductions that have expired for us. So I think that's still the right number for your estimate. And equipment -- yes. And I think -- yes, you're right. We do have some tough comps coming up in equipment the team is still pushing hard on that. I think mid-single-digit long-term. And again, given some -- not looking at quarter-to-quarter, but over a reasonable time frame is what we'd expect. And I just keep reiterating what we're saying is I think the market is looking for these investments. And so we're still pushing to get to that mid-single-digit long-term growth rate for equipment.\nDon Zurbay: I think the -- Jon, I think the metric we've kind of brought out every quarter is what does it look like if you look over the last 8 quarters, I think the I think the equipment growth is 4% in that time, and it kind of has been. So you can kind of think about it like that. I think the ups and downs here of a year we deal with. But over an 8-quarter period, that's still -- we still think that's a pretty good number.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nElizabeth Anderson: Hi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. Just a quick question. How are you guys thinking about -- obviously, you have interest expense in the quarter. How are you sort of expecting that to trend for the rest of the year?\nKevin Barry: Yes. Yes. So interest expense, we'd expect it to be maybe a little above what we carried here in Q1 for the rest of the next three quarters as we've kind of reforecast where we expect rates to go. And so really, if you look at it versus last year, there will still be a bit of a headwind here in Q2 and Q3, a little bit less in Q4.\nElizabeth Anderson: Okay, that's helpful. And maybe on the longer-term side, what are the things that maybe come out in the last of years is that you seem to have a sort of different M&A strategy for the Animal Health business versus the Dental business. It seems like sort of more tuck-ins -- or a more regular cadence of tuck-ins on the animal health side. Can you talk to us a little bit more about sort of maybe why that is? Why you're seeing is this sort of availability of assets? Is it just something unique about that business versus some of the Dental, which is obviously just had more core benefit?\nDon Zurbay: Yes. Okay. I think there -- first of all, I would start off by saying in terms of our M&A strategy. We're agnostic to some extent between Animal Health and Dental. We're looking for the right opportunities that hit our metrics and that check the box on what we're thinking about in terms of M&A. So I mean I would put this particular dynamic and kind of where we've been over the last few years, it's just the timing of opportunities that come up and when we're ready to do something and how they check the box. I don't know that there's anything particularly unique about animal health that would put us into a position where there's some good tuck-in acquisitions versus Dental. But we're doing a lot of work. There's a lot of work going into all kinds of potential acquisitions. I know we've been saying this, but we're careful. We want to make sure we make the right investments. And so far, this is what we have. But again, I don't think there's anything unique about Animal Health and Dental. They are different businesses, but we're looking for the right opportunities.\nElizabeth Anderson: Got it. More for me. Just how do you think about the private label opportunity? I know you sort of talked about that particular -- is there something you can sort of like quantify there? And I know you said you're adding more products than before, but how do we think about that as like a driver of margins in that business?\nDon Zurbay: Well, I think what you're going to see is private label becoming a more prominent part of our program. I mean, it's slow, we're not we're not accelerating at any -- at a significantly rapidly pace. So I mean we move carefully, but definitely, there's a strategic objective to make that a bigger part of our business and our sales in both the Animal Health and Dental businesses.\nElizabeth Anderson: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nA.J. Rice: Thanks. Hi, everybody. Obviously, you had really solid strong growth in consumables on the dental side and then your equipment sales down for all the reasons we talked about and to normalize that. I wonder, though, in the quarter, does that dynamic -- is it enough on the product mix shift you saw to have an impact on the margin? Is that part of why the margins showed the improvement that they did in Dental?\nKevin Barry: A.J., yes, it is. I mean we see typically within our dental business, our consumables margins and our value-added services margins, gross margins are higher than our equipment gross margins. Now they're somewhat interrelated, I'd say, because when we look at equipment, we also think about all the services that we provide with regard to the equipment that actually shows up on our value-added services. So in a quarter where we have slightly lower equipment sales that quarter, we might see a little bit of a mix benefit. But we know in our model, it accrues to mix benefits going forward when we sell a lot of equipment because we get the failure add services. We get the technical service revenue from that relationship.\nA.J. Rice: Okay. The company continues to put in its press release, the non to uncertain macro backdrop and some inflationary pressures we've talked on the call already about inflation impact or deflation impact in our infection control. And you've said you don't think you're seeing any impact on the equipment sales. Are you just making those statements to sort of keep a cautionary tone on things? Or is there any place that hasn't come up where those two dynamics, uncertain macroeconomic and inflationaries or pressures you are having an impact now that you would want to call out?\nDon Zurbay: No. I think we're putting that out there as just sort of a caution that kind of that these forces are out there and we have a lot of ways that we're looking at whether those are impacting our business and looking forward, do we think they're going to, and we're not seeing that. I think, again, I go back to -- I've been out in the field, I've been with our top salespeople recently. And I'd just tell you that the momentum in the business right now, the optimism momentum are extremely high and they're just not seeing it. So we'll continue to monitor it. And I think we want to put that out there just so -- I mean, not that people don't, but so people keep that in mind, but it's not showing up.\nA.J. Rice: It sounds like -- to an earlier question, when you think about the outlaying out the rest of the year, it doesn't sound like you're taking -- you're making any adjustments that things get tougher in any particular area, because of these factors late in the year. I just want to confirm that the variation that would be there is more, because of the year-to-year comps, et cetera, not so much because you're making an assumption about the macro environment changing. Is that right?\nKevin Barry: That's right. Absolutely.\nA.J. Rice: Alright. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nAllen Lutz: Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to follow-up on Jeff's question from earlier. So over the past six months, equipment sales have been about 8%, and that's higher than what it's been over the past eight quarters. And so as we think about what we've seen so far on interest rates, you've said there's been a marginal impact. As you think about the guide for the remaining three quarters of the year, is there any expected incremental impact from higher interest rates? And then kind of more thematically in longer term, is there any way to think about how dentists react if interest rates stay higher for maybe a few quarters? Thanks.\nDon Zurbay: Well, I would say, first, the concept of any kind of marginal impact on the equivalent business, given interest rates is something that we spent a lot of time modeling is all really built into our guidance. So I think it would -- unless there's a fairly dramatic change there that we built some of that into our guidance and that's there. What was the second part of the question?\nAllen Lutz: Just how dentists would -- historically, how they react if interest rates stay higher for longer. We haven't really seen an environment where rates have been elevated for more than a few quarters. So just curious about your perspective there? Thanks.\nDon Zurbay: Yes. Well, again, what we keep seeing, and it's not just in the numbers, it's really just as we interact with our customers that there's a lot of interest in continued investment in the practice. We'll monitor that. I mean, I think if we start to see something happen there that changes that dynamic, then we'll build that into the expectations. But again, for right now, that's just -- again, there's a lot of interest in investment.\nAllen Lutz: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And your final question today comes from the line of John Stansell from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nJohn Stansell: Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to look into production a little bit more. I think you -- appreciate you called out the headwind around cattle. So how does that sequential decline in herd count kind of translate to traffic? And then when you're having conversations with customers, how are you thinking about this? Is this something you see as kind of persistent through the year or more of a kind of a near-term? Thanks.\nKevin Barry: Yes. So certainly, our customers are seeing those lower herd counts on the cattle business, and I'd say our production team is doing a fantastic job managing through that. I think the thing for our business is that we do have a diverse kind of portfolio of customers and species that we serve. We've got a large cattle business, but we also serve the swine market, the dairy markets. And so as we look at our business, even if one of those markets is relatively down, we see strength like we did in this quarter in the swine market, the dairy markets have come back. So we'll be able to kind of manage through with our portfolio. And so if there's a bit of a headwind here in one for a couple of quarters as those herd counts normalize, we're confident we've got the plan to manage through it.\nJohn Stansell: Great. And then just quickly on working capital. I think you called out that it improved in the quarter. Is there anything specifically that you're doing to drive this working capital improvement?\nKevin Barry: Yes. No, the team did a good job this quarter. I think we're at a place with our working capital, I'd say that we're always looking for the right opportunities to make sure we've got the right inventory levels. We're balancing our service levels with good -- not getting too long on certain inventory categories. So I'd say there's opportunities that we look at more kind of opportunistically on the margins. But I'd just say, this quarter, our receivables team is doing a really good job. And I think as we go through the year, we'll continue to find some price some opportunities to take inventory down a bit, balancing that need to service the demand we've seen.\nJohn Stansell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to CEO, Don Zurbay, for some final closing remarks.\nDon Zurbay: Just want to thank everybody for their time today and their interest in Patterson Companies, and we'll talk to you in a quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
