Over to you Rajesh.\nRajesh Magow: Thank you Vipul. Welcome everyone to our third quarter call for fiscal 2024. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance during this high season quarter for leisure travel. We witnessed robust demand for leisure travel for domestic as well as outbound travel and are pleased to report our highest ever quarterly gross bookings, revenue and profit till date. Gross bookings for the quarter reached $2.5 billion, growing at 21.7% year-on-year in constant currency terms while our adjusted operating profit or adjusted EBIT grew by 70% year-on-year to $33.4 million as compared to $19.7 million in the same quarter last year. As per government estimates, domestic aviation traffic is expected to double from current levels by 2030. To cater to this increasing traffic, there is continued and increasing investment across all categories of travel infrastructure, resulting in significant upgrades across all categories of transportation, including airports, highways, rails, and thus offering customers more convenience and choice. The current commitments of close to $11 billion in airport modernization should only help meet the near-to-medium term requirements, but for the first time planned airport capacity we've put in place could exceed the projected demand for next five to seven years, which bodes well for the travel and tourism industry. According to Bernstein report, India has gradually been gaining share of the global travel market, now representing 2% of tourism receipts globally up from 0.7% in 2000. Domestic travel in India is already the fifth largest globally and is expected to become the third largest by 2027. The size and diversity of India contribute to the strength of domestic market and the government's efforts to develop new tourism destinations will help in maintaining this growth momentum. Outbound travel from India has also recovered to pre-pandemic levels now and the growth momentum is expected to pick up pace in the coming quarters and years. India is expected to be the fifth largest outbound market by 2027. This should lead to India outbound being the fastest growing component of overall India travel spends. We are excited about these opportunities and remain committed to excellence and innovation, meeting and hopefully exceeding the diverse travel aspirations of Indian travellers. As for our business segments, let me start with our air ticketing business. During the last quarter, I talked about near term supply challenges, particularly in the domestic market due to the insolvency of Go First and the grounding of airplanes due to P&W engine issues. The Indian carriers are taking various steps, including addition of large number of planes in the coming years to fill the supply gap. As per estimates, collectively airlines are expected to add about 150 planes during next year which will be the highest number of additions in a single year. We are hopeful that the supply situation will start improving from the next financial year. Despite the short term headwinds, our growth on a flown basis was at 7.2% quarter-on-quarter, outpaced the market growth of 6%, allowing us to consolidate our market share at 30% plus levels in the domestic air market. As to our international air ticketing business, we have not only fully recovered but have started to grow above the pre-pandemic peak. We continue to innovate and enhance our product proposition. With demand for business and premium economy tickets showing an increasing trend, we have now completely revamped the business class funnel for international flights to provide an enhanced booking experience to our premium users and cater to their specific needs and preferences. We have introduced an industry-first enhanced booking process for business class flight tickets where customers can preview visuals of cabin comfort, meals, in-flight entertainment and other amenities. Customers also have a comprehensive view of the extensive business fare inclusions including lounge access, shopper services and priority services and can also preview airline miles points before finalizing the booking. It is early days but we have started to see increasing engagement on our listing pages. Additionally, we have further strengthened our UAE proposition wherein customers now have the option to seamlessly buy e-visa for UAE during their international flight booking process on our desktop site. The initial response to this has been positive and this feature will soon be launched on our apps as well. Finally, we have further enhanced our price lock feature to now include multi-contract price lock where customers can choose from different time durations for which the prices can be locked. Our accommodation business which includes hotels, homestays and packages witnessed strong year-on-year and quarter-on-quarter growth in the seasonally strong quarter as well. During the quarter, we touched our highest ever single night check-ins of close to about 200,000 people on the back of strong holiday demand. We sold over 63,000 unique domestic hotels across 1760 cities giving us unparalleled reach and penetration within India. On the supply side, we continue to expand our supply and we now offer over 78,000 domestic properties on our platform. Our international outbound business continues to scale well. During the quarter, new direct flights to various destinations like Tashkent, Baku and Bali have been announced and key international holiday destinations like Thailand, Sri Lanka and Malaysia have announced waiver of visa for Indian travellers. This is likely to fuel greater demand for these international destinations in the times to come. On customer experience side, we enhanced the multi-room booking experience. Users are now shown more suitable room combination suggestions and they can specify their preferences explicitly thus simplifying their decision making process. We have also started offering super value packages, bundling various value added services with the hotel room which will help bring more value for the customers. Our homestay business continues to grow with increasing coverage of destinations and increasing customer awareness via our category building marketing efforts. During the quarter, we sold about 16,500 plus unique properties across 800 plus unique destinations. Our holiday packages business continues to scale on the back of our innovative offerings. We have started building on our spiritual tourism product. During the quarter, we launched Ayodhya train charter product with 800 passengers. We plan to scale this and other similar offerings in the coming quarters. For outbound packages, Bali and Singapore were the top destinations and witnessed strong growth while new destinations like South Africa, Japan and Kenya have started to grow meaningfully. Our bus ticketing business witnessed robust growth in Q3. RedBus is now also available in Hindi, giving us a higher share of new customers from tier 2 and 3 towns particularly for bookings on RTCs. We continue to work with various state road transport corporations to bring them online. The government controlled bus inventory on our platform has increased meaningfully with onboarding of UP state RTC and additional inventory being made live by Kerala and Telangana RTCs. A new RTC Chandigarh transport undertaking has also come onto the platform in this quarter. We have undertaken tech optimization to improve real-time inventory status for RTCs to lower booking errors. The overall sentiment amongst private bus operators is also very positive now and we expect a steady increase in private bus supply over the next few quarters and should help drive growth. On our RedRail app, we are acquiring new customers in Tier 2 and 3 towns, driven by our continued efforts to scale up acquisition, seasonal demand and driving organic growth by leveraging the RedBus user base. As a result, we continue to gain market share in train bookings on the back of all our three brands. Leveraging on the strength of our extensive inventory, we launched a connected travel feature for users to discover confirmed travel options through bus and rail combinations on routes that have lower availability or lesser frequency of trains. Let me now share some details on our brand campaigns during this high season quarter. We leveraged the ICC World Cup, which was held in India, with multiple brand campaigns to build and maintain top-of-the-mind recall and showcase our value proposition to our existing and potential customers. During the quarter, MakeMyTrip launched campaigns around hotels and homestays, while Goibibo launched its campaign with Kareena Kapoor, a well-known Bollywood celebrity, as brand ambassador. During the quarter, we also integrated BookMyForex product offerings on the MMT platform and launched a new brand campaign to drive Forex demand on our platforms. Our corporate travel business, via both our platforms, MyBiz and Quest2Travel, are scaling up steadily with every passing quarter. Our active SME corporate customers count on MyBiz is now over 56,000 and for Q2T, the active customer count has reached 334 large corporates. We continue to innovate our product offering based on customer feedback. We recently reimagined our MyBiz homepage, offering the corporates the capability to customize the homepage according to their preferences in terms of theme and layout. Additionally, we have now provided the option to users to enter their preferences in terms of seats and frequent flyer numbers, leading to greater personalization for corporate employees on the platform. We have also enhanced our workflow to include ground transport options in our corporate offerings. With this, let me now hand over the call to Mohit for the financial highlights of the quarter. Thank you.\nMohit Kabra: Thanks Rajesh, and hello everyone. During the first quarter of this fiscal year 2024, I had called out that while the pandemic is now well and truly behind us, the business is well positioned to leverage the investments made during the pandemic impacted years in key strategic areas such as building wider offering of travel and travel related services, driving supply side expansion and choices for our customers, and the technology investments in building efficiencies, improved personalization and curated platforms to scale new demand segments. It is heartening that these have helped us achieve multiple milestone numbers across financial and operating metrics such as gross bookings, revenues, and operating profits during this seasonally strong quarter. Gross bookings for the quarter grew by 21.7% year-on-year in constant currency terms to an all-time quarterly high of $2.1 billion compared to $1.7 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenue, as per IFRS, grew by 26.9% year-on-year in constant currency terms to $14.2 million from $170.5 million in the same quarter last year. EBITDA witnessed strong growth and has more than doubled to $29.4 million as compared to $14.3 million during the same quarter last year. Adjusted Operating Profit or Adjusted EBIT registered a growth of about 70% year-on-year and reached $33.4 million compared to $19.7 million in the same quarter last year. Adjusted Operating Margin for the business has expanded by about 50 basis points to 1.6% of gross bookings compared to about 1.1% during the same quarter last year. On an YTD basis as well, the adjusted operating margin stands at 1.55% versus 1.05% in the first three quarters of the previous year. Our air ticketing gross bookings for the quarter came in at $1.3 billion, witnessing a year-on-year growth of 19.8% in constant currency. Adjusted margin stood at about $79.2 million, registering a year-on-year growth of 14.2% in constant currency.  Take rates for the air ticketing business were in line at about 6.3% as mentioned by Rajesh. While the longer-term outlook for growth in the domestic aviation market is strong, with large aircraft outliers having been placed by the leading carriers, there are short term capacity headwinds given issues around supply and servicing of aircraft engines. We expect that these headwinds will start easing out by the next financial year. Gross bookings for the quarter for the hotels and packages segment came in at $559 million, witnessing a strong growth of 27% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Linked to seasonality and improved pricing, the adjusted margin growth came in much stronger at 38.8% year-on-year on constant currency terms and stood at $98.8 million during the quarter. Take rates for the quarter were in line at about 17.7% in this segment. We witnessed strong growth across both domestic and international destinations with our international hotel business surpassing the pre-pandemic peak. We continue to work on sharper targeting of various demand segments via a multi-platform approach, while also increasing the breadth of our offering through directly contracted hotels, both in the domestic as well as the international markets. This two-pronged approach is helping us drive strong growth in this business segment. In our bus ticketing business, gross bookings for the quarter stood at $269.8 million, growing at 20.3% year-on-year in constant currency terms. Adjusted margin stood at $26.9 million, registering a strong year-on-year growth of over 33.8% in constant currency. Take rates for the bus business again came in line at about 10% for the quarter. During this high season quarter, we invested behind our brand campaigns to drive top of mind recall for our brands, further thus helping us increase the mix of organic traffic. As a result, the marketing and sales promotion costs for the quarter came in slightly higher at 4.9% compared to the 4.6% in the previous low season quarter, but were lower than the 5.2% in the comparable quarter of last year. While the return on these brand campaigns tends to build over a longer duration, the initial response has been positive and should help us continue to target around 70% of our orders coming in from our existing customers or via repeat orders. All other costs were largely in line and we continue to drive year-on-year efficiencies in our fixed cost base. Another highlight of the quarter was our strong working capital management during peak seasonality. While the previous quarter had seen a deployment of about $12 million in working capital as we were getting into peak seasonality, we saw a much higher working capital release of about $35 million during this quarter. Accordingly, compared to the $37 million in cash operating profits for the quarter, the cash position has improved by almost $70 million over the previous quarter, taking our total cash position to about $608 million at the end of the quarter. During the last quarter, we announced the signing of the agreement to take a majority position in Savaari Car Rentals and I am happy to report that the transaction was concluded by early December. The teams are working on consolidating all the supply with Savaari and thereby driving efficiencies in supply acquisition and management. With this, we expect to drive much better efficiencies in our supply acquisition, facilitating the scaling up of our intercity cab business. We recently filed an intimation for our 2028 note holders on their right to tender the notes for repurchase at par by the company at the end of the third year of the notes as the terms and conditions of the indenture on 15 February 2024. We shall update the progress of the tender process in due course. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Vipul for Q&A.\nVipul Garg: Thanks Mohit. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Vijit Jain of Citi. Vijit, you may please ask your question now.\nVijit Jain: Thanks Vipul and congratulations on a terrific set of numbers yet again. My first question is, just looking at the hotels and packages business obviously has done really very well in the current quarter. I was wondering on two things. One, can you call out any specific benefits in terms of, either the average realizations per room night or in terms of your profitability that you had during this quarter because of both Cricket World Cup as well as other in general travel appetite. Is there anything, any special or any extraordinary gains that you had in this quarter from that side? And how should one think about pricing margins in this segment going forward? That's my first question.\nRajesh Magow: Yes, maybe I can take that Vijit and thank you. You're right. Hotel and packages growth. Given that this is also a season quarter and we had the demand momentum, especially after World Cup, it sort of picked up significantly because till the World Cup, it was sort of -- the focus was lot more while there were some gains for specific cities where India was featuring in terms of their World Cup games, but largely people were sort of focused on watching World Cup matches over the weekend. And therefore the first half of that quarter of this quarter, till the World Cup was relatively speaking, the seasonality momentum hadn't really picked up, but the moment World Cup was over, it sort of took off, and I guess sort of more than made up overall on a quarter basis. So overall seasonality momentum was, momentum was great. But specific to your question, was there anything extraordinary, I won't say there was anything extraordinary or temporary in nature. The mix, if you will see our overall mix of revenue on revenue basis contribution coming in from the hotel and packages has improved from 40% to 45% now, which is great. And that is on the back of the overall sort of mix changing. But from a demand in general standpoint, all segments actually that we saw demand going up and I guess additionally the emerging trend on homestays specifically has also started helping because that has added on one side a new set of supply and also new demand use cases that have also emerged off late, which has added momentum to the overall demand on the hotel and accommodation side and within packages. We saw outbound packages sort of coming back in this quarter with the bang as well. So I would say overall it's a bunch of factors, but lot more on the demand side and sort of all segments sort of rising, which is helping the overall hotel and packages business grown this quarter.\nVijit Jain: Rajesh, just staying on that hotels thing, do you have any comment to make on in general the demand and the supply situation, at least on the premium hotel or the branded hotel space in India? How do you think that evolving and do you think ADRs therefore remain resilient or even go up further from here? And a related question to that, do you think that is kind of, at least in that segment, impacting or bringing some shift over into the international outbound side from India. You did mention international outbound is doing very well. So I'm just wondering if you're seeing some kind of a shift there and how does that affect you in general?\nRajesh Magow: Yes. No, so I think it's a good question. So if you look at past couple of quarter’s data or more, and the ideas [ph.] on the premium segment, I would say even on the mid segment have been fairly robust. But I think we should never forget sort of factoring in the two years lull period where there was, thanks to COVID, there was no real price increase on the hotel side on all segments that had happened. So if you factor that in and adjust it to sort of overall cumulative inflation, normal inflation for last, I would say, say about three years, you would realize that the price increase is about 10%, which is fairly reasonable in my view. I don't see this sort of as an exceptional price increase, excepting for certain days where there will be exceptional demand over the long weekends, etcetera. That would always be the case because there will be more demand and less supply. And then because of that gap, there could be increase in prices, which to my mind is very normal, and that happens in any market. But otherwise, I think there is a certain degree of stability in pricing in terms of the new base that is setting in the market, and which I think is sustainable in an overall level. Now, outside of that, I think it will be a function of whether it will further increase from here or sort of sometimes in the market where in certain weeks, certain weekends, certain around the events, etcetera, the prices could go more or could go less will be a function of how much demand and how much, what's the sort of demand and supply gap equation that works out. But it's going to be a very normal sort of up and down that we would see. I think there is a new base that is set up where from a demand standpoint, we've seen, customers in general sort of upgrading on the back of, I think it's a behaviour change that we have noticed in terms of maybe taking more holidays or maybe spending more percentage of the available disposable income in consumers' pocket to experience travel, which means more demand in the market. So there is definitely more upside on the demand, which is helping. And therefore, and within that, I think it's also a behaviour of, upgrading from a particular segment to the next level and for a mid-segment to let's say a premium segment. And last point I would make on this also is that, it has also, specifically to premium segment, lot of the non-leisure travel events, like whether it is the corporate offsides or, specifically the mice activities or for that matter, weddings, that during the season, more and more you see the trend of these events happening in the hotels. And because of which, obviously, there is more demand relative to the historical period. And that's also sort of helping, sustaining the price levels that you would typically see or are seeing in the market. But I think all the factors will have to be brought together to analyse and jump to conclusion in terms of what kind of, whether this is sort of sustainable or not. In my view, there is at certain level that these are sustainable with plus minus 5% 10% up and down that will happen, which will be a function of regular demand and supply gap.\nVijit Jain: Got it, Rajesh. My last question, just on the international outbound from India, if you can give any colour on where you're seeing, in terms of channels, at least where you're seeing growth from, is it coming more in the packages side? Or because you also have direct, holiday booking feature available on your platform. And then there's the travel agent business also that you do. So I'm just wondering where do you see the most momentum overall? My question is more on the international outbound side, but maybe if the answer is relevant and domestic as well, you can answer that. Thank you.\nRajesh Magow: Sure. No, so the specifically on international travel, we have seen actually momentum on our business on packages side for sure. Like I was mentioning earlier, I think its part of the script as well. And because we were expecting, I mean, two quarters ago, the recovery on outbound was relatively slower. And we were expecting that to sort of pick up at some point, and it has picked up in this quarter. And that is on packages. It's also on international hotels. We have seen similarly for flights as well. And in fact, what also adds to this international travel momentum is the, as I was mentioning, even in this script, the announcement that happened on either the direct connectivity, solving for direct connectivity, like the three examples that I gave, and similarly for making the visa, easier and smoother and convenient for people. That definitely sort of helps because then there is a comparison point with the domestic, sort of comparable destination versus and short haul outbound destination and then you end up taking the call. And the fact that the outbound travel was slow, was a little sort of slow to pick it up and get back to pre-pandemic level. It has now reached to pre pandemic level because of demand coming back. In terms of channels, we see it, a large part of it is coming from our holiday’s packages business this quarter. Standalone bookings, not necessarily packages with respect to hotels or flights, our B2B channel also contributes. In fact, pleasantly surprised with the contribution coming in from there as well. Besides the B2C, which is the regular sort of channel which when we see the demand coming back on an overall platform in terms of traffic growth, all sort of products and services we have on our platform get benefited out of it.\nVijit Jain: Got it. Thanks, Rajesh. I'll jump back into the queue.\nVipul Garg: Thanks, Vijit. The next question is from the line of Sachin Salgaonkar of Bank of America. Sachin, you may please ask your question now.\nSachin Salgaonkar: Thanks, Vipul. Congrats again for a fantastic set of numbers. I have three questions. First question, just wanted to understand on pent up demand versus actually demand where consumers are traveling a bit more. And clearly when we look at this quarter numbers on a base of 36% growth, you guys are showing more like a 27% Yoyo growth. It does indicate that while the pent up demand is behind, the growth is strong. So the question out here is, and I know it's difficult for you guys and you guys don't give a guidance, but should general growth for the sector continue to remain strong in next 12 months to 18 months? And if you could help understand what are the, some of the drivers in terms of are Indians traveling a lot more than before or has something changed which is leading to that growth? And a related question is, of course, any color you could give in terms of how this upcoming quarter is trending, that would be helpful.\nRajesh Magow: Yes, Sachin, so thank you firstly, and I would actually say two factors. And I would stay away from saying whether it is 6 months or 12 months or 18 months, but two fundamental factors from an outlook standpoint, we feel clearly that seems to be happening and one is on the demand side and the second one is on just the overall improvement of the infrastructure. On the demand side from a consumer behavior standpoint, we certainly have seen now there is a pattern that is emerging where the frequency of breaks that the consumers were taking earlier is definitely going up. Point number one. Point number two, which to my mind is a fundamental change. Point number two is that we've also seen some new use cases that are sort of emerging which is also adding to the regular standard use cases for travel. So when I say use cases, it's effectively purpose for travel. So purpose for travel, for leisure, for pilgrimage, for visiting family, etcetera, was a standard purpose for travel or for work. But we have also seen now new use cases more and more emerging. And specifically in the echo space, we are seeing alternative accommodation, getting benefited out of it. Are the celebration use case of the milestone sort of celebration use case in the family with the friends, extended family, group travel, trying to celebrate, whether it's a birthday or an anniversary or some other family milestone and getting together and sort of doing the celebrations, etcetera, more than what used to happen in the past? So these are the two consumer demand side on the behavior, on the buying behavior of travel or spending more on travel experiences clearly are emerging that we can see. And on the other side, I would say from an overall outlook standpoint that the infrastructure improvement and the expansion is definitely going to add more because more and more we make it smoother, easier and convenient for the travellers and also develop infrastructure in the new destinations. We've started creating huge amount of awareness, for instance, of nearby destination to any key destination, and we've seen demand picking up on those destinations. Now, tomorrow, like I was just mentioning in the script, the spiritual tourism. Now if that picks up, let's say the Ayodhya event, which is likely to happen because there's also an infrastructure development that has happened in that city, I see no reason why people, more number of people would want to sort of travel and experience for some of these new destinations which they had not really explored in the past or the use case earlier was going for offering for prayers and sort of hardcore pilgrimage use case. It might just be an experience emerge into a new, sort of use case where people would want to go visit these destinations more for historical reasons, right. So, so I would say these are the two big factors that I think are more permanent in nature than temporary, as we've sort of seen the pattern emerging, and that should help the outlook or the growth outlook for travel and tourism industry going forward. So that that would be my take on it, Sachin.\nSachin Salgaonkar: Got it very clear, Rajesh. Second question, and it's just taking from where you left. Clearly, demand is good and some new cases are coming. So does that mean MakeMyTrip doesn't have to spend so much on marketing going ahead? And as a percentage of GMB, it could be much lower than, let's say, the earlier guided 5%?\nRajesh Magow: Go ahead, Mohit. Go ahead.\nMohit Kabra: Maybe I can take that. And we've largely remained, within the 5% kind of a guidance that we had rolled out, Sachin, through the year. And therefore, I believe that continues to hold good. I mean overall if you really see this quarter also, and generally, we tend to do this, if you look at historically also, during peak seasonality quarters, like Q1 and Q3, we generally tend to kind of, spend a little more on the brand marketing side, and which is what we have seen even during this quarter. But even with that, the overall spends came in at about 4.9%. And still kind of, well below the 5.3% in the same quarter previous year. So I guess the 5% kind of a ballpark number should be a good number to kind of keep in mind, at least for this year. And we'll continue to see if we can kind of keep building efficiencies, some efficiencies with the scale in the coming years as well.\nSachin Salgaonkar: Got it Mohit, very clear. And my last question, and anecdotally, I'm sure you guys also want to seeing it, there is generally also a school of thought is coming that travel, traveling around is becoming expensive in India. For example, in New Year traveling to Goa was a bit more expensive than let's say going towards Thailand or Bali. Is that something a risk what you guys are seeing, which could potentially impact some demand? And how do you guys, think in that direction?\nRajesh Magow: I would say Sachin, I think we should see this scenario more from a healthy competition between the destinations. Now, whether it is going to be a domestic market destination or an international market or comparable to domestic destination for that matter, are in the peak period, I don't think this will have an impact on demand. It would, it would actually in turn mean that, there will be healthy competition between the markets. And from that point of view, because I don't think that's going to impact the travel demand. Because if let's say all three, hypothetically, comparable destinations are pretty expensive, then people will still travel, but they might go to a, their plan B destination, but it may not mean that they would not travel. So I don't see that scenario happening given at least based on whatever patterns that that we've seen in emerging, and which therefore would mean is that, every in the ecosystem, people would start to sort of look at specific markets would start to look at all the data and accordingly price their products, rather than, sort of taking one destination as a threat to the other. I think that is what is likely to happen, rather than overall, because it's expensive, and therefore I would not really travel.\nSachin Salgaonkar: Very clear, Rajesh. Thank you and all the best.\nRajesh Magow: Thank you. Thank you, Sachin.\nVipul Garg: Thanks, Sachin. The next question is from the line of Aditya Suresh of Macquarie. Aditya, you may please ask your question now.\nAditya Suresh: Hi, thank you so much. I have a few questions. The first one was on the B2B PC, you spoke a lot about on the B2C side, but on the B2B segment, you've seemed to have kind of scaled that have a partnership with Zoho as well. Rajesh, would you mind kind of giving us an update here on that segment and what that may mean for, whether that be growth or kind of the impact on working capital and the likes? I'll be really curious to understand that. Thank you.\nRajesh Magow: Yes, sure, Aditya. No, I think it's a good question. And I think we gave a couple of data points to give an indication of how our corporate business is growing. And just from an outlook standpoint, I do see, there is headroom for growth there. There's actually good headroom for growth there. And the way we, our product has been sort of recognized in the market, for whatever it's worth, just from a voice of customer standpoint, we feel very confident that this definitely is going to add more and more sort of growth revenues for us both in the small and medium enterprises as well as in the large enterprises for both the platforms that we have, whether it is MyBiz or Quest2travel. And the other point I would also make is that what we are trying to do on the product side, just enhance, just continue to keep enhancing the experience significantly just based on feedback, keep sort of adding more features for our B2B customers, which is a delightful experience for them. And basis that we have our retention rate which is like benchmarked with the world class B2B outfit already. And we'll continue to keep doing that on two counts. One, adding more products and more use cases so that it becomes a one stop platform for the corporate. And the second is like the way conceptually we do personalization on B2C, use that concept to actually do a personalized customer experience for the corporate travellers, which would be very different than B2C because the behavior when you buy your own travel for your personal purpose is very different than what you end up doing it as part of your work trip on any of the corporate booking platform. And we have great insights on that and we are focusing on that and just enhancing the customer experience significantly to make it very smooth and easier for the corporate travellers. So on those two areas, we've been working very hard and we continue to keep sort of rolling out new features. So therefore, looking at the growth that we already have, the acquisition engine that has already been established, and how the wallet share is sort of increasing and the fact that our product will continue to keep improving to become world class, I definitely believe there is a lot of headroom for growth for us in the B2B segment.\nMohit Kabra: To your other part, which is on the working capital, capital and the overall margins on the B2B side, the way we've kind of put these platforms in place, we're kind of significantly leveraging technology, particularly the core B2B, which is the corporate driven platforms, because the other platforms, which are the ones which are powering the small travel agents or say the affiliates, those are more extension of the B2C platforms, right, B2BC kind of a platforms. And on these corporate platforms, I think we're kind of seeing that we are kind of gaining very good traction both with the small and medium enterprises as well as with the large corporates. So growth is coming in good. From an opportunity sizing point of view, like we have said, at least one fourth, if not one third of the market would be kind of largely business driven or corporate travel demand. And therefore, there is a long or big headroom to kind of keep making gains in this area. And with the unit economics kind of addressed to kind of meet B2C like kind of net margins, growth should come in kind of accretive both at the top line and the bottom line. And on the working capital side as well, we don't really kind of deploy working capital on the B2B side because like I said, these are largely kind of pay and kind of transact kind of setups that we have created without having to invest significantly in working capital for getting B2B businesses.\nAditya Suresh: Thanks. The second question I had was more on the outbound opportunity, right? Now you spoke a lot about the connections and the new routes and a few use cases. But Rajesh, should be great if you can maybe frame that opportunity for us. So in broad terms, how should we think about the scale of this opportunity, even if it's over the next, say, 2 to 3 years compared to where our domestic businesses are, because I think a lot of our modeling, etcetera, is focused mainly on the India domestic piece. And so I'm really curious to see how you're thinking about scale of international outbound.\nRajesh Magow: Yes. Aditya as I was alluding to earlier, it is -- if you look at it from a little midterm to long-term perspective, the outlook is actually quite positive for outbound. And the fundamental sort of underneath point for that is all what you have to look at it is the airlines, all the airlines orders that have been placed bringing in new fleet into the market, given the next, say, next 3 years or 5 years, or more and then some record orders have been placed already, as you know, a significant chunk of that is also going to get deployed in the -- to open up some of the foreign destinations for them or to grow the foreign destinations for them. So I think that is one data point which is important. And if you -- from a demand standpoint, as I was making the point earlier, on an overall demand standpoint, I definitely see from, let's say, a middle class to the upper middle class to HNIs, the ways of per capita income or the disposable income growing in the country, that's definitely going to be the other driving force for sort of demand to go up for the outbound destinations. And there are, by the way, some third-party reports, and maybe we can take this offline and you can look at some of those specific reports on outbound specifically from CAPA, for example. I don't know if you have seen it or not. I mean, that independent research has also captured many data points to make this point, and they have tried to sort of size the overall opportunity in the next 3 years to 5 years as well. In fact, headlined it as outbound could be the new domestic for the next 3 years to 5 years as well. And it's quite neutral and credible sort of research report, and maybe you should look at that and maybe form your own view on top of that. But in terms of just the drivers for this, these would be the two drivers, and we'll be happy to share the report if you want offline.\nAditya Suresh: Thank you so much Rajesh. And I guess the final piece for me was, I guess, as finally, the platform is kind of reach a scale, you see that the kind of after kind of come through with the cost discipline. Industry structure is kind of a bit more favourable compared to previously discretionary rising, all those kind of demographic dynamics are playing out here. Plus, there's cost of discipline. So a specific question for you is about -- and also given the fact that you kind of cashed up, the platform is generating free cash flow. I guess specific question to you is what worries you? Like what are some of the things which you're guarding against as you kind of plan the business in the next 6, 12 months?\nRajesh Magow: An interesting question, Aditya. I guess the worry is in this business, as we've seen in the past, is more the macro than the micro. So we would always sort of wish like some time back, the new variant of COVID, the murmurs had started, and that definitely causes concern as we know happened during COVID, etcetera. And so fundamental structure overall, as you rightly mentioned and articulated, seems to be well in place now, poised for a new level of growth, etcetera, both on the demand side, supply side, everyone is an investment loan, infrastructure improving, all of that is great. You don't really want any disruptive macro event happening. It's neither you nor I can or anyone, for that matter, can control. But if there is one disruption that we've seen over the last, let's say, over two decades that we've been in the business, it is the macro events that sort of caused a concern over in the whole industry's mind, if you will, than your own sort of micro issues or items. So operationally, within the organization, we feel much better and confident, well poised. Not to say that the eyes have to be taken off from an execution standpoint relentlessly because this business is also about -- a lot of it is also about consistent and relentless execution as well. But that we feel better and confident and given the track record, we'll be at it. But if there is one thing that would -- I have to call out as potential concern or worry area would only be any of the macro events. So if we have a smooth run on that, I think industry is definitely poised for better times in the coming years.\nAditya Suresh: Thanks Rajesh. All the best.\nRajesh Magow: Thank you.\nVipul Garg: Thanks, Aditya. The next question is from the line of Manish Adukia of Goldman Sachs. Manish, you may please ask your question now.\nManish Adukia: Yes. Thanks Vipul. Hi, good evening. Thank you so much for taking my question. Just picking up the concession from where Aditya left. When you think about in the last two years, right, the single biggest driver of your profitability has been the fact that marketing promotion spends have come down quite dramatically. And even from an outsider's perspective, it seems like the market is fairly competitive with a number of players. Your numbers suggest that competition is relatively low, at least lower versus what it used to be pre-pandemic. One, in your view, why is competition low? And a related question what may need to change? Or what could potentially change for competitive intensity to go up again, let's say, next one or two years. Your thoughts, please?\nRajesh Magow: Right, Manish. Again, a very interesting question. You know what, the way I would address this, Manish, is not specific to, let's say, MakeMyTrip or within travel. I think this is a very welcome change in the ecosystem overall. The competition is still there, as you ready pointed out. It's not that competition will never stop and healthy competition is always welcome. What has changed within that competition, it is not necessarily super disruptive or just super aggressive for the sake of being aggressive. And now within competition, everybody is sort of also focused on profitability at the end of the day in the entire Internet ecosystem. To my mind, it's a very, very welcome chain for the entire Internet industry. Forget about travel tech industry for that matter. And that is what has happened. And the other aspect of this also, I believe, is which is, again, a fundamental ecosystem level change, is also the -- just the availability of capital. And from the investor side, I think everybody is sort of more cognizant of investing behind the right assets and the right areas. And that's the sort of guidance rather than just playing super aggressively with the sort of aggressive amount of capital push and trying to sort of win the market. And I think it's also to do with the learnings from the past, it’s also to do with how the market has evolved and people have also become a lot more knowledgeable of what works in the market and what doesn't really work in the market and what's sustainable, what is not sustainable in the market. So part of it, I will attribute it to the evolution of the market. So I think it has reached that stage where because it's been going on now for, I think, Internet industry in India is over 2 decades definitely old, if not a little bit more. And that is a good enough time for anyone to run the amount of capital that has got invested in this market is also huge. So -- and I think this response is the answer to your second question as well, that what would change for it to go back to again sort of same high-end density competition, etcetera. I actually think, given the fact this is far more and part of it could be wishful thinking as well, but bear with me for that. But I do think, given the fact that the market overall is relatively evolved and matured and the entire ecosystem has a tremendous amount of learning at every stakeholder level, for it to go back to the same super aggression in the market for the sake of being aggressive, I'm not sure. I mean the likelihood of that, who knows for future, but likelihood of that might be, relatively speaking, much less than what I would have said maybe 10 years ago.\nManish Adukia: Thank you Rajesh. That makes a lot of sense. My second question, how should we think about the operating leverage in the business? I mean, you're growing top line north of 20% right now. And let's assume that your marketing promotion intensity stays in the same ballpark. Some of the other expenses, employee costs, outsourcing, etcetera, how should we think about what, let's say, the right growth number for that could be in the next, let's say, 2 or 3 years. Rajesh or Mohit, your thoughts there?\nMohit Kabra: Yes, sure. Kind of the way we are looking at operating leverage being continuously driven is that we have seen a good amount of improvement at the net level coming in over the last few years, and we want to kind of maintain that moment down, but we also want to kind of make sure that we are kind of more and more skewing towards growth and kind of not necessarily kind of trying to optimize only on driving profitability improvement. So I think the medium term kind of the next 2, 3 years kind of an approach would be to try and see if we can take this close to 15% on adjusted margin or, say, 1.5% of gross bookings in adjusted operating margins that we have, more closer to, say, about 1.8% to 2% of gross bookings. I think that would be a very healthy kind of adjusted operating profit margin level to kind of maintain, and that would be the endeavor to kind of see coming in as an improvement over the next 2 to 3 years.\nManish Adukia: Thank you. Last question on use of cash. So the buyback amount that you've carved out, $136 million, well understood and thank you again for sighting that. But when you think about the business, I mean, this quarter alone, $37 million of cash EBITDA annualized close to $115 million, and that number is only growing. So -- and then you have $600 million plus of cash in the book. So like when you think about a steady return to shareholders, I mean, could buybacks become like an annual affair in the business? Because from what I recall last you mentioned that there are not too many meaningful M&A opportunities out there. So how do you think about this growing cash balance and uses of cash as you go along next 2, 3 years? Thank you.\nMohit Kabra: Sure, Manish. Clearly, the first priority would be to kind of keep looking for inorganic as well as organic investment opportunities in the business. But beyond that, and clearly, like you called out, we have now close to $600 million in terms of cash and cash equivalents, and that is a large balance to have. And therefore, we have been calling out that we do believe that we kind of feel actively look at buybacks as an option to kind of exercise in the years to come. Like we have also kind of intimated this quarter, we have kind of put in the intimation on the 2028 note holders because there's a put option that is kind of coming up in the next month. And as we had called out in the previous earnings call [ph.] that we would want to kind of see through this put option date. And by then, we would also be kind of close to the end of this fiscal year. And therefore, from next fiscal year onwards, we would want to kind of possibly dip in into the into the buyback plan or the share repurchase plan in the right earnest. The quantum in size, again, would depend upon the market and the timing around it. But yes, this is one potential avenue of deployment of the cash.\nManish Adukia: Thanks so much for taking my questions. All the best.\nMohit Kabra: Thanks Manish.\nVipul Garg: Thanks, Manish. We are almost out of time, and we will take one last question for now from the line of Gaurav Rateria of Morgan Stanley. Gaurav, you may please ask your question now.\nGaurav Rateria: Hi, am I audible?\nVipul Garg: Yes, yes please go ahead. So thanks for taking my question. The first question actually is on the -- if you can elaborate on the short-term impact on air business that you talked about in the near term? And also you talked about things easing out from next fiscal year. Is it likely to be more like a second half? Or you think immediately in the first half, which are things will ease out based on the plans that you see for the airlines?\nRajesh Magow: I think, Gaurav, it's going to be every quarter some improvement. I don't think it's going to be second half more than first half. I think we'll see some improvement happening first half based on the plan that we see because that is practically every month, there are more planes coming and there is wet lease sort of options being explored, etcetera. But we'll see improvement pretty much now that the improvement could be small in the first quarter and the second quarter, it could be higher, etcetera, but that would be a matter of detailing. But we'll see improvement pretty much every quarter.\nGaurav Rateria: So fair to say that it kind of bottoms out from the supply issues perspective in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. And from there on, every subsequent quarter, there is an actually improvement?\nRajesh Magow: I think that will be fair to assume, yes. I mean all things being equal, right? I mean there should not be any new development. But all things being equal as of today, I think that will be a fair statement to make.\nGaurav Rateria: Got it. My second question is on the volume growth in the hotel and package segment. It's pretty strong on the back of strong last year. But let's say, on a steady state, given where we are in the online penetration journey, how should one think about this volume growth? Is it like going to be more like in teens? Is it something that can actually be 20s. Just trying to understand where we are in the journey of online penetration? And what is the scope headroom for growth from next 2 to 3-year perspective?\nRajesh Magow: So let me try and address, Gaurav, this one rather than just specifically calling out a number because you'll see how it goes. But from a penetration standpoint, relative to the flights market, clearly, it is -- there's much more headroom there, especially when you add homestays category also, which is an emerging category and adding more supply by the month. It becomes even more fragmented and the online penetration for that category is also low in relative terms. So I would say all things considered, even if we assume like a 20% online penetration or thereabout as compared to 65 odd percent penetration for domestic flights, there is obviously a significant headroom. And I'm saying even if you don't want to consider it going all the way and we look at global benchmarks, the next milestone number for online penetration for hotels and accommodation overall would be 40% at least because that has been the, in many markets, it got to about 40% world markets in the western side that I'm talking about, 40%. It's just that relative to the transport, it always has taken in every market, relatively speaking, a little bit more time than the transport because there are transport actually, because of the fact that it's very unidimensional product, it moves really quickly online. Railways is a good example of that versus a good example of that and domestic rights for that matter. Wherever there is more involved purchase, experiences and fragmented market on the supply side, it just takes more time for it to move online completely. So from that perspective, I think we should probably see it, let's say, if the overall travel and tourism market annually is going to grow at the double-digit growth rate, anywhere, if I look at some of the third-party reports, it talks about 10% to 12%, I think we should think about online growth more in terms of like, say, 1.5 to 2x kind of a range of the overall industry growth just as a thumb rule and then see how the demand patterns emerge in the quarter and basis which we can sort of form of you.\nGaurav Rateria: Great. That's really helpful. And last question, I think you made a very significant product enhancement and you have been highlighting every single quarter. How easy or difficult it is for competition to replicate that? And have you seen them actually even replicating or this is something that kind of stands apart for us and kind of creates a competitive advantage for us? Thank you.\nRajesh Magow: I would like to believe on an overall basis and on a continuous basis, it's not necessarily a one-quarter thing. It is actually if there is one sort of at the core DNA of the company is continuously keep improving the customer journey, continuously keep improving the customer experience end-to-end, whether it is pre-booking experience or a post sales experience and so on. And come up -- keep coming up with and some of the features we've called out an industry first. And on the back of leveraging the huge sort of data that we have, which probably is uncomparable to anyone else in terms of how much more do we have versus any of the other players in the market. So that gives you an inherent sort of advantage for us to be able to build on top of that very innovative features. And there are many, whether it's a trip guarantee or a fare lock or a zero cancellation or book at zero for tiles [ph]. And not to forget that AI led some of the innovation that we've already done for our hotels reviews. And there are more -- there's more work on a continuous basis happening on that front as well just to continuously keep improving the overall customer journey. And given that we are in a B2C business and the future will always be out there, and so theoretically, it can get copied. But I think some of these inherent advantages that we have and the fact that the at the core of our sort of belief and a very core part of our strategy is to continuously keep enhancing the experience and keep it cutting edge almost all the way, all the time, will always be some competitive advantage for us, I would have thought.\nGaurav Rateria: Okay, perfect. Thank you and all the best.\nRajesh Magow: Thank you.\nVipul Garg: Thank you, Gaurav. As we are out of time already, we'll not be able to take any more questions. Anyone whose question are unanswered, we can take them offline. That will bring us to the end of the call. Over to you, Rajesh, for your closing remarks.\nRajesh Magow: Yes. Thank you, Vipul, and thank you, everyone. Thank you, everyone, for your patience. Thank you, everyone, for your time and look forward to seeing you next quarter. Thank you.\nMohit Kabra: Thank you.\nVipul Garg: Thank you, Rajesh. You may please disconnect. Thank you."

Copies of these filings are available from SEC or from the company's Investor Relations Department. I would like to now turn the call over to Rajesh. Over to you, Rajesh.\nRajesh Magow: Thank you, Vipul. Welcome, everyone, to our second quarter call of fiscal 2024. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong operating performance, where we maintained strong momentum, both in terms of top line and bottom line growth year-on-year. Gross bookings for the quarter reached $1.8 billion, growing at 23.8% year-on-year in constant currency terms, while our adjusted operating profit, or adjusted EBIT, grew by 87% year-on-year to $28.2 million as compared to $15.5 million in the same quarter last year. We delivered this performance despite a short-term supply contraction, challenged during the quarter and the temporary hit on demand due to unprecedented monsoon rains in some parts of the country. As for the macro outlook, India is expected to be one of the fastest-growing large economies in the future, leading to a gradual increase in GDP per capita and a larger allocation towards discretionary spending, of which travel and experiences will garner a major share. According to the latest report by McKinsey, India is poised to witness one of the most rapid increases in travel expenditures among the world's top 10 countries from a travel spending figure of $150 billion in 2019. Travel expenditures are anticipated to reach [$410 million], making India the fourth largest global spender on travel by 2030. On the other hand, according to WTTC, travel and tourism sector contributed 7.6% to the global GDP in 2022. While in India, it accounted for 4.5% of the GDP, reflecting a huge headroom for growth. The contribution of travel and tourism industry to India's economy is growing steadily, generating substantial revenue and employment opportunities across various sectors, including hospitality, transportation and local businesses. We expect travel and tourism in India to grow faster than the overall GDP during the next decade, which should act as a tailwind for the overall industry. A large part of this growth will be led by the aviation and accommodation sector. This is corroborated by the fact that all major airlines have placed a record number of orders for new planes and all major hotel chains have announced the addition of new properties, which will help in supply expansion for many years to come. Homestay supply is also growing in the country with people investing in secondary homes to be used as homestays in key leisure destinations in the country. According to government of India forecast, the current 145 million air passengers in India are projected to rise to 425 million by 2025. That's driving growth for overall travel and tourism sector. While the air industry is facing short-term headwinds on supply due to engine repair issues, supply addition projections looking good, indicating that the supply situation will improve in the coming quarters. We continue to stay excited about future opportunities and aim to further consolidate our position as a leading travel services company in the country on the back of our innovative travel solutions, brand strength and ability to deliver superior value to our customers and our partners. We've been working towards building a platform for the future. During the quarter, we introduced a fresh version of our homepage to bring out our new design language and iconography to meet the discovery and buying experience more intuitive and delightful. I'm also delighted to share that MakeMyTrip is now GDPR compliant, thus making it accessible from regions where GDPR is applicable. This will help us cater to some of the inbound demand, especially from the Indian diaspora. As for business segments now, starting with the air business, while domestic air ticketing had recovered a few quarters back and continues to grow well, this quarter, our international air ticketing business surpassed the pre-pandemic levels for the first time, which is encouraging. All short-haul destinations have either grown beyond or recovered to pre-pandemic levels now, and travel to long-haul destination is also recovering rapidly now. We continue to innovate and add new features to our products to deliver better value to our customers. During the quarter, we went live with our hold booking initiative, wherein on selected international flights, customers can hold their seats until the end of the day giving them time to decide without worrying about prices and availability. We also launched a quick checkout flow on our existing QuickBook feature, enabling customers to see the payment options on the review page itself to make the booking faster for our frequent flyer customers. We also revamped Goibibo's flight search results page, baggage and cancellation rules on the itinerary page to aid faster information, assimilation and flight selection helping us improve conversion. Our accommodation business, which includes hotels, homestays and packages, witnessed strong year-on-year growth on the back of increased supply, improved discovery and deeper penetration beyond metros and Tier 1 and Tier 2 towns. We continue to expand our supply deeper into the country. We now have 77,000 plus properties listed on our platform, covering 2,075 cities across India, further strengthening our supply moat. Along with the supply, we continue to expand our distribution channels as part of our strategy to drive online penetration further. We went live with our hotel product on IRCTC website during the quarter, and the initial response is encouraging. Through IRCTC and our myBiz platform, we are now getting new users from new smaller cities for leisure and business travel. International room nights growth picked up strongly this quarter as well, while the domestic accommodation business continued to perform well. With the introduction of new direct flights, we witnessed travel pick up in new destinations like Tashkent, Almaty and Baku, while other key destinations in the Middle East and Southeast Asia continue to be the popular among Indians. Learning from valuable stay-related feedback and inputs from our customers, we have enhanced our quality checks to highlight alerts for our customers about properties consistently defaulting on service levels on one hand. And on the other, we work closely with the partner and push them to improve the stay experience. We have observed that most of our partners take the feedback seriously and take corrective actions. Our homestays business continues to grow with increasing coverage of destinations. During the quarter, we expanded our supply across the country, including World Cup venues. During the quarter, we added about 8,000 properties to our homestay inventory, out of which about 1,500 properties were added specifically in World Cup venues. The contribution of homestays to the overall bookings is steadily increasing, and we believe that this category will drive future growth. Our holiday packages business continues to scale on the back of our expanded offerings. During the quarter, we launched holiday packages with homestays as an accommodation option, which is the first in the industry. We have now started to offer -- we've now started to also offer charter train packagings, catering to religious tourism demand. Our footprint in the holiday packages business has now expanded to 555 domestic cities versus a peak of 405 cities in the past. On the international package side, we sold holiday packages to 66 countries during Q2, which is the best number achieved so far. Our Bus Ticketing business sustained the growth momentum in Q2 despite a seasonally weak quarter as more and more corporates, especially in the IT sector, are mandating work from office, the traditionally large bus markets in South India are witnessing good recovery. This increase in demand along with the improvements in bus operator finances is resulting in the addition of new buses, which bodes well for our business. In Q2, the inventory of UPSRTC was integrated into the platform. This makes redBus the first private ticketing platform ahead of the festival to host UPSRTC's inventory. This will help improve the new customer acquisition rate in North India. We are making good progress on our journey with generative AI-powered features on our platform. Our user review section now has summary results leveraging generative AI and harnessing our extensive repository of user-generated content. The summary results enable customers to swiftly identify suitable properties and provide instant insights to each property's offerings. This feature has further improved the user experience in the property selection process. Similarly, in our bus business, we've deployed a voice-based bot for solving customer queries before bus departure. Ground transport business is a parallel growth opportunity for us -- is a potential growth opportunity, I beg your pardon, for us. We are already have a leading position in the bus market. In addition, we've been making organic investments in expanding our user base via rail bookings. We started our cab business with airport transfers and are gradually scaling intercity travel use case by cabs. Currently, intercity cabs is a highly unorganized and fragmented market and with road infrastructure improving in the country, it presents a good future growth opportunity. So we have decided to strengthen this line of our business further with an inorganic investment in a well-known intercity cab company called Savaari. Mohit will share full details in his section. For all our product offerings, our direct B2C platform continues to be the leader in India in terms of active users, number of transactions and reach, while our new channels are also gaining traction. MyPartner, which is our B2B2C platform for small travel agents, now has 40,000 plus travel agents and expanding every quarter with a very healthy repeat transaction rate. Our corporate travel business for both our platforms, myBiz and Quest2Travel is gradually becoming meaningful. Our active customer count on myBiz is now 55,000 plus. And for Q2T, active customer count has reached 297 with strong additions every quarter. Both our corporate platforms are focused on building a holistic tech solution, wherein companies can seamlessly set policies, report without manual hassle and sync with their ERP and HRMS systems, allowing the employees to handle their bookings for themselves without diluting the experience. MyBiz has been getting recognition from the industry forums as well, recently has been ranked at the top in travel and expense management for APAC, marketing G2's fall report 2023. This is the third consecutive category recognition for myBiz. With this, let me now hand over the call to Mohit for the financial highlights of the quarter.\nMohit Kabra: Thanks, Rajesh. We have delivered robust operating performance this quarter, with a strong year-on-year growth in gross bookings, revenue and adjusted operating profit in line with our stated strategy of profitable growth. Demand for travel remained robust on the back of positive consumer sentiment, helping us deliver gross bookings to the tune of $1.8 billion during the second quarter of fiscal year '23, '24, witnessing a year-on-year growth of 23.8% in constant currency norms. Aided by strong operating leverage, the adjusted operating profit grew by over 87% year-on-year from $15.1 million in same quarter last year to about $28.2 million in this quarter translating to an increase of about $13.1 million in absolute terms. The adjusted operating profit stood at about 1.5% of gross bookings during the quarter, which is in line with the previously reported quarter of the current fiscal year and almost a 50% improvement from the 1% levels reported in the same quarter last year. Our air ticketing gross bookings for the quarter came in at about $1.2 billion, witnessing a year-on-year growth of 20.8% in constant currency terms. Adjusted margin stood at about $80.2 million, registering a year-on-year growth of 10.7% in constant currency. The take rate for margins for the air ticketing business were in line at about 6.8%. As mentioned by Rajesh, while the long-term outlook for growth in domestic civil aviation market is very strong with large aircraft orders being placed by the leading carriers, there are short-term capacity headwinds in view of issues around supply and servicing of aircraft engines as well as the suspension of operations by Go First Airlines. Based on the NCLT order in May '23 for the appointment of a resolution professional to operate Go First on a going concern basis, we had been optimistic of restoration of its operations. However, considering that now over 5.5 months have elapsed and there are ongoing legal challenges to the resumption, we have made a onetime provision of all the recoverable amounts towards deposits for ticket issuances, accrued incentives, taxes deducted or collected at source and recoverable from Go First during this quarter. As a result of this exceptional provision to the tune of about $10 million, the year-on-year increasing in the operating profit as per GAAP is about $2.8 million compared to about $13 million increase in adjusted operating profit, which is not impacted by this exceptional provision. We expect small capacity increases in the second half of the year, followed by normalized growth in the domestic civil aviation industry from the beginning of the next fiscal year. Gross bookings for the quarter for hotels and packages segment stood at about $432 million, witnessing a strong growth of 34.5% on a year-on-year basis in constant currency terms. Adjusted margin for our hotels and packages business stood at about $75.7 million during the quarter, witnessing a year-on-year growth of about 36% in constant currency terms. Margins for this segment also came in line at about 17.5%. In our bus ticketing business, gross bookings for the quarter came in at $219.7 million, growing at a year-on-year basis of 21.2% in constant currency terms. Adjusted margin stood at $21.8 million, registering a strong year-on-year growth of about 34% in constant currency terms. Margins for the bus business also came in at line at about 9.9% for the quarter. We continue to drive efficiency in our expenses and particularly so in our customer acquisition costs. Excellent top of mind recall of our brands has been driving a high mix of organic traffic for us. On top of that, almost 70% of the orders coming from our existing customers, helping us drive further cost efficiencies. Overall, marketing and sales promotion costs for the quarter came in at about 4.6% of gross bookings as compared to about 5.4% in the same quarter last year. With the COVID-19 pandemic behind us and almost every line of business having recovered to pre-pandemic levels or above, our focus is now on continuing to drive profitable growth. Our strong balance sheet with over $0.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents gives us the flexibility to pursue both organic and inorganic opportunities of driving supply or distribution side expansion. Across our portfolio of brands, we have built significant businesses in travel services, such as air ticketing, hotels and packages and bus ticketing. We have organically scaled up a variety of other travel service offerings such as airport transfers and rail ticketing for our customers. As part of our inorganic innovative, we had invested in BookMyForex, which is a well-known ForEx service provider in India. This investment helped us in strengthening the ForEx offerings for our customers, who book overseas travel services with us and opened up another growth opportunity for us. Along these lines, we are pleased to announce the signing up of a majority investment in Savaari Car Rentals Private Limited, which is a well-run intercity cab services company. We believe that while intracity cabs and local city buses fall under the day-to-day commute services, intercity cab services are akin to intercity bus services and, therefore, are a segment of opportunity for travel service providers like us. This is a segment with low online penetration, fragmented supply and lack of standardization in experience. We believe that there is an opportunity to transform this space with technology and offer a better value proposition, both for our suppliers as well as the customers in the years to come. The significant focus of the government of India in terms of improving the quality of highways, apart from adding to the highway infrastructure across the length and breadth of the country, can add further impetus to this segment. This investment, which is likely to be closed in the next 2 months, is intended to accelerate our plans of building a meaningful presence in the intercity cabs business or market in India. During the quarter, we also acquired the last tranche of equity from the founders of Quest2Travel, a company engaged in providing corporate travel services to large-sized corporates. We had acquired an initial majority stake in 2019 and have been increasing our holding over the years. And this final tranche marks the completion of the process with the acquisition of 100% ownership in Quest2Travel. We will continue to look for such inorganic investments to support our future growth initiatives as well. With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Vipul for Q&A.\nA - Vipul Garg: Thanks, Mohit. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from the line of Sachin Salgaonkar from Bank of America.\nSachin Salgaonkar: I have three questions. First, Mohit, again, I just wanted to clarify regarding this entire one-off. So basically, all the negative, which could be factored in is factored in, right? Ideally, we should not see any incremental one-offs coming from Go First in coming quarters.\nMohit Kabra: Yes, Sachin, that's right.\nSachin Salgaonkar: Got it. Second question, just on this entire capacity issues at airlines, again, one is a near-term perspective, which you guys said. But there is also a risk about the Pratt & Whitney Indigo engines continue to create a bit of an issue going into next year. So just wanted to understand where do you guys see this resolving and what kind of impact that could have, let's say, from a next 12- to 18-month perspective?\nRajesh Magow: Yes. And maybe Sachin, I can take that. No, I think it's a valid question. I guess, I was trying to sort of highlight that as a part of my script speech as well. So if there is this whole winter schedule that has been filed recently of any indication, that is actually quite encouraging, where there is a net addition. All factors are considered including the engine issue, there is an overall net addition to the supply of about 7%, 8%, so which will give you a sense of the fact that -- despite the fact that the Go First supply has been out of the market now for a while, and SpiceJet has also not necessarily been operating at 100% capacity, but both Indigo and Air India, including Air Express, Vistara, they've been adding more claims. And projections -- and because the orders have been placed for last now couple of quarters, the supply on an every month on a net-net -- on a net sort of addition basis is going to flow in every month pretty much. And that's the kind of projection that is already out there that has come from all the airlines together. So that gives you an indication that the things are going to ease out definitely in the coming quarters. And from a long-term outlook standpoint, to be honest, I don't really see an issue because, ultimately, all these problems are going to get resolved one way or the other. Either it is going to be -- the engine replacement that is going to fall in place slowly and gradually, or there are going to be other alternatives that are going to be available because the demand momentum from a long-term standpoint is clear based on various other sort of projections, if you see it more from a long-term standpoint, multiple sources. And operationally, all these -- I'm sure everyone is sort of working hard to find alternatives if there are any blockers that come along the way. So -- but we'll have to obviously watch the situation. But like I said, the next 6 months projections seem to be giving an indication that it's going to start improving overall situation.\nSachin Salgaonkar: Rajesh, in your opening remarks, you also commented about a bit of an issue on demand, especially given the harsh monsoon. I wanted to just understand how has been it progressing in the last few months given the fact there is a World Cup and we are heading into the Diwali season. Any general comments on early December bookings? Are we still seeing issues associated with demand or that started to reverse off?\nRajesh Magow: So Sachin, July, August, September, that specific monsoon-related issue was temporary and was confined to certain cities of the country, not necessarily across. And the demand overall sentiment remained positive. In fact, it was at its peak around August, September. In September, it was like all-time high. And for the current quarter, and as we know from the historical trends that October, November, December, again, is a high season quarter. But it's early days right now because it's just end of October. Of course, because of the World Cup, wherever specific where India was featuring as part of the games, in specific cities, we've seen bookings and actual transactions growing both for hotels and flights. But on an overall basis, the season will play out more in November. Historically, also it ends up sort of playing it and starting with third week of October, end of November and then goes into -- well into middle of December, which is yet to come. And so I guess it's overall early days for the quarter, but I don't see any reason why it will be any different.\nSachin Salgaonkar: Got it. And last question is on your margins. Great job guys in terms of holding up these margins well despite the negative operational leverage in the seasonally slower quarter. So the question out here is, is this the low selling and marketing below 5% of [GOV] is something which you guys see sustainable going ahead? And hence, there could be a bit of upside as to your medium-term margins?\nMohit Kabra: As far as the medium-term margins or the margins for this year are concerned, Sachin, like we had called out during the last call as well, we would like to kind of consolidate around the 1.5% of gross bookings level or at about mid-teens from an adjusted margin point of view. So this is where we would like to consolidate for the year. And on an annual basis, we'll continue to look at a small expansion in the coming years as well.\nVipul Garg: Next question in the line of Vijit Jain of Citi.\nVijit Jain: Congratulations, guys, on the great set of numbers. My question is just staying on the last point you made, Mohit, where are we in terms of budget hotel recovery in this quarter? I recall last quarter, you had mentioned 80%, 85% recovery. Where are we have -- has that moved up since? That's question number one. And I would like to understand if you have a -- if the reason why you believe these marketing costs can stay at these lower levels is because you can see the budget hotel segment completely recovering, and this is a new normal there as well.\nMohit Kabra: So on the recovery side, we continue to be around the 85%, 90% levels, Vijit, on the budget segment. And like we've been explaining, this is a segment which has seen a significant amount of pricing reset and, therefore, is kind of the recovery is slightly lower than all the other price points. And -- which is kind of -- which is fine from an overall mix point of view, and we do believe that it's just a matter of time before even this segment kind of gets back to pre-pandemic levels and above. So just an extended period for that to play out, considering the amount of price sensitivity, that kind of the segment witnesses. On the margin expansion side, like we've said this year, we have already kind of significantly optimized our overall operating cost, including the customer acquisition costs and have seen a decent amount of uptick compared to the last year. And therefore, like I said, we would like to consolidate around these levels. The reason we believe if at all, the margin -- the customer acquisition costs are likely to go up, this will be in line with our -- any changes that would happen on the mix side. So say, for instance, pre-COVID, we have seen hotels and packages kind of contributing for almost like up to 50% of the mix. Right now, we are seeing hotels and packages contributing to about 40% of the mix. And therefore, if the mix kind of moves more and more in favor of hotels and packages over a period of time, where it is likely to, in that case, we could see a improvement coming through in the blended take rates and also a little bit of increase coming in, in the overall customer acquisition costs. But other than that, we do believe we are kind of in a regime of at least for the shorter term or medium term in a regime of kind of stable margins as well as stable customer acquisition costs.\nRajesh Magow: Sorry, Mohit, if I may just add one more important point, Vijit, a few tips on the budget segment very quickly. Just to put things in perspective, I think it's an important one. So like Mohit explained that it is effectively the budget segment and solely in gradual recovery because the price point had changed and then the market is taking a little bit more time to sort of adjust to that. But within that, the recovery for any price point more than equivalent to INR 1,000 a room night or more than INR 1,000 a room night, the recovery is already there at the pre-pandemic level. In fact, the year-on-year growth numbers are also robust at about 115%, like about 15% growth rate, achievement is about 115% as compared to pre-pandemic. So the only segment that might be a little bit behind is less than INR 1,000, which is effectively $14 a room night. Now that was because of the historical reason. It has nothing to do with now demand not coming back. It is only because it was exceptionally lower price historically during pre-pandemic because of higher sort of aggressive push to sort of get that segment going very aggressively on the price points. So from that perspective, I think just on the overall recovery standpoint, from our point of view, all segments have recovered very, very well now.\nVijit Jain: Correct. Next question is just on the air ticketing side now. I know there's a little bit of mismatch in when you recognize these volumes and what we see in the DGCA data. But it looks like -- I mean, Q-o-Q DGCA data shows 2%, 3% decline, right, and your numbers are up. So is that international recovery here? Or is this just that mismatch that you were talking about? And a related question, if you can tell me what your market share in domestics is -- domestic air aviation is this quarter?\nMohit Kabra: Generally, I mean, it can be a bit of both. In fact, you typically do see bookings kind of holding strong, ahead of getting into the peak seasonality quarter because people tend to kind of [indiscernible] good pricing, which is available on advanced booking windows. So therefore, you could see a little bit of seasonality tweak happening on the book versus flown kind of reporting. And secondly, our international has been improving. In fact, actually, the mix of international has been kind of improving quarter-by-quarter. In fact, now we are pretty much back to pre-COVID kind of mix coming in from the international side, like we have been mentioning the recovery on international had been slower, but now pretty much kind of back to full recovery and the domestic versus international mix is pretty much restored now.\nVijit Jain: Got it. And Mohit, just your market share in the domestic side?\nMohit Kabra: Continues to be 30% plus.\nVijit Jain: 30% plus. Got it. My last question. If you can just tell me what the total investments in Quest2Travel and Savaari were in 2Q and in 3Q? And just on -- thoughts on the convertible buyback.\nMohit Kabra: Yes. See, Q2T, we've already kind of reported the numbers. And as far as Savaari is concerned, this again is going to be a small ticket kind of investment more in the less than $10 million kind of a range. And coming to kind of use of proceeds from a repurchase point of view, I mean, we haven't still been able to kind of get into any repurchases, particularly on the convertible bonds. They tend to be kind of there. The premium actually on the bonds has improved over the quarter. In fact, they are kind of trading at almost like double-digit premium, over 10% kind of a premium. And therefore, we haven't pursued any repurchases of these bonds. We do not expect any redemptions to come in because of the bonds already trading at a premium and the put option being in February, which is like about 4 months away. So that's where we are.\nVipul Garg: The next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria of Morgan Stanley.\nGaurav Rateria: So the first question is just trying to understand typically, in September quarter, what is the likely advanced bookings that you see for December quarter? And is this year something different because of the event of Cricket World Cup around? Has the advanced booking been stronger than the usual September quarter that you see for the December quarter?\nRajesh Magow: Maybe I can take that, Gaurav. I won't say it is -- we have seen anything dramatically unusual, Gaurav, to be honest, only for certain pockets for certain dates for certain cities, thanks to this whole World Cup thing because of the sort of worry or concern around fares going up, et cetera. We've seen some sort of consumer -- different consumer behavior on advanced purchase side. But on an overall basis, nothing unusual. The only other thing that I would like, which is very interesting that we've been sort of noticing over the last, I would say, quarter or 2, and that is thanks to our Book at 0 product on the hotel side is -- and maybe to some extent as people have been sort of experiencing high rate, high fares now for some time because of the peak of demand, especially in the premium segment of hotels, there is some more awareness that is getting created in the marketplace in consumers' mind to plan their travel a little bit more in advance and book their travel more in advance. Book at 0 also gives you flexibility, specifically, I mean, this I'm talking about the hotel bookings. It also gives you flexibility on -- if you are sort of even on the edge planning for your trip, you can still go ahead and book it and then cancel it without any sort of hit on your pocket. So -- and that is also sort of shaping the consumer behavior to an extent. But future quarters, at least 3 or 4 quarters down the line will tell us whether there is any kind of a permanent shift on just the buying a bit of the Indian consumers or not, but not in this quarter. In the reported quarter, we didn't see anything unusual.\nGaurav Rateria: Got it. Very clear. Second question is around your investment thesis in the intercity cabs. If you could highlight some bits of what's the addressable market share? What's the current online penetration? And how you're thinking about this segment?\nMohit Kabra: Maybe I can share some color and Rajesh can add. So we've been identifying, like we have been calling out, ground transport overall has been an area of focus for the company. And as you know, we kind of have a leader in the bus ticketing space in terms of redBus, that brand kind of has a significant amount of leadership in the online bus ticketing space. And we have also dialed over the last couple of quarters. We have also been dialing up the entire rail ticket offering, trip info services, as that's another kind of very good source of customer acquisition. And we believe when it comes to non-flight transport, the customer has a very easy option to choose between bus tickets or choosing to kind of commute by bus or kind of travel by rail or travel through intercity cabs. So as a result, we've kind of been trying to dial up the service offerings on the rail ticket side as well as on the intercity cabs. Intercity cabs overall from a market sizing point of view, while there is no ready report, but our estimate is it would be close to about $3 billion kind of a market with very low online penetration. Online penetration is likely to be in the high single digits. So it's a pretty good opportunity to get into and a meaningful opportunity to get into. And more importantly, like we have been calling out with this entire focus that the government has been having on infrastructure building now, while the civil aviation market has been seeing the benefit of the significant expansion on the airport side, and also we've been seeing new kind of supply coming in, particularly on the private bus side with the significant amount of highways that are getting laid and kind of created across the length and breadth of the country. We believe intercity cabs market could also grow very significantly in view of this significant growth in the highway infrastructure. So that's been an area that we've been kind of eying for some time. Savaari has been an existing supplier on the platform. And therefore, we thought it would be a logical kind of investment to look at. And we are glad that we've been able to kind of that this transaction has worked out, and it will help us accelerate our plans on the intercity offering side. This is clearly a space where there is a significant amount of scope for creating a much better kind of aggregation of the supply side and also creating a much better kind of shopping experience for the customers as well. So we believe with our expertise on the various kind of travel services and the online dispensation, we should be able to create a meaningful kind of impact in the intercity cabs market as well.\nGaurav Rateria: Mohit, last question on the comments that you made around generative AI. So if I just look at how to think about the eventual outcome of early investment on the 3 factors: one, competition or your competitive moat; second, addressable market; and third, the efficiency that can help to lower your cost structure.\nRajesh Magow: It's a great question, Gaurav. In all 3, the sort of separate variables that we should look to see how this new technology is going to impact. See, it's going to be a long journey, by the way. And we've started, and we started looking at, in fact, looking at all 3 aspects. I think the first 2 will get reflected in either the overall online penetration increasing because the overall experience. See, ultimately, this technology is going to help us improve the customer experience on the platform, making it far more intuitive, making it far more easier, discovery can be a lot better, we can -- there are use cases that we are already working on. We've done soft launch as well. We can -- the intelligent bots can come up with an innovative vernacular based, voice-based interface as well, which would mean that it will sort of expand our reach to the smaller cities beyond the, let's say, top 20, 25 cities of the country. And all of that would mean effectively that on one side, the customer experience will continuously improve and people will feel more and more comfortable to come and buy online. And two, it will go beyond 25 cities as well, more and more and trying to obviously also resolve the language issue beyond English. Now this is the -- specifically the language issue to crack commerce on vernacular language is going to be a long journey. It is not necessarily going to be an overnight solution. But on the other side, on the experience side, we've already started getting some good feedback from customers that this feature is helping and that feature is helping. But I think this overall -- this new technology is definitely looking more promising. Now on the third side, on the efficiencies also, there are use cases identified already for at our end. And one of them is the post-sales experience that we are already looking at further right now or the 1.0 or maybe the 2.0 journey for post-sales experience customer -- from a customer journey perspective, was how do we sort of automate and make the transition from, let's say, contact center servicing to doing the self-service or self-help, most of the use cases that can be done on phone on a click of button, et cetera, which we achieved -- which we have achieved quite significantly with a lot of the share is now self-service. And I think the 3.0 is going to be now further in that journey. How could we, on one hand, either the sort of get some more productivity gains for the agents -- for the call center agents for the really sort of complex cases by providing a lot of the information or filtering a lot of the information using this technology, or we sort of look at gain introduction of bot at some level in the journey, which can filter the generic queries that come our way on the post-sales service queues. So that's one area that is work on, which will clearly give us more efficiencies. And of course, we'll also enhance the customer experience for the post-sales queries, et cetera. And on the other hand, I think there's going to be some low-hanging fruits also on the software development side, on the programming side for the engineers, where this technology, again, can be leveraged to look at the basic, the first level of programming queries, just to make life easier and efficient for the engineers at the sort of first level, which would help us get some productivity gains on that front as well. I would just say that the work on our side is actually on, on all fronts, but it is going to be a journey, and we will keep sort of working on use cases on one side, which will impact the customer. And on the other side, we will continue to keep focusing on wherever we can get some productivity gains internally.\nGaurav Rateria: Rajesh, just a clarification here in terms of what's our dependence on paid traffic? And do you think that dependence also can come down with this use of this technology?\nRajesh Magow: Right, that's an interesting one. Actually, we are already, Gaurav -- lot of our traffic is direct. So our dependence on paid traffic is relatively speaking low and on the back of brand that has been established, all our brands actually MakeMyTrip, redBus and Goibibo even from an OTA overall brand standpoint as compared to the rest of the market. And dependence is already low. There are areas that they're also -- specifically on search engine optimization, we've already seen some gains that we have -- I should have actually mentioned about that as well that we have a -- we have leveraged -- we have started to leverage this technology there as well. And that would help more conversion because SEO traffic is not necessarily a paid traffic. And we'll keep sort of learning more and keep looking at it and exploring more areas to see if there are any further gains even on this side can come from here, from leveraging this technology. But like I said, the dependence is already relative quite low, and it's an underpenetrated market overall, and we still need to have a healthy mix of new users coming in. And so therefore, do I really see immediate, immediate gains that -- material immediate gains that will come from this area? Perhaps not. Maybe it'll get balanced out because we will also continue to keep investing in getting some new users in.\nVipul Garg: The next question is from the line of Ashwin Mehta of AMBIT Capital.\nAshwin Mehta: Yes, Vipul, can you hear me?\nVipul Garg: Yes, we can.\nAshwin Mehta: Yes. Congrats on a good set of numbers. I had a question on the take rate. So we've seen bump-ups in terms of take rates in both air as well as hotels. And also in bus ticketing, we've seen stability on take rates at elevated levels versus historical. So what are the drivers for these take rate improvements? And how sustainable near term do you see these take rates to be?\nMohit Kabra: Ashwin, actually, the take rates across segments have been reasonably stable for us. I mean there is generally a little bit of variation linked to seasonality. So slightly lower seasonality quarters, like Q2 and Q4, you would possibly find the take rates to be slightly better compared to peak seasonality quarters of Q1 and Q3. I mean it comes in both from the fact that the suppliers are trying to kind of more and more promote to build load factors. And secondly, also the ASPs tend to be slightly lower compared to peak seasonality quarters and therefore optically also, the margins look slightly better in the weaker seasonality quarters. That possibly is the only reason. Otherwise, kind of like I called out, we're kind of seeing feasible kind of stability in the take rates by the business segment.\nAshwin Mehta: So Mohit, in terms of the stability that you are seeing on -- or the recovery that you are seeing on the budget hotel side, do you think the take rates have scope to go up from here because typically budget hotels are higher take rate properties?\nMohit Kabra: Pretty marginally, if at all, Ashwin, and likely to kind of remain around this range, 0.5 percentage point, plus or minus, but no significant changes are expected on the overall take rates.\nAshwin Mehta: And the second question was in terms of fees, we saw sequentially a reduction in terms of hotel and bus ticketing transactions. Now part of it is seasonality. But were there impacts of, say, floods, which were more accentuated in hotels or bus ticketing compared to air for us or would you say it was largely in line with expectations in terms of seasonality?\nMohit Kabra: Largely seasonality.\nRajesh Magow: No, it is seasonality only, Ashwin. And if you go back in history, you will see similar trends between air and hotels. The air has all the use cases. The seasonality is only about leisure segment and which is more sort of reflected always on the hotel business than the air business.\nAshwin Mehta: Okay. Got it. Fair enough. Congratulations and all the best.\nVipul Garg: We'll take the last question now from the line of Aditya Chandrasekar of UBS.\nAditya Chandrasekar: A couple of questions from my side. Firstly, I just wanted to understand your kind of risk assessment of SpiceJet. What are you seeing on the ground? And if it's possible, could you quantify your overall exposure to SpiceJet also similar to the -- I mean, equivalent to the $10 million provision you made for GoAir? That's the first question. And second question on the bus side. On a Y-o-Y basis, I think we are seeing growth kind of stabilized at around 17% in the last couple of quarters. Just wanted to understand your overall kind of outlook on this segment? Is it kind of stabilizing at these levels or penetrations kind of saturated in this segment and how we should look at this going ahead?\nRajesh Magow: And maybe I can take -- I can start with this and, Mohit, please feel free to add. Listen, Aditya, as far as SpiceJet is concerned, again, everything which is there, SpiceJet is a listed company, and whatever is there in the public domain is known to all of us and that we have been rating. Just from a day-to-day operations standpoint, we have only seen in the last -- especially in the last few weeks or a couple of months that the immediate -- the situation in terms of pressure on the cash flow, in terms of a couple of payments that they were supposed to be made, they were supposed to be doing basis the court orders and stuff like that. They have been honored actually already, a couple of them, which is a good sign. And in terms of actual departures also, contrary to what we might be thinking or generally building a perception, they're adding more planes, at least about 6 more planes that they are adding during this season quarter. So I guess we will have to just wait and watch how they operate. They have been so far able to sort of navigate the situation. I would say reasonably well, not to say that they're in a very good share because they are obviously not operating at 100% capacity today. From our point of view, we are keeping a close watch and continue to keep sort of monitoring day-to-day operations, seeing the -- how the schedules are being projected and then accordingly sort of operate from a day-to-day business standpoint with them. I don't think there is any sort of -- at any particular day, it will be fair for us to be able to start estimating the exposure at this point in time because from our point of view, we're just monitoring it and keeping it business as usual based on their volume of business with them. So I don't think that would be fair to sort of estimate at this point in time because there's no real indication of that sort at this point in time. I guess your second question was on the bus side. No, I don't think that it has reached a saturation level. I don't think the penetration has reached a saturation level yet. In fact, we've been talking about as part of our sort of quarterly commentary in the past as well. The next wave of growth in bus segment could -- is likely to come from 2 accounts. One, there are still underpenetrated regions, where even the private sector bus market is not necessarily very well penetrated in terms of supply coming online and the adoption from the consumers are buying online. The South and the West, for example, are -- have penetrated well and have grown and continue to keep growing. But on the north side, it is still underpenetrated and that is where our focus is. We are trying to sort of add more inventory, create more awareness and trying to see if we can just get some more next level of growth from those regions, including that is the second sort of area from where we expect the growth to come in is the nonprivate sector supply. Now that is completely underpenetrated and a huge amount of opportunity, equal the size of opportunity that the private sector bus space offer. And the beginning of that journey has started already coming out of pandemic. We started to get a lot of RTC's supply on digitized and on our platform. And we are making good progress on that. Now the question is to create more and more awareness and also expand our reach to get those consumers who have been traveling through RTC buses also buy online. I think that is where our focus is, both these areas for -- to drive the next level of growth. But I don't think -- I think it will be early to conclude to say that this 17% or 17%, 18% would be the sort of steady-state growth. I think we do see potential to get it to mid-20s at some point in time as well.\nVipul Garg: Thank you, Aditya. This was the last question. I now request Rajesh for his closing remarks.\nRajesh Magow: Yes. Thanks, Vipul, and thank you, everyone. Thanks for your patience, and I wish you all the best. See you next quarter.\nVipul Garg: Thank you, Rajesh. You may now please disconnect the call. Thank you.\nMohit Kabra: Thank you."

Over to you Rajesh.\nRajesh Magow: Thank you, Vipul. Welcome everyone to our first quarter call of fiscal 2024. We have started this financial year on a strong footing, as evident from our Q1 results. Travel demand was robust in the leisure-heavy seasonal quarter despite high fares due to short-term supply side challenges in the aviation market. We witnessed strong traction in leisure travel during the quarter, aided by seasonality, coinciding with summer holidays, while business travel continued its recovery trajectory. All segments have now grown beyond pre-pandemic levels, as a result of which we have posted our strongest ever quarter, both in terms of gross bookings and profitability. Gross bookings for the quarter reached an all-time high mark of approximately $2 billion, growing at a faster pace than market growth rate. Our adjusted profit, operating profit or adjusted EBIT of $30.1 million and GAAP profit after tax of $18.6 million were also record milestones for us. India is still an underpenetrated travel market and is well poised for long-term growth. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience and adaptability. Other macro factors in India like strong GDP growth, growing earnings in the hands of middle class population, increasing propensity to travel and improving transport infrastructure and last mile connectivity will help fuel travel sector growth in India. Consumer preferences are evolving and experiencing travel is now increasingly emerging as one of the preferred areas to spend from the growing disposable income in the hands of consumers. As a result, both domestic tourism and international outbound travel are expected to grow at a faster pace in the next 10 years compared to the last 10 years prior to the pandemic. Infrastructure investments are adding domestic tourism growth, while the aspirational Indians are looking to travel to various international destinations. As per the IPK World Travel Monitor, India generated Asia's highest outbound travel volume for the first time in 2022, exceeding those of China, South Korea and Japan, partially aided by lagged recovery of outbound travel in China. All major Indian airlines have placed record number of orders for new planes to cater to this demand. Similarly, all hotel chains have announced expansion plans, that's increasing the supply over time. We continue to stay excited about the future opportunity and geared up fully with focus on leveraging new technologies to provide more convenient and personalized experiences for travel planning and booking. Our depth of travel-related offerings, quality customer experience powered by robust tech and product innovations, along with strong brand strength are helping us cater to the evolving consumer preferences and stay ahead of the market. As for business segments now, starting with air business, we witnessed strong growth in air ticketing driven by leisure travel during this high season quarter and continue to record 30% plus share in the domestic flown passenger market. Domestic supply was affected during the quarter due to go-first issue leading to higher airfares. The supply gap was partially offset on account of higher load factors and additional supply deployed by other airlines. With the DGC approval granted to go-first for the resumption plan and additional aircraft expected to arrive for other airlines, we hope to see supply situation improving in the coming quarters  Seasonal demand also helped our outbound travel segment finally recovered to pre-pandemic levels after almost three years. While long-haul destinations still haven't recovered fully due to supply constraints and visa-related issues. Short-haul international travel has surpassed the pre-pandemic levels. We expect the overall international air ticketing segment to keep growing as the supply situation eases further. We continue to innovate our product to cater to a larger variety of use cases. During the quarter we launched an inspirational travel discovery product called Incredible India At Incredible Prices, which offers results to leisure travelers about the most economical airfare to multiple destinations in India from their chosen origin destination. The early results are encouraging as we have observed a significant increase in searches for leisure destinations on the Incredible India funnel. During the quarter, we also launched an industry-first student festival for international flights in June offering special relevant benefits to students traveling to international destinations for their college studies coinciding with commencement of academic session during the period. This was highly appreciated and helped us increase our student-led contribution to overall business. Our accommodation business, which includes hotels, home stays and packages witnessed strong growth this quarter aided by robust demand in both leisure and corporate travel. We continue to focus on supply expansion and improve discovery. As a result during this quarter, we sold 56,000-plus unique properties in more than 1,700 cities, which is the widest spread achieved in the business. This supply expansion with improved personalization in search results has helped us in improving online buying behavior in an underpenetrated category. While our gross booking value cross pre-pandemic levels a few quarters back. During this quarter room nights have also recovered to pre-pandemic levels. We've also seen good momentum in our international hotel business in line with the recovery in outbound travel. Many countries like UAE, Indonesia, Vietnam, Maldives have already surpassed pre-pandemic volumes. We introduced a few industry-leading features in hotels to continue our journey of ensuring delightful and high-quality experience for the end consumer. Book with zero payment was launched last quarter, which received a fantastic response from our users with no upfront payments required, customers can now confidently plan their trips in advance benefiting from exclusive deals and avoiding price fluctuations. This innovative feature has particularly helped to improve adoption rates in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.  We continue to scale our homestays business with increasing coverage of leisure destinations. Learning from consumers insights we have enhanced our offerings for consumers to get final details around meal options such as availability of chef at the property, meal options, kids meals, extended cooking kitchen amenities at one place before booking. This is helping us to specifically target mid to meal premium segment of stays. Our packages business witnessed strong growth this quarter. We successfully conducted three campaigns during the quarter and thus helping us scale the business significantly. We have partnered with Europamundo, a leading global player in tourism and travel industry for bringing the latest international holiday packages to India online. With this partnership over 600 new itineraries will be added to MakeMyTrip's existing catalog of nearly 5,000 holiday package options. The partnership further strengthens our portfolio and bolsters our capability to unlock global destinations and new combinations to cater to every traveler's preference. Our bus ticketing business continues to deliver strong results. Q1 saw a significant addition of supply across the country. Our daily life schedules or supply for private bus operators has increased significantly owing to high occupancy across most regions. During April and May, we expect fleet additions to be strong in the second half of the year. Our other ground transfer services such as intercity cabs, rail tickets, et cetera continue to scale well. This segment is helping us acquire new users for the platform. We are gaining market share in the rail ticketing business, organic downloads for standalone redRail app with an app rating at 4.5 continues to be high on both iOS and Android. Now a quick update on myPartner and Corporate Travel business. Our myPartner B2B2C platform where we offer both flight and accommodation booking is gaining positive traction from our partners. Our travel partner count is now 38,000-plus and expanding every quarter. We recently launched myPartner in GCC. And we already have more than 1000 partners live on the platform. Our Corporate Travel business is scaling up. Our active customer count on myBiz is now 49,000-plus. And for Q2T active customer count has reached 271 with strong addition every quarter. We continue to add more capabilities on our both myBiz and Q2T platforms. We completed automated integration to multiple HRMS and Expense Management platforms, thus reducing onboarding time for corporates and simplifying overall travel and expense management for employees. Our OTA business in GCC is growing steadily. Gross booking value doubled over the same quarter last year. Strong momentum in the last quarter was driven by significant progress in building key product features, supply richness and building new growth avenues. Along with revenue growth we have been working on improving efficiency in acquisition and pricing management, driving significant improvement in unit economics, while overall contribution of GCC remains small, but showing good traction organically. With this, let me now hand over the call to Mohit, for financial highlights of the quarter.\nMohit Kabra: Thanks, Rajesh and hello everyone. The strong business performance in the first quarter of the new fiscal year 2024 indicates, that the pandemic is now well and truly behind us. Albeit, we continue to leverage the cost rationalization initiatives we had rolled out during the pandemic-impacted period. During this period, taking a longer-term view we have also invested behind three or four key strategies or areas which are as follows. Firstly, technology upgrades on the supply side to drive synergies across brands, while enhancing the stability and scalability of the underlying platforms. On the customer-facing side made significant enhancements to deliver highly personalized customer experience, driven by Data Science and machine learning abilities and on the Tech back-end and providing online resolution for a wider variety of post sales service requirements. Secondly, increase the travel and travel-related service offerings on our platforms, to be the One Stop shop or Travel Super-App for Indians to explore book and manage all their travel needs. Thirdly, supply side expansion, particularly the Accommodation space which involved getting more and more hotels and alternative accommodations, across price points and across the lengthen breadth of the country, so that our customers can have more options to choose from. Lastly, a sharper targeting of various customer segments by leveraging new generative Artificial Intelligence tools and scaling up new demand segments by our curated platforms to target after bookings as well as increase our outreach particularly beyond the Tier 1 cities through offline agents and other online affiliates. As a result of the above, the business is well positioned to leverage demand recovery and outpace market growth, while improving profitability. We are therefore pleased, to report a strong quarter as we begin the new fiscal year 2024, both in terms of business growth and profitability. While there were certain supply side hiccups during the quarter, demand for travel continues to be robust backed by seasonality and positive consumer sentiment. We have witnessed strong year-on-year growth across all segments, which has helped us achieve milestone numbers in terms of gross bookings as well as profitability and this has turned out to be one of our best quarters till date. During the reported first quarter gross bookings came in at approximately $2 billion or $1987 million to be precise, witnessing a growth of over 31.4% year-on-year in constant currency terms. We delivered, GAAP EBITDA of $25.9 million for the quarter witnessing a growth of around 31.7% year-on-year. EBITDA margin was at 13.2% for the quarter which is an expansion of about 530 basis points, as compared to the same quarter last year. Adjusted operating profit or adjusted EBIT stands at about $30.1 million, as compared to $16.5 million during the same quarter last year an improvement of almost 83% year-on-year. As already called out by Rajesh, these are our highest ever quarterly numbers during the business. While a sharper focus on profitable growth, we are glad to achieve our medium-term margin targets ahead of our expectations on the back of strong business growth and our continued focus on cost efficiencies. Our air ticketing gross bookings for the quarter stood at $1.2 billion witnessing a growth of 30.9% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted margin stood at about $74.5 million registering a strong growth of 30.4% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Take rates for margins for the quarter stood at about 6.1%. This was lower optically due to the higher ASPs on account of Q1 being a seasonally strong quarter and contraction in margins in line with the supply constraints as a result of the shutdown of operations by one of the low-cost airlines in the country. Gross bookings for the quarter in the hotels and packages segment stood at about $498 million witnessing a strong growth of 36.5% year-on-year on constant currency basis in line with the demand trends. Adjusted margin for H&P business stood at $85.6 million during the quarter, witnessing a growth of over 36% year-on-year in constant currency terms. Margins for the quarter were 17.2%, an expansion of almost 90 bps over the previous quarter. In our bus ticketing business, gross bookings for the quarter were at $276.8 million growing at 24.7% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Adjusted margin stood at about $27.3 million registering a strong growth of over 39.7% in constant currency terms. Margins in our bus ticketing business stood at about 9.9% for the quarter. We continue to be prudent and efficient with our expenses specifically our customer regulation costs as reflected under the marketing and sales promotions. During the reported quarter, we went live with our brand campaign to drive top-of-mind recall and accelerate call to action in a seasonally strong quarter. Overall marketing and sales promotion costs for the quarter including the brand campaign came in at about 4.6% of gross bookings as compared to 5.1% in the same quarter last year and 5% during the previous quarter. Most of the other operating expenses continue to be in line with the previous quarters. As at the end of this quarter, our cash and cash equivalents stand at about $522 million. Potential deployment of the free cash in the future could be in pursuit of growth opportunities or towards capital restructuring via share repurchases. During the last quarter, we had also notified that we have widened our share repurchase plan to include repurchase of convertible bonds. With that, I'd like to turn the call to Vipul for Q&A.\nA - Vipul Garg: Thank you, Mohit. [Operator Instructions]. The first question is from the line of Sachin Salgaonkar of Bank of America. Sachin, please ask your question now.\nSachin Salgaonkar: Thanks, Vipul. Congratulations for a great set of numbers. I have three questions. First question, clearly one sees in this quarter a strong growth in hotel and slightly subdued growth in air. And because of the mix shift in favor of hotels, perhaps the margins also have improved. So the question out here is how should one look at the sustainability of these EBITDA and EBIT margins going ahead. To Mohit your point that you achieved your medium-term margin targets in this quarter. Let me pause here.\nMohit Kabra: I think from a -- if you look at it from a mix point of view, the H&P business is now kind of into the early 40s. If you look at historically even in the pre-pandemic kind of period, we have seen H&P contributing to kind of almost close to 50% of the mix. So I think there is still further potential for holidays & packages as not going to have improved in the mix. While we could see better growth coming in from air ticketing in the coming quarters as some of the short-term supply constraints get lifted. We believe blended margins should continue to kind of be in the range that we've kind of posted. We have seen slight marginal improvements coming through over the last few quarters that should potentially sustain.\nSachin Salgaonkar: Got it. Mohit pretty clear actually at that. Second question just wanted to understand the -- how should one look at the industry growth for the next six to nine months. And it comes from a context that last year was clearly more like a low base kind of an year, but this year in the first quarter you guys are more like a 27% growth. So is the 25% plus growth for industry sustainable?\nMohit Kabra: Growth is a factor of one the industry, growth plus the kind of incremental growth that we get in by increasing online penetration, right? And we are kind of pretty much representative of the growth on the online side, particularly on the travel spaces. So, I think we continue to leverage on the trend of increasingly consumers getting comfortable with online buying behavior and particularly in the underpenetrated segments like accommodation, et cetera, so that should continue to fuel better-than-industry growth for us in the coming years. \nRajesh Magow: And maybe, Mohit, if I can just add to what Sachin was saying. Sachin as historically, we've seen the thumb rule typically, is that the overall industry growth online/offline put together, let's say, if it is like 10% CAGR, then the online typically will be 2x. And we have always sort of at least historically, even in this quarter we called out, our growth rate typically has been faster than the industry overall growth rate as well. So, some sort of additional points for that. But that's the way to sort of directionally think about the growth. \nSachin Salgaonkar: Okay. Thanks, Rajesh and Mohit. And last question, I just wanted to understand a bit more on the book with zero payment, what you guys launched last quarter. How should one look at the impact of this on your numbers, i.e. what kind of a balance sheet risk or are you taking or anything to explain the economics of that would be helpful. \nRajesh Magow: Sachin, there is – okay, let me just take this. There is no balance sheet risk on this for sure, because this is just a feature of back-to-back sort of work with the partners where it offers more flexibility to the consumers, the travelers just basically working on the insight, that if you are not necessarily 100% certain and at some level it will also over time drive the behavior of booking in advance, was really the thought behind. So, give the flexibility to the consumer, you can -- you just started to let's say, plan for your trip, you can just go ahead and book it, because there is a feature available that you don't have to upfront commit any money. And then as you make up your mind, you can just make the final payment, but your booking will be guaranteed. So, that's really the focus here. There's no balance sheet risk. There's a back-to-back arrangement here. Overall, from an impact standpoint, the way we are looking at it, that -- and as it has become popular in consumers' minds already, good feedback coming back from the customers that they're finding it really useful, is that it effectively mouth of the funnel will increase significantly there will be more users, more people who would be wanting to come and let's say, block or reserve their booking. And if they end up just canceling it, the net impact of increase in the more new users coming or even the existing users coming and booking. And let's say, even the cancellation rate is a little higher, because there's flexibility offer the net-net impact is only going to be growth, in the number of room nights. So that's the way, we are looking at it, but there's no balance sheet risk involved in this. \nSachin Salgaonkar: And then Rajesh, who faces the risk, let's say to your point of when the consumer cancels perhaps, at the last minute and doesn't make any payment. It's a loss to someone, right? So who bears this loss? \nRajesh Magow: No, Sachin, it's actually -- it's an auto cancellation and that's the way we have plugged it. So it's an auto cancellation that happens let's say, if the payment does not happen, where back-to-back arrangement with the partner is that the free cancellation is available for let's say, 48 hours in advance or 72 hours in advance, that the time lines are set accordingly. So, if the payment is not received from the customer, the cancellation happens automatically.\nSachin Salgaonkar: Got it. Thank you and all the best for future.\nRajesh Magow: Thank you.\nVipul Garg: Thank you, Sachin. The next question is from the line of Vijit Jain from Citi. Vijit, you may please ask your question now\nVijit Jain: Thanks, Vipul. Hi, guys. Congratulations, on a great set of numbers. Just two questions from my side. One, is I know you mentioned targets with free cash of buyback and I know you have that convertible debt that you would want to buy back. But aside from that $136 million authorization, have you settled on the use of cash between buybacks and dividends in favor of buyback? Is that how I should understand it? \nMohit Kabra: So, I think Vijit, what we have called out currently is the share repurchase plan and it kind of widened the share repurchase plan, as I've mentioned, to include the convertible bonds. We haven't kind of made any comment around any dividends as such. And even on the share repurchase plan, see this is an existing plan, which has been kind of carried -- which has been carried forward for quite a few years wherein the balance is about $136 million. We should kind of be open to increasing the overall plan outlay once we are kind of closer to exhausting the available within the plan. So, I think the -- one should not feel that the plan is kind of restricted to only $136 million.\nVijit Jain: Okay.\nMohit Kabra: It could be a much larger outplay, depending upon how much are we able to kind of repurchase.\nVijit Jain: Got it. So, Mohit if I can ask is there any specific driver for the choice between a dividend and a buyback. I'm just curious about that, because obviously there's a reason for something like that in India but just for US listed, I'm wondering if there's any rationale.\nMohit Kabra: So, a couple of things driving the rationale for us. If you look at it like, I've said our preference would be while we have a convertible bond which has certain put triggers end of year three and year five, our preference would be to kind of repurchase the convertible bonds, provided they're available at a meaningful discount. However, like I've said, it's been difficult to kind of get them at a discount. They're trading pretty strong about almost 99% to 100%. So the first preference would lie in terms of repurchasing the convertible bonds. And thereafter, we could kind of look at the repurchases on the share side. So this is the preferred prioritization at our end.\nVijit Jain: Got it. Sure Mohit. But my second question is, just on the quarter I see that the other expenses this quarter is somewhere around 2.4% of GBV quite a bit of a jump there. I know you mentioned areas where you're investing behind but if you can give more color on beyond the payment gateways related fees and those kinds of things where this increase is coming from that will be great. And in addition to that just a follow-up on your adjusted EBIT margin number, you've obviously hit the top end of the target of 1% to 1.5%. I just wanted to clarify if you're revising that target to 1.5% plus. Is that how I should interpret your earlier comment?\nMohit Kabra: On the first one, this is also a result of a little bit of a reclassification of certain expenses which were earlier coming in as cost of -- other cost of services and have now been reclassified as distribution expenses under the other operating expenses category. So, we made a disclosure in the 6-K around the same. It's largely coming in from the bus ticketing business and also from our overall affiliates business. So this is a little bit of an optical thing coming in from the reclassification as explained in the 6-K. On the second one, if you really look at it, we have been guiding that we're gradually scaling up on profitability and you would recollect that over the last few quarters, we have been mentioning that we would like to get to about teens of adjusted operating margin as a percentage of adjusted margin and get to about 1.5% of gross bookings in terms of percentage of gross bookings. I think we've kind of hit that level during this seasonally strong quarter, which is also backed with the fact that we were able to significantly optimize on our customer acquisition costs during this particular quarter. So, the quarter had certain amount of supply constraints. As a result of which, we have kind of tweaked our strategy or kind of tactically made sure that we're spending more on say brand building kind of expenses rather than short-term-ish transaction driving spends like promotional expense. And therefore, the overall marketing and sales promotion came in at about 4.6%. For the full year, I believe we could look at these expenses coming in at around the 5%, 5.5% mark. However, for the full year also, we have seen like last year we were pretty much able to maintain the momentum that we had kind of generated on profitability in the first quarter. Even during this year, we would like to kind of maintain the momentum and try and keep the profitability around the first quarter levels.\nVijit Jain: Got it. Mohit, one last question if I can sandwich in. The Cricket World Cup in November, is that a significant business driver in general. I don't know, if you had any experience around that at the last time India hosted World Cup. We have seen news around bookings in certain places going to high levels already. So I just thought, I'd get your two bits on that one.\nRajesh Magow: Well, maybe Vijit, I can take that. Yes, I know and there's a lot of hype and noise around it already, so I'm not surprised that you're asking this question. Listen, given that there is so much of interest in watching cricket in India, there is definitely bound to be some sort of excitement around traveling to the destination, where the matches are going to happen and therefore by virtue of that there is -- definitely it could act as a booster for the travel industry, overall domestic travel, right? And as you can perhaps already see fares have started to go up specifically to those dates and even the hotel rooms et cetera, the rates have gone up, because everyone is obviously -- I mean there is hype. There is potential. Potentially there's going to be hike in demand and therefore, accordingly the prices are also going up. So clearly there will be some upside. Now how much will that be, we'll see. From a preparation standpoint from -- at our end, we are doing everything possible for us to be able to be ready to tap into this opportunity as well. Now, be it on the accommodation side, not necessarily on the hotels, making sure that we have a lot of the inventory in place, but also additionally, actually it's a great opportunity for homestays as well for some of these locations. So -- and not to say obviously the travel that might happen along with it. So overall, whether it is air travel or ground transport or overall accommodation during that period, there definitely will be some growth, the additional growth or the incremental growth that we would witness.\nVijit Jain: All right. Thanks, Rajesh. Those were my questions. Thank you, so much.\nRajesh Magow: Thank you, Vijit.\nVipul Garg: Thanks, Vijit. The next question is from the line of Manish Adukia from Goldman Sachs. Manish, please ask your question now.\nManish Adukia: Yes, hi. Thanks, Vipul for taking my question. Sir, my question is actually a follow-up to Vijit's previous question. Now, when we look at your marketing spend Mohit, I mean, let's say a couple of years back, you were guiding to about 6% to 7% of gross bookings, then the guidance was lower to 5% to 6% and now you're saying 5% to 5.5%. And of course the numbers come at 4.6%. So, is there actually like a downside risk to marketing spend, meaning in terms of what you see in the market in competition, do you think structurally marketing spend has room to come down even further? Because when you look at let's say global markets, I think the marketing spend for some of the travel OT is there is still lower than what you have reported. So your thoughts on that would be great.\nMohit Kabra: Yes. I think, it's kind of evolving as you have seen over the last few years and quarters. Clearly, two or three trends that we had called out. One, there is definitely scope for improvement in the customer action costs linked to a few things. One, the overall pace of customers that we keep acquiring and how much of it -- how much of our transactions keep coming in from repeats, rather than new customer acquisition which is generally more expensive, right? And we've been calling that out that our repeat rates are actually kind of been increasing almost 70% plus of our transactions now or orders now are coming in from our existing customer base. And clearly there's an opportunity to keep expanding the customer base as well. What we also need to keep in mind is, usually as we kind of keep increasing the mix on the accommodation side, accommodation being a larger margin business, also requires a little bit of a larger push on the marketing and sales promotion side. And therefore, the blended marketing and sales promotion could work a little bit as we see the mix improving towards hotels and packages. That said, this particular quarter, there was also a little bit of an anomaly where like I had called out, there have been certain supply-related constraints, which were impacting particularly the air ticketing side of demand, right and therefore overall travel. Therefore, we've kind of gone tactically a lot more prudent in this particular quarter on some of these customer acquisition costs and therefore they have come in slightly lower than where we would have anticipated them to come in based on the previous few quarters trending. Should we be able to sustain it around these levels or the kind of cutting it back to the 5% levels will again depend upon how quickly particularly the air ticketing side of business or the industry recovers. That should pretty much kind of impact this in the coming quarters. But like I said overall, if we can be around that range of 5% to 5.5% that should be a good range to be in. On the competitive side, yes, competitive dynamics have been easy. And like I said two factors that are kind of contributing to it is one is the increasing size and scale of our customer base increasing online penetration in each of the segments that we operate in, and thirdly, increasing kind of easing of competitive pressures. \nManish Adukia: Thank you so much for that. My second question is on the reclassification that talked about. The take rate increase that we've seen in the bus segment of about 80 basis points quarter-on-quarter and hotels about 100 basis point on quarter-on-quarter. Is a large part of that due to that service cost reclassification? \nMohit Kabra: Not in hotels. Actually hotels and here there's hardly any kind of impact coming in from the reclassification. The reclassification is largely coming and making an impact on the bus ticketing margins. And therefore, I was clarifying that -- that is something that we have specifically mentioned as an explanation in the MD&A section of the 6-K. So, yes, large part of the bus ticketing upside that you see going in from about 8.8% to 9.9% is coming in from the reclassification. \nManish Adukia: Got it. And my last question is on the budget segment in the hotel -- budget hotels and recovery there. So in the past you've called out as the recovery there has lagged the mid to premium end has the recovery dynamic there improved meaningfully in the last quarter? And is that driving the take rate expansion on a quarter-on-quarter basis? \nMohit Kabra: Yes it is. It is. It is. And therefore you do see some impact of that coming through to the improved margins as well. And we are now close to about 80%, 85% recovery on the budget segment as well or the super budget segment. \nManish Adukia: Thank you so much for taking my question and all the best.\nVipul Garg: Thank you, Manish. Next question is from the line Aditya Suresh from Macquarie. Aditya, you may please ask your question now.\nMohit Kabra: Aditya, you will have to unmute your line. Yes. Please go ahead.\nAditya Suresh: Yes. Great. Thank you. Thank you very much, Vipul. I have one big picture question and then two specific questions. So it's obviously great to see the operating leverage come through. So beyond market dynamics I'm really curious to understand what's really changed in terms of how you're managing the business whether that be for Rajesh or Deep or Mohit. Could you just speak about that a bit in terms of what's really changed in the past one month -- one year in terms of how you're managing the business? \nRajesh Magow: Yes. Maybe I can take that Aditya. I think actually two or three big changes. And I would actually just not say for the last one year I would say including the pandemic period. And sometimes the down cycle actually pushes you to think harder and it also throws opportunities. How could you possibly look at the opportunities and look at the businesses slightly differently. So just to specifically call that out right? So the one big opportunity that we got was the availability of our technology and product folks and we decided to sort of focus on what could be the potential opportunities on the tech front or on the product front that we can possibly tap into for our existing business and we can -- and then in parallel can we think of new business segments and for that whatever development that we need to do what is that? Can we just, sort of, attack those areas and double down on those. So we leverage technologies all the latest technologies to focus on expanding the product offerings to make like literally a one-stop shop on the B2C side and then build multiple platforms as we've been calling out in those two years. I mean some of that was enhancement on the platform that was already there like myBiz the corporate segment platform was already built and we had started that journey pre-pandemic, but we just significantly, sort of, deployed resources and double down on improving not only the product experience, but also just significantly, sort of expanding the offerings there and fixing all the supply side front-end issues et cetera. Similarly the myPartner platform, similarly TripMoney fintech platform, launching into the GCC market launching redRail and also building an affiliate platform that we can potentially power many of the horizontals out there for new user acquisitions. So I would say, that was one area just the product and the tech part of it. The second, interesting opportunity that we saw, was in the Eco Space where we saw homestays category emerging very nicely, and we doubled down on building the supply strength on that. Today, we have about 28,000 properties and you also saw an opportunity in the budget hotel segment. There was churn happening, but then there was an opportunity on picking up the quality supply in the market and bringing on our platform as well. So, a lot of the work on the expansion of domestic hotel supply specifically, on homestays and then building home -- front-end capabilities and also building supply side or host application dedicated for the host and so on. And third, I would say, just looking at the opportunities again, which could enhance productivity of course gives us agility at scale, and also helps in cost sort of rationalization and that was just building the self-service platforms for post sales customer service side, and we invested behind – again, deployed a lot of sources a lot of bandwidth went into it, and we significantly improved the customer experience on the post-sale side and thereby reducing the sort of the amount of outsourcing that we had to do pre-pandemic, at a scale. So, all these areas that obviously, have helped us both on the profitability at the scale standpoint overall, sort of unit economics improving, but also more importantly adding new areas of growth. So, I'm saying all in all, it was basically an idea of just looking at the opportunities where it could potentially help you post-pandemic, while we were sort of weathering the strong as a separate track in terms of just how best to come out of the crisis. So, Aditya, these are the few things that are probably worth calling out. \nAditya Suresh: Great, Rajesh. Thank you so much for that response. I think the other call out, also is just how you improved your revenue line whilst your employee costs have been steady, and that's I guess speaks to your productivity comment, as well. But I'm really curious, to understand how this line shapes up in the next couple of years. You're kind of boosted productivity, per employee. Maybe some guidance here on how you're thinking about staff, salaries, ESOPs, as we continue to kind of grow the business. \nMohit Kabra: Maybe, I can take that, Aditya. When it comes to personnel costs, overall, I think this will largely be kind of seeing inflationary increases more around say the 15% mark. That is what we should be seeing, as we don't really kind of expect to have any significant increases on the headcount side. When it comes to specific areas of costs like, share-based compensation, et cetera, or SBC costs there what you can kind of consider is, that the absolute number should largely remain in the same ballpark range and therefore, provide a lot of operating leverage going forward as well. \nAditya Suresh: Great. Thanks, Mohit. I had one additional question if that's okay. So just on working capital. Clearly, we see that international and hotels is coming back in the mix. And I typically would have think -- thought that you'd see a positive working capital impact as these two lines come back. Would you tend to agree with that comment? And how should we be thinking about the working capital release going forward?\nMohit Kabra: Usually, if you follow our kind of trending over the years, seasonally high quarters would generally see a deployment in working capital. However, this quarter essentially because we've been extremely focused on cash flow management as well, we have actually seen a release coming on the working capital side. So, that's actually a kind of a big positive for the quarter that we have reported, because usually otherwise in a peak seasonality, there is generally deployment that we see over the years.\nAditya Suresh: But Mohit, I guess the specific question was as you have more share of hotels in your mix, my understanding is that as I'm kind of booking in advance the kind of advances which I'm giving much as a platform stays with you. And so there's a positive working capital impact until the time I actually check in right? So I was wondering if as you see more hotels and more international travel come back, you should see a bit -- a stronger working capital impact which favors you?\nMohit Kabra: Not a lot, because you've also kind of see the whole campaign this quarter was around Book at Zero, right? So we're not necessarily trying to kind of build on positive working capital through the accommodation business. That's not really the intent. We're kind of using a variety of options and features such as Pay Later or kind of Book at Zero et cetera, whereby we don't really see there will be any significant kind of working capital possibility coming in with the increasing mix coming from hotels & packages.\nAditya Suresh: Thank you so much for these clarifications. Thank you.\nMohit Kabra: Sure.\nVipul Garg: Thanks, Aditya. The next question is from the line of Gaurav Rateria of Morgan Stanley. Gaurav, you may please ask your question now.\nGaurav Rateria: Hi. Am I audible?\nVipul Garg: Yes, please, go ahead.\nGaurav Rateria: Hey, congratulations on almost a magical quarter on margins and cash flow. My first question is on your comment around the air ticketing business should see improving trends going forward with supply constraints easing. Is this more like a second half phenomena, or it should start happening from near term itself?\nRajesh Magow: Yes, Gaurav. And thank you, firstly thank you for the generous comment. Yes, Gaurav. That's what I was just trying to say in my commentary as well, most likely second half onwards, because that is when I think the deliveries are scheduled to come in more planes are likely to come in for the Tata Group of airlines or Indigo for that matter. And even for Akasa and the others so -- and that would help. I don't think it's happening like in the immediate future like not in the running quarter. But from second half onwards it starts -- it will start to ease out.\nGaurav Rateria: Got it. Very clear. Second question is again some comment that you made around you growing faster than market in H&P segment, how to understand the overall volume growth from an industry standpoint? And where have you got your market share gain from?\nRajesh Magow: Yeah. No, I think the data that we have sort of looked at. I mean at an overall level, it's hard there is not really any structured third-party data that is available like you will get it in the air market like DGCA number is a very good number that comes out every day. So you know to the last sort of digit that what is your market share gain, et cetera. And that's not necessarily the case with the hotels market admittedly. But what we see and our comment is based on looking at that data that specifically on our platform, we've looked at every segment as compared to let's say pre-pandemic level or even year-on-year. From a pre-pandemic level, every segment our growth rate is more than 100% across the segments except the budget. Budget, as Mohit pointed out some time back, that is also recovering nicely now. And then, basis that your conversation with the industry and the partners that you collect some data, there are some reports on the supply side, which are neutral on the occupancy. So, you bring in all of that into the calculation and based on your estimates that you think that we have actually gained share in some of the -- in majority of the segments of the hotels. So, that's really the basis of that comment and we can get into details offline but -- if you would want more color but that's the way we have sort of looked at it.\nGaurav Rateria: Got it. My last question is around the generative AI. You alluded to certain efficiencies around there and personalization improving product features. But, how do you think about the overall risk of disruption from using this new technology, where the whole travel booking process of search selection becomes more conversational and completely disruption -- disruptive to the way it is being done currently. Just trying to understand on terms of product innovations that could be a possibility in this market?\nRajesh Magow: No, there is huge possibility. I mean this technology per se is to our assessment, it's looking promising. And if I may say so, if there is any disruption that this technology is likely to cause, we would want to lead that disruption. And with that thought only we actually did soft launch of our conversation flow. And right now, there are two or three use cases which are in the works, which we are working on with the focus that we want to improve the customer experience and more particularly, relying on the better and robust language models to also have a flow which is hybrid and that could help us reach to beyond 25 cities if you will, literally penetrate deep into India or Bharat, that's really the focus. The next level to focus also is to leverage the technology to also bring in some efficiency and productivity gains in the system, because I think there are areas on software development or in some of the other areas that we are still doing some work on where prima facie you see a lot of potential, that if you do the deployment right then you should be able to get some gains. But if I may just add an important sort of not caveat but maybe an additional comment, that it is going to be a journey. And as you sort of deploy this technology in every particular use case, you will learn. You will learn, you will get more insights and you will keep fine-tuning it. Until the time that you get to 100% accuracy, it is going to take some time. It's not -- and pretty much happens with every technology. It's not necessarily overnight. Some gains you would be very visible to you really quick but for us to be able to see sustainable gains, whether it is overall customer experience improvement or a serious amount of innovation disrupting the status quo or productivity gains, right? In all areas, there is promise but it's going to be a journey.\nGaurav Rateria: Got it. All the best for future. Thank you.\nRajesh Magow: Thank you, Gaurav.\nVipul Garg: Thank you, Gaurav. This was the last question that we had in the queue. If we have no more questions, I'll hand over to Rajesh for his closing comments.\nRajesh Magow: Well, thank you Vipul, and thank you everyone. Thank you for your time and thank you for your patience, and thank you for all the nice comments that you have made today. Thank you.\nVipul Garg: Thank you everyone for joining the call. You may please disconnect. Thank you."
