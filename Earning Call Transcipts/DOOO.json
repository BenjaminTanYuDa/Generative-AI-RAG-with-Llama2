I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Philippe Deschenes. Please go ahead, Mr. Deschenes.\nPhilippe Deschenes: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to BRP conference call for the fourth quarter fiscal year ‘24. Joining me this morning are Jose Boisjoli, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sebastien Martel, Chief Financial Officer. Before we move to the prepared remarks, I would like to remind everyone that certain forward-looking statements will be made during the call and that the actual results could differ from those implied in the statements. The forward-looking information is based on certain assumption and is subject to risk and uncertainties and I invite you to consult BRP’s MD&A for a complete list of these. Also, during the call reference will be made to supporting slides and you can find the presentation on our website at brp.com under the Investor Relations Section. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to José.\nJose Boisjoli: Thank you, Philippe. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Fiscal ‘24 was marked by sudden market share gain, successful product launches, and continued progress on our key strategic initiative. From a financial perspective, the year was more challenging than expected, due to macroeconomic environment. We adapted to the situation and as you know, we have proactively reduced our shipment to dealers. Despite unfavorable winter condition, which impacted our snow-related business, we've delivered EPS within our guidance range. Let's turn to Slide 4. For key financial highlight for the year. Revenue increased 3% to reach $10.4 billion a record high for BRP. Normalized EBITDA was stable at $1.7 billion and normalized EPS was down 8% at $11.11. Our focus on cash management payoff as we've delivered a record free cash flow of more than $1 billion for the year. As for retail, our North American power sports sales were up 8% for the year compared to an industry of about 1%. The strong power sport retail performance further strengthened our position as the number one OEM in the industry. As you can see on Slide 5. With this additional growth in fiscal ‘24, our retail now stands 35% higher than pre-COVID level in an industry that has been flat. We added another two-percentage point of market share for the year with gain across almost all product lines. We have continued expanding our leadership position as a number one OEM in PowersPorts, and the only one refilling more units per dealer than during COVID. Our success comes from our ability to constantly innovate by bringing new product to market that drive consumer demand, and we are well-positioned to sustain our momentum going forward. Turning to Slide 6 for a closer look at our retail performance in the fourth quarter. Our North American PowersPorts retail was down 10% as we were facing a tough compatible due to late shipment and retail of three-wheel vehicle, personal watercraft and Sea-Doo Pontoon in Q4 last year. And yet, this year fourth quarter was our second strongest ever even surpassing the COVID year during which we had significantly depleted network inventory. Our performance was also impacted by unfavorable winter condition, which led to a snowmobile decline in the high teen, excluding snowmobile, our retail for the quarter was down only 2%. Still, despite a more challenging dynamic in Q4, we are satisfied with our performance for the year. When excluding snowmobile, our retail was up 12% compared to the industry, up low single digit driven by a very strong performance in off-road vehicle and personal watercraft, and market share gain across most product line. Turning to Slide 7 for an update on global retail trend. As mentioned last quarter, we started to see gradual sign that the macroeconomic and environment was affecting our industry leading to softer market condition, especially in EMEA and Asia Pacific. The fourth quarter played essentially in line with this view, as we saw softer demand in EMEA and Asia Pacific, which we tell down 5% and 25% respectively. However, we had an excellent performance in Latin America driven by the Brazilian and Mexican markets. Given these trends, we maintain a cautious approach entering fiscal year ‘25, our priority is to tightly manage network inventory to protect dealer profitability. Now let's turn to Slide 8. For a year-round product revenue were up 9% reaching $1.4 billion in Q4, primarily driven by a favorable product mix and a return to normal shipment pattern for three-wheel vehicle. At retail, Can-Am side by side had its strongest Q4 ever being up low 20% firmly driven by solid growth in the utility category. Our performance is even more impressive as the first shipment of the new Maverick R occur late in the season. This brand-new platform already made its smart by winning the king of the hammer race in California two months ago, which would further stimulate consumer interest. This strong quarter conclude another exceptional year for our side-by-side business, where we grew retail at the high teen percentage base and gain significant market share, especially in the utility segment. Our share reached 30% achieving the subjective a year earlier than our five-year plan. As for ATV, our retail was down low single digit as we lack a very strong Q4 last year. That said, we are pleased with the success of our new Outlander platform, which gained four point of market in the mid-60 segment. For the year, we gain almost two point surpassing the 20% mark for the first time ever and getting closer to the number two position in the industry. Looking at three-wheel vehicle, we are in the off season and Can-Am three-wheel retail was down high 20%. The decline is primarily due to lapping and unusually strong quarter of retail last year as we ship unit later than normal in the season. Still given the interest of new entrant for the category, our strong lined up and enhancement to our Spyder F3 and RT models, we are well positioned to have a successful season. Turning to seasonal products on Slide 9. Revenue were down 28% from last year to about $950 million driven by a lower volume of products sold, resulting from a different timing of shipment compared to last year. Looking at our retail performance. For personal watercraft, this was peak retail season in counter seasonal market and Sea-Doo retail decline of mid-single digit in Australia due to market weakness. This was partially offset by impressive growth in the low 30% in Latin America, notably driven by the bra Brazil market. As for North America, we are in the off season and retail was down primarily due to a difficult compatible given late unit shipment last year. However, from a historical perspective, retail is performing well a double-digit from typical for quarter pre-COVID level. This trend also continued in February, which gave us confidence for the upcoming summer season. Looking at snowmobile, as previously mentioned, fourth quarter retail was impacted by unfavorable winter condition in North America leading to decline in the high teen percentage range. I have been in the business for a long time and several challenging season, but is the first time that I see such difficult condition across North America. That said, looking at historical trend, we know that the snowmobile industry is very resilient and typically bounced back following weaker season. We have a loyal and passionate customer base. Our Ski-Doo and Lynx brands are very strong and continue to outperform the industry with retail down low single digit for the season. Reflecting our commitment to bring innovation to market, we are strengthening our offering for model year ‘25 by introducing new feature and technologies across the lineup. Furthermore, we have launched two new Ski-Doo and Lynx electric models designed for multi-use application such as key center and recreational result. This model will also be available to consumers. With the strain of our lineup and recent edition, we expect to remain the number one industry player. Moving on to Slide 10 with Powersports accessories and apparel and OEM engine. Revenue worked down 23% to $291 million due to lower product shipment to reduce network inventory level and lower demand for snow-related replacement part. Moving on to marine, revenue were down 32% to $84 million due to lower volume of boat shipment as dealer continue to be cautious about taking on inventory given weaker demand trends. Looking at retail sales, we are in the off season in North America and as my graph retail was down about 20% while Manitou retail was about flat. As for Quintex, retail was down about 10% in line with the industry. Looking ahead with softer demand in the boating sector, we are seeing more promotion across the industry. For this reason, we decided to be more conservative with our plan for fiscal year ‘25 in order to manage network inventory and preserve the value of our newly introduced folks. As such, we expect marine revenue to remain about flat for the year. We are pleased with the customer reception of the new Manitou boat and remain confident about the potential of our marine business for the coming years. With that, I turn the call over to Sebastian.\nSebastien Martel: Thank you, Jose, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter played out in a difficult context marked by unfavorable winter, which impacted our snow-related products and softening consumer demand in international markets. Still through it all, the team executed well to tightly manage shipments and network inventory levels, sustained solid market share gains and side by side and delivered bottom line results that ended within our guidance range. Looking at the numbers, revenue stood $2.7 billion, representing a decrease of 12%, primarily due to lower shipments and higher sales program notably, as adverse winter conditions affected our snow-related business and led to higher levels of promotions. We generated $653 million of gross profit with a margin of 24.3% down 130 basis points from last year. This decline was primarily due to lower shipment volumes and higher sales program partly offset by a richer mix of products, favorable pricing and improved production costs. Moving further down the P&L, we generated normalized EBITDA for the quarter of $405 million and normalized earnings per share of $2.46. For the year we delivered normalized EBITDA of $1.7 billion, roughly flat to last year, and normalized earnings per share of $11.11, a decline of 8% from fiscal ‘23 resulting from higher depreciation and financing costs. Success in our industry comes from innovation, solid cash generation, and diligent allocation of capital, and we strongly believe this is a core strength of BRP. In that vein, as you can see on slide 13, fiscal ‘24 were the strongest year ever with over a billion dollars of free cash flow generation, representing a solid conversion ratio of over 60%. Furthermore, we continue to prioritize investments in the business by deploying over $580 million in CapEx. These investments primarily focus on high-return growth projects aimed at sustaining our market share growth momentum, and expanding our addressable markets. Our solid ROIC of 30% for the year reflects our unique ability to innovate and deliver industry-leading results on projects. Given our solid cash generation, we also returned over $500 million to our shareholders to a 13% increase in the dividend, and by capitalizing on the dislocation in the value of our stock to repurchase about 6% of the shares outstanding. As our business is geared to generate solid free cash flow, we remain well positioned to continue investing in the business, all the while sustaining strong returns of capital to our shareholders. Moving to an overview of our network inventory on slide 14. Our dealers’ inventory for the fourth quarter was up 36% from last year and up 30% from pre-COVID levels. As we mentioned. As we mentioned last quarter, despite that we diligently improved our inventory terms over the years. Our dealers are currently facing elevated inventory financing costs due to the increased dollar value of units and higher interest rates. To protect our dealer value proposition, we have decided to support them by aiming to reduce our network inventory levels by 10% to 15% this year. While there are opportunities for improvements across all product lines, the more pronounced decreases are expected to come from seasonal products in three-wheel, as they ended the respective seasons with higher levels of inventory than initially planned. From a cadence perspective, Q1 network inventory is expected to remain high than last year as it comps overall leaner inventory levels and will be impacted by snowmobile given weather induced softer retail trends. From there, we expect a gradual improvement until year-end. Now moving to the guidance for fiscal ‘25 on slide 15. We are entering fiscal ‘25 with a solid lineup and an exciting pipeline of product introductions that are positioning us well to sustain our market share momentum in RRV and maintain our leadership position in seasonal products. From an operational standpoint, our manufacturing sites are running smoothly. The supply chain environment has normalized and we expect to continue benefiting from our lean initiatives and the expansion of our modular design across our lineup. From a financial standpoint, our guidance essentially incorporates the global trends that have developed during the second half of fiscal ‘24, and that we have shared with you during our last earnings call, notably, softer consumer demand in certain international markets, weaker industry trends in marine limiting dealer's appetite to take on inventory in a more elevated promotional environment. As previously mentioned, in this context, and in order to protect our dealer value proposition, we have decided to adopt a more cautious stance in our planning to reduce our shipments in fiscal ‘25. Additionally, given the impact of unfavorable winter on our snowmobile retail, we are planning to reduce our snowmobile production by about 30% for next season. Accounting for all these elements, we expect our revenues for the year to be down from last year and end between $9.1 billion and $9.5 billion. In terms of profitability, we expect the headwinds from the reduction in volume to be partly offset by our richer product mix, favorable net pricing, and the aforementioned benefits of our cost improvement initiatives. Furthermore, we are taking the necessary actions to right size our operating structure in line with the expected revenue generation, limiting the pressure on our margin profile. As a result, we expect our normalized EBITDA to end between $1.37 billion to $1.47 billion. Our normalized diluted earnings per share to end between $7.25 and $8.25, including a headwind of about $0.90 coming from higher depreciation and financing costs, as well as a higher tax rate. Note, that we are providing a wider than usual guidance range to account for the more than uncertain market environment, both in terms of consumer demand and promotional intensity, especially in the context of our aim of reducing network inventory levels. From a cash perspective, based on the above, and following a prioritization exercise of our project portfolio, which led to CapEx optimization, we expect to generate in excess of $750 million of free cash flow for next year. As such, we expect to have the financial flexibility to continue providing strong return of capital to shareholders. Notably, as we have announced a 17% increase of our dividend for fiscal ‘25. To conclude, we have provided a summary of the key drivers bridging our fiscal ‘24 results to the midpoint of our fiscal ‘25 guidance. As you can see, most of the client in earnings is expected to come from volume and then mix as a result of our objective of improving network inventory return driving a net negative impact of $2.50, and from a reduction in the shipments of snow related products following a difficult season representing an impact of $1.25. Note that we expect most of the net reduction in volume and consequently most of the decline in normalized EBITDA to happen in the first half of the year with Q1 normalized debit down 35%. While fiscal ‘25 is expected to be a transition year from a financial standpoint at the midpoint of the guidance range, our normalized diluted EPS you expected to end above our original M ‘25 targets that we had launched in the fall of 2019 of $7.50. Additionally, fiscal ‘25 is planned to be another year of exciting product introductions and continued progress and efficiency gains throughout the business. We strongly believe that the actions we are taking will position BRP for continued long-term success. And on that, I will turn the call over to Jose.\nJose Boisjoli : Thank you, Sebastian. While market condition as softened in the second half of fiscal ‘24, we were proactive and quickly adapted to the new reality. As mentioned in November, we have reduced our production volume in order to lower network inventory, and now in light of our Q4 results, we are adjusting snowmobile production for next year and taking a more cautious approach for Marine. We are known to be agile and we never hesitate to reprioritize our investment to find the right balance between the short, mid and long-term growth perspective. Looking at our EV plan, we have just launched two new electrics snowmobile model and we are looking forward to the upcoming launch of the Can-Am Electric motorcycle at our dealer event in August. We remain committed to electrifying our product lines, but we have decided to deal with some of our EV introduction and we'll provide an update in due time. In closing, I remain confident in our future. What we have in the pipeline is very exciting. As you know, the best part of my job is riding our product. I was at our test center in Florida two weeks ago and had the chance to try many future off-road personal watercraft, and both products, including some of our electric models. Again, I'm very impressed with the ability of our design and engineering team to come up with market shaping product and I look forward to introducing them to consumer. Innovation is at the core of our DNA and will continue to position the company for long-term success by pushing the boundaries of technology. Our diversified product portfolio is a significant advantage, while our agile manufacturing network allows us to respond quickly to evolving market condition and still generate solid profitability. I want to thank our strong and resilient team for their hard work and dedication throughout the year. I also acknowledge our dealer for their support in making us the number one OEM in the industry, and we will continue to work in collaboration with them to further expand our leading position. On that note, I turn the call over to the operator for question.\nOperator: Thank you, Jose. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And your first question will be from Sabahat Khan at RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSabahat Khan: Okay, great. Thanks, and good morning. I guess, I think Jose, you made a comment about sort of managing the business for short, medium and long run. You know, we obviously have the guidance here for the upcoming 12 months, but a lot of the questions we've been getting have been around kind of the medium-term outlook for BRP and the industry. Can you maybe help us think through how you view, call it calendar ‘25 playing out, and just your view of how the industry evolves beyond this year and, maybe address some of the questions that people have had around, how are the current year sales and earnings compared to what might be the new run rate for the company? So maybe just some perspective on the, your forward-looking views of BRP and the industry.\nJose Boisjoli: Yeah, good morning. Just to give you a sense about the trend, the retail trend in February and March so far, and I will give you the number in North America without snowmobile, then retail is up mid-single digit, very good growth still in ORV, three-wheel is doing well. Water graph and switch is down, but we know it's lapping abnormal quarter last year. And just to give you a sense of our retail momentum in the beginning of the year, our retail is about 50% above pre-COVID level. Then very happy with the retail trend. This is for North America, international, basically no change, soft in EMEA and APAC, and very strong in LATAM. Then this is the trend so far in February, March, and as you remember in ‘24 overall the, the North America industry was resilient with ORV in North America. We saw softer international and marine overall is softer than for fiscal year ‘25 we planning this overall trend to continue then we're planning North America to be down low single digit. A positive momentum for ORV and three-wheel will outperform snowmobile, obviously, watercraft and marine. And at international lagging North America. Then basically, we continue the trend that we saw in Q4 and what we see in February March is continuing for the remaining of fiscal year ‘25 with a downward of down low single digit in North America. Now that being said we have gained significant market share in the last few years, and our goal is to still, to continue to gain market share in the ORV business and maintain our solid leadership position on snowmobile and watercraft and continue to enter a new market segment, then that's overall what I would see for retail trend.\nSebastien Martel: Yeah, maybe it is still early to call out what fiscal year ‘26 could be. Obviously as Jose said, we've got great momentum and I mean we've had peak retail for Q4 and side by side, just, and so that obviously is exciting. But for me, fiscal ‘25 is a correction year. And if you look at slide 16 that we have in the deck that we shared with you today, I mean there's two elements that are for me are one-time elements that are hurting fiscal year ‘25, which is the adjustment of inventory for $2.50 and also the impact of snowmobile. So obviously we're disappointed with the guidance that we have. We'd like to come up with a higher guidance, and if you take the midpoint of the range of 7.75, if you add these two one-time items, for me, fiscal ‘25 is almost more an 11.50 year than a 7.75. We are doing what's right for the business, what's right for the industry, what's right for the dealers, but obviously in the midterm, we anticipate that we will be producing results significantly higher than what we've announced today.\nSabahat Khan: Great. Thanks, so much for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from James Hardiman at Citi. Please go ahead.\nJames Hardiman : Good morning. Really like sort of the layout of that slide 16, I think it tells us a lot. So maybe using that is it three months ago you guys gave us your initial view on fiscal ‘25, and I think most people landed on about a $9 earnings per share number. Is it as simple as to say that since then that $1.25 is really what's incremental in terms of the impact from the snowmobile-related products? And then you talked about that 2.50 also being one time-ish. Is the entirety of that just inventory draw down or wouldn't there also be some sort of market related demand weakness, that ultimately gets worked into that 2.50 number as well? Just trying to make sure I understand how I should think about more of a normalized earnings number in a year where there isn't significant inventory drawdown. Thanks.\nSebastien Martel: Yes. Well, on your first question, yes, you're correct. What changed versus when we talked last November is the snow season. And so that's the added headwind that we're seeing of a $1.25. So, it, if I would say ‘25 is, aside from snowmobile is in line with what our views that we had a few months ago. And obviously in the 2.50, there's a combination of inventory, which is a big one makes us favorable. That's going to help obviously market share gains as well. But the bulk of the 2.50 is us being proactive in managing network inventory and protecting the EVP.\nJose Boisjoli: Maybe we'd like to add, when we had the call in November, we were ahead of our planning for the snowmobile retail and the momentum was good till Christmas time. And really the retail falls off mid-January about, and they never really catch up. Then this is the main reason of our adjustment.\nJames Hardiman: Got it. It’s very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Martin Landry at Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMartin Landry : Good morning, guys. I would like to touch on the snowmobile inventory in the channel. What's the retail increase in inventory for snowmobile year-over-year, and how long do you think it's going to take to flush out this the success inventory?\nJose Boisjoli: Yes, good morning, Martin. Just maybe to give you some highlight on the snowmobile season. If you look at the data of the last 15 years, basically, we saw a few bad winter in those 15 years. We say we estimate about three bad winter. And what is interesting is the snowmobile is very resilient. Customer are passionate about it. They accept now to trailer more to go to find snow. And Canada is about stable, maybe less riding in the -- less retail in the heat, but more in the west. United States is slightly down. But if you look at the snowmobile business over the last 15 years, it varied between 95,000 units and 105,000 units per seat per year. In Scandinavia, in Europe - and in Europe and Europe is mainly commercial. It's about stable in the last 20 year at about 20,000 units. Then the point is, after a bad year, the industry typically remain quite stable because there is a lot of non-current into the flying pipeline. And there is customer that are happy to buy a new snowmobile at a discount. It's sad to have this bad winter. It didn't affect us on the wholesale, but obviously affected our sales program and our part and accessories and apparel. But we are confident that next year the industry will remain quite stable.\nMartin Landry: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And next question will be from Joseph Altobello at Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is Martin on for Joe. A quick question about the revenue decline in your guidance. It's a little bit steeper than you implied three months ago. Was that the primarily Delta I'm sorry -- Was that primarily the snowmobiles? And can you remind us of how big as apprentice set of sales is your snowmobile business?\nSebastien Martel: Yes, you're right. When we look at the seasonal products business obviously impacted by snowmobile, the impact of the production adjustment that we're doing, the 30% that we talk is going to be about a $350 million impact on our top line next year. When you look at the other elements of the guidance, where we missed the P&A business was off guidance that's driven by the softer snow season where we sold less accessories, less parts as well because people were riding less. And oddly enough as well, we sold less winter accessories for our ORV business, such as track kits and plows that go in front of the ORV. In the other business where we missed the guidance was the marine business, where we are still seeing softness in the marine market as we've seen in the last say 12 months. And dealers finish the season with more inventory and therefore they are more hesitant, especially early in the season to take on additional inventory, and so that's why the volume impact resulted in a shortfall on the guidance.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Robin Farley at UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Thank you. Just circling back to your inventory goals, you mentioned, do you want to reduce it by 10% to 15%. It sounds like that was mostly in the snow and three-wheel. I don't know if you clarified what you hope to do with side-by-side and ATV dealer inventory and then also on the retail side, just specifically for the side-by-side and ATV, what assumption are you working on for kind of industry retail as you're trying to manage whatever inventory target you're about to tell us for ORV?Thank you.\nSebastien Martel: The bulk of the decrease in the inventory is going to come from seasonal business, so personal watercraft, Sea-Doo Pontoon and also snowmobile. We will also be making greater adjustments on three-wheel. And in the on the ORV side, obviously, we have a very good momentum on ORV. As you saw, our retail performance in the fourth quarter was quite amazing. And so yes, we will adjust the inventory downward, but not as meaningful. It will be in the probably in the low single-digit adjustments for RV. In terms of industry, Jose gave a bit of color as well. The industry in good shape for side-by-side. Obviously, there's been a lot of product innovation and that's driving good retail, but we're expecting a softer industry this year than we had. But obviously, market share gains will compensate and we expect retail to be up for side by side this year.\nRobin Farley: So, you're saying industry ORV retail has been good so far in the year, but you expect the full year to come in down year-over-year?\nSebastien Martel: To be softer than what we had in the last year, yes.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Thank you, very much. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Cameron Doerksen at National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.\nCameron Doerksen: Thanks, very much. I guess my question is on capital allocation. So, I just want to confirm that you'd sort of indicated that you expect to generate something like $750 million in free cash flow in the year. So just want to confirm that number. And assuming that's the case, just wondering about your capital deployment decisions here. Obviously, if you've redone your debt, just thoughts about NCIB substantial issuer bid, it would seem to me that you would have some excess capital if you do indeed generate $750 million of free cash?\nSebastien Martel: Yes, for the record, I confirm that I did say $750 million this morning. Obviously, we will be generating strong EBITDA CapEx in the range of $500 million, so obviously that will allow us to generate solid free cash flow. I'm not expecting any headwind or tailwind from working cap. There are still some opportunities, but with the management of the network inventory, probably see a bit more volatility on the working capital, so no tailwind there. But nonetheless, solid cash generation, which allows us to continue providing good returns to shareholders. As we have announced this morning, the dividend is increasing by 17%, and we will certainly be active on the NCIB, that's our intention. We still got over 2 million shares that we can buy under the NCIB. So, we obviously want to deploy that capital towards that because we expect a certain dislocation in the share value in the current in the next few quarters.\nCameron Doerksen: Okay. Thanks, very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Craig Kennison at Baird. Please go ahead.\nCraig Kennison: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Seb, I think you mentioned some actions to address your overall cost structure in light of the difficult year ahead. I'm just wondering if you can help us quantify those actions and then maybe where they're targeted, whether it's in cost of goods sold or in your SG&A line?\nJose Boisjoli: Good morning, Craig. I will take the question. As you know, we said to the investor over the years that when slowdown happen, we prefer to be ahead of the game and be very agile to readjust. And like I said in my remarks, in my remark, in my script. I mean, we reprioritize many programs into the company. Then basically we feel that with the softer demand, we better to be prudent. That being said, I very confident that we have everything in line to be able to continue to gain market share in our key product line. But basically, we've done an exercise to reprioritize our project and that's how we achieve lower OpEx than the what was originated plan a few months ago.\nCraig Kennison: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Xian Siew at BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nXian Siew : Maybe also looking at slide 16, you kind of mentioned pricing net of sales programs, the $0.50 benefit, I guess, given a kind of more cautious outlook for the consumer potentially retail is down. What gives you the confidence on pricing?\nSebastien Martel: Well, every, obviously the inflation is still part of the business and running the business, and so we're seeing cost inflation happening. So, we want to compensate that with some pricing. We will not be as aggressive and we don't need to be as aggressive on pricing as we've been in the past. Inflation is coming down, but every year we do adjust pricing upward. We do expect the promotional environment to be more competitive this year. And so, we factored this in the guidance. We factored this year we've a tailwind of about 200 -- headwind of about 200 basis point coming from promotion. We expect another 50-basis point next year. So that's the next pricing and promotion. But again, we're not thinking that the environment is going to be like fiscal ‘24. We're expecting it more competitive and there's more non-current inventory in the network that needs to be addressed as well.\nXian Siew: Got it. Thanks. And maybe just a one quick one. Just on gross margin versus SG&A. How are you thinking about within the guidance the EBITDA margin? It sounds like it's mostly expense deleverage. Is that how we should think about it?\nSebastien Martel: There's some expense de leverage plan, but if I look at the lower end of the guidance range, you're probably going to lose a 100 basis points of gross margin. Probably coming from a bit more promotional and obviously the volume impact. And at the higher end of the guidance range, I'd say gross margin flattish to what we had in fiscal year ‘24.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Tristan Thomas-Martin at BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Good morning. Lot of talk about the snow headwinds is the potential of maybe a less snow warmer weather and early starts of season of tailwind for some of your businesses?\nSebastien Martel: I mean, I think we're, obviously we're not the expert in weather and it's not our job, but I, like I said in my answer a few minutes ago when you look at this snowmobile industry, it's quite stable. And if you look at the last 15 years, there was three bad snow season and the industry was quite stable between 95,000 and 105,000 units in North America and very flat in Scandinavia and in Europe at about 20,000 units. Then for us, it's a bad winter, typically the following year because of the non-current ratio available for consumer, the industry is quite stable, but it remained that we are happy to be more diversified than 20 years ago because obviously we have more product line, but snowmobile remained a very good business for us and our dealers, and we'll go to a bad season and we'll bounce back after. And just to add on Jose's point, and as you mentioned, the beauty of our business is yes, we are diversified and so if a product is not going as good, we are seeing an uptick in other products. And anecdotally, we've had some dealers say, you know what? My snowmobile business has slowed down significantly in February, March, but consumers are walking in and buying ORB product instead. So yes, we've seen some of that, and again, the beauty of being diversified.\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Fred Wightman at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nFred Wightman : Just a quick question on the implied EBITDA margin, I think it looks a little bit lower than what you guys had alluded to last quarter. Is that just a matter of the incremental de-leverage from the softer snow and marine performance, or is there something else going on there?\nSebastien Martel: It's mainly related to the volume impact and the revenue decline. So, the snow impact is having a ripple effect on the overall margin, but nonetheless, we're still, when you look at the guidance range, we're still looking to deliver even the margin in the mid-15 percentage points, which is significantly higher than what we had versus pre-COVID. And so, it's still very strong performance financially on our side, and we still see opportunities as we get through these onetime elements to continue improving our EBITDA margin down the road.\nFred Wightman : And then Seb, you talked about just from a cadence perspective, a softer first half with the stronger back half of the year. Are you guys assuming rate cuts in that outlook, and can you maybe talk about how quickly you think potential rate cuts could start to either catalyze consumer demand or dealer orders if floor plan rates come down?\nSebastien Martel: We've always said that we're not an economics, so we're not, we're not predicting any rate cuts in our guidance. We've assumed the current rates as they are today. If they happen, well, it'll be good news for our dealers, good news for our consumers, and hopefully we'll benefit from it as well with higher wholesale. But currently no and no rate cuts.\nFred Wightman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Benoit Poirier at Desjardin. Please go ahead.\nBenoit Poirier : Good morning. Could you maybe provide more color on Marine, given the impairment charge that was taken and the adjustment? Just wondering how much of a drive could it be right now, either in terms of EPS or how diluted would it be in terms of EBITDA and just trying to gauge kind of the rebound, we might see in terms of contribution going forward as you continue to grow that business beyond fiscal year ‘25?\nJose Boisjoli: The marine industry has had its struggles in the last year. We've obviously seen softer consumer demand and less demand from the dealer network that obviously impacted our profitability. And we had our issues as well with the ramp up in the Marine -- in with the new, many two boats, which obviously impacted profitability. And that is what drove the impairment charge we took this year. Obviously, our plan is to bring the Marine business to a much more profitable level. And so, I won't necessarily go into the details of the impact of that, but we do when we look at how we've designed these boats from a modular point of view and a more industrialized process of making these boats, our expectation is that the marine business should drive similar returns than some of the product lines that we have in the Powersport group.\nBenoit Poirier: Okay. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Jaime Katz at Morningstar.Please go ahead.\nJaime Katz: Good morning. I just want to clarify something on that last question. It sounds like, the impairment was more focused on the cost structure of the Marine business rather than what you guys think about if the long-term revenue opportunity set. Is that right?\nSebastien Martel: That's correct. When we look at the overall results that we've delivered in the last few years, the softness in the industry and the expectation for next year as well that will be a key or initial expectation and that's the main driver of the impairment.\nJaime Katz: Okay. And then, the, a lot of the expense deleverage that we're seeing this coming year is a function of sales decline. So, if we get back to, let's say, a low single-digit top-line growth rate in the following year, there's nothing really holding back expense leverage from accruing and theoretically we should go back towards where we were. Is that the right way to think about it?\nSebastien Martel: Well, I mean, we're diligent in how we deploy our projects and where we increase our overhead. And so, as the business as the volumes comes back next year and we increase revenue. Obviously, we'll have more flexibility in deciding which projects we do and which projects we don't. We might we'll increase overhead costs, yes, but we'll be selective in where we decide to increase it.\nJaime Katz: Perfect. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Luke Hannan at Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.\nLuke Hannan: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just going back to the target to bring down network inventory levels by 10% to 15% for the year. Is that a number that you'd established internally what you felt like the dealers should be comfortable with? Or is that a back and forth that's what the dealers felt they'd be more comfortable operating with in the network going forward?\nJose Boisjoli: When we look at inventory, we look at it internally. We look at it at days of inventory, and we want to have a good turn of inventory at the dealer level. And we believe that we had set a target ourselves during the COVID time not to go back to the pre-COVID level. And this is why we were proactive. And on top of it, you have the pressure of the high interest rate for the dealers. Then we're working hand in hand with the dealers to try to maximize, obviously, our business but also their business. And this is a decision we take, we believe, to protect value proposition of the dealers, the money they're making, the margin they're making with our product. We believe it's the right thing to do to continue to work hand on hand with them and continue to grow overall. And it's an internal target that we put together because we believe it's healthy for the dealer and us.\nLuke Hannan: Got it. Understood. And maybe sort of a follow-up to that then is just broadly speaking, how is the, we'll call it, the financial health of the dealer network as we stand today?\nSebastien Martel: The financial health of the network is very good. The interest cost that they have to bear is an important cost, but it's not the bulk of what's driving their profitability. It's an important component, but not the bulk. For them, it's obviously volume, and as you see, the retail is still going strong, especially for their side-by-side and ATVs. And during COVID, the dealers made a lot of money. And so financially they are in a good situation. The interest cost is higher because the value of the units are much higher than pre-COVID. The mix of the products is more side by side. The Swedish switch pontoon, so from a dollar value per unit is much higher, and so they see a much higher interest cost, and that's why we want to be diligent, but we have no concerns and we work hand in hand with our floor plan partners looking at the dealer health that there's a high risk in that area.\nLuke Hannan: Okay. Thank you, very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Brian Morrison at TD Securities. Please go ahead.\nBrian Morrison : Good morning. Maybe what are you seeing in terms of pricing from your competitors across your verticals in general? Because dealer inventory in dollars is up 60% sustain since the pandemic units, I think you said 30%, so that indicates very strong pricing over that time, which takes inflation to account. But the question is, are competitors remaining disciplined right now? As within your guidance? I'm just trying to reconcile price increases and market share gains in what's an increasingly competitive environment.\nSebastien Martel: It's obviously, yes, it's competitive. And we've been in this business for well over 50 years, so we know this industry very well. We know how to operate within these dynamics. But I'd say we're still below pre-COVID levels. There is discounting happening on non-current inventory. There's discounting happening on current models, but it is obviously a factor of higher interest rates where in order to stimulate retail, you want to offer certain promotions to bring the consumer in the store and give them a reason to buy the product. And financing the interest rate by subsidizing it is certainly something that is helping to move the needle. Both us and other OEMs are using this as a tool to stimulate retail and it's working.\nBrian Morrison: You are not seeing any competitive intensity heating up at this time?\nSebastien Martel: Again, it's a healthy battle. There is discounting that's happening, but nothing, I think nobody wants to buy market share. And so, I think there's a good level of promotional activity happening, but it's nothing crazy.\nBrian Morrison: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Mark Petrie at CIBC. Please go ahead.\nMark Petrie: Good morning. Thanks for all the comments as far I don't know, if you're able to or willing to, but could you quantify or give us a sense of the materiality of the revenue contribution of the new product introductions in the second half of fiscal ‘25? And just as a related question, I think, Jose, you mentioned you had planned to delay some of the innovation or introductions you had planned on electric vehicles. I'm just curious, the driver there, is that an internal constraint or is that reflection of not wanting to overburden the dealers at this time? Or what was the thought process behind that decision? Thanks.\nJose Boisjoli: Yes, I think, I think you nailed it in your last part of your question. I mean, right now, obviously, we've looked at all the new product we are introducing, and you need to understand that the dealer right now are focusing on reducing their inventory, but many of them are catching up on the growth of rest than year. During COVID, they grew significantly in some of the server shop is too crowded for the new reality. And the dealer are our need to focus on their day-to-day operation. And on our side, obviously, like I said in the previous question, we reprioritize many programs. And at the end of all this when you look to be successful in a new product launch, the dealer needs to train the sales people, the service people. He needs some space in the showroom. You need to invest in the new product line. And when we look at the workload of the dealer and what was reasonable, that's why we decided to introduce in August the Can-Am two-wheel that is think will be very successful. And we decided to push the rise at a further date. And obviously this morning, we don't want to go in too much detail, but basically this is what we've done. It's a question of balancing, the workload of the dealers with make sure that we have a successful intro.\nJose Boisjoli: And on the new product introductions, well, every year, Mark, and as you know, you've been following us for now 10 years. We always have a lot of product news. And that's the intention this year that the majority of the new products will be delivered in the fourth quarter, and so that's why in the gating of the earnings this year, we're seeing a higher back half loaded earnings adjustment and inventory of course in H1, but obviously new product moves, especially in the fourth quarter. So that will hit the fourth quarter. A lot of exciting stuff to come, but as usual, we like to keep our cards close to our chest and we will surprise the market in a few quarters.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no more questions at this time. I will turn the call to Mr. Deschenes to close the meeting.\nPhilippe Deschenes: Thank you, Sylvie, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning and for your interest in BRP. We look forward to speaking with you again on May 31st for our first quarter conference call. Thanks again everyone, and have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending. We ask that you please disconnect your lines."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the BRP Inc.’s Fiscal Year 2024 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. For participants who use the telephone line, it is recommended to turn off the sound on your device. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Philippe Deschênes. Please go ahead.\nPhilippe Deschênes: Thank you, Sylvie. Good morning and welcome to BRP’s conference call for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. Joining me this morning are José Boisjoli, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sébastien Martel, Chief Financial Officer. Before we move to the prepared remarks, I would like to remind everyone that certain forward-looking statements will be made during the call and that the actual results could differ from those implied in the statements. The forward-looking information is based on certain assumption and is subject to risk and uncertainties and I invite you to consult BRP’s MD&A for a complete list of these. Also, during the call reference will be made to supporting slides and you can find the presentation on our website at brp.com under the Investor Relations Section. So with that, I'll turn the call over to José.\nJosé Boisjoli: Thank you, Philippe. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. BRP delivered a sound performance in the third quarter as our team continued to demonstrate it’s commitment and resilience in a dynamic environment. We maintain our momentum in gaining market share in the off-road category and delivered financial results that came in close to our expectation. However, like the rest of the industry and despite our continued solid execution, we are seeing signs of softening demand in certain product category, more particularly in international markets. The situation leads us to proactively take a more cautious approach for the upcoming quarters as we strive to maintain a solid value proposition for dealers. We remain committed to continue to lead our industry and to further grow our market share. We believe that our proactive action will further solidify BRP position for long-term success. Let's turn to Slide 4 for key financial highlights of the quarter. Revenue reached $2.5 billion below our expectation due to softer demand in international markets and to a lesser extent, a temporary slowdown at the Texas Mexico borders which impacted deliveries of side-by-side and ATV over three weeks, near to the end of the quarter. The situation is now back to normal. With a strong product mix and tight expense management, we still delivered normalized EBITDA of $445 million and normalized diluted EPS of $3.06, both coming in close to our expectation. Turning to Slide 5 for a look at our retail performance. In North America, our retail sales were about flat with continued solid growth in ORV and snowmobile, offset by decline in personal watercraft, pontoon and 3-wheel due to a different timing of shipment this year compared to last. As you may remember, supply chain issue last year forced us to ship late in these product categories. It resulted in stronger than usual revenue and stronger retail in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 impacting the year-over-year compatibility. Excluding these affected categories, our retail sales were up 21% compared to an industry that was up mid-single digit. Our performance at retail continue to be strong in Latin America with a 30% growth. Demand was softer in Asia-Pacific and EMEA but we still outperformed the market in the latter. Also, we are expecting very low shipment in the short-term in the Middle East countries affected by the conflict. Turning to Slide 6, we see that we have continued to gain share since the beginning of the year in the North American Powersports market. Since fiscal year 2016, we have gained 17 points of market share to reach approximately 37%; more than one out of three products sold at retail is a BRP product. We have outperformed the industry in ORV, snowmobile and personal watercraft which shows the strength and the diversity of our product portfolio. Moving to Slide 7. At the beginning of the quarter in August and September, year-over-year growth remained positive in line with the trend observed in recent quarters. However, since October, we have started to see incremental sign that the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment is affecting the industry. As you can see, if we zoom in, on the ORV market; demand began to soften in our region, with more important decline in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, this trend is continuing into November. Reflecting this situation and considering the macroeconomic environment, we are proactively adjusting our all shipment plan for the coming quarters. This scenario is reflected in the updated guidance that Sébastien will discuss in a moment. Now let's turn to Slide 8 for a year round product. Revenue were down 8% to $1.2 billion. The decline was primarily driven by the different timing of shipment of 3-wheeled vehicle compared to last year and the temporary border slowdown which impacted ORV shipments. At retail, Can-Am side-by-side had another very strong quarter with retail up low-10% [ph], notably driven by sudden market share gain in the utility segments. Our industry growth came from the premium vehicle category. This market dynamic is very favorable for Can-Am given our significant market share in higher-end models. As for ATV, our retail was up mid-single digits, led by strong growth in the mid-cc segment, driven by the success of our newly introduced Outlander platform. We are pleased with the momentum of our off-road business. The strength of our lineup puts us in a good position to continue outperforming the industry. Looking at 3-wheel vehicle, we ended season '23 with retail down low single digit compared to an industry that was up low single digit. The slight decline came from the Ryker. While consumer interest remains high, entry-level buyers have been more hesitant lately. Meanwhile, the Spyder F3 and RT higher-end model have experienced positive momentum throughout the year. Turning to seasonal products on Slide 9. Revenue were down 15% to $869 million, primarily due to the exceptional high level of shipment last year and previously as previously explained. Looking at our retail performance, we are very pleased with the success of our Sea-Doo product line. We completed Season '23 in North America with an outstanding performance for Sea-Doo, leading to an all-time high market share. Furthermore, we ended the season with the number 1 market position in all the segments in which we compete and the number 1 position in all province and state. As for our Sea-Doo Pontoon, retail was up over 200% for the season. We ended with the number 3 market position in the U.S. but very close to the first 2 players. In Canada, we estimate that we finished the season with a solid mid-20% market share. Turning to snowmobile; while still relatively early, we are off to a very good start with our strongest season-to-date retail in the last 10 years. Looking ahead, retail trends for snowmobile are positive and we are well positioned with the strong level of presold unit. Moving to Slide 10 with Powersports, parts, accessories and apparel and OEM engines. Revenue were up 6% to $315 million, notably driven by higher sales of aircraft engine and Pinion gearbox. We also continue to benefit from a growing product portfolio and a larger vehicle fleet in use which led to higher sales of replacement parts and accessories driven by the LinQ ecosystem. We are notably seeing solid trend for the new Maverick R with buyer adding many accessories to their -- this trend demonstrates the benefit of developing highly integrated accessories which are available right at the [indiscernible] of the vehicle. Moving to marine on Slide 11. Revenue were down 6% to $104 million due to a lower volume of boat shipment. In general, dealer have high inventory and with higher financing costs, they remain cautious about accepting deliveries during the off-season. Looking at retail sales. From an industry perspective, we continue to see the category being more impacted by higher interest rates. For Q3, Manitou retail was down low 20% and Alumacraft down mid-30%. As for Quintrex, although it's still early in the season in Australia, retail was up low single digit. I am proud that our new Quintrex boat, the Freestyler X won a good design award in Australia. This prize illustrates the strong appeal and excellence of our new boat design and technology. This is the main reason why we remain confident about the potential of our marine business for the coming years despite current industry challenges. With that, I turn the call over to Sébastien.\nSébastien Martel: Thank you, José and good morning, everyone. While our top-line performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations due to lower deliveries resulting from an unforeseen slowdown at the Texas-Mexico border, our continued focus on efficiency and cost management helped us generate solid margins which, coupled with a favorable tax rate, allow us to deliver a normalized EPS, roughly aligned with our projections. Looking at the numbers, we reported revenues of $2.5 billion, a decrease of 9% compared to last year, primarily due to the different timing of shipments and slower deliveries of ORV products as previously discussed. We generated $627 million of gross profit, representing a margin of 25.4%, up 120 basis points from last year, primarily driven by a positive pricing impact net of cost inflation, lower turbulence costs, a favorable product-mix. These benefits were partly offset by less efficient use of our assets due to lower volume than expected, marine business inefficiencies, higher sales program and unfavorable foreign exchange rate variations in the quarter which impacted margins by 120 basis points. Moving further down the P&L, we generated normalized EBITDA for the quarter of $445 million, representing a strong margin of 18%. And our normalized net income reached $238 million, resulting in a normalized earnings per share of $3.06. Looking at the cash flow, we generated $695 million of free cash flow so far this year, of which we returned $409 million to our shareholders through dividends and by completing our NCIB, repurchasing a total of 3.5 million shares. Moving to an overview of our network inventory on slide 14. Our network inventory remains balanced at the end of the third quarter, only up 24% versus pre-COVID level, while our retail is up 43% over the same period. Still, despite improved days of inventory in the network, we are cognizant of the mounting pressure that our dealers face, particularly due to high inventory values and increasing floor plan financing costs. In this context and in response to recent industry trends and the mounting macroeconomic pressures affecting our consumer behaviors, we have decided to proactively adjust our production schedules. This decision is aimed at ensuring our dealers' inventory remains aligned with prevailing market conditions in order to protect our dealers value proposition and make sure that our mutual success is sustained. Turning to Slide 15 for an update on our guidance. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect to continue outperforming the industry, especially as we accelerate shipments of the new Maverick R sport side-by-side and the new ATV Outlander mid-cc platform as we sustain our momentum in utility side-by-side and as we progress through the snowmobile season which is already off to a good start. However, given the aforementioned challenging industry and macroeconomic backdrop, we have adjusted our shipment plan for the remainder of the year and are revising our guidance accordingly. For fiscal '24, we now project total company sales to be up 4% to 5%. From a profitability standpoint, the realignment of our production schedule to this new shipment plan is generating some short-term inefficiencies which, coupled with higher sales program, we expect will impact margins in the fourth quarter. As a result, we now project normalized EBITDA to be flat to up 2% for the year and normalized EPS to end between $11.10 and $11.35. Note that our results include a headwind of about $1.40 coming from higher depreciation and financing costs over the last year as we continue to invest to generate future growth and we are impacting by higher interest rate levels. As we approach the next 2 quarters with a more cautious stance, we are committed to staying agile and efficient and to continue diligently managing our expense, all the while continuing to set solid foundations for the long-term future of our business. We strongly believe our organization is well positioned to continue outperforming the industry and emerge from the cycle even stronger. On that, I will turn the call over to José.\nJosé Boisjoli: Thank you, Sébastien. I want to take a moment to share the success of the second edition of our Yellow Day. Last year, we choose intimidation as our global cause. On November 17, we rally our employees, dealers, ambassador, writers and partners to take a stance against all forms of intimidation. Our entire network embrace the cause and join in our global movement which makes me very proud. In conclusion, with the strength of our lineups, we continue to deliver robust market share gain over the last 12 months. However, like the rest of the industry, we are seeing softer demand in certain regions. Although we anticipate a few challenging quarters, we remain positive. We are known to be agile and we will make the appropriate adjustments as needed. Since we became BRP 20 years ago, we have never shy away from investing in our future, to build a resilient organization that is geared up to respond to market fluctuation. I am confident in our long-term strategy. With our commitment to operational excellence and constant investment in innovation, we are managing the business for continuing success. I am proud of our employees and I thank them for their relentless effort. I also acknowledge our dealers for their support. Together, we'll continue to deliver market-shaping product and remain the number 1 OEM in the industry. On that note, I turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. Please note that out of consideration for all callers today, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. [Operator Instructions] And your first question will be from Craig Kennison at Baird.\nCraig Kennison: So I guess I'm not surprised at all that you're seeing a slowdown given the macro environment. I'm just curious what you think happened in October and November that wasn't part of the ecosystem in prior months? It's just surprising to me that maybe it just happened so quickly.\nJosé Boisjoli: As you know, we're monitoring constantly consumer demand and the macroeconomic environment and H1 was in line with our projection and it continued in August and September but October, the decline happened in almost all markets but especially international. And the trend is continuing in November, at least with our numbers then. We believe that dealers have adequate level of inventory and you survey dealers often and you know that they have pressure on the higher inventory costs. So considering the macro environment, the European and APAC situation, don't forget there is two conflict in Ukraine and Middle East and the dealer challenges and the industry trend, then proactively, we decided to adjust the shipment for the coming quarter. And all of this is in the context of we continue to gain share. We believe we have enough inventory out there in the network to continue our momentum but we want to be more cautious to make sure that we protect the value proposition and we are convinced this is the right thing to do for the long term.\nOperator: Next question will be from Robin Farley at UBS.\nRobin Farley: I wonder if you have any thoughts about the M25 targets that you have out there, your longer-term targets? And if you see those as impacted or think that they could still be intact.? You had talked last quarter about even if the revenue didn't get there, the EBITDA still could. So just wondering how you're thinking about those? And then also, I don't know if you quantified in your comments there, you definitely talked about the outlook softening. Would you kind of put a ballpark quantifying your expectations for retail in North America in Q4 and into 2024 kind of what your current expectations are now with the reset?\nJosé Boisjoli: First, on the M25, the initiatives are not changing. They are the same. Our focus is the same. But obviously, like I just explained with the recent industry trend in North America and international and the macroeconomic environment, we're now working with more conservative industry numbers going forward. We want to be, again, responsible and we proactively do shipment to improve the inventory turn. And we believe that fiscal year '25 revenue could be down next year. And at this point, with the trend we're seeing, we don't expect to achieve the M25 target as planned. Now again, I would like to remind you that we're well positioned with the inventory we have to continue to gain market share and we target to remain the OEM of choice. And on this, I will give the mic to Sébastien, just to give you an idea about the numbers.\nSébastien Martel: Robin, it is obviously still early and we still have a few months to go before we firm up the assumptions for the planning for next year. But generally, we are expecting a softer industry. And from a profitability standpoint, heading into next year, obviously, we expect demand for premium products to remain strong. And that obviously is going to help from a mix perspective. And we do expect our marine business to be stronger as well next year as we've had challenges with the ramp-up of production and that impacted profitability. However, despite these benefits, we do expect some offsets, again, with lower volume, less efficient use of assets, probably higher sales programs as well because we are seeing other OEMs running with higher inventory and also higher promotional environment. And also, again, we invest in the business, so we should expect higher depreciation as well next year. OpEx will probably run higher as well as a percentage of revenue than we did this year. We are continuing to invest in growth projects. So all in all, when you combine all of these elements with a softer revenue, we could lose a point or so of EBITDA margin compared to this year. Again, as José mentioned, the strength of our lineups or brand, we are super well positioned and we expect the fundamentals of M25 to continue generating growth for us, especially market share gains but we believe we are taking the right actions to support our dealer. And also, we prefer obviously retailing current products and non-current products and that's why we are diligent in managing inventory.\nRobin Farley: Great. That's very helpful color for next year. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question will be from James Hardiman at Citi.\nJames Hardiman: And I think that was really good color on sort of next year. Obviously, nobody is going to hold you to that. It's pretty early. But I think you mentioned the softer industry for next year. Just to clarify, is that softer than previously expected? Or you actually expect the industry to be down next year? And if so, what does that mean for how you think about your own retail in fiscal '25?\nSébastien Martel: Yes. Well, as I said, we still got a few months ago before we firm up the assumptions for guidance next year. But given the macroeconomic and political backdrop there, we expect the industry to be down next year but we'll give you more color when we talk in Q4 on our results in the next year.\nJames Hardiman: Okay. But to clarify, you think the industry will be down. Could -- do you think your own retail will be down? Or do you think market share gains will be more than enough to offset that?\nSébastien Martel: Still early to give any color for next year. We'll obviously monitor how the situation is evolving in the fourth quarter and that's obviously going to be a big driver as to how we set up for next year.\nJosé Boisjoli: But we're confident to continue to gain market share. With the strength of our lineup, with the trend, with the premium, we're confident to continue our momentum with market share.\nJames Hardiman: Makes sense. And then on the inventory front, it sounds like days on hand are lower than they were pre-pandemic. Could you maybe quantify what that number was and how that compares to pre-pandemic? Just trying to get a feel for what should we should expect for the end of this year? And whether or not we should be factoring in any sort of inventory corrections as we look to fiscal '25?\nSébastien Martel: The -- today, as we mentioned there, when you look at our inventory turns, they're healthier than pre-COVID. But we want to operate with higher inventory turns than pre-COVID and dealers as well want that. The expectation for this year is that inventory at the end of Q4 will probably be flat to up single digit versus where we are at Q3. Obviously, very dependent on the how the snowmobile season will evolve but it's off to a good start. Next year, some of the wholesale adjustments that we will do will be as a result of managing the inventory in the network. So if you were to ask me, we said, would you want inventory to be lower at the end of next year than it is today. It's certainly something that I'd like to see because, as I said, we prefer retailing current products and non-current products. And so given the current backdrop and the softness in the market, running with leaner inventory is beneficial for us because of less programs and beneficial for the dealers as well because less discount.\nJames Hardiman: Got it. If I may ask, that was the follow-up. But if I may ask a follow-up. Do you think your peers will see the current environment in much the same way? It seems like there may be risk that if you're taking a really conservative approach and hoping to finish next year with lower levels of inventory if your peers aren't doing the same, then you could ultimately, A, lose market share but B, still feel the effects of a dealer channel that feels like it has too much inventory?\nJosé Boisjoli: But I don't know -- I don't want to predict what the peers are doing or will do. But one thing I can tell you, pre-COVID, we had less inventory than our competitor and we've been gaining share since fiscal year '16. And we're doing this by protecting the value proposition of the dealers. Then we're getting â€“ we truly believe in our plan that if we are increasing the inventory turn, protect the dealer profitability, this will pay off long term. And this, we had it pre-COVID from fiscal year '16 to fiscal year '21, we're gaining share with less inventory than our peers. And we want to make sure that, again, we're protecting the value proposition for our dealers and that will be more successful going forward.\nOperator: Next question will be from Martin Landry at Stifel.\nMartin Landry: I'd like to just get some color on the order of magnitude of your production costs -- your production cuts, sorry, for -- that you're making in Q4. Can you give us just an idea of how much you've cut your production for Q4?\nSébastien Martel: Well, the best way to read it, Martin, is by looking at the adjustment we made in the guidance. So again, with one quarter ago, we've adjusted guidance downward to reflect mostly our production cuts. And so that's the main driver from a top-line point of view. If you look at -- or we're expecting a strong quarter for year-round products because we're going to catch up from the Texas-Mexico situation that happened in the third quarter. So there's probably about 100 -- a little over $100 million of revenue coming from that. But also, we have Maverick R's to ship, the new ATV platform that's shipping and high-end side by sides as well. So we'll have a decent quarter there. And we're delivering the final snowmobiles for which we have preorders from dealers and customers as well. So expecting a good quarter as well for seasonal products.\nMartin Landry: Okay. And just trying to understand a little bit what's your approach to promotional activity. Some OEMs you've mentioned are very promotional. So what's your strategy to protect your market share on a go-forward basis? Do you want to match these promotions? Like how are you thinking about that?\nJosé Boisjoli: First, some of our competition right now are having promotion on model year '23 and '24. We have no promotion on '24 and -- but obviously, like normal, we have promotion on '23. Then we're trying to be balanced, obviously, again, to protect our brands and our value proposition and to continue our momentum. But it's a fine line. But at this point, we have more promotion, obviously, than last year but we are still, we believe, in the normal path like we had pre-COVID\nOperator: Next question will be from Joe Altobello at Raymond James.\nJoe Altobello: I guess first question, I was hoping to get a little bit more clarity on the softer demand and the adjustments in production. It sounds like it's mostly off-road and mostly marine. But -- is it really more across the board? Or is it primarily in those two categories?\nJosé Boisjoli: That's correct. Off-road and marine is where we've adjusted. We've also adjusted P&A because same story for P&A versus units. We want to be diligent in managing the inventory in the network as well. And so we've made adjustments to the P&A shipment plan based on the current inventory in the network. We do have a bit of visibility there and also expectations on retail in the fourth quarter as well.\nJoe Altobello: Okay. And just a follow-up on that. It looks like based on your revised guidance, you're expecting double-digit growth for year-round products in Q4. And obviously, a lot of that's the catch up that you talked about earlier from the slowdown at the border. But it also looks like your marine revenue guidance implies double-digit growth in Q4. So help us understand that dynamic given that demand is so soft in that category?\nSébastien Martel: Well Yes. We're lapping a very easy quarter last year in Q4 for marine. We were in the beginning of the ramp-up of the new Manitou boats. And as you know, it was a challenging ramp up. And so last year, we had very little shipments on the marine side. And so this year, now that the production is running much more smoothly, we are expecting to deliver the new product to the market ahead of -- and obviously, dealers need these units for boat show.\nJoe Altobello: And just one last one, if I could. The renewal of the NCIB, the timing of that, is that impacted at all by the fact that the Canadian tax on buybacks goes into effect January 1? Or is that not in your thinking?\nSébastien Martel: Well, obviously, we don't like the tax. We don't think that -- we think that the government missed the mark in putting the tax in play but it's not impacting our decision whether or not to do buybacks. So 2% tax that they're putting in place, if you look at what we've done in terms of investments over the last 5 years. And that tax is meant to stimulate companies to do investments in the business. But if you see the amount of CapEx we've done, the R&D we've done over the last 5 years, it's not because we've done buybacks but it has held us back. And so no, not related to anything on timing.\nOperator: Next question will be from Benoit Poirier at Desjardin Capital Markets.\nBenoit Poirier: Just to come back on the promotional activities, could you mention maybe quantify more color about the impact in the quarter and whether next year you're going to be trending in line with pre-pandemic level or above in order to maintain dealer inventory at a good level?\nSébastien Martel: For the quarter, the promotional environment was a headwind of 100 basis points in the quarter versus last year. You might recall that when we issued guidance, we said we expect promotional environment to be a headwind of 200 basis points. We got a positive tailwind of during [indiscernible]. The expectation is that we would keep a 100 basis points this year. Year-to-date, we're running at 190 basis points. So we're still within our expectations or our assumptions. And I expect the end of the year will probably end at 200 basis points. For next year, again, given that we are diligent in managing inventory, I think that's going to help us in being less promotional and making sure that we focused on dealer profitability. And as you know, dealers are making more money selling our products. And we think that is what's going to be driving our retail performance more than discounting non-current units.\nBenoit Poirier: Okay. Perfect. And just in terms of capital deployment, you end up the quarter with a leverage of 1.4. I would be curious to get more color about whether you still expect some working capital reversal in Q4? And how does the market softening impact capital deployment with respect to a potential SIB sub product launches or any opportunity maybe to look more closely at M&A over the next 12 or 24 months given the softening market environment?\nSébastien Martel: Those are few followings on that question. But obviously, given the production cuts we've done, it is going to impact the tailwind that we were expecting from working cap that we were expecting $400 million. So we'll probably be short of that but still, we're expecting a tailwind in the fourth quarter. We'll be generating over $1 billion of free cash flow this year. And so some of that went through the NCIB. We -- as you saw, we just reinitiated our NCIB and so we'll be opportunistic on that area as well. And as we said, our priority is to continue to invest in the business with OpEx -- with CapEx, sorry, because we're obviously very focused on growing this business and we've been successful doing so and we'll continue focusing on that. And as for the M&A, again, we've always been opportunistic. If it happens, we'll obviously consider it if it's strategic to our business. Certainly something that we look at but we're not necessarily in the market looking for M&A activity today.\nOperator: Next question will be from Xian Siew at BNP Paribas.\nXian Siew: Maybe given the kind of softer demand, can you talk about the cost base and how you can kind of maybe places where you can kind of cut the cost to kind of protect the margin. Any thoughts on that?\nSébastien Martel: Yes. Well, it always varies on how soft the market is. First thing we want to be strategic on what we look at when we address costs. We want to be flexible as well. But we want to protect the business for the long term. And so the last thing we want is cut purposelessly in activities such as R&D and key marketing activities that will hurt the business in the long term. But we want to be tactical as well and address short-term headwinds that we might see in the business. So there is room to adjust our cost structure in the short term, yet plan for the long term as well.\nXian Siew: Okay. Got it. And then I think you kind of talked about expectation a little bit for industry retail going into next year. But maybe can you think about the different geographies. Obviously, international is softer in October, does that kind of trend where North America kind of outperforming international continuing to next year, do you think?\nJosé Boisjoli: Well, if you look to our results in Q1, Q2 and Q3, I mean, we saw some weakness since the beginning of the year in EMEA and APAC. It's a market that fluctuated a lot in the last three quarters. Now obviously, at the end -- at the tail end of Q3, it was worse than what we were expecting. United States is still okay but there is some key economic data that we're following that we need to be cautious. The unemployment rate is still low at 3.9%. The inflation in U.S. at the end of October, the inflation is going down 3.2% at the end of October, the closer to the target of 2. Consumer confidence decline in July -- since July from 71% to 61%. And the credit card balance is record high, then there is a sign that the U.S. is also softening. And this combined to the international market, particularly EMEA and APAC. And again, the two conflict in the world, that's why we prefer to be prudent.\nOperator: Next question will be from Jonathan Goldman at Scotiabank.\nJonathan Goldman: On the retail trend, I was wondering if you can discuss the cadence of retail, how it's trended in November? Did you see the pace of declines accelerate versus October or show any moderation or any color on the cadence would be helpful.\nSébastien Martel: Well, on the -- we don't have industry numbers yet for November but our retail is still up but we expect the industry to be down in November.\nJonathan Goldman: Okay. Perfect. And then second, on the competitive dynamics, the presentation calls out elevated discounting by competitors on new model year units. Do you have a sense if that's largely a reflection of the worsening industry or weaker consumer or maybe something specific to a competitor strategy, maybe a share gain approach?\nJosé Boisjoli: I think in some industry, we're gaining significant market share. And some competitor want to defend their position. And this is why particularly ORV discount. What surprised us is discount on model year '23 but model year '24 product at this time of the year, it's quite aggressive but it's to defend their market share position.\nOperator: Next question will be from Jaime Katz of Morningstar.\nJaime Katz: I hope you can maybe elaborate on an earlier question about the marine business because if revenues are turning positive again, then can we assume profitability, at least at the gross profit line has hit a trough? And if so, could it potentially turn positive again in the fourth quarter?\nSébastien Martel: Well, marine had another tough quarter in Q3. Obviously, the longer ramp-up of both and very little shipments because dealer inventory. And that's the number 1 reason the weaker industry is obviously not helping. In this quarter, we also had a special charge coming from the legacy Evinrude business where we had a special charge on inventory and that impacted profitability significantly. And so our plan is obviously for the turnaround to happen. Some of it we'll see in the fourth quarter but the expectation is that next year, we'll see a much improved profitability on the marine front.\nJaime Katz: Okay. And then from a pricing perspective, I think there's probably some sentiment that it will be harder to raise prices next year. In which case, could there be some pressure on gross margin? And if so, what levers do you guys have or plan to use to mitigate those headwinds?\nSébastien Martel: Well, obviously, pricing is top of mind, especially in this higher inflationary environment and inflation on cost, on salaries is still there. So we'll be diligent in making sure that we price our products in line with the cost structure that we have. But one of the huge benefits we have is obviously our manufacturing footprint that is the majority of what we produce is in Mexico. And so obviously, we have a better cost advantage that are coming out of the production facilities we have. And also in our approach to designing our products through modularity and what we've just recently launched, a new ATV platform is under this new design approach. And so the majority of our lineup is on this modular design. And so that's obviously helping us drive better margins, I believe, versus the competition. And so it's giving us a hefty competitive advantage.\nOperator: Next question will be from Luke Hannan at Canaccord Genuity.\nLuke Hannan: José, I think you mentioned earlier that for three-wheeled vehicles, it was entry-level sales that were a little bit softer. Is that consistent with what you saw for your other product lines as well? And then maybe just following up on that, how have you been able to -- can you maybe describe the share capture that you've been able to do within the entry-level portion of your broader product lines versus premium, given that there's been a bit of a wash out of those lower-end OEMs in the market?\nJosé Boisjoli: Yes. If I give you some data that we follow on the value versus premium trend -- and obviously, it's different from one product that get to the other. But on the side by side in Q3 -- and this is the industry, the value product were down about mid-double-digit when the premium was up about 20%. And this is definitely helping us. And our numbers for the three-wheeled vehicle because we closed the season '23 in Q3, the Ryker category which we consider value with our three-wheeled lineup was down about 20%. But the F3 and the RT, the high-end model were up 20%. Then the trend that we saw since the beginning of the year where there is more traction on the premium and consumer that have lower household income are more hesitant to finance the product is affecting the value, then this is continuing. That being said, overall, if you step back and you look at the big picture, we want to win in each category but we are more skewed to premium product. And I think this is one of the reasons why we're continuing to gain share in this tougher environment.\nOperator: Next question will be from Cameron Doerksen of National Bank Financial.\nCameron Doerksen: Maybe just a bigger picture question around sort of the competitive environment. I know in the past, you made some commentary about dealing with a potential downturn scenario, there might be an expectation that some of the smaller players in Powersports might choose to exit the industry. We've actually seen some exits even in a good environment. So I'm just wondering how your thoughts around if we have kind of a protracted downturn in the industry, call it, a year or so? What do you think will happen with some of the marginal competitors? I mean do you think you'd still want to see -- still potentially would we see a trend where these companies will be investing less in Powersports?\nJosé Boisjoli: This is very difficult to predict what our competitor will do. But if we're focusing on our things and the dealers, the dealer right now with the slowdown in the industry, some dealers have at least they have option to decide and we believe that with the space that now our business is requiring, the space in the service shop, that some dealers could be -- would make the decision to drop some product line. And this is -- we're seeing from time to time and this could happen in this downturn. Then I don't want to comment on what the competition could do. But I think there will be some dealer who'll have to make some call on do they keep everything or they drop some smaller line for them?\nCameron Doerksen: Okay. That makes sense. And just as a kind of a follow-up and sort of related is just thinking about your CapEx as we look ahead to next year, obviously, you're not in a position to guide at this point. But part of your market share gains here have been you are continuing to invest in new products. I mean just directionally, what do you think CapEx might do in fiscal 2025? I mean do you think you'll still obviously continue to invest significantly the product line? Or will we see an easing off of that?\nSébastien Martel: We should see a continued investments in CapEx or a number similar to what we have this year is something that would be reasonable to [indiscernible].\nOperator: Next question will be from Mark Petrie at CIBC.\nMark Petrie: Yes and thanks for all the comments thus far, very helpful. Just a couple of follow-ups. I guess, specific to the fiscal '24 guidance implies about 100 basis points lower EBITDA margins for the year versus what you had previously provided. So Seb, I think you said programs are in line with expectations. So is the lower run rate just simply lost leverage on the slower volumes? Or is there another factor?\nSébastien Martel: The majority of it lower leverage from manufacturing side, given the, we'll call it the short-term production cut that we did. So less time to rebalance our production and be more efficient and the other one is OpEx as a percentage of revenue will be slightly higher because of the cuts in production.\nMark Petrie: Yes. Understood. Yes. Okay. Perfect. And then also just following up on the comments you shared with regards to sort of the demographics of the customer and sensitivity there. Can you just update us in terms of what you're seeing from the customer that's active in the business today, who's new to the industry returning to BRP? And any sort of color you can provide on demographics, that would be helpful.\nJosé Boisjoli: We didn't see any trend change into the industry. And this is -- we don't have data on this but we're hearing from dealers that there is more for the customer with lower income, there is more credit reject approval but we don't have any hard facts on this. It's more anecdote that we're hearing from dealers. But except that, Mark, we don't see any change. Obviously, the household income is still higher than it was pre-COVID. The new entrant, same ballpark but it's more the entry -- the lower household income customer who has more difficulty to finance their product with the high interest rate. And I think the banks are more restrictive than they used to be.\nOperator: Next question will be from Tristan Thomas-Martin at BMO Capital Markets.\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Of your kind of your fiscal '24 guidance for revenue, how much of that is [indiscernible]?\nSébastien Martel: I'm not sure I understand your question.\nTristan Thomas-Martin: I mean how much of that is either incremental, new product launches or channels so...\nSébastien Martel: Well, the -- as I said, the inventory -- the plan for inventory in Q4 versus Q3 would be the flat to up single digit. The channel fill is going to happen more with the new products that we launched in side-by-side and the high-end side by side. So the Maverick R is obviously something that will be channel fill. The new ATV platform as well is where we're going to be seeing more deliveries from obviously, there is some replenishment that's happening on the ORV side. But that's the main driver of Q4 wholesale.\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Okay. And I just want to follow up to believe with James follow-up as a follow-up. Is just kind of like your playbook is, let's say, the industry gets a little bit softer than you think or the competitors get more aggressive? Is it fair to assume that you would rather slow shipments then continue to ship and then have to subsequently promote?\nJosé Boisjoli: Yes. I would like to remind that we've been through those cycles many, many times and I've personally been through a few of those over my 30 years at BRP. And one thing we've learned over time is when you see the situation develop, you're always better to be proactive. And we've been gaining share since fiscal year '16. We have developed an incredible value proposition for the dealers and we want to protect that. And this is what we're doing. We just proactively -- we're just proactively reacting to a softer demand to make sure that we protect that. And we're convinced this is the right thing to do for the long term.\nOperator: Next question will be from Sabahat Khan at RBC Capital Markets.\nSabahat Khan: I'm just following up on kind of the dealer inventory question from just earlier. I guess you said you wanted inventories to ideally be lower kind of by the end of next year. I guess, can you may be shed a little bit of color on is that really if demand plays out or going to expectations? What are dealers telling you in terms of their plans for fiscal '25 in terms of do you have a magnitude on how much lower they would like inventories to be, given the floor plan financing costs? And maybe just kind of the follow-up is, are there any incentives or ways you're looking to help them with the plan financing cost if the current rate environment continues?\nSébastien Martel: Yes. First of all, the situation is not bad in the network. And we're in better shape than pre-COVID as we talked earlier in the prepared remarks, inventory is up 24%, yet our retail is up 43%. However, dealers have seen price increases, MSRPs have gone up and so the value of the inventory is higher. The mix as well is more richer. So we sell more high-end models from -- in all product categories. And the product-mix as well is different. There's a lot more side by sides with higher MSRPs, more switch as well. And so despite the dollars increasing by 24%, the value is up 50%. And so when you factor in as well a financing cost that is probably increased by 300 basis points for the dealer, they're seeing the impact of a monthly for [indiscernible] And so that's why we want to be diligent in managing the inventory, especially in the current economic context. We do support our dealers with a [indiscernible] plan period and we do support dealers as well when we come out of the season and there's more inventory. And so we've been active in the past to do this and we will continue going forward. And so we're -- we want to make sure that we manage that inventory. So there might be a reduction of inventory in, let's say, in the low-teen percentage for next year, that would be a nice number to achieve. But again, the situation today is not a disaster. It's very much -- very healthy when you compare it to pre-COVID.\nOperator: Next question will be from Brian Morrison of TD Securities.\nBrian Morrison: Many of my questions are asked but I want to ask about what you're seeing in terms of price in the used market? I think the question was posed earlier, I didn't understand the answer. There's obviously been some softening this year but are you seeing acceleration in October and November? And if so, what do you see is the magnitude [indiscernible] decline in used prices?\nSébastien Martel: Yes, we do have a bit of visibility on the used market but the used market is still healthier than pre-COVID. The gap of new to use has increased. I mean it was almost zero during COVID. Now it has increased. But someone looking into trade in a used product, will get a good value because MSRPs have gone up quite a bit in the last two to three years. So -- and plus, there hasn't -- there's been a shortening of supply in the last two, three years. So there's not actually a big used market contrary to what people might expect. And so it's still very healthy, Brian.\nOperator: Thank you. And at this time, Deschênes, we have no other questions. Please proceed.\nPhilippe Deschênes: Thank you, Sylvie and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning and for your interest in BRP. We look forward to speaking with you again in March for our fourth quarter conference call. Thanks, again, everyone and have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does indeed conclude your conference call for today. Once again, thank you for attending. And at this time, we do ask that you please disconnect your lines."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the BRP Inc.’s FY24 second quarter results conference call. For participants who use the telephone line, it is recommended to turn off the sound on your device.  I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Philippe Deschênes. Please go ahead, Mr. Deschênes.\nPhilippe Deschênes: Thank you Julie. Good morning and welcome to BRP’s conference call for the second quarter of fiscal year ’24. Joining me this morning are José Boisjoli, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Sébastien Martel, Chief Financial Officer. Before we move to the prepared remarks, I would like to remind everyone that certain forward-looking statements will be made during the call and that the actual results could differ from those implied in these statements. Forward-looking information is based on certain assumptions and is subject to risks and uncertainties, and I invite you to consult BRP’s MD&A for a complete list of these.  Also during the call, reference will be made to supporting slides, and you can find the presentation on our website at brp.com under the Investor Relations section. With that, I’ll turn the call over to José.\nJosé Boisjoli: Thank you Philippe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us.  I am pleased to report that we delivered a very solid quarter driven by continued strength in consumer demand for our line-up and the ongoing support of our dealer network. Solid execution of our plan led to an impressive market share gain and record results for our second quarter. Given this strong performance and our positive outlook for the rest of the year, we are increasing our normalized EPS guidance to a range of $12.35 to $12.85.  Let’s turn to Slide 4 for key financial highlights. Revenue reached $2.8 billion, up 14% from the previous year driven by higher volume and pricing. Normalized EBITDA grew 13% to $473 million and normalized EPS increased 9% to reach $3.21.  Turning to Slide 4 for a look at our Q2 retail performance, our product portfolio continued to gain traction with consumers, leading to significant market share gains. In North America, our retail sales were up 41% compared to an industry that was up mid-teen percent. Given our retail performance, this implies that BRP accounted for most of the industry growth in the quarter. We were also very strong in international markets with retail up 23% in EMEA, 36% in Latin America, and 33% in Asia Pacific.  Looking more closely at the numbers, we see that demand for products remains robust despite ongoing macroeconomic concerns. We just had our strongest second quarter ever at retail except for the first few months of COVID, where we experienced significant inventory depletion. Not only was our retail up 41%, but it was up 37% versus Q2 of fiscal year ’20, showing continuous gains. With this strong performance, we reached record market share for side-by-side, ATV and personal watercraft, all of this with retail incentives below pre-COVID levels. We believe those results are driven by the evolution of our customer profile over the last four years. The influx of new entrants remains high at 39%. We also continue to see high FICO scores, and the average household income from our customer survey is 40% higher than pre-COVID at slightly above US $160,000. Those customers are looking for more high end product, which explains our momentum in this category across our line-ups. Bottom line, the typical BRP product buyer remains in very good shape financially. This puts us in a favorable position entering the second half of the year. Turning to Slide 7 for an overview of key products introduced at our BRP Club held in Atlanta two weeks ago, this year’s club was one of the largest ever with 5,300 total participants in person and virtually. The highlight was the launch of the Can-Am Maverick R, our flagship model in the sport category. It brings a new dimension to riding with an industry-leading 240 horsepower engine, industry-first dual clutch transmission, a unique suspension geometry, and [indiscernible] technology. With this new offering, we are well positioned to gain market share in the high end sports side-by-side category. This was not the only product news, as shown on Slide 8. We improved our entry level offering with the first major evolution of the highly successful Sea-Doo Spark since its introduction. We also launched many new side-by-side models, notably the Can-Am Defender XT HD7, as well as the Maverick X3 RS Turbo, the industry’s most affordable mid-HP 72-inch wide side-by-side. These models offer a lot of value at price points that reach a wide range of consumers. We also continue to push innovation in the premium segment, which has seen the fastest growth in recent years. We introduced a full range of high end models, such as the Manitou Explore Max 300 HP, a pontoon with dual rotax engine, and the larger Max Deck, the Sea-Doo RXP-X and RXT-X with 325 horsepower and the Sea-Doo Switch Cruise Limited. We also added a touch screen with Apple CarPlay to our Spyder models. These additions represent a historic level of product news, which will help us to gain more market share and grow our addressable market while further improving our margin profile. All our new products were well received. The order process is ongoing, volume is as expected, the mix is currently trending slightly better.  Now let’s turn to Slide 9 for our year-round products. Revenue was up 8%, reaching $1.5 billion driven by strong shipments of side-by-side vehicles and ATVs. At retail, Can-Am side-by-side had its strongest Q2 ever with retail up high 20% and solid growth in all segments and price categories. We also finished the season with a 6 point market share gain to reach the high 20% range in North America. With this performance, we are very close to delivering on our M25 objective of reaching a 30% market share by the end of fiscal year ’25, but of course we will not stop there. Moreover, for the first time ever, Can-Am side-by-side reached the number one position in Canada with a market share in the high 30%.  As for ATV, our retail was up mid-30%. This performance was notably driven by strong growth in the mid-cc segment, reflecting the success of our newly introduced mid-cc Outlander platform. Also, ATV also closed its North American season with the strongest share gain in the industry, passing the 20% mark for the first time ever. We are pleased with the momentum of our off-road business and with recent product introductions, we are in a good position to continue outperforming the industry. Looking at three-wheel vehicles, retail was down high single digits compared to an industry that was up high single digits. While consumer interest remained high, the Ryker’s retail performance was softer in the quarter. As seen across the industry, buyers of entry level product are more hesitant to purchase at the moment; meanwhile, the Spyder F3 and RT models, which are higher end, had solid growth. With the upgrade on the model year ’24, we are well positioned for next season. Turning to seasonal product on Slide 10, revenue was up 30%, reaching almost $900 million driven by higher volume of snowmobile and Switch pontoons as well as favorable pricing. Looking at our retail performance, we had a very strong quarter for personal watercraft with retail up about 60%, again an easy comparable to a year ago. Remember that we had limited product availability in the network during Q2 last year. Still, this performance was exceptional from an historical perspective; in fact, our season-to-date retail is the strongest in the last 15 years. These results demonstrate the strength of our line-up and our ability to create new segments with models such as the Wake, Fish and Explorer Pros. These products bring new entrants to the category, which drives industry growth, and with our new product introductions for ’24, we are well positioned to sustain our momentum. As for our Sea-Doo Switch, our retail was up over 200% and we had the number three position in the U.S. pontoon industry over the three-month period ended in May. This is a great example of how we can disrupt categories by developing market-shaping product.  Finally for snowmobiles, we are currently in the off-season. We are confident for the peak season with a high level of units pre-sold to consumers.  Moving onto Slide 11 with power sport parts, accessories and apparel, and OEM engines, revenue was up 14% to $294 million. We continue to benefit from our growing product portfolio and vehicle fleet in use, which led to higher replacement parts and accessories sales driven by the Link ecosystem. We expect a softer second half than originally planned for our PA&A business as we anticipate dealers to de-stock inventory mainly for the Sea-Doo pontoon and three-wheel vehicle line-ups.  Looking at our recent acquisition, a key highlight was the introduction of Pinion motor gearbox unit, commonly called MGU, which combines a full power electric bicycle motor in our industry-leading gearbox in one compact package. This promising technology got excellent reviews following its introduction in June, notably winning the prestigious Eurobike Gold Award in Frankfurt. Now moving to marine on Slide 12, revenue was down 5% to $125 million, reflecting a lower volume of boat shipments. The revenue decrease is due to the slower than expected production ramp-up of the new Manitou platform, namely because of a supplier issue for an esthetic component which limited product availability. This issue has now been resolved. Looking at retail sales from an industry perspective, the boat category has seen weaker demand so far this year. Demand was affected by higher financing costs and poor weather in many markets, especially in the Great Lakes region which is key for both Alumacraft and Manitou. In addition, our retail performance was impacted the supply issue for Manitou, and we still had lapping months retailing welded boats for Alumacraft. For Quintrex, retail was down in line with the industry in Australia.  Given the slower production ramp-up for Manitou and softer industry trends in the boating sector, we decided to realign our plan for this year focusing on season ’24. While the year has not unfolded according to plan, we are encouraged by consumer reaction to the new boats and we remain confident about our strategy for the marine business. With that, I turn the call over to Sébastien.\nSébastien Martel: Thank you José and good morning everyone. We once again delivered solid results in the second quarter driven by robust top line growth, fueled by the sustained strong demand for our power sport line-up which continues to translate to market share gain and growing momentum with our dealer network. Our focus on efficiency also paid dividends as we ended the quarter with lower than anticipated turbulence cost and operating expenses. These elements combined with stronger than expected revenue growth allowed us to offset inefficiencies on the marine side to deliver results slightly ahead of plan. Our revenues for the quarter were up 14% versus last year, ending at $2.8 billion. We generated $698 million of gross profit, representing a margin of 25.1%, up 40 basis points from last year primarily driven by the favorable impact of pricing net of cost inflation and lower turbulence costs as we operated in a more normal production environment. These benefits were partly offset by inefficiencies related to the marine business, increase in sales programs which remain below pre-COVID levels, higher interest rate on floor plan financing, and unfavorable foreign exchange rate variations which impacted margins by 180 basis points in the quarter. Continuing down the P&L, we generated normalized EBITDA for the quarter of $473 million, representing a margin of 17%. Our normalized net income reached $255 million, resulting in a normalized earnings per share of $3.21, up 9% versus last year. Our free cash flow generation was also strong at $387 million, driven by a strong operational performance and positive working capital contribution. With a healthy balance sheet and the expectation for future cash generation in the back half of the year, we are well positioned to continue investing in growth projects for the business while retaining the financial flexibility to continue returning capital to shareholders.  Moving to Slide 15 for an update on dealer inventory, our network inventory is in a good position, striking the right balance between having sufficient product availability all while operating more efficiently with a lower number of days of inventory compared to historical levels. In fact, our network inventory is only up 24% versus pre-COVID while our retail volumes have grown 49% over that period, driven by industry growth, the addition of a new product line, the Sea-Doo Switch, and more importantly significant market share gains. We still have opportunities to further improve availability on ORV while continuing to work through the remaining inventory for summer product as the season is winding down. Looking ahead, we will continue to diligently manage our network inventory to ensure that we are well positioned to seize retail opportunities while continuing to operate more efficiently to limit the cost of inventory for both us and our dealers.  Turning to Slide 16 for an update on our guidance, we are entering the second half of the year in a strong position, having delivered strong financial results and retail performance in H1. With just five months remaining in the fiscal year, we are well positioned to deliver on our guidance, which calls for a solid year for year-round and seasonal products as our line-ups are driving consumer demand, and the positive response to our recent product launches reinforces our confidence and ability to sustain our market share momentum in H2. The competitive and promotional environments remain in line with our initial expectations and we now have better visibility into our shipment plans thanks to a strong booking of pre-sold units in snowmobile and as we will be filling initial dealer orders for multiple new products we just introduced. As such, we are comfortable re-affirming our year-round and seasonal product revenue guidance ranges. As for power sports, PA&A and OEM engines, we are adjusting our guidance to reflect softer trends in accessory orders as dealers are working through more elevated levels of inventory in the network. Similarly for marine, we are revising our guidance to incorporate our decision to realign our shipment plans for the year to focus on positioning the business for a solid season ’24. Following these adjustments, we expect our revenues to grow between 7% and 10% for the year. Continuing down the P&L, since our last guidance, the supply chain environment continued to improve; consequently, we now anticipate incurring less turbulence cost than initially projected. This adjustment and an improved product mix translates into an additional 50 basis point improvement in our gross profit margin for the year. Combined with our better than expected Q2 results, this margin benefit offsets the impact of lower than anticipated shipments for PA&A and marine, therefore we are re-affirming our normalized EBITDA guidance with a solid growth of up 9% to 13%.  This, when coupled with the benefit of a lower share count resulting from the buybacks we have completed at this point, yields a normalized EPS guidance of $12.35 to $12.85. Additionally, within the context of our realigned marine plan for the year, we have decided to postpone our boat capacity expansion in Mexico by 12 months. This strategic decision combined with timing of investments in other projects allows us to reduce our capex guidance by $100 million, now ranging from $650 million to $700 million. This capex reduction is expected to further reinforce our already robust free cash flow generation for the year. Finally before turning the call back to José, I want to highlight a couple of elements. First, as evidenced in our normalized EPS guidance bridge on Slide 17, the adjustment in our marine plan for the year has a negative impact of $0.60 on our guidance. Despite this impact, our capacity to elevate our normalized EPS guidance underscores the resilience of our diversified portfolio and our ability to deliver operational efficiencies. Furthermore, as we strategically position our marine business for a strong season ’24, you can appreciate that a successful year for that segment coupled with continuing momentum in power sports could yield substantial benefits for our results in fiscal ’25. Secondly, our guidance calls for a very strong second half of the year, as you can see on Slide 18. Although our top line growth may appear limited, I would like to remind you that we are lapping a period in which we had about a billion dollars’ worth of inventory replenishment, making it a difficult comparable. Nevertheless, our results for the second half of the year are expected to be very strong from a historical perspective, reflecting the solid momentum of our power sports portfolio and the underlying strength of the demand for our products. In terms of cadence, we expect to generate roughly 45% of the remaining normalized EBITDA for the year in Q3, resulting as usual in Q4 being our strongest quarter for the year. On that, I will turn the call back to José.\nJosé Boisjoli: Thank you Sébastien.  I am pleased with our performance so far in fiscal ’24 as we continue to significantly outperform the industry. Our strategy is simple - we focus on delivering industry-leading innovation across a diversified product portfolio and we team up with the best dealers. This gives us access to a wide range of customer base across all markets and regions.  Our ability to execute has delivered exceptional results over the past eight years, as you can see on Slide 20. We have gained market share almost every quarter during that period and we are now the number one OEM by a wide margin in terms of average unit retail per dealer. Looking ahead, we will continue to execute that strategy. The record level of new products introduced at Club positions us well to continue to our growth and remain the industry leader.  As for the remainder of the year, we expect demand for our product to continue driving our market share momentum and will stay focused on executing and optimizing efficiencies to deliver a record year in term of top and bottom lines.  In closing, I want to thank all our employees for another strong performance this quarter. I also acknowledge the support of our dealers, who made us the leading OEM in the industry.  On that note, I turn the call over to the Operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Petrie from CIBC. Please go ahead.\nMark Petrie: Hey, good morning. Thanks. I wanted to ask first just on the competitive dynamics in the industry. Obviously there’s a healthy rebound in sales volumes versus constraints last year, but I guess just commentary on the competitive dynamics, and then I know the sales programs are higher but still below pre-pandemic levels, so is that just higher than what you sort of initially embedded in guidance or is it just higher from last year? Thanks.\nSébastien Martel: Yes, good morning Mark. I’ll take the question on the sales program. They are trending in line with our expectation. Yes, the floor plan cost is higher because the interest rates are higher, but from a retail incentive point of view, we are trending according to plan. You might recall that we said we would expect about a 200 basis point headwind coming from retail incentives this year, and that is currently the assumption we’re working with, so no changes there.\nJosé Boisjoli: On the other question, Mark, there is not much change in the dynamic into the industry. All OEMs are getting better with the supply chain, and basically what I believe makes us different than the others is our focus on technology and new product and pushing novelty in innovation. On top, what is positive, and we see now more the stability, but the customer profile. As I mentioned in my remarks, the household income of our customer has increased by 40% since pre-COVID, and those customers are shopping for high end product, where we are good at. I think no big change in the dynamic of the industry with the other OEMs, but I think what makes us different is what we’ve been good at, pushing innovation, technology, and coming out with new products in new segments and more premium product.\nMark Petrie: Okay, thanks. I wanted to ask about the strength across the price points, and you called out Ryker as sort of underperforming relative to Spyder, but curious if that’s also the case in PWCs, where obviously you have a range across price points. Is that the same dynamic?\nJosé Boisjoli: It’s a bit different. Those two products are entry level products, but the Ryker customer is more, I would say, a midrange household income. Sometimes those customers are definitely more concerned with the macroeconomic and the inflation and all this. The watercraft Spark customer is more high household income, it’s people who have typically a cottage on the river, the lake, and they buy two watercraft for their family, then it’s a different profile. Same type of product, entry level, but different profile in customers. \nMark Petrie: Okay, understood. Then maybe just one last one, Séb, you mentioned the supply chain as sort of a 50 basis point tailwind in the second half. Is there still an opportunity for this to be a tailwind in next fiscal year, or will you be lapping stability by that point?\nSébastien Martel: Obviously this year, we are getting a huge benefit from a better supply chain, and I’d say also the teams are very focused on coming back to more normal operations and they’ve outperformed our expectations. We have solid people running all our plants, and so most of the benefit is going to happen this year. I might expect a bit of a benefit next year, but a significant part is being materialized, which is good news, this year.\nMark Petrie: Yes, understood. Okay, thanks for all the comments. I’ll pass the line. All the best.\nJosé Boisjoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robin Farley from UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great, thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit more about the sales promos that you highlighted kind of being tied to interest rates, that partially offset some of the margin improvement. Can you give us some color around the mix of your buyers that are paying cash versus financing and how that kind of compares to pre-COVID?\nSébastien Martel: When we look at the overall trends from our financing partners, there is not a significant change in terms of proportion of who’s financing versus who’s paying cash, so we’re still in a range of with our partners about 30%, but we know that dealers have arrangements with their local credit unions and banks, and another 30% is being done through retail financing there as well. About 60% to 65% is done through retail financing, the other is cash, but we are seeing higher FICO scores versus pre-COVID and that obviously is being highlighted, as José said, through the household incomes that are higher as well. But the acceptance rates are in line with pre-COVID and with COVID, and we don’t feel that our retail partners have tightened on the credit as well.\nRobin Farley: Thank you, and then just one follow-up. You talked about the higher demand, your higher customer income level, and obviously a lot of demand at the higher end. Can you talk a little bit about what’s happening at the entry level and whether it is a share shift to maybe some lower priced OEMs, some other imported product, or is it, do you think just overall, just less entry level; in other words, is it more of a share issue or a size of the pie issue at the more entry level? Thanks.\nJosé Boisjoli: I think it’s--obviously the inflation that we’ve been through in the last 18 months and the pressure on the macroeconomic and the uncertainty is scary for people who are buying entry level product, could be scary. But you know, our job is to make sure that we are competitive in the entry level, and we’re focusing a lot on the premium because that’s where we shine, but we still have Sea-Doo Spark and Ski-Doo MXZ below $7,000. We have many side-by-side models in Commander and Maverick between $13,000 and $16,000, and the Switch, which is an entry level pontoon below $24,000. What we’re trying to do is always keep good offerings in the value product and pushing, again, technology and innovation for the high end product. We want to have a wide portfolio of product to make sure that we please everybody. A positive thing, like I said before on the previous question, is the trend of the customer change in the last few years, and it’s benefiting us right now.\nRobin Farley: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Hardiman from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJames Hardiman: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my call.  I wanted to dig into the inventory situation a little bit. Obviously you talked about your inventory being up 24% versus 49% increase in retail. It sounds like you’re comfortable with where you are. I guess why is that, and ultimately why is there not a greater opportunity to replenish inventories? Then I guess sort of a second part of that question, in the prepared remarks, you talked about how some dealers were working through elevated levels of inventory - it sounds like it’s not your inventory that’s elevated, but help us sort of connect those two comments.\nSébastien Martel: Well, we’ve always said that coming out of the pandemic, we wanted to run our dealer networks with less inventory. We’ve said it, a lot of OEMs have said it as well, and dealers say it as well, and so we’ve been very focused on making sure that we have enough inventory so that the dealers have the right product offering when the consumer walks in, and they can close the sale rapidly and get the unit to the consumer rapidly. We also have flexibility in our ability to quickly deliver units to the dealers if they need them, and so our goal is to make sure that we have that right level. I’m actually happy to see that - again, dealers are saying that they have the right level of inventory, they’re able to meet consumer demand, and we’re managing it diligently. I mean, we are cognizant as well that interest rates are higher, so why put more inventory in the network? It creates more cost for us, more cost for the dealer network if we don’t need it.  Ultimately what we are driving for with the dealer network is not to create a great pressure where they’re focused on our units because they have them in the yard but because they’re making more profit selling our units, and one way of making more profit is by having the right level of inventory so that they don’t pay unnecessary floor cost. \nJosé Boisjoli: Just to maybe to add to Sébastien, I just came back from a club where we had many discussions about this with dealers. For sure, if you survey a dealer, they will tell you they have too much inventory, but they look at it in dollars, and we look at it in units. Again, I said it in the remarks, but our inventory level right now in the network is 24% higher than pre-COVID but our retail is 50% higher than pre-COVID, plus you have higher end product and you had all the price increases that we have done in the last four years. For sure the dealer, when they look at it in dollars, they don’t like it with the interest rate, but if they want to support the growth at retail and be able to supply to the demand, this inventory is needed. We look at it in number of days, and we are below pre-COVID.\nJames Hardiman: Got it, that’s helpful. Just to clarify, the billion dollar headwind that you’re lapping against in the second half of last year, that’s versus a zero this year’s second half, presumably, or I guess maybe put a better way, the days on hand, you expect to stay pretty constant as we move forward, maybe not quite a one-to-one wholesale to retail because retail is obviously growing, but is there any offset to that billion dollars in the second half of this year versus the second half of last year, or is that--is your retail going to have to grow by that much more just to get to sort of flattish sales?\nJosé Boisjoli: Well, if you look at what the implied growth is for the back half of the year, obviously there is that inventory replenishment that we did last year. About 60% of that was for seasonal product because of timing of shipments for personal watercraft and Switch, but when you look at the implied growth for year-round products based on the guidance, you’re talking about a growth of 11% to 16% growth - that obviously comes from the market share gains we’ve experienced over the last few years, the recently introduced products that we’ve done at the Club, obviously better pricing, better mix as well, and also by strong deliveries of ATVs as we’ve launched a brand-new platform. But I’ll remind you that in the last three years, we’ve gained three points of market share in side-by-side, and obviously that momentum is fueling wholesale deliveries and retail deliveries as well. \nJames Hardiman: That’s really helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Xian Siew from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nXian Siew: Hi guys, thanks for the question. Maybe first on the $0.80 better than 90 days ago in terms of the raise to guidance, can you maybe disaggregate between mix, turbulence costs and operating expenses? Then maybe within that mix improvement, what do you think is driving that and how much do you think that continues until, let’s say, next year? Does mix continue to be a positive driver for the next couple of years? Thanks.\nSébastien Martel: Yes, well about 40% of the $0.80 adjustment comes from mix. As José alluded to in his prepared remarks, we are seeing a healthy--a financially healthier customer buying our product. These customers are looking for high end product. We’ve recently launched the Maverick R - we’ll call it the next level in technology for the sport side-by-side, and that obviously is driving very strong margins. But from a utility point of view as well, the customers are asking for fully enclosed side-by-side with HVAC, and we’ve made adjustments in our production capacity in order to be able to deliver these units and meet customer demand, and that obviously is helping the mix favorably.\nXian Siew: Okay, got it. Then maybe on seasonal, you did better than the street expectation, but guidance was kind of held for the year. Were there any shifts to consider, and are there any kind of margin impacts we should think about?\nSébastien Martel: No, we were expecting a very strong second quarter for seasonal products due to better deliveries of personal watercraft and Sea-Doo Switch. Again last year, because of supply chain it was a tough quarter, and so now things are back to normal seasonal patterns. That’s obviously a big plus. The implied revenue decline in the back half of the year is really mainly related to timing of deliveries compared to last year, but all in all, we’re very happy with the season we had on seasonal. Sea-Doo Switch was our first real year of deliveries, obviously the demand was very good, and the performance of the Switch was also strong from a retail point of view and from an industry point of view as well, but nothing to highlight specifically other than that.\nXian Siew: Okay, great. Thank you. Good luck.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Fred Wightman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nFred Wightman: Hey guys, good morning. I just wanted to come back to the dealer inventory number, and I totally get that it’s below the retail share performance, but in the past you guys have given sort of a bridge between seasonal products and then also year-round products. Can you give us an update on sort of where the dealer inventory levels for both of those categories stand today, either on a year-over-year basis or next to ’19, however you want to talk about it?\nSébastien Martel: Well, when I look at the overall inventory position, what I’d say is for year-round products, we are comfortable with the inventory we have for both ATV, as we’ve started shipping the new model. For side-by-side, as I said, we have opportunities to increase deliveries, especially on the utility full enclosure cabin side-by-side. That’s a product that’s in high demand. Spyder, very strong on the traditional Spyder, we’re good there. We have a bit more Rykers, and that obviously will--we’ve put a plan in place to make sure that we get through that inventory in the next quarter. From a seasonal point of view, we finished the season. With personal watercraft, it’s going to finish in a month, very happy with the season that we had, good levels of inventory coming out of that season. The Sea-Doo Switch, strong season in some markets. The midwest was a bit softer than what we were expecting, so we have a bit of inventory there that we are working through and we’ve put promotions as well in those regions to make sure we get that model year ’23 retail and get ready for model year ’24.\nFred Wightman: Okay, and then just to follow up on the marine business, you guys are cutting the outlook, you’re delaying or deferring some of the capacity expansions - just a pretty big change versus a couple months ago, so can you just give us maybe an industry lay of the land as far as what changed, and maybe why you think it was so much different than what seems like solid demand for year-round?\nJosé Boisjoli: If you talk about the industry, obviously the weather was not the best. We didn’t have the best summer to start with. After that, many customers financed their boat 15 to 20 years, which is a very long period, and obviously the interest rates that climbed over the last 18 months affected, or people delayed. When you have a combination of interest rates going up in a summer that weather is so-so, some customers preferred to delay their purchase, and this is for the industry.  For us, what happened, and you know the story - I mean, I don’t want to talk too much about it, but we had--we were a victim of a cyber attack last fall, the operation in marine was the last to be reintegrated. After that, we had that supplier difficulty, and when we started to really ramp up with good volume the production in May, dealers already had high inventory of other brands, and at the end of the day, we were pushing too much, then we decided to slow down for season ’23 and refocus everything on season ’24.  Why we are happy overall, it’s first the product is well received, the product that we shipped in season ’23. We have introduced the dual engine Manitou that was very well received by the dealers at Club two weeks ago. The factory is now up and running and we are re-engaging the dealer and realigning all this for season ’24, then it’s a question about this. Obviously the factory in Mexico, we paused by one year. We’ve lost basically a season because of the industry and our--we were behind our plan, and this was just a logical move to do.\nFred Wightman: Makes sense, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Cameron Doerksen from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.\nCameron Doerksen: Yes, thanks. Good morning. Just trying to get maybe a little bit of a better handle on what you’re seeing in the retail. Obviously it’s still very strong for you, but I was wondering if you could maybe talk about how retail performed through the quarter, was it fairly steady throughout, and then what you have seen so far, I guess, in August? Obviously you’re facing a much tougher comp in your fiscal Q3, but maybe you can just talk about retail trends so far in the third quarter. \nJosé Boisjoli: The retail, if we look at the year, retail was soft in February-March but picked up very good in April and continued the whole summer. I know that some of you were concerned about the model year ’22 three-wheel and watercraft, but we’ve been able to sell most of them and we’re very happy the way the season unfolded.  For the third quarter, what is our expectation, I don’t want to go into too much detail and get into the habit of providing guidance every quarter for what’s coming, but overall we are in a good position for the second half because on the off-road, we have the new Maverick R, we have the additional Defender entry level product, the additional entry level product on the X3, and when I say entry level product in the side-by-side category, which is high end, we have the ATV mid-cc platform that is extremely well received, and the snowmobile line-up, as we’ve said, about half of our production is already pre-sold and we feel very good about off-road and snowmobile.  Obviously you can expect in H2 lower retail for watercraft and three-wheel because last year, we shipped the ’22 in Q3. When we look at the overall, we are planning the industry to be flattish, and us when you consider all the product lines, some reduction on watercraft and three-wheel and an increase in off-road and snow, we’re targeting to be around mid single digit growth for H2.\nCameron Doerksen: Okay, that’s very helpful.  Just secondly, maybe switching gears, just want to talk a little bit about the EV roll-out. I guess at the Club, you kind of described that the final product that you’re going to introduce on the electric side is going to maybe be delayed by about a year, and there’s been some, I guess, challenges in developing the technology. Can you maybe just talk about what the challenges are that you’re facing there, and just how the EV roll-out and end development is going?\nJosé Boisjoli: Yes, but first Cameron, I would like to remind you that we’re developing our own technology and we’re developing our own battery pack, motor, inverter, charger, software, and we believe by doing this all by ourselves, we will be better integration and performance than buying components that you need to put together, and it will be more cost effective. Doing this, it’s about people and suppliers, working with suppliers. This is going on. There is overall some delay, but it’s not--we had planned for some delays in some areas, but--and I just want to remind you that last year when we disclosed Rise and the two-wheel motorcycle, we said to the dealer that the product would be available in 2024, and some dealers, because we had some prospect dealers mainly from Europe in Atlanta, wanted to see with BRP what are the rest of the line-up, and we wanted to be very clear with the dealers. We could have decided to show the specs, the prices, the allocation, and our plan for network fulfillment, but we felt it was too much information against the competition. We said very clearly, all the details will be unveiled next summer, and delivery for both the Rise and the two-wheel will happen in the fall of 2024.  We’re not delaying by one year. You could debate some were expecting to have it earlier in the summer, but we are very basically overall on plan.\nCameron Doerksen: Okay, that’s helpful. Thanks very much.\nJosé Boisjoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Kennison from Baird. Please go ahead.\nCraig Kennison: Hey, good morning, and thank you for taking my questions. It’s been a good call. I wanted to ask on the credit side, do you have an understanding or a read on the percentage of your buyers that are exposed to student loan repayments in the U.S.?\nSébastien Martel: I know it’s been on the news feeds recently, changes to student loans, but no, we don’t have that visibility, Craig, what percentage have outstanding loans.\nCraig Kennison: Okay, and then maybe just said more broadly, I’m wondering if there’s a way to measure affordability in terms of monthly payments, if you look at a similar unit this year versus maybe pre-pandemic, how much more expensive is it per month relative to the income of your consumer, and do you see that consumer getting pinched in the climate we have today?\nJosé Boisjoli: Yes, good morning. I will give you an example of the Sea-Doo Switch, because we were expecting the question, and obviously for ourselves to better understand the dynamic. But many of the buyers buy boats financed 15 to 20 years, and if you take a Sea-Doo Switch, and we took a model Switch Sport 21-seat, if you were financing--and again, the rate could vary depending on your score, but high level, if you were financing a Sea-Doo Switch in June ’22, your rate was 7%. If you were financing your Switch in June ’23, this year, your rate was 8.8%, and in August your rate was close to 12%. The difference between, let’s say June ’22, it was around $250, and it was $100 more in August ’23. Now, you can debate, $100 for someone who really wants the product, some will justify it, but when you commit for 15 or 20 years, it’s a long payment, and I think the rate increased so much in the last 12 months that some customers are reflecting if they will buy or not, and that’s why--that’s what affected, I believe, the boat industry.\nCraig Kennison: That’s a really helpful example. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Martin Landry from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMartin Landry: Hi, good morning guys. Maybe just a follow-up to that. The power sports industry has been very resilient when you compare to the boating industry, and also when you compare to the RV industry. Is that resilience just related to price points, is that it? Is that the main explanation why the power sports industry is not seeing much sign of weakness versus other industries?\nJosé Boisjoli: Well, the big difference between power sports and marine is in power sports, typically the people who finance will be three to five years, then your commitment is shorter. The other thing is the OEMs are--it’s easier for the OEMs to subsidize or to do a sales program to support the customers. I give you an example for us. Today we have, depending on the product line, for model year ’23 we have some offers that vary from 2% to 4% for 36 to 60 months, and this is very different than the example I gave into the marine business, both where obviously the rate is higher, the period is higher, and it’s more difficult for the OEM to justify the subsidizing. I think this is a big difference between the two industries.\nSébastien Martel: And Martin, if I could add one extra element there, if we look at what has happened to MSRPs in the last, call it the last four years since the onset of COVID, we saw much higher increases in MSRP in the marine and the RV sector than we’ve seen in the power sports sector. I’ll just give you an example. If I look at personal watercraft, model year ’20 to model year ’24, we’ve increased pricing by 17.4% in the U.S., whereas the boating industry has increased pricing by over 40%, and so that obviously makes the ticket item much higher for marine than for power sports. I think that’s one factor that’s also helping the power sports industry.\nMartin Landry: Okay, that’s good color. That’s helpful.  Maybe on [indiscernible] your guidance, your back half guidance implies strong EBITDA margins, I think higher than 18% according to our math. Sébastien, you touched in your opening remarks, heading into fiscal ’25 with strong momentum. Just trying to understand those strong margins in the back half, is there a seasonal tailwind here or can these higher margins be sustainable long term?\nSébastien Martel: Well, customarily we have usually higher margins in the back half of the year. Q3 is a quarter where we have strong margins, the mix is very strong in snowmobile, and also we’re expecting very strong mix in side-by-side. As I said and highlighted, the teams are over-performing from an operations point of view and from a [indiscernible] point of view, which is also driving good savings, which will be there next year. As you know, next year is our M25 anniversary date and so where we have ambitious financial objectives, and our plans are still very much in line with the M25 objective. When you look at what we have delivered since we have done our investor meeting last June, or last year, on the side-by-side side we are just shy of that 30% market share objective that we had given ourselves, and especially with the recent product introductions, that will obviously drive continued market share gains. ATV, we finished very strong this season with 20% market share, and there’s going to be continued momentum as we’ve just started delivering the new platform.  We finished the season with record market share in snowmobile and personal watercraft, so that obviously bodes well for next year. Sea-Doo Switch, we always said we want this to be a $500 million business. This year, we will be at $500 million, so again continuation next year, so everything in power sports is in line and even better than our plan. Again, if I want to put things into perspective, if you look at the last 12 months, we’ve gained about six points of market share in the power sport industry, and every point of market share we gain is about $190 million of revenue, so with the recent product introductions, the momentum, the brand, the dealer engagements, we are well positioned for next year. Marine, softer than expected but we are obviously making the necessary steps to position it well for next year. [Indiscernible] is going very well, as I mentioned. The modular design is paying off and we have a greater proportion of vehicles being produced in Mexico, so all in all if the industry remains the same and consumer demand is maintained, we feel very comfortable with our plans for next year, Martin.\nMartin Landry: Okay, that’s helpful. Congrats on your results.\nJosé Boisjoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jaime Katz from Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nJaime Katz: Hi, good morning. I hope you can just dissect your outlook on gross margin a little bit more, just on the ability to take pricing, the premiumization of the mix, and then how much more of the logistics tailwinds are left to help hold that metric up. Thanks.\nSébastien Martel: Yes, obviously we had very good gross margin in the second quarter. When I look at the puts and takes of the margin, obviously pricing net of inflation was a big driver - that was a tailwind of 170 basis points, offset by programs. We said our expectation for the year was 200 basis point headwind; this quarter, it was 170 basis points. Floor plan costs are higher as well - that’s a headwind of 100 basis points, and in terms of turbulence, we’re looking at a 250 basis point tailwind. A big tailwind in Q1, big tailwind in Q2, that’s going to taper down in Q3 and Q4, as even last year Q4, we saw benefits from turbulence costs, but overall in line with our--in our plan, plus adjustments we’ve made in the guidance, and as we mentioned, we had FX, which was a headwind for 180 basis points in the quarter. Obviously strong gross margins, strong EBITDA margins driven by again the great mix, product that commands these margins, and as well great operational efficiency from the teams.\nJaime Katz: Then are there any inefficiencies that will stem from pushing the facility out that will weigh on gross margin next year, the build-out of that marine facility? Thanks.\nSébastien Martel: Not significant when you look at the cost to build a plant. Yes, there is some operating expenses associated with it, but when you look in the grand scheme of things, it’s not that material.\nJaime Katz: Thanks, helpful.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Altobello from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJoe Altobello: Thanks. Hey guys, good morning. Just wanted to go back to your comments regarding M25. You mentioned power sports is trending well, marine not so much, and you mentioned you’re pushing back capacity expansion by 12 months. Is it safe to assume that we should think about the marine M25 targets as getting pushed back a year as well, and has your long term outlook for that segment changed at all?\nJosé Boisjoli: Yes, if you remember, in the M25 we were targeting by the end of fiscal year ’25 to be at $1 billion. It’s too early to say if we--what will happen. I think we need to wait to see how the industry will unfold, beginning of the year, the boat show and all this. But you know, for me this is short term. For the marine, the vision that we have is working, it’s just a matter of execution this year, and we will realign for next year then. I think it’s too early for the $1 billion in M25 or fiscal year ’25 for marine, but it doesn’t change the overall picture, like Sébastien described, for the overall BRP M25 objective next year.\nJoe Altobello: Okay, that’s helpful. Maybe just a quick question for Séb, I wanted to better understand how you see overall gross margins versus opex playing out this year. I think the prior expectation was gross margins would be up 50 basis points, opex up 50 basis points so they sort of offset, but it sounds like that’s still the case on the gross margin line but we’re looking to see maybe some lower, or less of an increase in opex. I’m curious if I have that right and where that’s coming from.\nSébastien Martel: Yes, the initial estimate when we issued guidance was that we’d get a tailwind on gross margin of 50 and we’d get a headwind on opex of 50, so net flat EBITDA margin year-over-year at 17%. Now with the revised numbers, gross margin, it will be a tailwind of about 100 basis points, and we’d get a tailwind from opex of 50, so--pardon? Yes, and so that would be for this year, delivering strong EBITDA margin this year.\nJoe Altobello: Okay, great. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Luke Hannan from Canaccord. Please go ahead.\nLuke Hannan: Thanks and good morning. I’ll start off with a quick one. Sébastien, I believe you said last quarter that for the year, you expected working capital [indiscernible] roughly $400 million. I may have missed it if you mentioned it earlier in the call, but do you still expect to see that level of tailwind for the year?\nSébastien Martel: Yes, we’ve generated strong cash flow, free cash flow since the beginning of the year, over $500 million for the first six months total free cash flow, with minimal working capital benefit, as I said. We’re still running with higher levels of inventory, we’ll call it safety stock, but obviously with the good results that we’re seeing from the supply chain turbulence, the expectation is that we will be able to achieve our $400 million working capital benefit at the end of the year.\nLuke Hannan: Okay, and then a higher level question here. I appreciate the commentary earlier in the call, José, about the market share that you’ve been able to gain in SSV, particularly in Canada, but I guess just taking a step back and from a higher level structurally, when it comes to the competitive dynamics or anything else inherent to that product line specifically, is there any reason why longer term, you wouldn’t be able to achieve a market share in SSV similar to what you have right now in snowmobiles and personal watercraft?\nJosé Boisjoli: There is no reason. You know, we’re going step by step. On the M25, the objective was to reach 30% market share. We’re almost there and we will pass that 30% next year. After that, with the momentum that we have and the product innovation, we will not stop there, like I said in my prepared remarks. For us, you know, it’s always, like I said, in some--many investors are asking why are you gaining so much versus others that are not able, but as we said, in 2015 when we introduced the Defender, we wanted to convey a strong message about our commitment in the side-by-side industry, and that’s where we committed of a new model every six months for the next four years. That message convinced many dealers to convert more space to BRP, and with our capacity to come out with innovative products, pushing technology, pushing design, combined with that commitment, it was like a big wheel that did start in motion, and today the wheel is really in motion.  I believe that with our continued push on product and helping the dealers and working with the dealers to continue to grow, this is what explains the success. Definitely I will not commit this morning about any specific number for any dates, but I can assure you we will not stop at 30%.\nLuke Hannan: Great, thanks for the commentary.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Morrison from TD Securities. Please go ahead.\nBrian Morrison: Hey, good morning. Thanks for all the clarification comments. I have one further question to clarify, though. Séb, you mentioned on Slide 18 and your prepared comments that you’re lapping H2 fiscal ’23, there’s $1 billion of inventory replenishment. How much of that--how much was inventory replenishment revenue in fiscal ’23, how much do you estimate will be in fiscal ’24, and how much is there to go in the second half? I understand that retail unit sales are well in excess still of the increase in inventory at retail.\nSébastien Martel: As of today, Brian, I’d say we’re pretty much done on the inventory replenishment. Obviously there is going to be some seasonal elements where we might find, okay, there’s snowmobile that’s going to be there at Q3 more than last year, but from an overall business point of view, their inventory replenishment is not a tailwind for us. Growth in inventory will come with growth in market share or growth in industry, but not from putting more units at the dealership.\nBrian Morrison: Okay, and how much replenishment was there this year and last?\nSébastien Martel: Well, last year was a billion. We probably did $250 million at the beginning of this year, and in fiscal year ’23, I’d have to check, but not that significant, probably same in this year. But obviously the bulk was in the second half of last year.\nBrian Morrison: Right. Then on Slide 17, you said there’s lower shipments of PA&A, primarily due to Sea-Doo pontoon. Can you just reconcile that with the strength of the Switch? Was it just the pre-builds because the product was in its infancy last year?\nSébastien Martel: Well, last year, as you know, we under-delivered in terms of Sea-Doo Switch pontoons, and so dealers--we under-delivered units, but we delivered--dealers had ordered parts and accessories, and so they had quite a bit of inventory on hand. This year, they were able to cycle through their inventory, get it to the dealers, but they still have a bit more inventory, and so dealer levels are higher from a PA&A side, and so they will be adjusting their dealer inventory and they’re ordering less from us.\nBrian Morrison: Okay, simply timing. Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tristan Thomas-Martin from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Good morning, just one question from me. How are dealers approaching holding inventory or maybe ordering over their off seasons any different given how elevated floor plan costs are?\nJosé Boisjoli: It’s a bit funny. I was again with power sports dealers and marine dealers two weeks ago, and if you talk to dealers, like I said in the question before, they don’t like the inventory in dollars and the interest, but at the same time when we take an order, it’s like a discussion between your growth and what you’re planning and basically orders in line with our expectations. That’s why we said the volume is in line with expectations but with a richer mix. It’s a bit funny, the power sport dealers right now, most of them complain about the interest bill at the end of the month, but they still--they understand that to support the growth, they need to invest in working capital.\nSébastien Martel: Yes, and the other thing is that dealers do trust us, that we’ll make the right decisions. One thing that’s important is that we do support the inventory in the first 60 to 90 days when the unit is shipped, so obviously that is a burden that they do not have. We have, and we accept it. The other thing is in the past, if we’ve ended a season with too much inventory, we’ve always been there to step in and support the dealers with their floor plan financing, and that’s something that we’ve done and that’s something that we will continue to do if a season would end up to be not as good as expected and they’d have more inventory. There is a level of trust there that exists between us and the dealers on that side.\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Okay, so they’re complaining more but they’re not changing their habits? Got it, thank you.\nSébastien Martel: Well I mean, they’ve lived in a perfect world for two years - they had no floor plan financing costs and so they forgot what it was, and now they have inventory, which they’re happy because that allows them to sell, but there is obviously a higher interest rate and higher floor plan that comes with it, so there is sticker shock but it’s a cost of doing business.\nJosé Boisjoli: It’s like meals in the restaurant - more expensive, but you still go.\nTristan Thomas-Martin: Sounds good, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Kypreos from Desjardins. Please go ahead.\nMichael Kypreos: Good morning and congrats on the strong results. Just one quick one for me, maybe on the snowmobile front. I think you mentioned 50% had been presold, the same figure that you had mentioned last quarter. Have you seen any early signs of cancellations, or is everything setting up well for a strong season in your point of view, especially with one of your competitors saying that they’re going to exit the market?\nJosé Boisjoli: No, no sign of--every year, you have some fallout and some cancellations, but I haven’t heard any dealers saying that this year was worse than previous years. Snowmobile customers are different than the others. Some will save money and that’s the last thing they will cut in their budget because it’s a passion, and we believe we’re in good shape for the snowmobile season.\nMichael Kypreos: Appreciate the color, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Goldman from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Goldman: Hi, good morning guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Most of them have been answered, just two housekeeping ones. José, you talked about possibly exceeding the 30% market share in side-by-side next year. I just wanted to, if you can revisit the capacity that you have in side-by-side currently and coming online, what market share could that support over the next two years, or year and a half?\nJosé Boisjoli: Oh, that’s a good one. First, we have plenty of capacity for next year’s season. We will not reach the maximum of our capacity. As you remember, we build Juárez 1-- Juárez 2, sorry, in two phases and Juárez 3 in two phases, then we have plenty of capacity for next year for sure. Now we’re even looking how we could tweak and maybe optimize the capacity within those two factories. I think there are ways where with small investments, you can even increase the capacity above what we had planned two years ago.\nJonathan Goldman: Perfect, that’s helpful. Then just I guess one for you, Sébastien, on the reduced capex guide by $100 million, does that change your thinking around capital allocation for this year at all?\nSébastien Martel: No, we’re still going to be generating strong free cash flow even before the reduction of capex, and obviously we’ve been active with buybacks. We still have about 900,000 shares to buy back under the NCIB, but the priority, as we’ve always said, is investing in growth and any excess free cash flow will be used to obviously return it to shareholders, which we’ve been very good at doing in the last few years.\nJonathan Goldman: Okay, thank you. That’s it for me.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, as a reminder, should you have a question, please press the star followed by the one. Your next question comes from Brandon Rolle from DA Davidson. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Rolle: Good morning. Thank you for taking my quick question. Just circling back to the fiscal year ’25 earnings targets and revenue guidance, could you just speak to your level of confidence to hit those targets? I feel as though there’s a view out there it’s going to be impossible for you to hit, even the low end of that earnings range. I know you talked about the market share gains, but just overall, where could there be some downside to the current guidance and are you still comfortable with hitting those earnings targets? Thanks.\nSébastien Martel: Well, as I said to Martin’s question, when we look at all the positives that have been happening, there’s been a lot. We’re ahead of plan on a lot of the elements, and again if the consumer sentiment is to remain as it is today, we strongly believe that the M25 target is achievable. Now, if there was going to be a soft landing in everybody’s calls or a recession, obviously we’d revisit our plans, but we can’t manage the business one foot on the gas and one foot on the brake. Today when we look at the great momentum that we have, there’s no reason why we could not achieve the target next year.\nBrandon Rolle: Great, thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call to Mr. Deschênes to close the meeting.\nPhilippe Deschênes: Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and for your interest in BRP. We look forward to speaking with you again for our third quarter conference call on November 30. Thanks again everyone and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for joining and you may now disconnect your lines. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the BRP Inc.'s FY'24 First Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Philippe Deschenes. Please go ahead, Mr. Deschenes.\nPhilippe Deschenes: Thank you. Good morning and welcome to BRP's conference call for the first quarter of fiscal year '24. Joining me this morning are Jose Boisjoli, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sebastien Martel, Chief Financial Officer. Before we move to the prepared remarks, I would like to remind everyone that certain forward-looking statements will be made during the call and that the actual results could differ from those implied in these statements. The forward-looking information is based on certain assumptions and is subject to risks and uncertainties. And I invite you to consult BRP's MD&A for a complete list of these. Also during the call reference will be made to supporting slides and you can find the presentation on our website at brp.com under the Investor Relations section. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Jose.\nJose Boisjoli: Thank you, Philippe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that we are off to a good start for fiscal '24 as our solid production portfolio continued to drive strong demand globally. While the quarter started more slowly at the retail level due to the late arriving spring season, the momentum picked up in April. This allowed us to deliver another solid quarter at retail and gain further market share. From a financial standpoint, we continue our strong execution and delivered solid results that put us on pace to meet our guidance for the year. Let's turn to slide four for key financial highlights. Revenue reached 2.4 billion, up 34% from the previous year, driven by higher volume and pricing, as well as a more favorable mix. Normalized EBITDA grew 39% to $377 million and normalized EPS increased 43% to reach $2.38. Turning to slide five for a look at our Q1 retail performance. The strength and the wide range of our Powersports offering continue to drive strong results. In North America, our retail sales were up 3% for the quarter or up 8%, excluding snowmobile. Remember that last year our snowmobile shipments were made later than usual in the season, which led to usually higher retail in the first quarter of fiscal year '23. This compared to an industry that was down low single-digit. Our performance was also solid in other geographical markets, with retail up 14% in EMEA and 25% in Latin America. In Asia-Pacific, our retail was down roughly in line with the industry. As shown on slide six, our retail progressively improved as we move through the quarter. Retail declined in February and was relatively flat in March due to poor weather as well as different timing of shipment for certain products which make year-over-year comparison difficult like I point out for snowmobile. However, the momentum picked up significantly in April as weather improved and consumer reacted positively to certain retail incentives. The trend continued in May. Moreover, despite ongoing macro concern, many indicators are pointing to healthy consumer interest for our industry and more particularly for our product, such as continued strong demand for our line-up. For instance, we've just closed our snowmobile booking for the upcoming season and pre-sold unit to consumer ended up about 25% above our target. The financial position of consumer remained healthy with lending application continuing to show FICO score above historical level. The influx of new entrants remained high at 28% and web searches for different product category remain higher than pre-COVID level. Now let's turn to slide seven for Year-Round product. Revenues were up 43%, reaching $1.3 billion in Q1, driven by strong shipments of side-by-side and three-wheeled vehicles, as well as favorable product mix and pricing. At retail, Can-Am side-by-side had its strongest Q1 ever, with the Commander, Defender and Maverick X3 all gaining share in their respective markets. Our retail was up low single-digit, but the momentum improved significantly through the period. April retail was our third strongest month ever, only trailing the first two months of COVID. As for ATV, our retail was down low-teen percent limited by the ramp up in production of the new mid-cc outlander platform. This new platform has been very well received by our dealers and the media, which position us well to continue our momentum as the OEM with the highest market share gain in the industry so far this season. Looking at three-wheeled vehicle, Can-Am retail was up low single-digit. Early in the quarter, retail was impacted by the weather and by a product recall. It then picked up nicely in April with high-teen growth and the momentum continued in May. All-in-all, we are pleased with our performance in the three-wheeled category and we believe that we are well positioned heading into the most important retail period. Turning to Seasonal Product on slide eight. Seasonal product revenue were up 69% from last year, reaching $692 million, driven by higher volume of Sea-Doo Personal Watercraft and Pontoon. Looking at our retail performance. In snowmobile, we closed the '23 season in North America on March 31st, which we fell down low single-digit, but with a 1% point market share gain, which further increased our historical record level. We also ended the season with the number one position in each segment in which we compete, including the youth category that we've just entered last season. In Scandinavia, our market share also improved, gaining four percentage points by the end of the season. Also, as I mentioned, we recently closed our spring customer orders for the Season '24 model and pre-sold level in North America came in about 25% above target. The solid bookings significantly improved our visibility on expected volume and sell-through for our snowmobile business. For this season, we have increased our seasonal product revenue guidance for the year, as Sebastien will explain in a few minutes. Looking at Sea-Doo product. While still early in the season, our retail for Personal Watercraft is performing very well up in the mid 30% for the quarter and the solid trend continue in May. We are also seeing strong momentum in international markets with retail up over 40% in Latin America and over 50% in EMEA. As for our Sea-Doo Pontoon, our retail was up significantly, even if it was a very small base, as we're ramping up the initial production during Q1 last year. To give you a better understanding of our momentum with this product, in less than one year, the Sea-Doo Switch has already reached the number two position in the US Pontoon industry for the last three months ended in March. This is a superb example of how we can disrupt categories by developing market shaping products. As you can see both our Sea-Doo Personal Watercraft and Pontoon are performing well heading into the peak retail season. Moving onto slide nine with Powersports parts, accessories and apparel and OEM engines. Revenue were down 17% to $285 million. The revenue decline is primarily due to lower repeat orders during the season and lower sales volume this year due to timing as late snowmobile unit delivery last season had pushed related P&A sales to Q1 '23. We still have good momentum with our P&A business as we continue to see positive trend at the retail level, notably for our Sea-Doo Personal Watercraft and Pontoon business, for which we have significantly developed the accessory offering in recent years. Moving to Marine on slide 15. The revenue lag for Marine continued to be tied to the ramp up of the new Manitou platform. While we were planning to be further along in our production ramp up, we have been dealing with the supplier issue for an aesthetic component that did not meet our standards. These resulted in a slight revenue decline of 3% compared to last year. On the positive note, the situation has improved and shipments have increased throughout May, thereby increasing product availability heading into the peak retail boating season. Looking at retail sales, from an industry perspective, the boat category seems to have suffered the most from the late spring, especially in the Great Lakes region, which is a key market for Alumacraft and Manitou. In addition, our retail performance was improved by the supply issue at Manitou as well from lapping months during which we were still retailing Alumacraft welded boat. As for Quintrex, retail was down in line with the industry. We are not pleased with the marine result this quarter, but I would like to remind you that we are still on track to deliver a strong year. With that, I turn the call over to Sebastien.\nSebastien Martel: Thank you, Jose, and good morning, everyone. The first quarter essentially played out as expected unfavorable foreign exchange rate variations. While our overall gross profit margin upside was limited by Marine during the quarter, it is worth noting that our Powersports gross profit margin was very strong at 27.3%, up 160 basis points from last year. Continuing down the P&L, we generated normalized EBITDA for the quarter of $377 million, representing a margin of 15.5%, up 50 basis points from last year's first quarter, despite suffering a 110 basis point headwind from FX. Our normalized net income reached $192 million, resulting in a normalized earnings per share of $2.38 for the quarter, up 43% versus last year. We generated $141 million of free cash flow, providing us with the financial flexibility to take advantage of the current weakness in the share price to do buybacks. In fact, we have deployed about $110 million toward share repurchases so far this year, and we expect to continue being active in repurchasing shares as we still have about 2.4 million shares available under our NCIB. Moving to slide 13 for an update of the network inventory situation. As expected, the improved supply chain environment allowed us to better leverage our production capacity and increase our throughput in Q1 further supporting network inventory replenishment. Our network inventory now stands only 4% up from the first quarter of fiscal '21. A very comfortable level when you consider the significant growth of our business since then driven by market share gains and the introduction of new product lines. Moreover, our mix of inventory is very healthy. We ended the end of the season inventory for snowmobile, while higher than last year, is still below historical levels. Putting us in a good position for Season '24. Unit availability is much better than last year for Sea-Doo PWC and Pontoon and for three-wheeled vehicles as we head into key summer retail season, which should help support strong retail into Q2. And for off-road while there are some areas of the line-up where we still need to improve unit availability, such as the new ATV platform and some higher end SSV models, we believe that we are near optimal level in terms of overall network inventory. So all-in-all, with the improvement made in recent months, we are now better positioned to serve our dealers and customers and seize retail opportunities across the product portfolio. Now looking at slide 14 for an update on the guidance for the year. As I already mentioned, the first quarter essentially played out as expected. The demand for our product remains healthy with retail momentum improving in April and May after a spring season that was late to come. The supply chain environment is more favourable allowing us to better utilize our production capacity and reduce turbulence costs. The pricing actions we took over the last year are now more than offsetting the inflationary pressures on costs, providing a margin tailwind and the competitive landscape and promotional environment is trending in line with our expectations. As a result, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year with only slight adjustments to account for the better than anticipated snowmobile booking and longer than planned production ramp up for the new Manitou boats. As such, our objective remains to deliver 9% to 12% growth in revenues and 9% to 13% growth in normalized EBITDA. Going down the P&L we have adjusted upward our depreciation expense guidance to reflect the impact of FX variations and review downward share account for the buybacks done so far this year. Both elements offsetting each other. As such, we are still in line to deliver a strong normalized EPS between $12.25 and $12.75, which would be a record year for BRP and another strong step towards our M25 objective of reaching $13.50 and $14.50 of normalized EPS by fiscal year '25. Looking at the rest of the year, we expect to deliver three solid quarters driven by continued market share gains, a more favorable operational environment and upcoming product introductions. Moreover, we still expect to generate north of $400 million of cash from working capital this year, which should lead to very strong cash flow generation. Finally, zooming in on the second quarter, our plan calls for a normalized EPS that is expected to be flat versus a record Q2 last year as we expect continued growth in the business to be offset by higher depreciation and financing costs. On that, I'll turn the call over to Jose.\nJose Boisjoli: Thank you, Sebastien. I am pleased with how we began fiscal '24. We acknowledged that there are still uncertainties surrounding macro concern, but our results demonstrate the strength of our diversified portfolio and ability to reinvent product categories. For the remainder of the year, we anticipate demand for our product to remain healthy, and we will continue to focus on executing and optimizing efficiencies to deliver on our guidance. As we have proven many times since becoming a public company ten years ago almost to the day, our team's strength, agility and resilience have allowed BRP to grow significantly and outperform the industry. As shown on slide 16, our revenue more than tripled over that period. Normalized diluted EPS grew eightfold and our Powersports market share almost doubled. And the achievement that make me particularly proud is that our business with dealers quadrupole and we became the number one industry player worldwide. In addition, we have created significant value for shareholders with a 368% share price appreciation as of the anniversary date. We also distributed $2.7 billion in capital to dividend and share repurchase. In conclusion, our strong fundamentals are positioning us well to deliver another solid year in fiscal year '24 and to gain further market share in the Marine and Powersport industries. Moreover, we believe we can sustain our momentum over the mid to long-term, given many new products in their early stage of growth, a solid pipeline of product introduction and constant progress on our journey towards electrifying our product lines. As usual, we are hosting our dealer event in August and you are invited to join us in Atlanta. I thank all our employees for another strong performance this quarter. I also acknowledge the support of our dealers who made us the leading OEM in the industry. On that note, I turn the call over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from James Hardiman with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJames Hardiman: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my call. So coming out of the fourth quarter, you had given us some pretty good context. Maybe I missed it, but how were you thinking about industry growth? I think previously you were talking about a flattish industry. And then I guess within that context, I'm assuming based on everything that you've said, you still think that you will see significant share gains this year, but maybe walk us through any updated thoughts on either of those assumptions?\nSebastien Martel: Yeah, obviously, we're happy with how Q1 went, especially the tail end of Q1 and the beginning of the Q2 from a retail perspective. Our assumptions are still the same as when we initially established guidance. The expectation is for a flat industry this year and obviously the growth coming from new product introductions, some of which we've done already with the new ATVs, some will come in August and also sustained market share gains, especially on the side-by-side segment and the ATV segment. But overall the industry and the retail is trending in line with our expectations.\nJames Hardiman: Got it. That's helpful. And then on the inventory front, pretty flat retail with a few years ago, despite some significant increases in your own retail. So how should we think about is there any remaining replenishment opportunity here or should wholesale generally track with retail? I guess, another way to ask it, as we think about inventory turns, you know, those seem to have come in pretty meaningfully. Is there any way to think about this from an inventory turns perspective and what the right number is there? Thanks.\nSebastien Martel: Yeah. Generally we're happy with the overall level of inventory, especially going into retail peak retail season for Personal Watercraft, Pontoons and Three-Wheels. So we're super happy with what we have there. We believe that's going to drive good retail in the second quarter. There are few pockets of opportunities on the ORV side where inventory is needed. Obviously, the new ATV platform that we just launched and also a few high-end models on side-by-side where dealers are raising their hand to have more inventory. But generally, as the business grows, we will see the absolute number of dollar value of inventory grow in units grow as well, because coming with higher market share and obviously if you look at if you compare our wholesale to retail, well, obviously ASPs are higher as well the -- and benefiting from pricing. And so you'll see a higher wholesale growth and you'll see a retail growth in the next nine months.\nJames Hardiman: Make sense. But just to clarify, if I were to think about this in terms of units from here, the expectation is, is that wholesale units would be pretty similar to retail units or is that not a good assumption?\nSebastien Martel: Wholesale will be slightly higher than retail as we obviously grow the business. So a number of days should remain similar. You'll see a minor impact on the top line.\nJames Hardiman: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Xian Siew with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nXian Siew: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Maybe on the P&A. So it was down 17% in the quarter. You mentioned some timing effects, but the guide of 3% to 7% growth was maintained. Any other kind of shifts we should think about over the rest of the year? And are there any kind of inflection points like maybe in the third quarter? Or any kind of thoughts on the P&A?\nSebastien Martel: Yeah, Q1 P&A down. Some of it is driven by timing of shipments of snowmobiles last year that were shipped much later in the season so that drove higher P&A sale probably accounts for half of the P&A variation that we saw this quarter, just timing of snowmobile year-over-year. And also, when we look at what the dealers have on hand last year and during the COVID period, everyone had a fear of missing out. And so people order more inventory. They wanted to make sure they were not they were running out. And so what we are seeing is that the dealers now that there's a more stable supply, there are rebalancing their DSOs and managing the business with lower inventory. So I think Q1 was also impacted by, we'll call it, inventory adjustment on the dealer side. But overall, when we look at the overall attachment rates on the P&A, it's good. And obviously, we have exciting product introductions coming later this year, that is also going to be tied to P&A and accessory introductions, which is going to drive growth for the rest of the year.\nXian Siew: Okay. Thanks. And then I wanted to ask maybe just a little more housekeeping, but there was in the other expense line, there was an FX contract cost of about $17.3 million. I guess like what is that expense? And why not exclude that or I guess adjusted out similar to the other kind of FX impact on the P&L?\nSebastien Martel: Well, the euro was more volatile in Q1. And so that obviously drove some, unfortunately, it went the wrong way, and so that drove some loss on foreign exchange. The majority of it is revaluation of balance sheet items, monetary balance sheet items. And in first few weeks, there was a mismatch, which kind of amplified that volatility. And so we've obviously made a few adjustments. I'm not expecting that to impact our business as much going forward. But certainly, the euro, the strength of the euro in Q1 did have an unfavorable impact on the remeasurement of some balance sheet exposures.\nXian Siew: Right. But I guess it's fair to say that's more of a onetime kind of impact?\nSebastien Martel: Well, it doesn't mean that it cannot happen going forward. But as I said, we've made a few adjustments to how we look at these exposures. And so I'm not expecting as much volatility going forward, even though the rates would -- could vary as well.\nXian Siew: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please go ahead.\nJaime Katz: Hey, I hope you can talk a little bit about what you guys are seeing with the holdup in Marine parts and how you guys have gotten more clarity on what the rest of the year is going to look like given the disruptions that have already been seen.\nJose Boisjoli: Yeah, good morning. First, the marine industry is probably the industry like I said in my remarks that is the most affected by the late spring. And just to give you some numbers, and obviously, as you know, there is not much -- the data on Marine is not as tight on Powersports, but I give you some numbers. And for the first three months of the year, the Pontoon industry was down 18%. But in the Midwest, where is the -- very, very strong area for Manitou, the Marine industry was down 35% in Michigan and Minnesota. Then and April was also down 18% then the Marine industry is still affected. And aluminum fishing boat, the industry was down for the first three months of the year by 17%, improved in April to 7% -- down 7%. But again, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan worse than the industry. Then this is the environment that we are in. And our retail, we believe with Alumacraft that we are -- it's a question of timing and seasonality, but we are in good shape. Manitou, obviously, we still have the problem with the supplier for anesthetic parts. But I have to say now the supplier is able to follow production, and we have BOs with that missing part in the yard in the Lansing and we will pick up retrofitting the BO ourselves in May and June then this would stabilize and it's played into the season, but not too late because the spring affected the retail.\nJaime Katz: Okay. And then maybe this is a little nit-picky, but I think in the prepared remarks, you guys had noted that you were on track to achieve the M25 EPS goals. But I don't think you guys articulated that you would specifically reach the revenue goals that had been laid out there in the past and I assume that was just an omission and not just caution on what we're seeing in the environment. Can you clarify that? Thanks.\nSebastien Martel: Well, obviously, and as we've said in the past, we've always been very focused on growing this business, growing a profitable business, and that's the number one priority. And top line is obviously the driver of that growth. So our plans are still very much in line with the M25. Could there be adjustments in terms of which product line delivers the revenue target? Absolutely. But overall we're very much in line with the target.\nJaime Katz: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jonathan Goldman with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Goldman: Hi. Good morning. On one of the slides, you showed your unit growth from February to May. So, on the May numbers, obviously, some significant growth there. Can you provide some color on how much of that is a catch-up from earlier in the year? And also how much maybe attributable to industry growth versus share gain for May?\nJose Boisjoli: Yeah. This is a difficult question, but I will try to give you some color. If we look at the Powersports industry overall and if you -- our retail for Powersports in April, if you compare to last year, we were up 37%. But if you compare to pre-COVID, 26%, then you could say here, some may be catch-up. But what is interesting, this was April. What is interesting in May. In May, the retail was up 47% versus last year, but 42% versus pre-COVID then there might be some catch-up in there, but I don't think it's significant with what we see so far.\nJonathan Goldman: No, that's very helpful. Thank you for that. And the second one I had is on expenses. It looks like SG&A was up 35% year-on-year, which is the same as revenue growth. Can you discuss if there's anything unusual in the quarter? Or can you break out how much of that SG&A increase is attributable to growth investments or growth or just the business is getting bigger? Or what other sort of drivers behind that SG&A pick up?\nSebastien Martel: Yeah, your latter point in terms of business being better, certainly is an element. Obviously, we are investing in technology and that is an investment and comes with obviously higher dollars. But when I look overall for the year on an EBITDA margin, the target is to deliver about 17% EBITDA margin and we'll see an improvement of probably 50 basis points coming from gross margin and a headwind coming from operating expenses of about 50 basis points. Some of that is a greater R&D expense. Some of it is a greater marketing expense and some of it is SG&A as well.\nJonathan Goldman: And just to clarify, you said 50 basis points tailwind from gross margins and minus 50 basis points from OpEx netting out to even?\nSebastien Martel: Yeah.\nJonathan Goldman: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.\nJose Boisjoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Robin Farley with UBS. Please go ahead.\nRobin Farley: Great. Thanks. I had two questions. One is just a follow-up there on your margin commentary. Just thinking about your top line is growing at a double-digit rate. And just thinking about whether the supply chain has kind of gotten back to what you would say is normal at this point when we think about margin comps? And just with that double-digit revenue growth, should we be thinking about other things like as Pontoons grow, if that's a lower-margin business than ORV? And like are there sort of segment mix issues that we should be thinking about with your margin that would be offsetting the benefit to margin that we think from the double-digit revenue growth. Thanks.\nSebastien Martel: Hi. Good morning, Robin. Obviously, we're happy with the margin improvement, especially on the Powersports side. When I look at the drivers of the gross margin in Q1, last year, we did get a benefit coming from an insurance claim with [wise] (ph) to fire that was last year -- or this year, a headwind of 100 basis points. But when I look at volume mix and fixed cost absorption, that's a positive 100, mix was a bit negative, but not that significant to your question. But the big tailwind we got this quarter is, finally, we're getting ahead of inflation. So all the pricing actions we took over the last several years are now more than offsetting the inflation and also turbulence costs. So that's a 400 basis point tailwind. As planned, we have more retail incentives out there that's a 130 basis point headwind. Higher interest rates on the floor plan financing, a slightly higher number of days as well. That's another 100 basis point headwind. Marine was a 70 basis point headwind and then the other elements impacting margin for about 40 basis points as a headwind is depreciation effects and warranty. So overall bringing us to the 25.7 gross margin of this quarter.\nRobin Farley: Okay. Great. Thanks so much. And then my other question was just on the demand side of things. If you can just help us think a little bit about what's going on. Obviously, it sounds like it's certainly improved through the quarter. Any color on sort of higher end versus lower end demand from the consumer or utility versus rec demand? Just kind of any color like that? Thank you.\nJose Boisjoli: Yeah. Then first if we look at -- and obviously, as you know, we are stronger in premium product than entry-level product, but I give you some color on the Spark and the Ryker. On the Spark, to be honest, no change. The Spark need is typically 30% of our Watercraft retail and in Q1, and we compare that to the last five years. And basically, this year, it's in line with the previous year. Ryker is about 50% of our retail versus the traditional Spyder. And it's, again, comparable to what we had in '22, '21, '20. Last year, we were missing some traditional Three-Wheeled vehicle then I think it's -- you cannot compare to last year. But for Ryker and for Spark, the mix versus the other product line is stable. If you look now at the industry and in the ATV industry, we're not very strong in the mid-CC and other segment with stronger and higher. But the high-cc is stable at 20% than the mid and other are stable at 80%. And side by side, there is a change, side-by-side in terms of premium. The industry grew from about 35% premium in fiscal year '20 to 60% so far this year. And it's a big change for side-by-side going from higher-end products. What is helpful. We are basically our side-by-side business, 70% of what we sell is premium. Then this is the big picture. Look, we don't see big change in Watercraft, Three-Wheel and ATV, definitely a shift on side-by-side where the market is growing more high-end. Lucky for us, we stronger on that product category.\nRobin Farley: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Fred Wightman with Wolf Research. Please go ahead.\nFred Wightman: Hey, guys. Jose, I just wanted to go back to last quarter and sort of entering the fiscal year. You called out a few different things to monitor for the industry. One of them was momentum and use. And I'm wondering if you could sort of give an update on that. You had talked about dealers might be carrying some higher cost inventory and what that might do for retail. So I'm wondering if that showed up at all in the spring sort of x the weather benefit or timing?\nJose Boisjoli: Yeah. Obviously, we don't have much data. It's anecdote that we have from the dealers on this, but price are starting to go down on the use, which I think is helping the whole retail situation. Typically, a customer come in if there is a good trade between used machine and the new one then the wheel is moving. And I think the dealer we're holding to high price for use for a long period of time. And now it's starting to be more, I would say, normal.\nFred Wightman: Okay. And if we think about strong early snow indications, but if you look at sort of dealers with higher inventory levels, higher floor plan rates, are you seeing an impact on dealer orders? Are people sort of adjusting the size, adjusting the cadence of when they would be ordering sort of products versus what you were seeing a year or two ago because of sort of where floor plan rates are?\nJose Boisjoli: I mean -- the -- if you -- obviously dealers this -- and we monitor it by days of inventory -- and the dealer also are looking at the dollars. But on the dollar side, like Sebastien explained, we're selling more premium high-end product, the dollar is going up per unit. The other thing is we gained significant market share since the COVID situation. And it's normal that we need more inventory to support the continuous retail then dealers are obviously watching their line of credit. On the other hand, the snowmobile order was better than what we had anticipated. And what is very interesting, close to half of our production is already pre-sold to consumers. That is -- we feel we're going into the snowmobile season with a very good visibility of what's going on. We take ATV order every month for delivery in the next three months. And so far, dealer, most of the time, are ordering above the recommended order because Can-Am is having a good traction at retail. Then we all heard about those macroeconomic concern, but the dealer who are on the front line are quite positive about the business.\nFred Wightman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Altobello with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Altobello: Thanks. Hey, guys. Good morning. Jose, I just want to go back to the comment you just made to Fred about the softness you're seeing in used pricing. I certainly understand why that would drive used retail. But could it diminish demand for new products as that price gap between new and used widens here?\nJose Boisjoli: I mean I don't believe it will affect the new product. I think there is enough novelty in the new product that the customer will go for the technology and all the novelty that we bring. This is something that we're very good at. We are good to come out with a novelty that excite the consumer. And the good example is the snowmobile. We came out with the second year of the REV Gen5 and we had very, very good traction with the new model we introduced. Then I think we are in a very good position. My comment to Fred on the use. I think to get the wheel in motion at retail level, you need the trade-in and dealer need to accept that they buy the use maybe a bit higher than what pre-COVID but lower than a few months ago and this gets the wheel in motion.\nSebastien Martel: And maybe if I just add a bit of color that obviously the big hedge that lies with the used market is that there's been material price increases over the last two or three years. And so MSRPs are much higher than they were two or three years ago. So someone who brought a product two or three years ago, that price is protected from the inflation that the new products have had. So, yes, the gap is widening more than it was during COVID, that gap almost went to zero. But it's still a very, very healthy gap because of the MSRP increases we've seen over the last two or three years.\nJoseph Altobello: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And just to clarify on the acceleration of retail that you guys saw in April and May, were your share gains in those two months, similar to what we saw in Q1? And was it concentrated in any particular categories?\nSebastien Martel: All I can say is we're obviously happy with the retail growth that we saw in April, May. We're happy with the performance. Things are trending in line with our assumptions for the guidance.\nJoseph Altobello: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Benoit Poirier with Desjardins Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBenoit Poirier: Yeah, good morning, everyone. Just when we look at your dealer inventory, you're almost toward the end of the ORV season. Could you talk about the ORV inventory and maybe your overall inventory, how much would be considered obsolete and therefore requiring some sales programs?\nJose Boisjoli: Good morning, Benoit. We're comfortable with our ORV inventory. On side-by-side, we have good momentum in the retail level. And, at the end of the season, it's July, August. And after that you have a transition that lasts a few months, and we believe we are in good shape with our side-by-side inventory, good product news that will come in August. And on the ATV side, if there is something, we've lost some retail because the inventory tool is too low. We are in a transition with the new platform. And it's a bit always tricky though. You have like three, four months where you try to ramp down the whole one and you ramp up the new one. We are on plan, but the dealer will see high volume coming their way in June with the new platform. Then if I have something comfortable with side-by-side, everything is on plan. And on ATV, the inventory is probably too low, and that's why our retail was a bit soft. I believe that when the network will be fulfilled with the new platform, you will see our retail gaining momentum.\nBenoit Poirier: Okay. And Jose you mentioned that the sales program were a little bit higher than it has been in the past. Where are you versus normal level? And maybe on the supply chain I think it impacted your margin close to 400 bps. And given the improvement in supply chain situation, have you been able to capture the full 100, 400 bps? Or are you maybe just halfway through the margin recovery coming from supply chain?\nJose Boisjoli: Yeah, I will take the question on the sales program. Just to give you a sense, on Watercraft and Pontoon, the Sea-Doo Pontoon and Watercraft. First, today, we have nothing on model year '23. We have some program on model year '22, but it's slight program. What we have out there is a two-year warranty plus either 2.99% interest rate for 36 months or 4.99% for 60 months. If a customer would like to finance the machine, it would pay probably 7% for five years. And we are in line with the competition for model year '22. On ORV, we are weaker than our main competitor. But again, ATV, we have some program on model year '22, mainly because of the old platform that on the mid-cc category. And on side-by-side, it's the same thing. We have some program in model year '22 and a few on model year '23 that are entry-level units. But at the end of the day, we are not, I mean it's significantly less aggressive than what we had at this time of the year pre-COVID. And that's how I would qualify our -- my comments on the remarks about the slide programs. Maybe, you want to comment on the?\nSebastien Martel: On the turbulence and inflation, as you reminded us, yes, it was a 400 basis point tailwind. It's probably 50-50 between turbulence and the positive effect of inflation. There's still some inefficiencies that we could further reduce and that's the plan for the rest of the year. And from a retail incentive, we're still below pre-COVID, significantly below pre-COVID. And again, we did -- yes we did put more programs, especially on the interest side, where we subsidized the rates. But we think it's the right thing to do with -- and it has an impact on the retail momentum.\nBenoit Poirier: Okay. Thank you very much for the time.\nJose Boisjoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Craig Kennison with Baird. Please go ahead.\nCraig Kennison: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. You've addressed a lot already, but wanted to ask about your dealer body. And just I'm curious, how do you evaluate the financial health of your dealer partners just given the potential for an economic downturn?\nSebastien Martel: Well, as you know, we partner with Huntington Bank on the floor plan financing. And so we work hand-in-hand with them in constantly evaluating the health of their dealer how much credit can they take the terms of inventory. So it is a daily operation with our internal credit team and their credit teams in order to make sure that we monitor the health of the network. It is something we pay very close attention to. And in the end, it's a balance. And dealers need inventory in order to be successful in order to drive top line. But obviously we don't want to have them too much inventory, so that becomes an issue from a floor plan cost. And so we are quite active on that front and we have constant discussions with our different floor plan partners around the world to make sure that we find that right balance.\nCraig Kennison: That's very helpful. And I guess the second question on just the affordability dynamic for consumers. I'm wondering if you ever look at it from a monthly payment standpoint on like-for-like unit. I'm curious, you've got rates moving higher, but inflation has waned a bit and dealers probably are offering much sharper prices than when there was no inventory. Just what is the consumer looking at from an affordability standpoint. And we had some inflection where their monthly payment may not be going up anymore.\nSebastien Martel: Yes. When I look year-over-year, obviously, with the rise in interest rates that we've seen in the last 12 months -- for a like-for-like product there consumer buying a product a year ago and buying a product today. The consumer would pay 8% more on a monthly payment. So that factors in inflation, interest rates, et cetera. So, yes, it's higher, but on the other side, now, we are offering promotions that's certainly helping to drive retail. And on a $300 monthly payment, 8% is something that is something the consumer looks at, but probably not significant enough to pull them away from executing on the purchase.\nCraig Kennison: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Rolle with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Rolle: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. First, just quickly, when would you be able to start your buyback this quarter?\nSebastien Martel: As soon as next week is with something that we could start doing again and we have until the end of November to do the buyback. So there's quite a long window to execute on the buyback, Brandon.\nBrandon Rolle: Okay. Great. And then also on the promotional side, I think, you guys have started increasing support to dealers and April and May and obviously saw strong market share gains. Do you see your competition potentially responding with increased promo to respond or could that cause you to go back to pre-pandemic promotional levels this year?\nJose Boisjoli: So far we don't see an escalation of programs. On the Watercraft, our main competitor, we are about in line with our main competitor below historical programs level. On off-road, obviously, the leader in the industry is a bit more aggressive than us, but it's lower than what it was pre-COVID.\nBrandon Rolle: Okay. Great. And just finally on market share dynamics. Obviously, the Japanese competition still doesn't have necessary inventory in the channel. How much of their absence in the channel is contributing to your market share gains?\nJose Boisjoli: That's a very difficult question. But I would say I believe that our market share gain last year came from our first -- our strategy about building unit that was almost completed and retrofit them when we received the part either in our factory and at the dealer level. This gave us a head start versus some of our competitor who reduced production and second, the strength of our lineup. Our lineup , and again, I'm biased, but our lineup are the best in the industry. And we have a complete product portfolio. We have products for all season, which is very helpful for the dealers. Then if all this that I believe explain why we have so much momentum at the retail level.\nBrandon Rolle: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Morrison with TD Securities. Please go ahead.\nBrian Morrison: Yes, good morning. I want to understand the margin cadence throughout the year. So Q2 sounds like it will be sub 17% EBITDA margin again, so below in the first half. So the second half weighting and the forecast improvement in the back half of the year. Is this a mismatch of timing of the offsetting benefits and headwinds? Is it scale or is it the need for Marine to improve? And I understand the weather impact in Marine, but can you just talk about the demand pull for the new Manitou marine product?\nSebastien Martel: I'll let Jose cover the Manitou and then I'll cover the cadence. Is that fair?\nBrian Morrison: Please.\nJose Boisjoli: On the Manitou, as you know, we are sold out to the dealers and basically the dealer orders everything we can produce. To be honest, we reduced our planning for model year '23 from now until summer for production. But so far, what we hear from the dealer is retail, the new Pontoon is very popular. I think the new Manitou with the MAX Deck, you know the fact that you have an open space, you're gaining four feet in the back. You have an open space. You don't have the engine in your way. It's a big, big benefit. And I would say very happy that we dealer and consumer react to the product.\nSebastien Martel: From just a margin profile similar to what we saw probably last year in terms of the EBITDA margin. We historically had a higher EBITDA margin in the second half of the year. A lot of it driven by mix, but some of it driven by timing of operating expenses. So probably consistent to what we've seen in prior years, Brian.\nBrian Morrison: Okay. Thank you for that. Just and then the snow checks up 25% relative to your target. Can you just provide a comparison relative to pre-orders last year? It sounds like it's probably flat.\nJose Boisjoli: It's below last year in terms of production units that are sold in percentage of production. Like I said, about close to 50% of our production is presold to a consumer. This is the third best year in our history. Then, obviously, the COVID year were exceptional because the fear of missing. But it's the highest year in, I would say, a more normal non-COVID year. I'm very, very happy with the snowmobile season.\nBrian Morrison: All right. I appreciate that clarification, Jose.\nJose Boisjoli: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]\nPhilippe Deschenes: Well, thank you very much, everyone, for joining us this morning and for your interest in BRP. We look forward to speaking with you again for our second quarter conference call on September 7th. Thanks again, everyone, and have a good day.\nJose Boisjoli: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines."
