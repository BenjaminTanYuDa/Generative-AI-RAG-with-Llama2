Now, I will turn the call over to Applied Digital's Chairman and CEO, Wes Cummins. Wes?\nWes Cummins: Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal second quarter 2024 conference call. I want to start by thanking our employees for their ongoing hard work and service in supporting our mission of providing digital infrastructure solutions to the rapidly growing high-performance computing industry. Before turning the call over to our CFO, David Rench, for a detailed review of our financial results, I'd like to discuss some recent developments across our business. Let's start with our data center hosting operations. Our 100-megawatt Jamestown facility continues to perform as expected and operated at full capacity with consistent uptime throughout the quarter. This marks the fifth consecutive quarter in which the Jamestown facility has operated at full capacity. Our 180-megawatt Ellendale facility in North Dakota also operated at full capacity with consistent uptime during the quarter, bringing our total hosting capacity to 280 megawatts across our North Dakota facilities. Both facilities are contracted out to customers on multiyear terms. During the quarter, we announced the initial energization of our 200-megawatt Garden City facility in Texas. This is a significant milestone in Applied Digital's ongoing efforts to meet the growing demand for low cost scalable digital infrastructure. The Garden City facility had a small contribution to our results this quarter and is currently operating at approximately 132 megawatts, with the remainder of the capacity expected to come online in the next several months. As we brought on the facility, we realized there were additional infrastructure improvements needed for the grid. We expect these improvements to be made no later than April. Our customers continue to send miners to the facility and we are actively installing them. With the increase in the cost of bitcoin, we are seeing demand increase significantly for hosting services. As a reminder, our Garden City facility is fully contracted with fixed prices, so we are not exposed to volatility in the crypto markets heading into the halving event this year. Once our Garden City facility becomes fully energized, we will have approximately 500 megawatts of hosting capacity across our three data center hosting facilities. We expect our three sites to deliver up to $300 million in revenue and $100 million of adjusted EBITDA on an annualized basis. Operating cash flow from data center hosting services will ramp up significantly in March as the majority of our prepayments burn off in February. Let's move on to cloud services, which provide high-performance computing power for primarily AI applications. It continues to grow quickly as we progress further in supporting our existing contracts and pursue additional opportunities in our pipeline. Since our last earnings announcement, we have added an additional cloud customer, which brings our total annual contract value of cloud service contracts at full capacity to approximately $398 million. We tailor our agreements to our customers so that they -- as they raise money, we can exercise options embedded in the contract to deploy GPUs and ramp-up hosting capacity over time. While the typical customers for our cloud service have been private VC-backed companies, we are now also seeing strong demand from the enterprise market for large amounts of GPU compute capacity. We are excited to see demand increasing from this important segment of the market and have plans to hire sales talent to enhance our outreach efforts. We continue to secure access to GPUs, however, there have been some delays in installations attributable to pending deliveries of networking components. We believe it's prudent to receive GPU deliveries only when all associated equipment is on-site and ready for installation, which is how we structure our client deposits. Additionally, we continue to actively explore vendor financing and other tailored financing options to support the capital requirements for the 34,000 H100 GPUs we have on order to support our current customer demand. To date, we have four 1,024 clusters installed and are planning to ship an additional four in the next two weeks. These clusters, as they are currently configured put us in an elite class of next-generation supercomputers in terms of raw compute power or petaflops for the most demanding AI applications. We expect to reach a minimum of 10 before the end of the fiscal year with the Jamestown cluster representing the opportunity to put us in the top 10 supercomputers for AI workloads. The fully commissioned clusters are expected to generate over $200 million of annualized revenue. Lastly, let me provide an update on our purpose-built HPC data centers. During the quarter, we broke ground on our first 100-megawatt high-performance compute facility in Ellendale, North Dakota. This facility will offer low cost, high-efficiency liquid-cooled infrastructure designed for HPC applications. Construction is proceeding as expected. Our unique proprietary architecture and design implementation together with the strategic placement of the Ellendale facility near sources of abundant and renewable power will offer scalable infrastructure for these workloads. It will offer significant cost reduction to our customers and deliver best-in-class performance that maximizes high power density compute. We believe that this advantage is sustainable in this emerging market for data centers specialized in running AI workloads. Our contracted power and adjoining land at our facilities will become valuable assets over the next 18 months. We believe there will be a significant supply constraint for power in the data center market. We have already seen a robust demand for our data centers, which driven by the burgeoning AI landscape has exceeded our initial expectations. We believe we'll be in a strong competitive position to support this demand. As a reminder, we have 400 megawatts of capacity in development across North Dakota and Utah. This does not include the current 9 megawatts of capacity we have at our standalone facility in Jamestown to support cloud service customers. As we enter the second half of fiscal 2024, we're well-positioned to capitalize on the demand we're seeing across both our cloud service and HPC data center business and we will continue to allocate our capital appropriately to the highest risk-adjusted returns to maximize shareholder value. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, David Rench, to walk you through our financials and provide an update on guidance. David?\nDavid Rench: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, everyone. Revenues for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 were $42.2 million compared to $12.3 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The increase was driven primarily by the full quarter of revenue generation from the Ellendale facility, the Garden City facility beginning revenue generation during the fiscal second quarter of fiscal year 2024, and additional revenue from the Jamestown facility due to increased uptime. In addition, the company recognized a full quarter of revenue from the first cloud service contract during the fiscal second quarter of 2024. Cost of revenues for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 was $29.2 million compared to $11.8 million for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The increase in cost of revenues was attributable to higher energy costs used to generate hosting revenues, depreciation and amortization expense, and additional personnel expenses, driven by the growth of the business as more facilities were energized. Selling, general, and administrative expenses for the fiscal second quarter 2024 were $21.1 million compared to $27.2 million in the prior year comparable period. The decrease was primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense and was partially offset by increases in depreciation, amortization, and personnel costs. Net loss for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 was $10.5 million or a loss of $0.10 per basic and diluted share based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately 109.7 million. This compares to a net loss of $26.8 million or a loss of $0.28 per basic and diluted share in the fiscal second quarter of 2023 based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately 93.4 million. Adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure for the fiscal second quarter of 2024, was $5.2 million or adjusted net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.05 based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately 109.7 million. This compares to an adjusted net loss of $3.8 million or $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the fiscal second quarter of 2023 based on a weighted average share count of approximately 93.4 million during the quarter. A significant headwind we faced during the fiscal second quarter of 2024 was amortization and occupancy charges for leases of computing equipment and data center space that have been assessed -- accessed by the company but are not yet supporting revenue. The lease expense for the colocation sites not supporting revenue totaled $1.5 million and were not added back to -- into adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings. Amortization of GPUs not supporting revenue was $3.7 million and was not added back to adjusted earnings. We expect this impact to decrease in future quarters as we resolve supply chain delays and are able to stand up full computing clusters that support revenue. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure for the fiscal second quarter of 2024, was $10.6 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss for the fiscal second quarter of 2023 of $2.2 million. Lastly, on our balance sheet, we ended the fiscal second quarter with $34.6 million in cash equivalents -- cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, and $42.8 million in debt. During the first two quarters of 2024, we received $81.8 million in customer payments due to the structure of our commercial arrangements with our customers that incorporate upfront deposits and prepayments. In certain contracts, the prepayments are credited back to the customers over the term of the contract. This has no impact on revenue recognition, but the upfront cash flow is a major benefit for the company as it helps with our CapEx funding as we build out our data centers. Since the quarter closed, we have received an additional $11.1 million in customer prepayments and $23.1 in net proceeds from the ATM offering. The ATM offering is now complete. Now, turning to guidance, due to the delayed delivery of certain networking components for our GPU clusters, we now expect our revenue and EBITDA to be below the low end of our previously guided range for the fiscal year 2024. Network component deliveries improved in recent weeks, but did have a significant impact on the timing of commissioning clusters and our revenue and EBITDA. We now expect to exit the fiscal year 2024 at an annual revenue run rate of approximately $500 million and an annualized adjusted EBITDA run rate of $250 million. Now, I turn the call over to Wes for closing remarks.\nWes Cummins: Thank you, David. We're well-positioned to capitalize on the growing opportunities across our business and look forward to continuing our momentum in the second half of the year. I'd like to thank all of our team members for their dedication in making Applied what it is today and our shareholders for your continued trust on our mission and execution. We are now happy to take questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on the HPC hosting side and the conditional agreement that you announced and a few ones. First, in terms of the total value you cite there, should we kind of think of $220 million of revenue per year? And then are your margin expectations for the segment still around 40% and on the capital cost side? I've been working with the $5 million per megawatt assumption. I wondered if that's still a good number to use. Thank you very much for your details.\nWes Cummins: Good morning, Lucas. Thank you. So there's not a lot more detail that I can give versus what we announced, but let's talk about the cost. I think we talked about in our shareholder -- in Analyst Day, and the Shareholder Day, that cost moving towards $6 million to $7 million per megawatt versus the $5 million as we've worked through the new design. So the $5 million was more for the previous design and this is the three story design that we're working for. So that's what we're looking at. But as far as economics, this fits in the economics that we've talked about previously, right, which is about $2 million per megawatt in revenue and $1 million of EBITDA per megawatt.\nLucas Pipes: Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you for that. And turning to guidance for a moment, in terms of the components that have been delayed, what exactly has been the bottleneck? Could you add a little bit more color on that? And then I think previously you provided some color on GPUs online for the average in physical Q3 and Q4. I think you mentioned it in your prepared remarks but I was trying to take notes and couldn't quite keep up. So if you have maybe an expectation around kind of Q3, Q4 GPUs, would appreciate the color around all of this. Thank you.\nWes Cummins: Sure. So the components that are the issue for delivery, It's not the GPUs themselves. It's specific networking components related to the InfiniBand networking piece of the cluster. And I've talked about this several times already, and this has been the bottleneck, I would say for the last kind of three or four months. We are getting delivery of those. It's a matter of making sure you get delivery of every component because you need all of the components to stand up the cluster, commission it, and get it operating for customers. So we're seeing improvement in the delivery of the InfiniBand. It's been specifically on the transceiver side of the InfiniBand deployments. So we had one cluster up and running last quarter. We have four deployed now. As I said in my prepared remarks, we expect to receive another four. And on the cluster, just as a reminder, Luke, is the cluster for us. I know it can be a little bit confusing, but it's 1,024 GPUs per cluster is how we refer to it. So we'll receive another four in the next two weeks is our expectation. And so also think of where pricing has gone for us on these clusters. You should think about $20 million of annual revenue per cluster deployed. So the difficulty we have is just a few weeks, because right now, let's say we're running about eight weeks behind our original expectation. But when you think about the revenue ramp and the revenue generation on a week by week basis, we go from one cluster, so we're generating $20 million of revenue per year for that cluster to our business goes to four clusters, which is $80 million of revenue per year. And then in a few weeks, our business goes to eight clusters, which is $160 million of revenue per year. So when we look at our guidance, we're just assuming 10 clusters deployed by the end of our fiscal year, which is May, about 4.5 months away. And so that 10 clusters plus our blockchain hosting solutions, that gets us to that $500 million run rate. I think we can do better than that, but that's the number that I think is a very conservative number for us to hit by the end of the year.\nLucas Pipes: That's very helpful. Thank you, Wes, for all the color. One quick one, the $45.8 million in property, equipment and other assets that have been purchased year-to-date, are you able to provide a breakdown between HPC and GPUs in that number? Thank you.\nWes Cummins: I'm sorry, Lucas, which number was that? The purchase year-to-date?\nLucas Pipes: Yes, that's the number of property and equipment that's been purchased to date.\nWes Cummins: So the majority of that goes into HPC. So when you look on our balance sheet -- so as you look at our balance sheet, where the GPUs are showing up because of how we're financing the GPUs is the lease asset, the right to use asset.\nLucas Pipes: Okay.\nWes Cummins: And then we'll have a -- and then on the liability side you'll see a capital lease. One of the things I would call out with this is the -- on the leases, we deploy the GPUs, the entire right to use asset goes into long-term assets, whereas on the lease liability, it's split about half and half between long-term liability and short-term liabilities. So when you look through the balance sheet, the leases right now, because we're doing what I always refer to as equipment finance. These are capital leases. That's how we're financing the GPUs. So when you look through CapEx, the vast majority of what you'll see is CapEx on equipment, is the HPC facility, the data center. And then on the lease right to use and the capital leases and the liabilities is where you'll see the GPUs.\nLucas Pipes: That is very helpful. Thank you, Wes, for all the color and best of luck.\nWes Cummins: Yeah. Thanks, Lucas.\nOperator: Our next question is from George Sutton with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed.\nGeorge Sutton: Thank you. It's great to see the conditional agreement. I just wondered if you could walk us through the project level financing side of this and sort of how do these ultimately come together in your mind? Is it a combination of construction loan financing and project financing? And any sense of the market dynamics there that we should know about?\nWes Cummins: Yeah. Thanks, George. So I've talked about this publicly before. So the way these agreements, we've been marketing this since mid-September. And when you think about this, you should think about marketing. People do -- our potential customers do a lot of due diligence on the site. You answer a significant number of questions, site visits, all of those things that you would expect in the due diligence. And then you'll typically go into a ROFR period, a right of first refusal period where someone gets exclusivity that you won't sell it outside of anyone. And I'm not talking about our specific agreement now, I'm just talking about the way that we've experienced this working. And then you work to get to a contract. And then post the contract, you go to project level finance. We are engaged with multiple parties on the project level finance side. We have been for a while. We haven't -- we're not waiting. We weren't waiting for an agreement to go to project level finance. But on the project level finance side, you'll get in the neighborhood of 65% to 80% loan to cost at the project level. So this won't go at the corporate level. It goes down at the site level, just like we've done with all of our Bitcoin sites. And then there's what we call the equity component, which I always look at as we work through this is more of a -- people would refer to in our industry as like mezz debt. So you have the construction finance, that debt runs kind of in the 7.5% to 8% type cost range. And then you have the mezz piece, the equity piece. And then you have our contribution to it and our contribution, we can have continued construction, we broke ground continued construction on the site in Ellendale, and we've put a significant amount of money into that already. So I think we're close to where we will need to be on the equity portion of that. And the remainder will come in from project level finance and then this mezz debt piece where typically someone will get kind of a high -- mid to high teens return on their capital and it's generally first money out and then maybe retains a small piece of ownership, call it 4%, 5% -- 3%, 5% in the site itself. And so that's the process that we're in now.\nGeorge Sutton: So I wondered if you could walk through the 400 megawatts that you're ultimately marketing, obviously 100 megawatts now effectively spoken for. Just, it's very clear to us that the demand side of the equation here is going to be pretty significant. Just curious what you're seeing as you're going to market with the other 300 megawatts of opportunity.\nWes Cummins: Yeah, so demand was robust. We had two parties very deep in diligence last year. As of the thing that we have seen, which has been interesting in January, as we kicked the year off, we've had several more parties show up, three more in the last week. And it feels almost like kind of panic looking for capacity just in the last couple of weeks. So we're seeing a lot of interest and the parties that are involved would easily take more than the capacity that we have. So it's nice to get the first one close to over the finish line, but the expectation for me is that over the next month or two months, we're going to have the full 400 booked out. And as a reminder, I think when we think about this, the biggest issue that we face, which is a high quality issue, is how much do we carve out for ourselves because we want to carve some of this out for ourselves for our own cloud solution. And I think that's really the question mark, what's the highest and best value for these, for our assets, because we want to carve some out for ourselves, but we have a massive amount of demand for the capacity that we have. And, George, the reason we have that demand is, the 400 megawatts that we have is 400 megawatts that could come online over the next 18 months. Right? The power is available, the land is there, permitting, we're in a really good position in a market that is already short capacity and I think it's going to get worse over the next few months.\nGeorge Sutton: So last question for me on the Sai Computing side. Obviously we understand the supply chain challenge. Looking past that, I'm just curious on the demand side. So you mentioned you've got another four clusters that could ship here soon. Is there any demand challenge that you're seeing or has anything changed there or is it really just a limitation on the supply chain side?\nWes Cummins: So on the demand side, the only thing that has changed on the demand side is we're seeing a new group come into the market as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So the demand remains extremely robust on the VC-backed startup companies. But what we're seeing in the market is what we're referring to as enterprise customers. So these, and just so I can define enterprise customers, these are companies that generally are very large companies, typically publicly traded, typically north of $50 billion type of market cap that have a business. They already have a business. And now to me, what it feels like is they have been working on their AI strategy, they have landed on what they plan to do with their AI, and now they're looking for significant amounts of GPU capacity. So that's a new element for us. We have one of those customers that we've been working with for about two months now, and they've moved into what we call -- we all call it a proof of concept, which is basically a test drive of our infrastructure. And I think we could get that customer into contracting here in the next two to three weeks. But that's been the only change, which is increased demand, but from a different segment of the market. The way I've looked at this market, it is a bit of a barbell, right? It's -- on one side you have the hyperscalers, so this was last year, you have the hyperscalers on one side and then you have the VC startups on the other side and then kind of there was nothing in the middle and now we're seeing that piece in the middle start to show up.\nGeorge Sutton: Perfect. Thank you for the details.\nWes Cummins: Absolutely. Thanks, George.\nOperator: Our next question is from Darren Aftahi with ROTH MKM. Please proceed.\nDarren Aftahi: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two, if I may. I think if I heard you correctly, pricing has kind of gone up on the GPU side. I think, Wes, maybe [say] (ph) on an annualized basis with the 10,000, you'd be over $200 million. I'm just kind of curious. I think at the Analyst Day, which is not too long ago, you talked about the $1.5 million monthly run rate. I guess what's changed? And then on the GPU side, I know you are targeting 10,000 by the end of your fiscal year. I guess given there's some uncontrollables on components, what's your level of confidence in that 10,000 number?\nWes Cummins: Sure. So, yeah, Darren, you're right. The pricing has gone up some. So what we're seeing -- the number I gave before is with one of our largest customers, and we were pricing that at around $2 an hour on the GPU capacity and our reserve contract. What we're seeing now is for most of our customers, we're signing contracts and what it looks like in the marketplace is kind of in the $2.20, $2.25 range for two-year reserve contracts and somewhere between 20% and 30% prepayments on the contracts. So that's the color on the kind of the update on pricing. And then on the 10,000, that's a number -- we took that down from the 26,000. So the original for us was 26,000. We had co-location capacity for 26,000. And where we are now is just with the slowness on the component side for InfiniBand. The 10,000 is a number that we feel really comfortable with hitting. We feel really comfortable in multiple ways, both on delivery of the GPUs, but also on the financing of the GPUs without going outside to a larger debt piece that has been done by some of the players in the market. So we feel really comfortable on both sides of that. But that's the reason we gave that guidance. However, what I would say about that is I think there's more we can do on the GPU side. So we'll have the 4,000 plus 4,000 shortly. So call it mid-February, we're at 8,000 of those clusters of the 10,000 that we're guiding for. So I think that leaves us plenty of room between there and the end of May.\nDarren Aftahi: Well, I'm going to squeeze one more in. On Garden City, just looks like it obviously didn't ramp as fast as everyone expected. With the grid components, can you just maybe talk a little bit about maybe what is needed, how quickly those can get procured? And then I'm just kind of curious, your propensity to continue to do business maybe with the next site in somewhere like Texas, like, how would you kind of grade that in terms of wanting to do business in a place like Texas? Thanks.\nWes Cummins: Yeah, I mean, I live in Texas. I love it there. So I don't want to say anything bad about Texas, so I'll leave that. But the sites we're doing in the future right now are North Dakota and Utah. So those are the two areas we're working on. I think we've talked about this in the past. We're out looking for more capacity because of the demand we see in the market. We have a pipeline of additional capacity that's north of 1 gigawatt. So we're working through that. And then, specific to the Texas site, there's some improvements. I'm going to butcher this a little bit, but I think we need a little resiliency, which is a capacitor bank put in, not specifically in our location, but a substation that's in the area to get fully up to the 200. There's two ways to go there. There's getting approved for wind plus grid is one route, and the other is this, I think it's a capacitor bank that needs to be installed, and not a huge expense on that, by the way. But we've been working on that since either late November or December. And the guidance that we gave is what we view as the worst case scenario, which would be the April time frame for that -- the remainder of that to come on. So we're basically waiting for the last 65 megawatts to come on there.\nDarren Aftahi: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nRob Brown: Hi, good morning.\nWes Cummins: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Brown: Just following up on the new anchor customer, could you give us a sense of sort of what vertical that customer is in, I think you mentioned, I guess, enterprise or the VC-backed side. Which sort of group is that customer in?\nWes Cummins: So we can't do that, but what I can tell you is the customer set that we are seeing of all the people that are looking at the site, there's not a lot of companies that exist in the world that are going to take down 100 megawatts or 200 megawatts or 300 megawatts themselves. So it's a very small group and all of the companies that are in the mix for us in North Dakota are names that everyone would easily recognize. They're looking for high-power density hosting, high-power density data center capacity, but it's all companies that you would recognize the name instantly.\nRob Brown: Okay. Okay. Thank you. And then I just wanted to follow up on the GPU discussion around, I guess, do you still have commitments to buy the 26,000 GPUs and deploy them after May or is that still to be determined on contract activity?\nWes Cummins: Yeah, those orders are still valid, even up to the 34,000. And so we just expect to continue. By the way, Rob, just to clarify on those orders, it's 34,000 right now for H100. We can still change those orders, whether it's for H200, GH200, right? These are fluid for us. So as the market evolves, we're able to react to that. But we still have those in queue and the ability to bring those when all of the components are available. So the issue in the quarter we had just now, as David mentioned in his prepared remarks, just to give clarity on that, so we took delivery of a second cluster during the quarter. We were paying for that cluster. Those were the expenses. In total, we're just under $4 million. So paying for that cluster without that cluster generating revenue because we didn't have the InfiniBand components to fully commission that cluster and turn it over to our customer. So we basically paused the GPU deliveries ourselves because we don't want to be paying for these GPUs while we can't offer them to our customers and generate revenue for them. So that's really what's happened for us, but we still have all those orders in place and expect to deploy those. We just need to be more careful, I guess, about when we expect those to be deployed.\nRob Brown: Got it. Great. Thank you for the color. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Todaro with Needham & Company. Please proceed.\nJohn Todaro: Great. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of ones here. One, so as you called out before, I think it was supposed to be 20,000 GPUs by December 23. Remember on the last call or the Analyst Day, maybe you did talk about some possible delays in the InfiniBand. Just kind of curious, did that situation get worse than you expected or were those delays kind of on your mind and maybe you guys just mis kind of analyzed it?\nWes Cummins: So, John, specifically on those, we're getting delivery of certain -- of the vast majority of the networking equipment that we needed. There was one particular component, but you need that component to make it work. So in an instance where in one of our clusters, right, we have the entire InfiniBand setup besides like 28 transceivers, just as an example, but you can't fully commission that cluster and generate revenue. So it's been just squeezing in those transceivers is specifically what it is. So like I said, we could have taken delivery of a lot more GPUs, but I see no point, and I think it's detrimental to us to take delivery and not be able to generate revenue and pay for the GPUs. So we just held that off and made that decision in December. We could have taken a significant number of GPUs in December, but again, no reason to do that. So as those come available, I think that you could see us speed that up again significantly and we've started to see that loosen up in the marketplace in late December and January but I'm not ready to say that we'll be able to speed that up to meet kind of the 20,000 and then 26,000 and 34,000 deployment.\nJohn Todaro: Got it. Okay. And then that's helpful. Another question I had, so you had mentioned this new customer contract in the Sai compute side, enterprise customer, how you could move to a proof of concept and start maybe delivering on that contract shortly. Just curious, with the delay, wouldn't the previously existing contract come before this one, or did anything change with those contracts?\nWes Cummins: Nothing has changed with those contracts. And just to clarify, John, we don't have a contract with the enterprise customer. It's in proof of concept and then we'd be moving to contracting. So just want to be clear on that. But nothing's changed with our previous customers. But it's exciting to see an entire new group show up in the marketplace looking for significant amount of GPU compute. And these are established companies that make money and have a product. And it's just calling out that that's kind of a new area of the market that we've seen develop over the last -- it really started kind of in late November.\nJohn Todaro: Okay, got it. And just to clarify though, so even with the delays though, customers are still kind of lining up, knocking down doors, it sounds like?\nWes Cummins: Yeah, we have had no issue with that.\nJohn Todaro: Okay, got it. Thanks, guys.\nWes Cummins: I would say, and I said this earlier, John, but I would say we've seen -- with the entrance of the enterprise customer, I would say that overall we've seen demand increase from our last conference call. We haven't seen anything slow down. We've seen it increase.\nJohn Todaro: Got it. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Mike Grondahl with Northland Securities. Please proceed.\nMike Grondahl: Hey guys. What is a rough estimate of Applied’s contribution to complete financing of the construction, just the project side of it for the anchor tenant? What do you guys have to pitch into that, roughly, just a number? How much have you done so far?\nWes Cummins: So -- good question, Mike. When you think about -- we say it's 7 million megawatts. Let's go to the high end of that. So it's 7 million megawatts, right, we're going to land anywhere from 65% to 85% -- sorry, 65% to 80% on construction finance, on project level finance. And then we expect to have what we in the industry would call an equity partner. However, as I explained earlier, that generally looks more like mezz debt. And so at the end, you're looking at us, our expectation is that we'll contribute somewhere between 5% and 10% of the project in cash for the equity portion of that. And we've already spent north of…\nDavid Rench: $25 million.\nWes Cummins: …$25 million on that currently for Ellendale. And then, Mike, when we look at that too, I think David mentioned this in his prepared remarks is for us on the cash flow for the company, I think it's important to note that when we hit March 1, the cash flow from our Bitcoin data centers improves dramatically. Right? We burned through the vast majority of the prepayments at that point and so the cash flow from that portion of our business improves dramatically.\nMike Grondahl: Got it, got it, that's helpful. And I'm assuming that the anchor tenant will be supplying the GPUs, but could you clarify there?\nWes Cummins: Yeah. So on the data center business, we are just providing space. Think of this as an Equinix or DLR style business. We're providing the space, they select the equipment, and they buy the equipment and then we're just hosting. Very similar to what we do on the Bitcoin side.\nMike Grondahl: Got it. Got it. And roughly, when would you begin to recognize revenue with this anchor customer? And hey, I'm not going to hold you to it, but roughly as this plays out, when would you expect that revenue to start?\nWes Cummins: So, right now, the expectation is the revenue would be the very early part of the second half of this calendar year.\nMike Grondahl: So, like July, August would be kind of…\nWes Cummins: Yeah.\nMike Grondahl: Okay. Great. Then just one last question. The Bitcoin hosting business, any contract renewals or extensions, any updated kind of terms, or is everything kind of locked down in that business?\nWes Cummins: Yeah, it's locked down. The things of note, our largest customer there, we have four years, maybe a little over four years on most of the capacity for our largest customer there on the contract. The only thing of note, and this probably shouldn't surprise you, but we're seeing -- we’re getting a lot more calls about hosting capacity. We are never out marketing because we don't have any to offer, but we are getting a lot more calls about hosting capacity over the last you don't call it six weeks, eight weeks as the price of Bitcoin has went up significantly.\nMike Grondahl: Got it. Okay. Hey, thank you.\nWes Cummins: Absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed.\nKevin Dede: Hi, Wes. [Technical Difficulty] question. I'm curious about the number of facilities that you're running or leasing to supply the power you need for your cloud service at the moment.\nWes Cummins: Sure. So we have third-party facilities in Denver, in Minnesota, and in Salt Lake City. And then we have our own Jamestown facility in Jamestown, North Dakota.\nKevin Dede: Yeah. And Jamestown, you have maxed out at 8 megawatts, if I understand correctly.\nWes Cummins: So Jamestown will hold 5,000 GPUs for us. I can do it on megawatts, or I can tell you on the GPU capacity, however you prefer.\nKevin Dede: Oh, whatever you're used to is fine. I guess the real genesis of the question is in meeting a cloud build-out, right? The amount -- given the market's really tight, how are you securing the power that you need to meet your customer demands on the cloud service side?\nWes Cummins: Yeah, so we secured this power back in the summer of last year. So middle of the year last year, we secured these power sites. We saw the demand and we ran out and grabbed the capacity to be able to service it. So we secured that at that point. And so we have the capacity both from third party and our own facilities for the 26,000 GPUs that we talked about. And then as we go beyond that, our expectation is that it will go into our own facilities post that 26,000 as we continue to grow.\nKevin Dede: Right, so [26,000 to 30,000 of that Delta will go] (ph) into the Ellendale facility that's under construction now.\nWes Cummins: Yeah.\nKevin Dede: Okay. I think I correctly heard you mention a marketing initiative. And I was wondering if you could be more specific about the direction that you're going to take that. Do you think that goes toward that enterprise market that you're seeing starting to develop?\nWes Cummins: Yeah. So it's specifically for the enterprise market. So, as a reminder, Kevin, I think we've talked about this before, but we've never had a single salesperson at our company. And we hired our first salesperson a few months ago. And we're going to add more to that capability specifically to go after this enterprise market that we see developing now. So that's our expectation. But previous to that, we've never had a salesperson. We've had no sales force whatsoever in the company.\nKevin Dede: Understood. And congrats on that. I guess I'm just still a little shaky in how you see that market developing. And I guess sort of your competitive positioning and if demand is so strong, why would a marketing initiative be necessary at all?\nWes Cummins: So, we've hired one salesperson, maybe we'll hire another one, but there's an idea about going out and making sure people know who we are and what we do because we've never done that before in the history of the company. So that's really the idea. So I don't think you should be thinking that we're hiring 20 salespeople, but I do think it's prudent to get a few salespeople on board, develop that sales organization. And the idea here that we've discussed a lot internally is we don't need it now, but we don't want to wait until we need it to build it.\nKevin Dede: That makes sense. Okay. Well, thanks for that. [indiscernible] any offense in kind of looking for clarification. Thanks a lot.\nWes Cummins: No, no, no. That's it though. But yeah, Kevin, we're discussing it on the call here, but we've debated a lot internally where there's a group of people saying, why would we have sales people, we don't have anything to sell. And another side that goes, the things that we should develop this before we need it. And I have landed in the latter camp, which is I think it's a good idea to develop a sales team before you actually need it.\nKevin Dede: I don't disagree. Right marketing makes it all happen. Well, congrats again on the results, Wes. Thank you very much for taking the questions.\nWes Cummins: Thanks, Kevin. Operator [Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Wes for some closing comments.\nWes Cummins: Thanks and thanks everyone for joining. And my last comment is just I want to say thank you to the team in Ellendale. We're sitting here in January. It's not the most pleasant climate for them to be continuing construction on our site. So we really appreciate the team and everyone who makes it happen for us. And I look forward to speaking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."

Now I will turn the call over to Applied Digital's Chairman and CEO, Wes Cummins. Wes?\nWes Cummins: Thanks, Alex, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fiscal first quarter 2024 conference call. I want to start by thanking our employees for their ongoing hard work and service and advancing our mission of providing digital infrastructure solutions to the rapidly growing high-performance computing industry. Before turning the call over to our CFO, David Rench, for a detailed review of our financial results, I'd like to briefly discuss some recent developments across our business. Let's start with our existing blockchain hosting operations. We aim to have all three of our blockchain hosting facilities fully online shortly with high reliability and performance for our customers. Our 100-megawatt Jamestown facility continues to perform as expected and operates at full capacity with consistent uptime throughout the quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter in which the Jamestown facilities has operated at full capacity. Our 180-megawatt Ellendale facility in North Dakota was fully energized and became fully operational during the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 and contributed to our results this quarter, the facility is fully online and operating with consistent uptime during the second quarter, bringing our total hosting capacity to 280 megawatts across our North Dakota facilities, all of which are contracted out to customers on multiyear terms. In September, we entered into a facilities extension agreement with Oncor for the transmission and metering of power to our Garden City, Texas facility. With this in place, metering and telemetry equipment owned by the power provider will be installed and once complete, the site will be energized. This installation is expected to be completed by October 23rd. Once our Garden City facility becomes fully energized, we will have approximately 500 megawatts of hosting capacity across our three facilities. We expect our three sites to produce around $300 million in revenue and $100 million in EBITDA on an annualized basis. Presence of all three operational facilities with high uptime will provide us with consistent cash flow, supporting our capital requirements for the build-out of our HPC data centers and purchasing GPUs to service our AI cloud customers. Let's move to our AI cloud services, which launched this calendar year to provide accelerated computing power for AI applications. Our AI cloud service continues to ramp up as we make further progress in supporting our existing contracts and pursue additional opportunities in our pipeline. In July, we activated the first cluster of GPUs for Character.AI and since then have made meaningful progress receiving our second cluster of GPUs in September with the expectation of receiving additional GPUs this month. Since our last earnings announcement, we have added two additional AI cloud customers. Both customers have an established user base and are growing quickly. These customer agreements have a similar structure to our first two. They also include significant prepayments to fund a large portion of the capital requirements for purchasing the GPUs. This brings our total annual contract value of AI cloud services contracts at full capacity to approximately $378 million. In addition to substantial prepayments we received from customers, we are using vendor financing and actively exploring other tailored financing options to support the capital requirements for the 34,000 GPUs we have on order to support our cloud service. We remain on track for delivery of the majority of these GPUs by April of next year. Our established partnerships with leading OEMs like Super Micro, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell, combined with our recent Elite Partner status in NVIDIA's Partner Network, provide us with visibility into the delivery time line, ensuring timely receipt of these GPUs. As previously mentioned, we will initially provide this service from our 9-megawatt HPC Jamestown facility, along with third-party colocation space, as we continue to execute on the element of our dedicated next-gen HPC data centers. The pipeline of opportunities for our AI cloud service business remains robust. We look forward to capitalizing further on this opportunity and providing further updates on our newly signed customers going forward. Lastly, let me provide a quick update on our purpose-built HPC data centers. We have 300 megawatts of capacity in development and have begun initial groundwork for our Ellendale facility. In order to proceed with the construction of these facilities and obtain the necessary financing, we're in the process of securing a credit-rated anchor tenant. We have been actively engaged in ongoing discussions with several potential anchor tenants for our Ellendale and Utah facilities. In order to our new customers for our AI cloud service, we will provide more information once available. We aim to secure an anchor tenant customer for each facility and have these facilities fully energized and operational within the next 24 months. With that, I now turn the call over to our CFO, David Rent, to walk you through our financials and provide an update on guidance before providing my closing remarks. David?\nDavid Rench: Thanks, Wes, and good morning, everyone. Revenues for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 were $36.3 million compared to $6.9 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The increase in hosting revenues was driven by an increase in online capacity due to Ellendale, North Dakota site being operational and revenue from the company's first AI cloud service contract, which began during the three months ended August 31, 2023. Cost of revenues for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was $24.4 million compared to $6.1 million for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The increase in costs was attributable to higher energy costs used to generate hosting revenues, depreciation, amortization expense and personnel expenses for employees directly working on our Jamestown and Ellendale hosting facilities. Operating expenses for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 were $17.1 million compared to $5 million in the prior year comparable period. The increase was primarily due to personnel-related costs as a result of the increase in head count as well as an increase in depreciation. Net loss for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was $9.6 million or a loss of $0.10 per basic and diluted share based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately $100.5 million. This compares to a net loss of $4.7 million or a loss of $0.05 per basic and diluted share in the fiscal first quarter of 2023 based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately $93.1 million. Adjusted net income, a non-GAAP measure for the fiscal first quarter of 2024, was $0.1 million or adjusted net income per basic and diluted share of less than $0.01, based on a weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately $100.5 million. This compares to an adjusted net loss, a non-GAAP measure of $3.4 million or a loss of $0.04 per basic and diluted share for the fiscal first quarter of 2023, based on our weighted average share count during the quarter of approximately $93.1 million. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure for the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was $10 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss for the fiscal first quarter of 2023 of $1.9 million. Lastly, on the balance sheet. We ended the fiscal first quarter with $31.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and $44 million in debt. During the fiscal first quarter of 2024, we received $39.5 million in customer payments due to the structure of our commercial arrangements with our customers that incorporate upfront deposits and prepayments. In certain contracts, the prepayments are amortized back to the customer over the first year of their contract with no impact on revenue recognition, but the timing of cash flow with upfront cash to us is a major benefit for the company and that it helps our CapEx funding needs as we build out our data centers. Since the quarter closed, we have received an additional $15 million in customer prepayments and are expecting an additional $23 million this week. Now turning to guidance for the full year fiscal 2024. We are reaffirming our expectations for revenue in the range of $385 million to $405 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $195 million to $205 million. Now I'll turn the call over to Wes for closing remarks.\nWes Cummins: Thank you, David. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our competitive advantages and differentiated capabilities to meet the sophisticated and demanding requirements for businesses and enterprises to run AI workloads and other emerging HPC applications. I remain optimistic about the future of Applied Digital as we solidify our leadership in next-generation digital infrastructure for both blockchain and non-blockchain HPC use cases during this era of digital transformation. I'd like to thank all of our team members for their dedication in making Applied what it is today and our shareholders for trusting us in our mission and execution. We're now happy to take questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from the line of Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital. Please proceed with your questions.\nRobert Brown: Hi. Good morning.\nWes Cummins: Good morning, Rob.\nRobert Brown: First question is on the -- on your kind of efforts for anchor customers in the AI business. I know you can't give too much detail, but maybe a sense of kind of the sizing of the center. Do they need to fill out kind of a whole center before you kick off? And how does that sort of kind of scope out to get -- to make the decision to kick off a data center build?\nWes Cummins: Yes. I think we've -- so in the past, we've talked about this, and it remains the same, which is we think we need to contract roughly 70% of the capacity. Doesn't have to be one customer, but we think we need to contract that on a reasonable, say, 7 to 10-year contracts with renewals to kick off the construction, and we're in process of securing that. But, Rob, the way I think about these is kicking off roughly 100 megawatts in North Dakota shortly and then followed up with 100 in Utah and then come back kind of mid-next year for the second 100 in North Dakota.\nRobert Brown: Okay, great. And then on the ramp of the AI business, it depends on getting the GPUs sort of delivered. How do you sort of see that ramping of the GPUs you've ordered? How do you see those coming in, in terms of the ability to ramp up that business?\nWes Cummins: Yes. So we -- I think at this point, we're getting pretty good visibility on delivery schedules. It's gotten better since our last call. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we received our second cluster in September, expect to receive more this month and really expect to start to receive large volumes in November, December and January.\nRobert Brown: Okay, great. Thank you. I'll turn it over.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of George Sutton with Craig Hallum. Please proceed with your questions.\nAdam Kelsey: Good morning. This is Adam on for George. Wes, starting with Garden City, could you provide a little more detail on the pace of energization once Oncor has installed their equipment?\nWes Cummins: Yes. Sure. So, the date that we mentioned in the prepared remarks and in the press release is the expectation that everything will be ready to go for energization. We should start energizing that day. And then the ramp should be faster than we've seen at our North Dakota facilities where we were continuing to finish buildings and energize them. It will still take weeks to energize, but it won't be the months that we've seen in both Jamestown and Ellendale because construction is complete, the miners are racked and ready to turn on. And so it should go much faster. So at some point in kind of the November -- mid- to late November should be fully online from that late October start, the 23rd.\nAdam Kelsey: Great. Thank you. One more follow-up for me. With respect to current construction efforts, are there any milestones that you need to hit before you face more adverse weather?\nWes Cummins: Yes. In North Dakota, we're -- we started on the groundwork there, and it's kind of the same thing we did last year, which is - it will be a little bit of a rush to get foundations poured to be able to work through the winter to enclose the facility and work through the winter there. And so that's what we're doing right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of John Todaro with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Todaro: First, thanks for taking my question, guys. What you're on -- so the site computing business, just trying to understand , first off, congrats on adding a few more contracts. But kind of what is the capacity out there? Can -- is there more contracts we can add now? Or are you looking to get those HPC sites on and anchor tenants there? Just kind of wondering really kind of how much capacity if we can expect any more contracts to come online?\nWes Cummins: Yes. We have some more capacity, not a lot until we start to bring our own facilities online. So, John, if we walk through kind of the math on the site compute side. So roughly every 1,000 GPUs generates approximately $1.5 million of revenue per month. And we've talked about before about getting the 26,000 on by April. And so that gets you to, call it, $460 million plus annual revenue business. And then when we go from April on, we'll be looking to put it in our own facilities. So through that ramp in April, we have our Jamestown facility and then we've secured third-party colo to support that ramp and then we're looking to put further deployments in our own facilities.\nJohn Todaro: Got it. Okay, great. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess just on the timeline too. So that when you guys increased from 26,000 to 34,000 GPUs, just any kind of color from the suppliers that it seemed like certainly doable? Or is that, what is the difficulty in kind of getting that? I know you guys said you're tracking, but any more color there would be helpful.\nWes Cummins: Yes. So those are the -- what we expect to deploy post April of next year and so we've added those in because of, again, the pipeline of demand that we're seeing. You should think about those being added after April. So the 26 that we talked about on the last call being added through April and then the additional 8 being added post. But I would continue to think about, it's 8 right now, but we'll see where the demand comes through. So if we need to expand that, we should have our own data center capacity coming online to support that.\nJohn Todaro: Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Lucas Pipes with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you very much, operator. Good morning, everyone. My first question is on guidance. And with the delays at Garden City, should we think kind of more of the EBITDA and revenue contribution having shifted to AI cloud. Thank you very much for walking me through those changes.\nWes Cummins: Yes. Thanks, Lucas, for the question. So the -- given what I just said about the AI cloud, you can kind of walk through as GPUs are deployed, how that steps up throughout the year, but it will be a fairly steep ramp, especially in our last two quarters as these come online, we'll get the deliveries. We got the delivery in September. We'll get additional in October. And then I think the deliveries really ramp for us in November, December and somewhat into January. So as you see those come online, you'll see a pretty steep revenue ramp on the cloud business through the remainder of the year. That should make up for the delay that we've seen in Garden City.\nLucas Pipes: Thank you, Wes. On the HPC side, can you walk us through the capital intensity with many of the planning completed from what I understand. And in terms of financing, what are your current targets for debt to equity? Is it project financing that would cover the majority of the capital needs? We'd appreciate your thoughts on that. Thank you.\nWes Cummins: Yes, sure. So on the data center business and we'll go through this in great detail on Thursday. But we -- I think a lot of people have seen. So we redesigned the data center with the knowledge we have now. So what we built in Jamestown, which was the initial build that we talked about, it was single-level horizontal because that's the cheapest way to do it. And we have plenty of land in North Dakota, and so it's going to be just build it as far as you wanted to horizontally. But now that we know how these workloads work and the necessity of them being all much higher density closer to the network core. We redesigned our structure that to a three-story structure that has network core that runs through the middle so that you can get much more density for specifically for training and then somewhat for inference. But with that redesign, you should be thinking, we talked before about kind of $4 million, $4.5 million that we're looking more around $6 million per megawatt to build those facilities. We think with the work that we have done that we can get roughly an 80% loan to cost for construction, this is -- looks much more like data centers, so we get -- secure that tenant or tenants that are credit-rated, then we can put the construction financing in place. And then there's an equity component, but we call it site level equity and you can get financing partners on the equity component of that as well. That we're -- we've spent a lot of time talking to there and you should -- it's usually in the data center industry is called the equity financing, again, it's at a site level, but I think of it more as what we would see in the capital markets as like mezz debt. So we're working through all those pieces of the capital structure to finalize and start the initial build in North Dakota. I guess technically, Lucas, not our initial build. It's the initial build of this design.\nLucas Pipes: Understood. Thank you very much, Wes. I'll try to squeeze one more in. In terms of the 34,000 GPUs today versus 26,000 GPUs previously, would those be related to the additional two customers you announced or are there other moving pieces there?\nWes Cummins: There's other moving pieces. It's really more related to the demand we continue to see. We haven't seen demand in this area slow down. I think if you go look through the capital raising in the industry hasn't slowed down. There was a large deal, I think, announced with Anthropic was that last week with AWS. But we're still seeing a robust funding environment for the companies that will be customers for us we see good demand, really strong demand in our pipeline. And so it's really just a decision based on what we're seeing from a demand perspective.\nLucas Pipes: Okay. Very helpful. I appreciate it. And to you and the team, best of luck.\nWes Cummins: Thanks, Lucas.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Darren Aftahi with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your questions.\nDarren Aftahi: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Wes, could you speak a little bit more to the cadence on the GPU orders? I'm just kind of curious if you can talk month-to-month in September and in October. Are those numbers getting bigger relative to the initial 1,000 order? And then I guess why is the cadence kind of hockey picked up into November, December and January for your comments. Is that just a function of backlog? And I guess what's your confidence that number isn't kind of pushed out further into '24?\nWes Cummins: Yes. So it's a good question, Darren. So what we saw in September is our second 1,024 cluster, 1,024 GPUs being delivered. And in October, we could see that be doubled and then get significantly bigger in November and December and into January. And it's just the -- our order book that we put in back in the May time frame, starting to be delivered, you get small pieces. And then it's the schedule that we've been given as far as when deliveries will happen really between now and the end of the calendar year. So that's what gives us that confidence in the deliveries, can things be pushed. I mean that it could always happen, I suppose, but it seems that we've -- this is probably trying to think when it was maybe three weeks ago, we're given or a little bit longer than that, kind of a firmer delivery schedule from our suppliers. So feel pretty good about the deliveries for us. And I think it's just a matter of when we ordered those and when they're being shipped out and kind of the cadence of that ramping up over the next three months. I don't know. I don't think it's for me to say whether there's better supply in the industry or not or if it's just related specifically to us that I don't know.\nDarren Aftahi: That's helpful. Thank you. And then just one last one for me. On the anchor tenant with HBC, you have multiple tenants you're talking to? And I guess, in terms of slotting people in, I mean, how close are we to North Dakota vis-a-vis Utah? And then I assume your data center financing is probably going to be right behind that based on kind of your prior comments. So if you just kind of walk through, I'm just trying to understand kind of anchor tenant demand relative to the capacity you have and then kind of a longer-term plan. Thanks.\nWes Cummins: Sure. So we're seeing a lot of interest. We've been having these conversations for a few months now. And then in the first week, the end of the first week of September, we finalized our design. And so we've been in a, what I would call, a formal marketing process from that point. Until now, and we'll move that into an LOI stage and into a contracting stage over the next few weeks or a month or so that's the expectation, but that's kind of how it's come together as it really started a formal process in, call it, mid-September, and we hope to conclude that in the coming weeks. But the interest is high, and we'll go through this in more detail on Thursday. But it's -- the demand for this style of data center with this type of density because we've been both out getting colocation space for ourselves on the cloud side and then talking to potential customers on the data center side for building our own. We're seeing a huge amount of demand and really demand for power that is available in capacity that can come online over the next 24 or 36 months.\nDarren Aftahi: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mike Grondahl with Northland Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nMichael Grondahl: Hey, guys, thanks. A couple of questions. The first on potential anchor tenants. Would you say the potential anchor that you're going to announce near term, is that still sort of wide open, meaning there's still multiple five, six, seven big potential anchors out there you're talking to? Or have one or two kind of made it way down the funnel and you're just kind of finalizing who it might be out of a very small group?\nWes Cummins: So Mike I would say that we're right in the, I would say, in the middle of the kind of the two scenarios that you described. So the funnel has gotten smaller, but we're not right at the end yet. Does that makes sense?\nMichael Grondahl: Got it. Yes. Just trying to understand. And then on the prepayments, you mentioned $39.5 million in the August quarter. And then I think a $15 million prepayment and a $23 million prepayment you expect this week. Can you say are the $15 million and the $23 million, are those from customers three and four? Or do those relate back to customer one and two?\nWes Cummins: It's both. It's both for those prepayments. The ones that we talked about that we've received already and then the one we expect to receive this week.\nMichael Grondahl: Got it. Got it. And then lastly, the 1,024 GPUs in August that you put to work, did they all go to customer one?\nWes Cummins: So those came in September, Mike. And they are for customer one.\nMichael Grondahl: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Kevin Dede with H.C. Wainright. Please proceed with your questions.\nKevin Dede: Hi, Wes. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe you could just help me understand a little bit better how you're thinking about AI cloud versus AI host and how that might figure in your calculus your construction calculus.\nWes Cummins: In what way, Kevin?\nKevin Dede: Well, I guess what I'm wondering is when you go look for your anchor tenants, are you looking at them purely from a cloud customer perspective? Or are you looking at some perhaps from a host perspective, where they're bringing their own GPUs?\nWes Cummins: Yes, yes. So the anchor tenants are absolutely a hosting business for us where they will bring their own equipment. It's just a data center hosting business for us. When you think about anchor tenants and for these data centers, we've talked about the ideas, 70% goes to the colocation hosting style business and then we keep 30% for our own cloud capacity.\nKevin Dede: Then the -- you said you're comfortable in -- colocation that you need for to support the 26,000 to 34,000 GPUs you have coming in. How do you figure moving them once they're at their colocation to your own facilities once they're ready?\nWes Cummins: So we won't ever move those installations. And the way that I think about it from a cloud service perspective is a lot of that colocation is in what I would call kind of traditional cloud regions. And as we ramp up capacity in North Dakota, it's really being built for very large training clusters. And so I think about the training portion of the business that's being deployed in smaller training clusters in these cloud regions moving over to the infrastructure that gets put in place in North Dakota and then using the smaller clusters that we're building out now is inferencing which I think the way this market splits is there will be training in batch inference and then some inferencing done in these large facilities like we're building in North Dakota. And then a lot of the inference portion of the market will be more in what I would call traditional cloud regions. And so it works well for our cloud business over time to have that type of architecture of just being spread into more cloud regions for the inferencing portion of the business, while a lot of the training will move into North Dakota.\nKevin Dede: Okay. The redesign that you did in September, Wes, for your new Ellendale facility, did you have to rethink latency? Or did you have to be more concerned about power backup on those? Or do you still think you can operate under the conditions that you built for in Jamestown?\nWes Cummins: So it's not about latency or necessarily power backup. It's about -- it's a redesigned specifically for density. So it's designed to be able to basically take a network core and go through multiple floors and put all of the GPU. So the design here for the new North Dakota facility, it's really around kind of this magic number of, I call it, 30 meters being the magic number of how far you know rack can be away from the network core and still be in the same cluster, same spine for networking. You technically Kevin can go out to 50 meters away from the network core, but you have to use a single mode transceiver on optics instead of multimode, so it gets more expensive, a little more difficult. So it's really designed around how many racks and how many servers can we get within 30 meters of the network core. And so that's why it goes through multiple levels in the building instead of the single level. That's the primary piece of the redesign.\nKevin Dede: And what are the heat implications, though, if you've got multiple racks stacked, right, and heat's tendency to rise.\nWes Cummins: Yes. So this is a liquid cool facility. That's the other part of the redesign. So it was air cool. You can effectively do air cool, our opinion up to, call it, roughly 50 kW per rack. But as you start to go above that, you really need to move to a liquid cool solution. And so the new facility is designed for liquid cool. The new facility will go to 150 kW per rack. It can still -- it still has the floor space to do it at 45 kW, which is what we're doing in Jamestown, but we've -- this will be built for liquid cooling.\nKevin Dede: Okay. Thanks, Wes. Appreciate it. Appreciate the detail.\nWes Cummins: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Thank you. At this time, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Wes Cummins.\nWes Cummins: Thank you, operator, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. I look forward to speaking with you on Thursday at our Investor Day, which will be held in Midtown Manhattan. And again, thanks to all of our employees for the efforts they put in the last quarter and this quarter to date. I look forward to speaking with you on our next quarterly call.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for joining us today for Applied Digital's conference call. You may now disconnect."
