With that said, it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Transphorm's CEO, Primit Parikh. Primit?\nPrimit Parikh: Thank you and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We are pleased to report a strong second quarter of fiscal 2024 as year-over-year revenue grew 36% to $5 million, and product revenue increased 18% over the prior quarter to $3.6 million, exceeding our expectations. We also delivered higher gross margin and reduced cash burn, each exceeding our expectations. The design in momentum continues to be very strong, having grown our pipeline further by over 5% since our last Investor Call. Our product pipeline today is over $475 million dominated by high-powered products where Transphorm has a clear advantage in quality and reliability, performance and IP differentiation. Q2 revenue was comprised of about 70% in product revenue with government revenue just under $1.5 million. The government portion at the lower end of our targeted range due to the timing of our key government contract negotiations. Overall, more than 70% of the product revenue mix came from high-power areas, where Transphorm continues to be the world's number GaN company with superior high performance and reliability over every other GaN competitor, most notably e-mode GaN. A white paper was recently published that outlines the superiority of Transphorm's GaN technology. We continue to make new advances, unlocking more capability of the GaN to address larger market segments as evidenced by strong product offerings that now include high-power surface mount packages like the TOLL and the TOLT, the topside cooled package, another first by Transphorm in gallium nitride. We now have also started sampling pin-to-pin as well as other high-performing high-power products that a drop in replacement to silicon carbide MOSFETs. We continue to have additional wins in the lower power area, especially our recent system in package SiP strategy, enabling multiple customer wins. Now going through Slide 3. I will first start with a high-level corporate update. Our leadership in high-power GaN remains strong as we grew our pipeline to over $475 million and our products surpassed more than 200 billion hours in the field, further demonstrating our superior reliability. We are expanding leadership in three key high-power verticals: computing power for data centers, AI machines and blockchain; energy and industrials, including micro inverters, UPS and servomotors; and electric vehicles, initially with two and three wheelers followed by four wheelers. We continue to increase our penetration in the low-power side as well with a system in package partnership as well as growth in notebook chargers that benefit from the superior reliability delivered by the physics-based benefits of our GaN versus e-mode GaN. Having delivered strong product revenue growth over the previous quarter, coupled with our robust pipeline, we expect to see continued sequential product revenue growth in the current third quarter. Second, we recently engaged Bank of America, BofA Securities, to act as our financial adviser in connection with our previously announced and ongoing strategic review to enhance stockholder value. Given both inbound interest we have received from third parties, coupled with continuing strong macro interest in GaN power with the help of Bank of America, we are systematically pursuing multiple options that may include the merger or sale of the company. As we previously discussed, we are working on securing non-dilutive debt financing as well as having in-depth discussions on certain licensing possibilities as we work to secure our financial runway well into fiscal 2025. Now moving on to Slide 4. I will next review our key vectors and execution metrics for the quarter. We reported $5 million revenue in Q2, 70% of which was from product sales that exceeded our expectations, with the majority coming from high-power, which is more than 300 watts for us. It is worth noting that competing e-mode GaN has not realized yet end product customer ramps due to unclear full voltage reliability of e-mode GaN, at least from offerings from the leading e-mode GaN Foundry. For fast chargers in the low-power space, we secured 15 new design-ins, taking the total to more than 115 with over 30 now in production. Notable is our multiple wins at two of the top three worldwide lap of OEMs due to the performance and reliability of d-mode normally off that delivers higher efficiency from an effectively smaller die due to its superior dynamic characteristics. We are gaining rapid traction with our SiP, our system in package strategy with more and more integrated controller and driver companies and the strong ecosystem partners now who are increasingly preferring to design-in Transphorm's pure-play GaN chips with more than five products now in design-in and two SiP products released. To the best of our knowledge, Transphorm still is the only GaN company with broad-based customers in the high-power across segments from 300 watts to over 4 kilowatts who have ramped in the market, and now we are addressing 7.5 kilowatt power levels from a single chip. Since our last update, we've had a record of 33% sequential increase in design-ins for high-power that stand today at over 100 of which over 35 are in production. Adding to our already diversified package portfolio, we introduced several new products, notably the high-power surface mount TOLL and TOLT topside cooled packages, a first for GaN. We are working with leading customers in the server, energy and microinverter space for this high-reliability high-performance parts. We are also sampling a 4-pin TO-247 high-power GaN, something e-mode GaN cannot do due to the inherent gate weakness – and these 4-pin TO-247 are pin-to-pin compatible with silicon carbide MOSFETs while exhibiting 25% lower losses at 5 kilowatts versus the latest silicon carbide MOSFETs from global top three supplier. Recent high-temperature full voltage stress testing on the SuperGaN products revealed superior reliability and the dynamic performance over e-mode GaN from the leading foundry that exhibited 400% increase in resistance, i.e., losses for the e-mode GaN case after just 500 hours of reliability testing. Where is this may be acceptable for low-power adapters, it certainly is not for high-powered server, industrial and automotive. And this is where Transphorm GaN especially excels. These, coupled with the ecosystem partnerships with IC companies for Transphorm GaN that can be used with standard controllers and drivers will also contribute to our anticipated sequential product revenue growth. Our 1200 volts GaN has progressed well with models and data sheets that are drawing significant interest from EV customers, some of who are even starting to view GaN as a possible future replacement for silicon carbide. With automotive qualified products today at 650 volts and then having 1200 volts in the future with the promise of a simpler supply chain and an attractive cost structure with gallium nitride. Our efforts to improve operational capacity and costs led to continued higher productivity from our Japan epireactors, while further capacity from qualification at our global wafer reactors is expected by the start of fiscal year 2025. We added high-volume packaging subcontractors for both our high-power and low-power products, a move aimed towards improving margins as well as capacity as we target aggressive growth over the next few quarters. Moving on to Slide 5 now. Let me turn to our partnerships in key manufacturing and customer initiatives. Our manufacturing scale expansion efforts remain ongoing with global wafer reactors now in qualification. And expect it to be done by the end of fiscal year 2024 to ramp in fiscal 2025. We now have six out of eight of our MOCVD reactors installed and running at various levels of production or development. And consistent with previous updates, about $50 million [ph] of annualized product revenue comprising both wafer and package products can be supported. Our AFSW wafer fab continues to operate on target and has sufficient capacity plans in place for fiscal year 2024 and 2025. With incoming interest of third parties in the AFSW wafer fab joint venture, we are also potentially looking to add a third partner that could reduce our ownership to roughly half of the current levels in fiscal 2025, while maintaining IP ownership for our technology in the fab. Transphorm has the only GaN offering with three and five micro-seconds short-circuit rating, developed under a funded effort from Yaskawa, a worldwide leader in motion control and robotics. We also achieved 12 kilowatts from a single device in a half-bridge topology without any paralleling, which promises over 30- to 60-kilowatt scale inverters when used in three-phase single and parallel mode, an important step towards enabling EV in wafers with gallium nitride. We also came one more step closer to achieving our targeted growth in the EV two-wheeler and three-wheeler charging space, with the release of 300 watt and 600 watts two- and three-wheeler EV charger power supply designs. We have successful ongoing design-ins at two of the top five India-based OEMs that we expect to ramp next calendar year. As stated before, with the automotive exclusivity behind us now, we progressed on worldwide customer engagements with EV four-wheeler customers for charger and converter applications, with 650-volt automotive AECQ one-on-one qualified products. And we are in early discussions regarding our 1,200-volt technology. Some manufacturers, including a leading U.S. OEM have engaged in efforts to develop gallium nitride as a potential future replacement of silicon carbide. We received payments of a little bit more than $1.4 million in Q2 on our NSTXL Epi wafer government program that was awarded to Transphorm in the fiscal first quarter of FY 2024. And thus far, we have received about $4.4 million of payments from performance under this award. We are also in meaningful discussions for licensing with various parties, some of whom are planning for GaN fab manufacturing under the U.S. chipsets. This would result in significant non-dilutive capital that could be in place in fiscal 2024. Last but not least, Transphorm is also part of the micro electronics common chipset trust through our participation in the coalition led by University of Southern California to enhance production of 5G and 6G semiconductor manufacturing, where we expect to secure support for funding through this program for enhancing some of our rf GaN epi trust. Now on to Slide 5. Our core capabilities, again, from low power to high-power wafers and package products are captured in our large and growing pipeline. In line with our strategic emphasis and revenue profile, about 70% of our power products pipeline applications are for high-power defined as over 300 watts. Across the full spectrum, Transphorm's gallium nitride is fundamentally superior to other GaN like e-mode GaN and typical foundry offerings, the impact of high reliability and robustness getting even more evident in the higher public areas. This, coupled with growing ecosystem partnerships with IC companies, both in the low-power and high-power space, we expect to convert larger portions of this pipeline into production, hence, supporting our targeted product revenue growth both near term and long term. In closing, our priorities will be on the following areas. First, progressing through the strategic review process now with the assistance of Bank of America, BofA Securities, to systematically identify the best options to enhance shareholder value, including the potential merger or sale of the company. And to secure non-dilutive debt and other capital, such as licensing, meaningfully extending our cash runway well into fiscal year 2025. Second, continuing sequential product revenue growth in the current fiscal Q3. And growing our worldwide sales and application footprint to enable faster conversion of our growing design-ins into revenue. All are based on our superior performance, high reliability, and cost effectiveness of SuperGaN products, as well as our ecosystem of strong solution partners in the IC space, SiPs notably, for lower power and system level solutions for higher power. Third, continue to improve margins through achieving higher volumes, transitioning to lower cost packaging subcontractors, and following our technology road map to improve performance while reducing costs. Fourth, accessing new markets like 800-volt battery EV systems. And adding new offerings, like the 1,200-volt GaN and motor-drive products with short-circuit capable GaN, as well as other novel topologies like the four-quadrant bidirectional switch all first enabled by Transphorm GaN. Overall, as one of the only pure-play GaN power semiconductor companies in the world, with volume production in both the low-power and high-power segments, we are well positioned to progress towards our long-term model in fiscal year 2024 and beyond. With that, I will hand it over to Cameron to walk you through our financials. Thank you.\nCameron McAulay: Thank you, Primit. And hello to everyone joining us today. Let me now start my remarks with a brief recap of our financial results for our most recently completed quarter. For my remarks, I will refer both to GAAP and non-GAAP results, which are reconciled to GAAP in our press release tables. Non-GAAP results exclude stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization, and other income and expenditure. Starting with the income statement. Total GAAP and non-GAAP revenue comprising product and government was $5 million in the quarter. This represents a decrease of 15% to the prior quarter and an increase of 36% over the same quarter last year. Product sales were $3.55 million in the quarter, in excess of our expectations. And an increase of 18% from the prior quarter and 12% from the same quarter last year. Our product revenue is being driven across a broad range of power conversion applications, including fast chargers and adapters, and gaming and data centers. As noted by Primit, we continue to see positive momentum with our customers and production. Looking to the immediate future, the company anticipates a continuation of our sequential product revenue growth in the current quarter. Government revenue was $1.45 million in the quarter, a decrease of $1.45 million in the prior quarter and an increase of $1 million from the same quarter of last year. This year-on year-increase has been driven by the successful award and execution of our new $50 million government program. We will continue to see solid revenue from this program over the year, with flattish revenue anticipated in the coming quarter. The reduction from the prior quarter is attributable to pre-work done at the inception of the contract that increased revenue particular to Q1. The gross margin in the quarter was 23%, down from 35% delivered in the prior quarter. And higher by 11%, when compared to the same quarter last year. The train driver here from the prior quarter was the reduced overall revenue from our higher margin government business. Direct margins for a product business remained largely stable in the quarter. We anticipate company gross margins will remain largely stable in the coming quarter for our product and government businesses. We continue to progress towards our long-term model of gross margins in excess of 40%. A number of actions, including new product introduction, ongoing cost efficiency activities, and benefits that we will receive as we continue to grow and scale are expected to contribute to this increase. Operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis were $6.4 million in the current quarter, down 6% from the prior quarter. Spend for the current quarter is anticipated to remain largely flat. Coming to EPS, I will focus my remarks here on the non-GAAP results. The non-GAAP EPS loss in the quarter was 8%, flat when compared to the prior quarter. From an operational perspective, we continue to see solid traction in our targeted markets as evidenced by our improvement in both customers and production, and design and activity. As mentioned earlier, the company anticipates sequential product revenue growth in the current quarter. Our short-term focus is on product execution and enabling capacity expansion to support medium- to long-term growth. We also continue to invest in the long-term growth engine of the company. Coming out of the balance sheet our shareholders’ equity was $23.7 million at the end of the quarter, an increase from $19.6 [ph] million as of March 31, and $22.8 million in June.  Operational cash burn excluding capital investment, decreased significantly in the quarter from $6.8 million to $5.1 million. This was driven primarily by improved collections, including receipts from our government business and ongoing tight spend management procedures. As noted in the prior quarter, the company has no debt on its balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $6.2 million at quarter end, enabled largely through the $8 million received from our rights issue. We continue to progress towards completion on debt facilities and expect to conclude these facilities in the near term. Looking ahead, we continue to remain open to opportunities to further strengthen our balance sheet in order to ensure that we are able to continue to invest in our growth. A growth made possible through our continued progress with the design wins and production customers. Concluding now with a few key highlights. Transphorm publicly listed on the NASDAQ Exchange, is a global leader in robust GaN, the future of next-generation power systems. Our disruptive, best-in-class technology is addressing a large growing market opportunity. We are commercially ramping with a strong pipeline in place. We have established a strong network of blue-chip partners and have a comprehensive product offering to-date that meets our customers' needs across a wide range of power levels and segments. All of this is underpinned by the industry's strongest IP position, a vertically-integrated supply chain and a deep and talented team. That concludes our prepared remarks on materials, and we would now like to open the call to any questions. Operator, please proceed with the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] One moment for our first question. And our first question comes from the line of David Williams from The Benchmark Company. Your question pleaser.\nDavid Williams: Hey. Good afternoon everyone. It's certainly good to speak with you again and congrats on just the continued progress here. I guess first, Primit, I wanted to ask a little bit about the process that you're going through on the strategic side. You talked about having a lot of interest there. Is there any further maybe color you can provide there in terms of the types of interests and really where things are leaning today? Is there anyone that's shown some interest that gets you more optimistic? Or just anything, I guess, to help us understand how you're thinking about this ongoing strategic review? Thank you.\nPrimit Parikh: No. Thank you. Thank you, David. I think the most important thing there, and as we talked we hired BofA Securities, Bank of America to help us channel systematically this interest that we talked about the inbound interest so we can do the due process for all of these opportunities that are in the way. That is what we can share publicly. We can – definitely, we will continue to update on that as soon as updates become due. But that's a key message, that we did this for a reason, getting BofA Securities onboard so we can systematically channel through all these opportunities.\nDavid Williams: Yes. Thanks for that. And I thought it was interesting, your commentary, just about silicon carbide or GaN being a competitor there, and we've talked about this quite a bit in the past. But we heard one of your peers earlier this week that also it was probably the most glowing review that I've heard before publicly in terms of just that opportunity. Can you talk to us about how you think about GaN in terms of displacing silicon carbide, and especially as it matures and where we are today? But it feels like just from an efficiency standpoint and a cost perspective that there would be a large opportunity, at least in that 1,200 volts kind of range, that the GaN could really feel and become the de facto kind of standard. Is that how you feel? And maybe just any color there would be helpful. Thank you very much.\nPrimit Parikh: No. Thanks David. We definitely strongly believe in that, right. So today, if you look at kind of the low-power and intermediate power, and the high-power side space, there is not too much silicon carbide. Of course, silicon carbide has done very well on the automotive side, right, with many strong companies in the freight. But according to physics, this is just physics that GaN should have 70% lower losses than silicon carbide. And I think we have announced publicly before and shown results that Transphorm GaN, other GaN, I don't know about, but Transphorm GaN has harnessed about half of that 25% to 35% lower losses than silicon carbide with the affordable cost structure of GaN-on-Silicon for 650 volts and for our 1,200 volts platform, GaN-on-Sapphire. So that's the reason we believe this inquiry is now for – even for automotive, there was no question on the other areas we are into micro inverters, for example, server, UPS, all of those areas. But now for automotive side, the interest – inbound interest coming in has been very exciting for us, both for 650 volts, for the 400 [ph] volt battery node and then with our GaN-on-Sapphire 1,200 volt node for the 800 volt battery application. So exciting, definitely.\nDavid Williams: That's great. Well, congrats again on the progress and certainly looking forward to hearing how the rest of the year turns out and further GaN adoption. Thank you, sir.\nPrimit Parikh: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis from B. Riley. Your question please.\nEthan Widell: Hi. This is Ethan Widell calling in for Craig Ellis. Thanks for taking my questions. To start, it sounds like you have some nice design and activity, especially in high-power. I guess between high and low-power, where are you seeing more engagement activity and value? And what is your confidence level and your ability to fulfill demand? Thank you.\nPrimit Parikh: Yes. So on that, as we have said before, right, high-power is where Transphorm is one of the undisputed leaders in high-power GaN, that is. And we continue to want to establish our leadership and extend our leadership in high-power. And about 70% we have said it, of our revenues come from high-power. That said, we do like the low-power segment, of course, because we offer better performance with reliability and it's a good ramping area for us, especially with the system in package, SiP partnerships that we talked about with multiple very strong IC partners enabled again by the so-called open architecture or easy, easy drivable architecture of Transphorm scan. So clearly our focus leadership in high-power, 70% revenue is there. Low-power is a good segment; we want to win our fair share in that market. In terms of fulfilling the demand, we continue to do two things there. One is focus on our sales and FAE [ph], sales – sales and field application footprint worldwide. That's an important part to continue to fulfill that demand and support customers. And second, as you heard in the call on capacity, our epi wafer capacity is coming up nicely, and our wafer fab has been stable with plans in place for capacity increases there. So for the near- and mid-term, we are reasonably well set to fulfilling the demand with those two key areas I talked about.\nEthan Widell: Thank you. And then could you speak to your expected cash burn over the next few quarters? And whether equipment based financing is still an option that you're considering?\nCameron McAulay: Sure, yes. Thank you, Cameron here. So the one thing I see is we brought our cash burn down significantly from 6.8 to 5.1 in the current quarter, and I think that it will likely hover around that level for the near future. I think, the key thing for us, as Primit mentioned in his prepared remarks is that we're actively pursuing primarily debt facilities, but also looking at licensing opportunities. The combination of that would bring our financial stability comfortably into fiscal 2025, and we're hoping to conclude that in the near term.\nEthan Widell: Understood. Much appreciated.\nCameron McAulay: Just, I was finishing the thought on equipment leasing here. That is an avenue that we remain open to, and we're continuing to pursue that along with our other avenues of potential funding.\nEthan Widell: Yes. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Your question please.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, yes. Thanks guys, and good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Yes. I guess, a few if I could. Just going back, Primit, to the strategic review, is there any time frame? Or any sort of time-related signpost that you guys are looking at that would be useful for us to be aware of?\nPrimit Parikh: I think, the key thing I'll reiterate there, Ananda is with BofA Securities on, we are working hand-in-hand with them to very systematically now to drive this process. We'll definitely be updating as and when the key updates are due, public updates are due, but we are progressing very systematically with BofA here.\nAnanda Baruah: Okay. Got it. Thanks. Thanks for that, Primit. And just going to the product roadmap, the ramps you guys are seeing in product revenue, lots of wins. The high-powered wins seem like they really amplified the last 90 days. What's a useful way for us to think about, given the design in activity, given the momentum that you've seen and you're calling to continue to see sequentially in product growth. What's a useful way for us to think about the impact of what's then good design activity, sort of both high-power and low-power manifesting into revenue dynamics across the product portfolio over the next 12 to 24 months? And any context underpins, that would be like super useful too. Thanks. \nPrimit Parikh: Great question. The way we think about those and just based on our historical experience and where we are today with customer. First of all, we were very pleased with the growth in the – especially, we grew the low-power design-ins by 15% versus last quarter, and the high-power, like we said, 33% from 75-plus to 100-plus just in one quarter. And this was a result of again, our products' reputation in the field and performance and just adding a few sales heads in Asia, which helped us expand so much. And long term, the way we think about it, the conversion is on the high-power side, the design cycles are slightly higher. It could be from 12 months to 18 months. For a brand new design from scratch, it could be even 18 to 24 months. On the low-power, they tend to be faster from say nine months. If it's a derivative product, it could even be as fast as six months, but usually nine months. And a brand new product with a large ODM, large OEM could be 12 months plus. And historically, on the high-power side, our conversion rate has been very strong around more than 75% conversion rate. That doesn't mean other 25% it lost is maybe still ongoing, but we have had very good success rate on the high-power. On the low-power it tends to be a bit more fragmented. But that's why we are adding. We have more than 100 – 100-plus, 115-plus wins now ongoing. And on that side of the step, we have taken with our SiP, system in chip partners is something we expect next two, three quarters to start adding revenue nicely because it actually magnifies our own sales channels and application channels with these SiP partners that we have.\nAnanda Baruah: And Primit, just to follow-up on, I guess the high-power, both are interesting, but the high-power is just because that's a bigger impact. Of the 35 products you have in production right now – of the 35 products in which you're in production right now, is that to say, given the time, sort of the timeline that you actually just spoke to, is that to say, well, let me just – I guess what I'm wondering is, the 35 you have in the field today, how did those layer in over the last 36 months? And is it useful to say that of the 100 you have, that in the next 36 months, given the time frame you gave, you could sort of double the amount of products in production? Is there any usefulness in that?\nPrimit Parikh: No. Good question. Again in the next – I think we can look back where we were in terms of the 35, I believe a couple of months ago. I mean a couple of quarters ago, sorry, we were about, I would say 20-plus, if I remember correctly, and where we expect out of the 100-plus design ins we have. So 35-plus are in production. So you can say around 70 – 65, 70 are still design ins, right? So over the next 18 to 24 months, I would say, if our estimates are good, around 80% of that. So you can say out of the 70 to 80, about 80%. So there'll be like 55, 60 of them more would get into production. So yes, we should more than double from where we are today. That's a good way to look at it.\nAnanda Baruah: Cool. And just you mentioned the new sales force was sort of the messaging to be that the 30% sequential increase in high end designs-in was primarily driven by the incremental sales force?\nPrimit Parikh: No, it helps the coverage, but it's actually primarily driven by the products we have, benefits versus e-mode GaN and performance benefits versus silicon carbide. The proven reliability and the 200 billion hours in the field. But the coverage – coverage definitely helps. That's why I alluded to it. Just like a headcount or two, you can suddenly get coverage of 15 more accounts. Right. So that definitely helps.\nAnanda Baruah: Got it. And so, it is more – And really? What I guess I'm trying to tease out is, are these kinds of sequential increases, these kinds of wins, is there something that's structurally sustainable to it, these design-ins? Do you sort of hit a stride, so to speak, such that I don't know if it's 30% Q-over-Q, but like 25 new ones sequentially? Have you hit something that's a bit of a sweet spot now? Or I guess maybe – is this maybe not sustainable?\nPrimit Parikh: I think we were very pleased with where we were this quarter, right. So I think if we look at past, we've been adding healthily on the high-power side, right. I believe two quarters ago we were 60 and then we went to 75, so we added 15. This time we added more. It's a very good quarter we had in terms of new design-ins added. So, yes, we should – I mean, we cannot get a 33% increase, I think every quarter-over-quarter. But we should look to healthy increases, right? Because the products are there, the performance is there, the manufacturing capacity is there. And with promotions and what we are gaining worldwide footprint now, we should look forward to these increases. But I cannot say whether each quarter will be a 30% increase.\nCameron McAulay: Certainly, Ananda, the biggest single increase in our operating spend, if I look back 12 months to today, has been in sales and marketing – sorry, sales and marketing and application is what we've invested significantly and I think you can start to see the momentum coming from that additional headcount.\nAnanda Baruah: That’s helpful. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Martin from AIGH Investment Partners. Your question please.\nAaron Martin: Hi, guys. Congratulations on the progress. Congratulations on the, I think it's the first EV two wheeler and three wheeler design-ins. Can you talk a little bit more about that and kind of your expectations there? And you're talking with multiple – I think, you said you had two design-ins looking for a design win by the end of the year and a ramp in 2024. How should we think about the EV two wheeler market? We're obviously much further along than the four wheeler in terms of sizing and the kind of ramp. Are those, how do those designs compare from a size perspective relative to some of the other designs you currently have?\nPrimit Parikh: Thank you for that. So, yes, it is definitely exciting. The first two design-ins we won, and these are very reputable customers, two out of the top five as we speak. And we are targeting, we expect to get initial production orders by end of the year towards that, and then ramp in calendar year 2024. Like we have said before, we still expect these design-ins to be around $1 million level from the EV. Not each design win million-dollar level, but hit $1 million-plus level in calendar year 2024. And we are engaged actually beyond the two out of five, we are engaged with 10-plus customers actually in India and Asia on this two wheeler charger opportunities at the onboard charger or a portable charger or a poll charger in the two wheeler space. So – on the question of the size ultimately versus, say, if you look at a four wheeler opportunity on the onboard charger or the inverter, those will be much larger size, but a little bit behind in time. But coming right now, where it stands with the two wheeler and three wheeler and if we compare it to, say, our design-ins – other design-ins such as server power or blockchain or inverter, UPS space we have. We believe it can be as much or even more growing in this EV two wheeler segment in the next – in 2024 and 2025.\nAaron Martin: Okay. And then for the ramp in 2024, are you expecting more than these two design wins – design-ins or that's really these two designs-ins are enough for that?\nPrimit Parikh: No, we do hope to get more design-ins also for 2024, which we are working on.\nAaron Martin: Okay. Congratulations on the progress.\nPrimit Parikh: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Primit Parikh for any further remarks.\nPrimit Parikh: No, thank you. Thank you for the attention today, and we expect to continue on this momentum that we have secured with moving along with the strategic review and extending our cash runway well into fiscal 2025, executing on our product priorities and product revenue growth, backed by cost down and margin improvements. And then executing on our new products to keep continuing growing the design-ins and stay ahead of competition. Thank you very much, and till next time.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."

With that said, it is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Transphorm's CEO, Primit Parikh. Primit?\nPrimit Parikh: Thank you, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. We are pleased to report a strong first quarter of fiscal 2024 with revenues of $5.9 million in our targeted range and over 13% higher than fiscal first quarter of 2023. In less than two months from our last earnings webcast, our power products pipeline has grown to over $450 million with our total pipeline nearly at $600 million, dominated by high-power products where Transphorm has a clear quality, performance and IP differentiation. Q1 revenue was roughly evenly split between product revenue and government revenue, the former at $3 million and the latter at $2.9 million, including a catch-up from the delayed start we had reported in the prior quarter. More than 70% of the product revenue mix came from high-power, where Transphorm continues to be the world's number one GaN company with superior high performance and reliability over every other GaN competitor, notably e-mod GaN. We continue to make new advances, unlocking more capability of GaN to address even larger market segments. A good recent example is our achievement on short circuit rating capability, a key for motor drives and inverters. We continue to have increased win in the lower power arena with proliferation starting within our existing Fortune 100 accounts as well now, as well as 1 of the largest ODMs in the world. Additionally, we are now successfully executing on our $15 million NSTXL government contract, already securing $2.9 million of cash receipts since our June investor update. Moving on now to Slide 3, I will start with a high-level corporate update first. Our designing momentum remains strong as we focus on expanding leadership in three key high-power verticals: Computing, which includes power for data centers; artificial intelligence machines and blockchain computing; energy and industrials, which includes micro-inverter, UPS and servo motors; and electric vehicles with two and three wheelers first, followed by four wheelers. On the low-power side, our GaN products, both discrete and SiPs with the system in package varieties with our ecosystem partners continue to lead in efficiency and reliability with the physics-based benefits of Transphorm's Super GaN products versus e-mode GaN technology. Coupled with a strong pipeline, we now see resumption of sequential product revenue growth in the second quarter. Second, we closed our rights offering, raising approximately $8 million of capital from our key shareholders led by KKR, who fully exercised their pro rata rights. As we previously discussed, we are working on securing non-dilutive asset and AR-based debt financing. We also have active discussions on certain licensing possibilities as we work to secure a financial run rate well into fiscal 2025. With the rights offering completed, we are now beginning our previously announced strategic review of Transphorm with the goal of maximizing shareholder value. Given both inbound third-party interest we have received, as well as strong macro interest, including recent M&A activity in the GaN arena, we believe the time is right for this process. This review encompasses strategic and/or traditional equity or debt financings, U.S. and Asia-based licensing opportunities, and potential M&A opportunities, again, all with the focused objective of maximizing shareholder value. Turning to Slide 4 now, I will go into our key vectors and metrics for the quarter. We reported $5.9 million of revenue within our targeted range, roughly evenly split between product and government revenues with majority contribution coming from high power, which is more than 300 watts for us, where competing GaN has not yet realized meaningful end customer product revs (ph). For the fast chargers in the low power space, we secured more than 10 new design-ins, taking the total to more than 100 with over 30 now in production. We are gaining rapid traction with our System-in-Package, SiP strategy, we adopted earlier this year with integrated controller and driver and strong ecosystem partners like Weltrend, a leading IC provider. With the dynamic capability and superior performance advantage of our Super GaN FETs versus typical foundry style e-mode GaN, we have the versatility to use the same Transphorm GaN chip for 65 watts or 100 watt adapter design. And crossover difficult, it's not impossible with e-mode GaN. We are ramping into designs for multiple Fortune 100 OEMs and leading ODMs in this area, supporting our expectations of resumed sequential product revenue growth. To the best of our knowledge, Transphorm is still the only GaN company with customers in the high power ramped in the market from segments 300 watts to 4 kilowatts, and we are now in the process of extending that to 7.5 kilowatts with some new design-ins. Since our last update, we had another 25% sequential increase in design-ins for high power that today stand at over 75, of which over 30 are in production. In addition to Transphorm being the only GaN company to have ramped in the attractive micro inverter segment, we recently achieved another first by demonstrating a robust 5 microsecond short circuit withstand rating, which is a safety spec required for large market segments like motor drives and inverters. Our team recently completed a 600-watt battery charging solution for EV two-wheelers with our Super GaN FET achieving over 1% efficiency gain or 14% loss reduction in this application versus silicon super junction with 25% lower device count, making it cheaper than silicon with superior performance over silicon. We continue to expand our product offerings in what is the most diverse package portfolio for GaN power devices. High performance and industry standard compact PQFN style packaging for lower power to standard robust TO packages for higher power, that by the way, e-mode GaN today cannot do due to its inherent weakness to a new robust high-power surface mount packages. These coupled with ecosystem partnerships with IC companies for Transphorm GaN that can be used with standard controllers and drivers will also contribute to our anticipated sequential product revenue growth. Continuing with our 1,200-volt GaN progress, we now introduced a preliminary data sheet generating significant interest from EV customers who begin to see Transphorm GaN as future-proof 650 volts today, 1,200 volt in future, directly taking on silicon carbide. On the operations side, our focus on capacity and cost improvements has led to record productivity from our Japan Epi reactors. On the packaging side, where we have completed our dual sourcing and cost down activity for high-power products, we will expect margins and cost improvements. We have now started multi-sourcing and cost down activity for our low-power products as we target aggressive growth over the next few quarters in this area as well. Moving on to Slide 5, let me now turn our attention to partnership and key initiatives. I want to highlight our GlobalWafers Corporation relationship, a key partnership for MOCVD epi wafer scaling with a large international $6 billion-plus market cap materials and manufacturing leader. We remain on course to qualify two reactors and release them to production by the end of the fiscal year with early samples by end of the current calendar year. As a recap, we already have six out of our eight MOCVD reactors installed with four running at various levels of production or development today. With the eight reactors we already possess, we can support $50 million of annualized product revenue. Our AFSW wafer fab continues to operate on target and a sufficient capacity in place for fiscal year '24 and plans in place for fiscal year 2025. In collaboration with Yaskawa, our customer partner and meaningful shareholder and also a worldwide leader in motion control and robotics, we have achieved a major breakthrough with our patented technology for short-circuit rated gallium nitride, demonstrating 5 microsecond with 10x at high voltage, previously, possible only with silicon IGBTs or silicon carbide. Simultaneously, we achieved 12 kilowatts of power from a single device in a half bridge topology without any paralleling. This first with high performance GaN, a key safety feature for rugged applications like servo and industrial motor drives, along with the high-power capability addresses a multibillion-dollar TAM, including servo, industrial motors and electric vehicle powertrains and further underscores the robustness of Transphorm's GaN power portfolio. With solutions from 350 watts to 2 kilowatts, we are deepening design traction with multiple solutions now in the two- and three-wheeler electric vehicle space, a focus area we have outlined previously and now engaged in design-ins for multiple customers in Asia, including recently a more than $5 billion market cap top three EV two- and three-wheeler India-based manufacturer. We remain on track for achieving million-dollar level ramps in this EV segment, the two and three-wheeler EV segment next calendar year. With the automotive exclusivity with respect to the Nexperia contract behind us, we have started worldwide customer engagements with EV four-wheeler customers, with our automotive AEC-Q101-qualified 650-volt products, and we are in early discussions regarding our 1,200 volt technology that is already generating a lot of interest. We are now well underway with performing on our NSTXL epi wafer government program that was awarded to Transphorm in the fiscal first quarter of '24. Thus far, we have received $2.9 million of cash from performance under this award. We are also in discussions for potential licensing revenue with parties, some of whom are planning for GaN manufacturing under the U.S. CHIPS Act program. Moving to Slide 6 now. Our core capabilities from low power to high power, wafers and packaged products are well captured in our large and growing pipeline. Now over $450 million in power products and close to $600 million, including power device wafers and our government contract business. Reflecting on our recent revenue profile, 70% of our power products pipeline is also for high power, about 300 watts, where Transphorm is superior to other GaN offerings, including e-mode and typical foundry-based offerings. Our focus will be on: one, progressing through the strategic review process, identifying the best options for enhanced shareholder value and continuing to secure nondilutive debt and other capital, meaningfully extending our cash runway well into fiscal year 2025; second, resuming sequential product revenue growth in the current fiscal Q2 and growing our worldwide sales and application footprint to enable faster conversion of growing design-ins into ramp production, all based on our superior performance, higher liability SuperGaN products, as well as our ecosystem of strong solution partners in ICs, SiPs for lower power and system-level solutions for higher power; third, improving margins through higher volume, lower cost packaging and our technology road map, improving performance while reducing cost; and four, accessing new markets like 800 volt battery electric vehicle systems with new offerings like our 1,200 volt gallium nitride and motor drives and short circuit capable GaN, both first in GaN from Transphorm. Overall, as one of the only pure-play GaN power semiconductor companies in the world with volume production in low-power and high-power segments, we are well positioned to progress towards our long-term model in fiscal year 2024 and beyond. With that, I will hand it over to Cameron to walk you through our financials in detail. Thank you.\nCameron McAulay: Thank you, Primit, and hello to everyone joining us today. Let me now start my remarks with a brief recap of our financial results for the recently completed quarter. For my remarks, I will refer both to GAAP and non-GAAP results, which are reconciled to GAAP in our press release table. Non-GAAP results exclude stock-based compensation, depreciation, amortization and other income and expenditure. Starting with the income statement. Total GAAP and non-GAAP revenue comprising product and government was $5.9 million in the quarter. This represents an increase of 84% for the prior quarter and 14% over the same quarter last year. This was in line with our projected revenue. Product sales were $3 million in the quarter. Our product revenue is being driven across a broad range of core conversion applications, including fast chargers and adapters, gaming and data centers. As noted by Primit, we continue to see positive momentum with our customers in production. Looking to the immediate future, the company anticipates a return to sequential product revenue growth in the current quarter. Government revenue was $2.9 million in the quarter. This increase being driven by a successful award and execution of our new $15 million government program. We will continue to see solid revenue from this program over the year, but some reduction from Q1 is anticipated. The gross margin in the quarter was 35.5%, a significant increase from the 5% delivered in the prior quarter and higher by 14% when compared to the same quarter last year. The prime driver here was the increased margin from our government business. The net margins for our product business remains strong. Overall, company gross margins will drop in the current quarter with the reduction of government revenue and associated fixed cost impact on gross margins, but with our direct margins remaining consistent, we will be able to deliver solid margin performance continuing to improve further as we resume product revenue growth. We continue to progress towards our long-term model, our gross margins in excess of 40%. A number of actions, including new product introductions, ongoing cost efficiency activities and benefits that we will receive as we grow and scale are expected to contribute to this increased gross margin. Operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis were $6.8 million in the current quarter, a reduction from $7.5 million in the prior quarter. This reduction being driven by a number of factors, including government absorption, reduced legal costs and other smaller efficiencies. Spend for the quarter is anticipated to be largely flat. Turning to EPS. The non-GAAP EPS loss in the quarter was $0.08. This compares to a $0.13 loss in the prior quarter. The main driver here being the increased revenue and margins, together with lower OpEx. From an operational perspective, we continue to see solid traction in our targeted markets as evidenced by our improvement in both customers of production and design-in activity. As mentioned earlier, the company anticipates a return to sequential product revenue growth in the current quarter. Our shot-term focus is on product execution and enabling capacity expansion to support medium to long-term growth. We also continue to invest in the long-term growth engine of the company. Turning now to the balance sheet. Our shareholders' equity was $22.8 million at the end of the quarter, an increase from $19.6 million as at March 31. Operational cash burn, excluding capital investment decreased in the quarter to $6.7 million. This was driven primarily by improved collections, including $500,000 from our customer partner, Yaskawa, reduced waste costs driven by timing of payroll and ongoing tight spend management procedures. In addition to this, the company paid off a $12 million revolving credit facility and now have a balance sheet with no debt. For the current quarter, we expect the continuation of the reduction in our cash burn enabled by strong collections and our continued focus with cost controls. Cash and cash equivalents were $3.3 million at the quarter end. As announced, the company strengthened its balance sheet in the current quarter with the $8 million received from our raise issue. Additionally, we also received $2.9 million in the quarter in relation to our government contract. We continue to progress towards completion of asset-backed, nondilutive debt, and we expect to conclude these facilities in the near term. Looking ahead, we continue to remain open to opportunities to further strengthen our balance sheet in order to ensure that we are able to continue to invest in our growth, a growth made possible through our continued progress with design-ins and production customers. Concluding now with a few key highlights. Transphorm, publicly listed on the NASDAQ Exchange is a global leader and robust GaN, the future of next-generation power systems. Our disruptive best-in-class technology is addressing a large growing market opportunity. We are commercially ramping with a strong pipeline in place. We have established a strong network of blue-chip partners and have a comprehensive product offering today that meets our customers' needs across a wide range of power levels and segments. All of this is underpinned by the industry's strongest IT position, a vertically integrated supply chain and a deep and talented team. That completes our prepared remarks and materials, and we would now like to open the call to any questions. Operator, please proceed with the Q&A portion of the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from David Williams with The Benchmark Company. Your line is open.\nDavid Williams: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for the color and allow me to ask the question here. I guess, Cameron, just -- I get first to you. Just kind of thinking about the inventory level. We're up to about $8 million this Q, we've got the accounts receivable that's up about 57% sequentially. Can you talk a little bit about that? What's driving that? And when do you think you can convert that into cash?\nCameron McAulay: Sure. Thanks, David. Specifically for accounts receivable, about 30% of that accounts receivable was tied to the government deliverables that we referenced in our prepared remarks, and we've since received that. So you can expect to see accounts receivable coming down in the current quarter. Inventory from quarter-to-quarter was up slightly, mostly due to the fact that the standard cost increased our overall NP number. There wasn't an increase in inventory per se. And we've managed to keep inventory, I would say, pretty flat from September '22 to current date. And obviously, we'll continue to manage that and make sure we're being efficient in that regard.\nDavid Williams: Okay. Very good. Just kind of given the level of demand that you see in front of you, what do you think is the most appropriate level there on the inventory side? Is $8 million about it? Or should we see that -- would you prefer to see that down maybe with a quarter's worth of revenue?\nCameron McAulay: For me, I think what we've got to do is make sure we've got an inventory level that allows us to support the business, David. And as we resume sequential revenue growth, we want to make sure that we strike that balance between having the right inventory number and having the inventory number that allows us to scale and to support our customers. So I'm relatively comfortable with an inventory number in the raise that it has right now.\nDavid Williams: Okay. I certainly appreciate that help. And then I wanted to ask, it sounds like or at least it seems like the data center and artificial intelligence kind of trends, you guys already designed into power supplies there. Just kind of curious if you're seeing that demand pulled in and since you already have existing design-ins, are those being pulled in? And just any activity you're seeing around the AI trends in the data center would be very helpful. Thank you.\nPrimit Parikh: Yes. No, thank you for that. So we're -- that -- all of that is in our computing segment, computing and storage and networking segment, which is traditionally been strong for us -- steady and strong segment. So we are seeing some nice upticks in the computing segment with the server-based designs in the AI space, our technology, our products and our customer products, with GaN-based highly efficient GaN-based power supply, titanium-rated power supplies from GaN with Transphorm. We were one of the first by the way and have a very patented -- broadly patented approach for realizing titanium-based high-efficiency servers for, amongst other things, AI and high-power computing in general. So we are seeing some nice design-ins there in the space of indirectly impacting AI. Our existing wins, which we are seeing proliferation is in the area of servers, high-power gaming and blockchain computing.\nDavid Williams: Thanks so much. Certainly appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey. Thanks, guys. Appreciate you letting me ask question. Congrats on the progress. And I guess, just to put out on the -- with regards to the strategic review process, you're saying that you're now officially underway. Can you describe to us what the milestones are, at least these initial milestones? Have you hired a banker yet? How long do you think that process takes that you haven't? And anything else that's relevant that you get started here? And I have a few follow-ups. Thanks.\nPrimit Parikh: So yes, Ananda. So what we said and just clarifying again that we are beginning our previously announced strategic review process. So some of the specifics, we cannot yet comment on. But we are talking, we continue to discuss with the bankers who are familiar with Transphorm and also those bankers who were involved in recent similar transactions in the power electronics, GaN, silicon carbide-related arena. So we are doing all of those discussions. We cannot comment more specifics at this time. But again, like we said, we begin our -- we are beginning our review process, and it will include multiple opportunities like financing, strategic semiconductor financing, traditional financing, licensing, like we talked about in the call and potential M&A. All this will be part and parcel of the discussions.\nAnanda Baruah: Awesome. And Primit, how are you finding sort of interest the opportunity holistically relative to what your desires would be when -- sort of when you started the process?\nPrimit Parikh: Again, I think, look, our primary focus is to -- very exciting design-in and momentum space that we have got in front of us, really keep growing that, keep converting more of the design wins to design wins and ramp the design wins. So that's a clear business focus of Transphorm. And then like we said, equally important to enhance shareholder value and accelerate the growth of our GaN business we are doing and beginning to start our strategic review. So we are finding, like we said, again, various levels of inbound interest because Transphorm obviously is a well-known name. It's one of the few pure-play GaN companies out there with the strongest products in low-power and high-power, very strong IP, our own wafer manufacturing and clear kind of differentiator in various areas that we talked into low-power, high-power, 1,200 volt GaN and things like that. So we are finding a kind of interest across the board in this space. And -- which is why to channel those inbound interest properly is why we are, again, doing this with -- again, a single-minded focus to enhance shareholder value.\nAnanda Baruah: No, that sounds good. That sounds great. You may have mentioned in the prepared remarks about the ability to increase the velocity of design-in impact. And I just wanted to make sure I just -- I understood the context there of those remarks. Does that -- do you recall making those remarks?\nPrimit Parikh: Yes. So like we said, our pipeline is very strong. In just the last six or seven weeks since we did our year-end call end of June, we've got a 10% increase in design-ins in the low-power and 25% increase in design-ins in the high-power. So now as we -- our goal is to convert more and more of those design-ins, solid design-ins into production and ramping those, right, at both ramping new customers as well as the parallel designs proliferating at existing customers taking more slots in the design and existing customers. And we are doing that through a couple of things. We have already put in place over the last six to nine months, personnel in place relationships and technical resources to, first of all, garner this strong pipeline. And now as we go on our own team in worldwide sales and application as well as very important customers and our partners, right. Our IC partners that we have to increase the momentum. All of those two or three things put together, we look forward to getting more traction in increasing revenues faster. We also aim to add new geographies like India, for example, as well as increase our U.S. based sales.\nAnanda Baruah: That's all great. And I guess if -- like structurally, can you give us any sense as you sort of implement these various initiatives and processes? Any sense structurally after this is complete, the impact it can have in, I don't know, sort of the development to revenue cycle or development the qualification cycle, whatever the appropriate metrics are.\nPrimit Parikh: Yes, both actually, right, qualifications internally and then working with qualification, the product qualification design, qualification at our customers and then impacting the revenue cycles. Both of them we intend to shorten. Particularly the example I gave at proliferating within existing customers, more slots and supporting our existing customers to do more. That's an area we particularly want to emphasize upon. And, like, we are confident now looking at the pipeline and what we have in the process to resume good sequential product revenue growth from here on now.\nAnanda Baruah: That’s great. I appreciate the context. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Your line is open. Craig, please check your mute button.\nCraig Ellis: Can you hear me now.\nPrimit Parikh: Yes.\nCraig Ellis: Yeah. Thank you. Apologies there. So my first question, I'll direct to you, Cameron, and then I want to follow up on some of the strategic issues with you, Primit. Cameron, really nice gross margins in the quarter with significant government mix. Now there was a catch-up payment, which we won't have in the current quarter. So can you just help us with the arc of gross margins over the next couple of quarters with the contribution from government? And then how significantly do you think volume can scale given the breadth of design wins both in higher and lower voltage? Thank you.\nCameron McAulay: Sure. No, thank you. So yes, government, there will be a mix change as we think about the quarter that we're in to Q2 and Q3, and you'll see more -- proportionately more product. Government will revert back to more kind of normalized levels of activity. But even with that, because we've got more scale because we're still seeing solid margins in our direct business -- although there will be a drop in -- from Q1 to Q2 margins, it will be a drop that will still form the company's solid margins. And from there, it is largely a case of upscaling the business, continue to bring the pipeline over the finish line and continue to do it in a way that allows us to see a kind of steady increase in gross margins from there. And we should anticipate seeing that in the back half of FY '24 and into '25 as we scale our production business.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have a question from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Your line is open.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you, Primit, Cameron. Primit, maybe for you first. You mentioned the 1,200-volt GaN now sort of in data sheet. When can we realistically think about sampling of the 1200-volt products?\nPrimit Parikh: Thanks, Tore, for that. So we've started discussions with a few customers systematically on that. First, we announced the modeling at PCIM, now the preliminary data sheet. So we are working through it. What we expect in sampling, sometimes in the calendar year 2024, the early part of calendar year 2024, we expect sampling -- limited sampling to closer kind of so-called customer partners who want to work with us closely into system-based design and evaluation of this technology. But the very important thing about that, about the 1,200 volt is, like we mentioned, customers. Now this is also helping, frankly, our traction with 650 volt, existing call it, automotive qualified products that we have today because customers see us now that, look, we can have 650 volts for 400 volts battery today. And then in the future, when we want to design for 800-volt batteries, the 1,200 volts is in place, all with gallium nitride.\nTore Svanberg: That's very helpful. And also a question for Cameron a little bit related to Craig's question, but maybe asked a little bit differently. So how should we think about mix for the next few quarters? Will we sort of revert back to 75-25, kind of a mix between product and government? And what will it take for the product gross margin to be a bit more optimized? Is that sort of like $5 million in product revenue per quarter or higher than that?\nCameron McAulay: Sure. No, thank you. I think the split, roughly 50-50 in this quarter, I think it will be two-thirds one from [indiscernible] in the September quarter as I think about the difference between the two, Tore. And then you'll start to see product continue to have a higher percentage. I think that the government will be flatter just in the general trajectory. So you'll see production from a greater part of the overall revenue number. In terms of margin improvement, I think it's a few different things. I mean some of it is scale, so that we can absorb the indirect cost of manufacturing. Some of it will be, as Primit mentioned, cost and activity, getting the cost out of the parts, transitioning people over to a new sleeker products. So I don't think it's one individual thing. I think it's a combination of three or four different things that will help drive the margins and improve the margins as we go forward.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question from Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities. Your line is open.\nCraig Ellis: Yeah. Thanks. Primit, I wanted to come back and just ask about the strategic alternatives. Can you help us understand the time line that you and the Board are working with? And any key milestones associated with that time line that investors can look to gauge progress down the road? Thank you.\nPrimit Parikh: Thank you for that. So again, we have started preliminary, we have begun under a strategic review process. We obviously, we will proceed -- two key objectives we have, maximizing shareholder value along with -- and it's the same objective at the end of the day, growing our GaN business, right? So converting this momentum on our own with partners faster than we can. We have not set a very specific like ABC time line of this yet, but we definitely will be updating the investors as we go along. But the key is we have inbound inquiries, our design-in momentum is very, very strong, like we alluded to. And there's a lot of activity happening, as you all know as well, in the GaN field. So these three vectors together coming together is the right confluence to have -- kind of embark on this process.\nCraig Ellis: That's helpful. And do you envision this leading to you selecting a single partner or is it possible that you would have multiple partners depending on their technology position or desired technology, geographic domicile market focus, et cetera.?\nPrimit Parikh: It is possible to have actually multiple partners, it all depends, but it is possible, for example, the three areas I outlined, right -- financing, licensing and potential M&A, right? And for example, licensing can stand alone with either one of those two, right, with a different partner, for example. So there could be -- very well be multiple partners because we have multiple opportunities on the horizon.\nCraig Ellis: Thank you, Primit.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Primit Parikh for our closing remarks.\nPrimit Parikh: So thank you, everyone, for tuning in today. We look forward to continue to grow faster on this exciting opportunity that we have in front of us, growing Transphorm's GaN business rest of this quarter and the second half of fiscal year 2024. Good day to all.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
