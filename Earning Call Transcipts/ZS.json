I am pleased to share our Q2 results, which once again exceeded our guidance for the top line and the bottom line, even amidst an ongoing, challenging macro environment. Revenue grew by 35% year-over-year, and billings grew by 27%. Our customer base spending $1 million or more continues to grow by over 30%. Our operating profit more than doubled year-over-year, and our free cash flow margin reached are record for Q2. During the quarter, we made solid progress on our strategy to scale our go-to-market engine to reach our goal of $5 billion and beyond in ARR. To augment our already strong sales team, we're adding more experienced leaders with a proven track record of running large operations. Considering these leadership changes, I am particularly proud of our field sales execution this quarter. Before getting to the details of our fiscal Q2, let me share a few observations on the business environment. Based on my conversations with hundreds of CIOs and CISOs, I expect demand for Zero-Trust security to remain robust in 2024 and expect customer budgets for Zero-Trust to be up this year, particularly in light of the recent surge in the number of high-profile breaches. Threat actors continue to exploit vulnerabilities of firewalls and VPNs, which allow them to spread ransomware laterally inside an organization. In a recent example, a VPN vulnerability was so severe that CISA, the U.S. Cybersecurity agency, took the extraordinary step of mandating that federal civilian agencies disconnect their Ivanti Pulse Secure VPNs within 48 hours. This is yet another example of why customers are increasingly realizing that their security posture remains vulnerable and are motivated to transform their firewall-based security to our Zero Trust Architecture. Spinning up firewalls and VPNs in the cloud and calling it a sassy solution doesn't solve cybersecurity challenges. While customers want to consolidate point products, they're looking for a fully integrated platform that delivers zero trust architecture. Cyber is so mission critical that customers will invest in the industry-leading solutions rather than rely on cheaper or less effective products that are included as part of their ELAs. They want best-of-breed platforms with the best functionality that integrate with other platforms, thus eliminating dozens of point products. Zscaler's Zero Trust platform is an integrated and purpose-built solution that delivers comprehensive security and provides a compelling user experience while reducing cost. Strong customer interest in our platform drove a record first-half total bookings with nearly half of net new bookings coming from new logo customers. We added a record number of new logos for our Q2. This demonstrates the momentum in our business and we're increasing our outlook for revenue and billings for fiscal 2024. We are operating in a strong demand environment for zero trust architecture. To capture this demand and scale our business to $5 billion ARR and beyond, we appointed Mike Rich as our Chief Revenue Officer last quarter. Mike joined us from ServiceNow where he established a scalable go-to-market engine to drive deeper engagements with large enterprises. Going forward, Mike and his team are focusing on three key areas. First, our existing opportunity-led sales engine has helped us deliver strong growth over the years, enabling us to surpass $2 billion in ARR. To drive our next phase of growth, we are evolving from an opportunity-centric to an account-centric sales motion, leveraging Mike's experience in building such plans. As we grow our sales organization, we are adding more experienced leaders and strategic sellers with the right level of experience working with CXOs and global system integrators. As we begin our planning for fiscal ‘25, we are developing account plans that are aligned with our customers' long-term strategic initiatives and we are partnering with our customers to build transformation roadmaps to modernize their security and IT infrastructure. Second, we launched our top accounts pilot program a couple of quarters ago, which is successfully driving deeper platform engagements and adoption. Building upon our initial success and leveraging Mike's experience, we are scaling this program across more top accounts. Third, we are increasing our focus on vertical selling. We introduced a vertical specific sales motion a few years ago, starting with the public sector and expanded it to the healthcare vertical last year. Based upon the successful growth in these verticals, we plan to continue to expand program into more verticals by adding domain experts who can drive vertical specific strategies to better align with our customers' strategic initiatives. We now have a double-digit number of customers spending more than $10 million with us annually. With our expanded platform and these go-to-market initiatives, I believe we will see more and more of our large enterprise customers reach $10 million ARR levels over time. Now let me highlight three factors that drove our performance in Q2. First, we are seeing continued success in selling our broader platform, including ZPA, Data Protection, CDX, Zero Trust for Workloads, Zero Trust for Branch, and AI -powered solutions. Driven by upsells, our $1 million ARR customer count grew by 31% year-over-year ending the quarter with nearly 500 such customers. Second, we had a strong federal quarter with particular strength in upsells to cabinet level agencies. We have plenty of opportunity to expand further in the federal market. Third, we achieved a Q2 record for new logo additions, deflecting early success with our channel investments. Our $100, 000 or more ARR customer base grew 21% year-over-year, ending the quarter with over 2, 800 such customers. Let me highlight two new logo deals from the quarter. First, a Fortune 100 Health Care customer purchased ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and Advanced Data Protection for 10, 000 users in a 7-figure ACV deal. ZPA will greatly enhance their security and user experience while eliminating legacy security gateways by consolidating the VPN and VDI appliances. Protecting patient healthcare records is of paramount importance to this customer, which made data protection a crucial consideration for this deal. For the next phase, they are planning to expand to over 100, 000 users, representing a significant upsell opportunity for us. In another new logo deal, after suffering repeated ransomware attacks, a technology company purchased 20, 000 seats of ZIA, ZPA, ZDX and Advanced Data Protection. They're phasing out the legacy castle-and-moat firewall-based security, which failed to protect them against ransomware attacks. This customer excluded the incumbent firewall-based SASE vendor from consideration, as they wanted a true Zero Trust architecture. This is a multiyear 8-figure TCV deal, which is expected to generate over 100% ROI for the customer by eliminating the multiple-figure ACV deal. Now, let me highlight two upsell deals that highlight broader adoption of our comprehensive platform. In a 7-figure ACV deal, an existing Fortune 500 Financial services enterprise, currently using ZIA, ZPA and Data Protection, upgraded to our high-end ZPA Transformation bundle and added Endpoint DLP for 73, 000 users. This also marks our largest Endpoint DLP deal since the introduction of this module just two quarters ago in our Data Protection solution. By moving to the high-end of our ZPA and Data Protection packages, this customer increased their annual spend with us by over 60% to over $10 million annually. In another 7-figure ACV deal, a major global mining company increased their ZIA and ZDX purchases to 48, 000 users and purchased ZPA transformation for 30, 000 users. With the ZPA purchase, the customer is eliminating their VPN appliances and providing Zero Trust access for their workforce spread across remote locations worldwide. With this expanded purchase of our platform, the customer’s annual spend with us nearly doubled to approximately $5 million. Next, let me discuss our opportunities in the Federal market. As I mentioned earlier, we saw strong growth in net new ACV from the Federal vertical in Q2. After our initial lands at 12 of the 15 cabinet level agencies, we continue to win additional awards as agencies are increasingly adopting Zero Trust architecture to meet the President’s Executive Order. For example, in a seven-figure upsell deal, an agency customer expanded their seats with ZIA, ZPA and Data Protection purchases, nearly doubling their annual spend with us. With this upsell, the customer is already approaching $5 million in annual spend, even though we are still less than 15% penetrated in terms of the number of users, representing a significant upsell opportunity in this agency. With the highest levels of FedRAMP certifications for both ZIA and ZPA, we are very well positioned to benefit from continued growth with our federal customers. Building upon our success in the US, we are investing in building public sector programs for half a dozen nations that have adopted FedRAMP like certification programs. This is a significant opportunity for us, but like any government initiative this will take time. Moving on, our R&D engine continues to deliver innovations, rapidly expanding our platform and providing larger upsell opportunities. Given our strategic position, we are interacting with more CXOs than ever before and having much deeper engagements. For example, we recently hosted a CXO summit in India, attended by over 200 senior IT leaders, including over 100 CXOs. At the summit, one CXO said and I quote the velocity of features that Zscaler releases every time we meet is extremely impressive. Our comprehensive platform protects not just users, but also workloads, and IoT/OT devices. While still early, we are seeing growing traction in our emerging platform solutions, including Zero Trust for Workloads, Zero Trust for Branch and Zero Trust for B2B, as well as our AI/ML powered solutions. Zero Trust for Workloads continues to gain wider adoption. For example, in an upsell win, a financial technology company purchased Zero Trust for Workloads for 25, 000 workloads, which contributed to nearly doubling their annual spend with us to over $1 million. A large aerospace company more than tripled their Zero Trust for Workloads purchase, contributing to a 60% increase in their annual spend with us to over $1 million. In January, we launched Zero Trust for Branch which enables one-to-one connectivity between branch devices and applications, thus securing branch IoT/OT devices and eliminating the risk of lateral threat movement. Our Zscaler plug-and-play appliance would be the only solution customers will need at the branch, as it eliminates the need for legacy SD-WAN appliances, routers, and firewalls, thus dramatically simplifying branch networking and security. Zero Trust for branch is a key component of our Zero Trust SASE solution, which is the industry’s first single vendor SASE solution built on Zero Trust. Zero Trust SASE pairs Zscaler’s leading SSE with our new Zero Trust SD-WAN. We have seen early adoption of our Zero Trust SASE from customers across a range of industries including: A U.S. based Energy and Retail company. A Europe based Fortune 500 manufacturing company. A U.S. based Financial Services company, and many more. Moving to our AI cloud, within this portfolio, our newest products Risk360 and Business Insights are growing rapidly. Business Insights is helping CIOs and CFOs optimize cost of their SaaS applications, office locations, and more. For example, an existing Global 2000 consumer products customer purchased Business Insights for 97, 000 users to replace their home-grown solution that cost over $500, 000 annually. Recently adopted SEC disclosure requirements and Board level interest in understanding cyber risk are driving demand for Risk360. For example, A Global 2000 manufacturing customer purchased Risk360 for nearly 16, 000 users to automate the process of risk quantification and take proactive measures to reduce cyber risk. We have already delivered several AI innovations, including ML-based data classification, ML-based policy recommendations, Risk360, Business Insights, and more. In addition, one of the AI products I’m particularly excited about is Breach Predictor. Breach Predictor is our vision to leverage the power of our platform to predict breaches before customers get breached. We are working relentlessly to bring this and more industry leading AI innovations to our customers this year. With our innovation engine humming and delivering cutting-edge products, and our go-to-market organization focused on scaling and growth, I’m more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead of us, and our ability to capitalize on those opportunities. Now, I’d like to turn over the call to Remo Canessa for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa : Thank you, Jay. Our Q2 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals. Revenue was $525 million, up 35% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 54% of revenue, EMEA was 31%, and APJ was 15%. Our total calculated billings in Q2 grew 27% year-over-year to $628 million. On a sequential basis, total billings increased 37% quarter-over-quarter. Our calculated current billings grew 26% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 29% from a year ago to $3.613 billion. The current RPO is approximately 51% of the total RPO. We ended Q2 with 497 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, adding 29 such customers in the quarter. We also saw strength in $100, 000 ARR customers this quarter, which grew to 2, 820, adding 112 customers sequentially. This continued strong growth of large customers speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers’ digital transformation initiatives. Our 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 117%. While good for our business, our increased success in selling bigger bundles, selling multiple pillars from the start, and faster upsells within a year, can reduce our dollar-based net retention rate in the future. There could be variability in this metric on a quarterly basis due to the factors I just mentioned. Turning to the rest of our Q2 financial performance, total gross margin of 80.8% compares to 80.7% in the prior quarter and 80.4% in the year-ago quarter. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin benefited by approximately 60 basis points from a change in accounting attributed to the longer useful life of our cloud infrastructure. As mentioned on our previous earnings call, beginning fiscal 2024, we extended the depreciable useful life of our servers and network equipment in our cloud infrastructure from four to five years. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 3% sequentially and 22% year-over-year to $321 million. We continue to generate significant leverage in our financial model, with operating margin reaching 19.6%, an increase of approximately 700 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 19%, including data center CapEx of approximately 6% of revenue. We ended the quarter with over $2.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Next, let me share some observations about the macro environment and our framework for guidance for the rest of the fiscal year. We believe we are still operating in a challenging macroenvironment and customers continue to scrutinize large deals. Customer interest in our platform remains strong, and we are adding experienced sales leaders to our already strong sales team to position us well for sustainable growth in the long-term. In our outlook for fiscal 2024, we're balancing our business optimism with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and sales leadership changes. Moving on to guidance for Q3 and full year fiscal 2024. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $534 million to $536 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 28%. Gross margins of 80%. I would like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including newer products like ZDX and Zscaler for Workloads, will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We're currently managing the emerging products for time to market and growth, not optimizing them for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $98 million to $100 million. Net other income of $15 million. Income taxes of $10 million. Earnings per share in the range of $0.64 to $0.65, assuming 161 million fully diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2024, we're increasing our guidance as follows. Revenue in the range of $2.118 billion to $2.122 billion, reflecting a year-over-year growth of approximately 31%. Calculated billings in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.57 billion or year-over-year growth of 25% to 26%. From a modeling perspective, Q3 is typically our seasonally weaker quarter. Consistent with our historical seasonal patterns, we expect billings to decline sequentially by approximately 7% in Q3. Operating profit in the range of $395 million to $400 million, which reflects up to 400 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year. Income taxes of approximately $35 million. Earnings per share in the range of $2.73 to $2.77, assuming approximately 161 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be up year-over-year and in the low-20% range. We continue to expect our data center CapEx to be high-single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year, reflecting the 3-percentage points to 4-percentage points of headwind to free cash flow margins. We expect the timing of CapEx spend to be more towards the later part of the second half of the year as we invest in upgrades to our cloud and AI infrastructure. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we plan to continue to invest significantly to drive long-term growth while increasing profitability. Before moving on to Q&A, I would like to note that Bill Choi, our Senior Vice President of Strategic Finance and Investors Relations, will be leaving us in a couple of weeks. This is a bittersweet moment for me, as Bill has been instrumental in building the finance practice here, but happy for him as he is moving to pursue his first CFO opportunity at an AI networking company. We wish him great success in his next endeavor. With that operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alex Henderson with Needham.\nAlex Henderson: Well, first off, I've got to say, Bill, it was great working with you and congratulations on progression in your career. As for you guys on Zscaler, nice quarter. Thanks for a good print. The first question I have for you is really against the backdrop of already expected difficult decision making environment. Has there been any change in deal size, in deal process time, closure rates, win rates over the last quarter that might show some incremental improvement versus where we were in the prior quarter? Are there any green shoots evident in those key metrics?\nJay Chaudhry : Alex, thank you for the question. The short answer is we haven't seen any meaningful change for a number of things you mentioned. Take, for example, macro. It's pretty much a similar environment. Our deals keep on growing. We are doing large deals, so there's no significant crash on deals. We do see demand for cybersecurity products remaining strong. Customers do have budgets for cyber, even though they may be tightening budget for IT overall. And this is because Zero Trust is a top priority. But it boils down to two things when I talk to lots of CIOs. They do want to take care of cyber. But if you can fix cyber, and reduce cost at the same time, it becomes a much better situation. Zscaler happens to be in a position where we do it extremely well. If you look at most point products out there, they don't save money. In fact, security generally is a cost. We replace a number of point products, save money, give far better security, as we are sitting in pretty good shape.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Zelnick with Deutsche Bank.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thanks so much and congrats to you, Bill. It's been a fun ride since the IPO. Jay, just following the last question, I appreciate your comments on the environment. You obviously had one of your key competitors last week talking of customer fatigue and you guys are at least in the federal market. You're telling us a little bit of a different story but can you specifically share thoughts about competitors giving away free product and the impact it can or is already having on Zscaler and maybe the extent to which you're factoring that into your outlook ahead.\nJay Chaudhry : Yes, thank You, Brad. We really do not see any cyber spending fatigue among our customers. In fact many of the CIOs that told me that cyber is a priority for spend. But they do have ELA fatigue because a lot of stuff has been becoming shelf wear and it's being scrutinized. Regarding free stuff, many vendors have been trying to give it away for a while and we have been successfully winning against this strategy for a long time. I mean look at our retention rate. It used to be been 90s at IPO now, now it's high 90s and fundamentally cyber is so mission critical that customers will invest in the industry's leading solution rather than rely on cheaper and less effective products that are included as a part of an ELA bundle. Look, we are really dealing with a secular trend too. Just like the role of data center diminished and public out to a call, similarly, the role of firewalls is diminishing and the demand for Zero Trust security is growing and this is bound to impact sales of firewall vendors and this naturally puts the legacy vendors in a defensive position. And they're trying to cover giveaway products as bundles which end up becoming shelf wear and this strategy starts to unravel over time. We'll stick to our strategy.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks, Jay, maybe just a quick follow-up one for Remo. Remo on the back half billing seasonality that you've set up now for us, could you just maybe speak to any factors we may want to consider and what it is that drives your confidence, and now it looks like a pretty big sequential Q4 as you've set it up for us. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa : Yes, I mean, we made a go-to-market change during the quarter because you're aware, Mike Rich, Mike has hit the ground running and is doing an absolutely outstanding job, balancing the strength that we've got with our sales organization as well as bringing new leadership in. If you take a look at our guide for the year, it is slightly up, we're being prudent. The key thing, I think, for our investors to recognize and what Jay said, this is a large market opportunity. It's a huge market opportunity. And when it's a huge market opportunity, when you look at companies giving away things for free, especially in security, that's one area that basically I wouldn't shortchange. So what we're seeing with the market opportunity, our engagement with our customers, with Mike Rich on board, we feel good about our guidance going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Wells Fargo.\nAndrew Nowinski: Great, thank you, Bill. Certainly going to miss you. Can't wait to see where you land next. And then, overall, just great quarter. Congrats on another strong execution. I wanted to ask you guys about the US federal sector. It sounds like you had some strong upsells in the US Fed may have contributed to some of your upside this quarter. Do you think some of these agencies that you mentioned that are really under-penetrated, they might serve as a role model to other agencies in the U.S. government which could help you continue your growth there and how does your pipeline look in the U.S. Fed over the next few quarters? Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry : As we have been investing in the federal market for quite some time. We got the highest level of certification and we're doing very well. In fact, we are heavily engaged with all federal agencies including DOD, 12 of the 15 agencies on our customers. In my prepared remarks, I talked about the federal deal that we doubled the number of users and we doubled that ARR to approximately about $5 million. And with this, we are less than 15% penetrated in the agency in terms of the number of users which means there's an 85% wide space to go up there. We feel good. We keep on investing in it and I think it's a strong area for us. Remo?\nRemo Canessa : Well positioned. And as Jay mentioned, 12 to 15 basically agencies that we're in, these are big deals in federal. It's hard to predict when these deals are going to close. From our perspective, we're well positioned, very well positioned going forward. We've made significant investments with our certifications and also our team, which we feel is outstanding. So the answer to your question, Andy, is we feel good about federal. But, again, bigger type deals, hard to forecast, but we feel good.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tal Liani with Bank of America.\nTal Liani: Hi, guys. I have a small question and a big question. The small one is about billing. You guide it down 7% sequentially and then guide it up 53% if I take the implied 4Q, which is the highest growth in billing. You had the same problem last year. What's the meaning of it? What's the meaning of billing being weak and then billing being so strong in the fourth quarter? What needs to happen for it to materialize? So that's a small one. The bigger one, Jay, maybe you wanted me to take it one at a time or you wanted me just to ask both?\nJay Chaudhry : No, go ahead.\nTal Liani: Jay, the second one is a bigger question. SASE is used to be a very secure, a very safe market for you because there were only two players and maybe two and a half players. And now we're seeing tons of competition coming in. And competition is coming at very low pricing. And Fortinet is talking about one-third of your price. The newcomers are coming either through bundling, which enables them to reduce price, or as an add-on to a firewall, which again enables them to bundle and reduce price. And if I ask the question in a provocative way, I'll ask it, what prevents this market from turning into what happened to FireEye and what happened to Sandboxing that when competition started, pricing collapsed in the market?\nJay Chaudhry : So, Remo start with you.\nRemo Canessa : So, the things that we've got going on in the third order, first of all, this is our normal range, a much of decline over the last five years from Q2 to Q3. I talked about on a prior question the go-to-market changes that we've made. That certainly plays into things. Related to the back half in the fourth quarter with the implied increase basically in billing, it's related to pipeline close rates and the forecast that our team has come up with. Again, from our perspective, we feel it's prudent guidance. We feel good about it, and we feel that we are in a great position to go forward with the team that we have and will build in our sales organization.\nJay Chaudhry : Okay, regarding your bigger question, that's SASE, the market and the competition. Let me put it this way. They are point products and the platforms. You absorb point products into platforms. And then there are products that are mission critical, the products that are not mission critical. FireEye, Sandbox was a feature from day one, it’s not a much barrier to entry. Everyone could build it and add it into the main platform. CASB was a point product all along, became that way. Cloud Security Boston Management, a point product gets bundled with something. And then there's something called platform. For example, the code of our platform, Zero Trust Architecture proxy based, sitting in line, inspecting traffic, and you add things to it. So it's almost like ERP. You see lots of product going out in many areas. Customers don't remove and put in an ERP for vendor A or vendor B because somebody feels like I need to enter the ERP space. I think SASE market is almost like that. This is so mission critical. All traffic goes through us. In fact, a CIO told me, Jay, Zscaler is more mission critical than Microsoft Office 365 because you must work all the time. So with that in mind, our customers may look at this thing. Price is a secondary factor. Reliability, availability, and effectiveness of doing cyber protection is an important factor. My customers also tell me that they have so many firewalls, so many VPNs, and the threats are growing so the credibility of firewall vendors overall is less. Maybe I can use another analogy. You want to buy a pacemaker; you don't try to cut corner and buy one at sale. You want to buy something else, yes, you may be able to do so. Yes, competition is coming. We see that, but I can tell you some of the new firewall vendors that announced the SASE act entrance, I haven't come across them in the recent months as I've seen out there. I think the platform keeps on growing. We started with outbound traffic, now inbound traffic. The platform must have the most comprehensive data protection. None of these firewall vendors can do a lot of data protection. Data protection starts with the proper SASE architecture. Then we moved on to expand to workloads, to IoT/OT, and on to B2B. And the pace of innovation is kept on going. I'm very comfortable with our platform story. We need to keep on focusing on go-to-market to keep on going faster and faster. I hope that helps.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler.\nRob Owens: Great. Thanks for taking my question this afternoon. Could you touch a little bit more on your vertical selling motion and maybe some of those new markets that you will have special overlays for? And I would love a little more commentary around your success with your IoT/OT solution. Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry : Yes, so let's start with vertical market first. About five or six years ago, we started with a first vertical. That was a public sector. And then within that vertical, we expanded into federal government and state government, education and the like. And those things have been very successful for us. For a year ago, we expanded to health care verticals. And then now we want to expand to a couple of more verticals. When company gets to a certain level, you can actually afford to go vertical because vertical requires a decent amount of footprint. Vertical requires some of the expertise in those areas. For example, we have hired some people who come from very good backgrounds, who have spent time in those vertical markets. So we think it's a good natural area for us to expand. And it's not a new, something totally new for us. We've been there, done it, we need to know, we need to learn how to expand it. For example, financial is a strong market for us. It's almost like a vertical today, though it's not a formal vertical. So we'll see, you'll see us expanding in more verticals. That was the first part. The second part of the question, what was the second part.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Hedberg with RBC.\nMatt Swanson: Yes, thank you. This is actually Matt Swanson from that Hedberg. I wanted to follow up on Andy's earlier question on the federal vertical. Yes, it's been a place that's been a little bit mixed among your peers and with the strong results, is anything change from your perspective from a competitive standpoint? Or you mentioned the Zero Trust mandates. Are there things that are changing the federal government that are leaving this scaler better positioned relative to some of your peers that maybe have seen a little weakness in that vertical?\nJay Chaudhry : We have seen no weakness, no slowdown in the federal market. In fact, adoption of Zero Trust keeps on growing, especially under the president's mandate. So all agencies, whether federal government, civilian side, or defense side, we have strong engagements and we feel very good about it. But as Remo said, some of these deals can be big and lumpy, but we are in good shape. And the certifications we got at the highest level for all products puts us in an especially very good position and our strong sales team in place.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Fatima Boolani with Citi.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hello. This is Mark on for Fatima. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you maybe just speak up a little bit more on the leverage you guys recognize in this quarter, and then really the meaningful to the on margin expansion, even though there's a pretty long roster of initiatives you guys is looking to implement, such as verticalization. So any sorts of leverage performance this quarter, and how does sort of your investment stance or philosophy differ today versus maybe three months ago? Thank you.\nRemo Canessa : Mark, it's actually very hard to hear you. So what I picked up was you were asking about a little more information about our vertical approach. Is that correct?\nUnidentified Analyst : Can you hear me now?\nRemo Canessa : A little better.\nJay Chaudhry : A little better, yes.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Sorry about that. So we were just more so wondering, can you maybe speak a little bit more on the leverage you guys recognize this quarter, and then maybe the meaningful to on the margin expansion. We know that there's a lot of initiatives you guys are looking to implement, such as verticalization. So we just wanted to get a sense of the source of leverage performance this quarter, and how does your investment philosophy basically differ today versus three months ago, and going forward. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa : So I'll take that you. I believe, Mark, you're talking about operating leverage. So we exceeded in revenue. Our gross margins were higher, and our operating expenses came lower. Having said that, we did hire significantly during the quarter, and we'll continue to hire as we go forward. The key thing I think to really think about Zscaler is that we are early in this market. We have a model which we've talked about in the past that we can leverage related to operating profitability and free cash flow. We've shown 700 basis points increase and operating profitability on a year-over-year basis. In one way that's great. And another way is we need to continue to invest. So our focus is still growth. We'll be mindful and manage your operating profitability and free cash flow. But this is a huge market opportunity. And quite frankly with Mike Rich on board and our focus that we're going to have towards large accounts and penetrating large accounts. What we talked about is that we have a 6x opportunity in our existing install-based upsell new products. And also when you take a look at the penetration of the market it's in the teens probably that Zscaler has. So large market opportunity, the ability to leverage upwards profitability and free cash flow. When you take a look at our contribution margin in years two and three, it's over 60%. A lot of levers we can pull. And so we feel good about where we are. We're going to continue to invest and we will manage our operating profitability. But again, I'm not concerned about hitting our operating profitability targets or free cash flow. Our model is well-built, especially with 80% gross margins to do that. Jay, anything to contribute?\nJay Chaudhry : No, right and clear.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Roger Boyd with UBS.\nRoger Boyd: Thanks for taking the questions. And Bill, first off, congrats. I think pretty much summarized the best when you call it a bittersweet moment. But, Jay, I was wondering if you could expand on how you're approaching SD-WAN and single-vendor SASE market, really how that approach differs from traditional vendors there and how you see this changing your competitive standpoint in the market for security edge in general. Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry : Yes. So we have always wanted to make sure we deliver Zero Trust solutions. SD-WAN was a good technology because it was cheaper. But D-WAN nothing for security. SD-WAN enabled the same lateral movement that the previous networks did. So, but our customers do want to simply file branches. So, they've been talking to us. We launched our Zero Trust for Branch solution a few months ago, and then actually there's a January, the second release of that. So with that, we actually are making available a plug-in play appliance that you simply ship, you drop in the branch, you plug in the internet, and it's auto-discovered, and in 15 minutes it's up and running. No route papers to manage, no Zero Trust architecture makes it wonderful. So our customers are very excited about it. So really, so that is our Zero Trust SD-WAN, it's not traditional SD-WAN. So combined with our SSE and Zero Trust, so we are actually offering the full SASE solution for the first time in the market, Zero Trust SASE solution. I can tell you the number of customers who are eager and ready to roll it out is very large. We're already working with a number of customers, but over the coming quarters, I'm very bullish with the success of this new offering. And it has the full potential to disrupt traditional SD-WANs and traditional SASEs as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Essex with JPMorgan.\nBrian Essex: Great. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. First of all, Bill, congratulations from me as well. It's great to see your success. Maybe Jay for you. So we've seen a little bit of executive turnover here as we watch the story from the sidelines, and would love to get your sense of, and obviously some of these make a lot of sense, right? People come as a team, who believe as a team, there are relationships there, and you did a great job previously calling it out as being a factor of conservatism in your outlook. So maybe two quarter for me. One has turnover been what you expected it to be, particularly given what you've kind of like folded into your guidance and then two, maybe frame out what kind of or how deep and meaningful some organizational changes that Mike Rich might be driving within the organization. Thank you.\nJay Chaudhry : Okay, good. So starting with our sales attrition is down in the quarter. And second, when leaders leave, it's natural for some people to follow. But as Zscaler has become a very big brand. We have become a top destination for top talent. And we are no short in attracting some of the best and the brightest sales leader and account manager in the market. Mike has built and he continues to build a strong team that includes many, many good leaders. Now, when it comes to organization changes, as we mentioned last time, we are evolving our sales model. There's no wholesale any meaning significant change. We years ago, we had to move to top down conference selling at the sea level because that's what drives transformation. Remember I said, when I used to go and sell two box huggers, they would kind of say, please go away. So our process has been top down. It has been strategic. It's aligned with the background, white, broad form. So we have been doing a lot of that stuff, our business value assessment and topic count stuff and stuff. So these are evolutionary changes. And they're not really, they're no large basket change across. So we're pretty comfortable in evolving from where we are to get to where we need to go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Levine with Evercore ISI.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thank you for taking my question and Bill congrats on the opportunity. Two parts. One, can you maybe help us understand where NRR maybe troughs out, where you see that trending throughout ‘24, perhaps into fiscal ‘25? And then Jay, you had comments and maybe piggyback of last question on opportunity centric to more of an account centric sales motion. Maybe explain to us what that means and who kind of somewhat appreciated that change.\nRemo Canessa : Yes. I'll answer the NRR question and Jay can answer the opportunity question. So we don't guide the NRR and quite frankly we only look at NRR at the end of each quarter. So we're not providing any guidance in NRR. It can be impacted as we called out on the script related to large deals or more being bought up front, customers buying within the quarter. So, it is a metric that's it's going to move around. But again, we do not provide any guidance on NRR.\nJay Chaudhry : Okay. The second part, opportunity-centric versus account-centric. In an opportunity-centric model, the rep normally engages on a tactical basis, the customers are all being, where is my opportunity, where's the deal, let me brought the deal. In the account-centric sale, we create account plans, we focus on growing the account. Now, when you are a young company, you don't have that many customers. You naturally are opportunity-centric and it serves you well. At our stage, there will be a large number of customers. It is important for us to move towards being account-centric. We have a large platform to sell. So, once we land, working with account, creating a joint plan to expand becomes far more effective. And as we scale to $5 billion ARR and beyond, so it's evolving to really become long-term strategic partner with the customer. We have been doing it at a small scale in some pockets of the business. Now, we want to take it across at a larger scale.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Moskowitz with Mizuho.\nGregg Moskowitz: Hey, thank you very much. Bill, congrats to you. It's been a pleasure. I have a question for either Jay or Remo. Some investors are harping just a bit on short-term billing, slowing down a little this quarter. But conversely, based on my numbers, both RPO bookings and CRPO bookings actually accelerated this quarter, which is impressive. So just to level set for all of us, because we know that these metrics can sometimes be a little noisy, is there any incremental slowdown that you have observed in any facet in the Q2 or any change in the level of execution? Thank you.\nRemo Canessa : First of all RPO, CRPO is based on contracted value. And again, those did very well. Billings is actually what's being built. So there's always going to be differences between CRPO and RPO versus short-term billings and in billings. As the company gets bigger, it's just the numbers are growing, but the numbers are, you're not going to get the type of growth rates when four or five years ago. But again, from my perspective, the short-term billings growth rate of 26%, that's very good. That's outstanding.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, many thanks. Good evening. Remo, I wanted to start with you, if I could. I wanted to turn the federal comments around a little bit. Your federal business has been very strong for a number of different quarters. And in the past, you've actually provided some context of growth on the federal standalone. And I just wanted to see if you could revisit that. And the lens that I'm putting on the question is, there's been some investor concern that your federal business has been outstanding. And yet, that would suggest a that there's been a more, a greater slowdown, if you will, on the corporate business. So I just wanted to see if you could provide any context for that. And then Jay, perhaps for you, you actually in your prepared remarks talked about, I think you said one half of your net new bookings were from new logos, if I heard you correctly, which is a very strong metric. And I just wondered if you could characterize how, you see that unfolding new logos in particular, as you look out over the next number of quarters. Thank you very much and congrats to Bill.\nRemo Canessa : Keith, I'll start. The federal business has been good for us, because as I mentioned, we're well positioned. We'll provide color on the contribution of federal on an annual basis. I haven't said that. I'll go out and put my neck out, which maybe I should.\nKeith Bachman: Bill's leaving so it's safe.\nRemo Canessa : With Bill's leaving, that's right. He's picking me at the table. We're well positioned in federal. It really comes down to our executions. Let the numbers play the way they play. We'll see how it plays through. But we feel good about our federal business. It's been strong. I would not say it's been carrying us. That's the key comment. But it is basically a vertical that I see that we have a lot of potential. We just need to execute.\nJay Chaudhry : Yes, and non-federal is pretty good, too.\nJay Chaudhry : So, I mean, we are bullish, but both sides of the business. Moving on to the second part, yes, business, strong business coming from net new logos. It's good in terms of future. And as customer base is getting bigger and bigger. And we have lots of platforms to sell. From a directional point of view, I think we have been planning the upsell being in the, whatever, 60%, 65% range somewhere else there Remo, and new logo, the rest. So I think that's really how we see us moving forward. Now, part of the thing that I'm excited about is we are seeing more and more of million-dollar customers being on board. The number is about almost 500 customers that are a million dollars. Then they are trying to get to $5 million and $10 million. So we are targeting towards getting more and more customers a $1 million to $5 million to $10 million. That's probably the bigger target than trying to get lots of new logos by count of logos.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Tilton with Wolfe research.\nJoshua Tilton: Hey, guys, can you hear me? Congrats, Bill, and I apologize for the amazing cafe music in the background. But the one question I have that's been on my mind is just none of what you guys are talking about tonight kind of happens overnight. So I guess, were these sales changes factored into the initial guidance that you gave back in Q4? Or are you actually embedding incremental services and related to these changes in the outlook going forward?\nRemo Canessa : I'll speak to basically both Q2 and Q3. In Q2, we said we were expecting close rates to be slightly worse. Things came in pretty much as we thought they would. For Q3, our assumption also there's a level of conservatism slight. Again, for Q3, they're related to close rates.\nOperator: And we'll have our last question from the line of Peter Weed with A.B. Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. And I guess following up, maybe a couple of questions that we've had here, I mean, I will agree impressive to see the continued acceleration and new customer contribution. I think that had been a worry maybe a year ago whether or not that was going to continue. And obviously you've talked a little bit about expansion coming down with landing orders or deals up front leaving a little bit less upsell, cross-sell opportunity. Maybe help break down a couple of things. One is with a lot more new customers landing in the short term, would this be a good signal for kind of a year from now and in the short term getting some lift just because newer customers expand more. And secondly, how would you think about the opportunity around expansion? Like what are the things that you think you can do to grow the upsell opportunity even though customers are landing larger today? What are you going to be doing to kind of create some lift there with expansion in the future?\nJay Chaudhry : Yes, so if you think about what we've done over the past several years since our IPO, we essentially used to start with, in fact, the ZIA, mostly business. They would ask, what about transformation? Then what about next? When ZPA came in great expansion, CDX came in, a number of new products have been coming in. So we are actually able to expand quite a bit. In fact, even today, as we said in our current customer base, we could literally take our ARR by 6x if we sold all these growth user products to our customers. So even I would even say we have no lack of product to sell. And customers are embracing broader and broader platform. If you look at all that deals, they use that talk about, reading the script and say, huh, CIS, EPS, EDX and data protection. And so it is becoming pretty significant. So we have a big, big upsell opportunities, things like data protection. They don't want to go with someone else to do data protection if the traffic is going through our platforms. So that's one piece. And the second piece is everyone is talking about only users when they talk about Zero Trust safety or they talk about whatever safety. That's only one piece. Then you talk about how about workloads? That's a bigger opportunity. IoT/OT is a sigma opportunity. B2B, where your customer, suppliers and partners need to access information through our Zero Trust platform. So I think there's a big opportunity on the product side, on the sales side, we keep on learning and refining some of the stuff. We do have some of the overlay specialists. We don't do overlay sales per se, but there are specialists in certain areas because you need to be able to go deeper. So we are definitely taking advantage of that. We are pleased with the results, but we'll keep on tweaking and refining to get better and better results.\nPeter Weed: And the new customer success that you've been having, do you anticipate that provides some additional lift kind of looking at a year or so, just as a mix of new customers has increased?\nJay Chaudhry : We don't wait for a year or two years for the contract. We are in the process of we sell, we go, we talk. Literally, it's an ongoing engagement with the customers. So you're not going to see lumpy things from our us. Like people said, hey after COVID what's going to happen after three years? When three years came in most of our customers had done an upsell or two with us.\nOperator: That concludes the question and answer session. This time I would like to turn it back to Jay Chaudhry for closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry : Well, thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at one of the investor conferences. Thanks.\nRemo Canessa : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. Bill Choi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Finance. Please go ahead.\nBill Choi: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to the Zscaler first quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call.

For a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties, please see our filings with the SEC as well as in today's earnings release. I also want to inform you that we'll be attending the UBS Global Technology Conference tomorrow. Now I'll turn the call over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you, Bill. I'm pleased to share our first quarter results, which exceeded our guidance across all metrics. We delivered 40% revenue growth and 34% billings growth. Our operating profit and free cash flow more than doubled year-over-year, and free cash flow margin reached a record 45%. We exceeded the rule of 60 for the 13th consecutive quarter, at a significant scale of $2 billion plus in ARR, we are delivering a unique combination of high growth and high profitability that only a few SaaS companies have accomplished. In Q1, we executed well in a challenging macro environment and what is typically a slower quarter for us. The elevated scrutiny of large deals remains mostly unchanged. The increased frequency of high-profile breaches, coupled with impending SEC disclosure requirements has propelled Zero Trust security more into focus at the management and the Board level. Against this backdrop, we achieved a Q1 record for number of new logo customers with over $1 million in ARR. We also achieved a record for new pipeline generation in a quarter. More customers are adopting our broader platform to consolidate multiple point products, increasing our average deal size. As a result, we are actively working on more large, multiyear, multi-pillar opportunities than ever before. To meet this demand and to further scale our business, we're adding two key go-to-market leaders, one in sales and one in marketing. I will provide details about these new executives after reviewing our Q1 performance. Let me highlight three factors that drove our strong Q1 performance. First, large new logo wins were strong this quarter with a Q1 record of 14 new logos contributing over $1 million ARR. We ended with 468 such customers, up 34% year-over-year. These wins spanned across many verticals, proving that every vertical needs Zscaler. Second, Customers are buying the broader Zscaler platform with multiple product pillars. I have said before, over time, I believe every one of our customers will buy ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, for every user to deliver secure, fast and reliable access to any application anywhere. This quarter, nearly half of our new logo customers purchased all three user pillars, ZIA, ZPA and ZDX. In addition, strong platform upsells drove our 120% dollar-based net retention rate. Third, this was a record U.S. federal quarter with new business up over 90% year-over-year, including four deals that are greater than $1 million in ACV. We are starting to see larger awards as multiple U.S. federal agencies are standardizing on Zscaler to meet the President's executive order to adopt Zero Trust security. We are extremely proud of having landed 12 of the 15 cabinet-level agencies as our customers, where we have plenty of opportunity to expand. For example, at a cabinet level agency, we expanded the ZIA and ZPA deployment from 25,000 users to 100,000 users, while cross-selling ZDX for all 100,000 users. We also won a top defense integrator who purchased ZIA, ZPA and ZDX for its employees. In parallel, they launched a go-to-market service to take Zscaler to their federal customers. As our SI partners are selling and deploying Zscaler for their customers they are also adopting Zscaler to make their own business secure, agile and competitive. From my conversations with hundreds of IT executives, it's clear that cybersecurity is the number 1 IT spending priority. Adopting Zero Trust architecture and protecting their enterprise from Gen AI risks are top priorities for CISOs in 2024. We have enhanced our data protection policies or AIML applications and tools to protect our customers' risk of data loss due to increasing use of Gen AI, our AI-powered threat protection uses a diffusion model to detect complex exploits and to catch sophisticated phishing attacks that evade traditional security controls. These AI-driven features are included in our Advanced Plus bundles, which are often priced 20% higher than advanced bundles. We now secured on average over 2 billion AI transactions every month for our customers.  Next, let me discuss some of our Q1 deals, which demonstrate our differentiation and business value. We are starting to see some wins where customers are coming to us after initially purchasing a firewall-based single vendor SASE solution that failed to deliver in the real world. For those who are not familiar, firewall-based single vendor SASE is the combination of SD-WAN and firewall and VPN deployed as VMs in the cloud. A leading software company made an architectural shift to our Zero Trust exchange platform after trying to deploy a leading firewall vendor SASE solutions across 50 office locations and multiple public cloud sites. It became clear to the customer that this solution expanded their attack surface to all locations and increase the risk of lateral threat movement. They decided to move to our Zero Trust security with the purchase of Zscaler for users, our complete bundle for ZIA, ZPA and ZDX, for all 25,000 employees. Our Zero Trust Exchange connects users directly to apps, eliminating attack surface and lateral threat movement. The Unmanaged devices, the customer is deploying our browser isolation with ZPA to enable third parties to access their applications. Deals like this reinforce our conviction that firewall-based SaaS solutions are not the future of security that some analysts advocate. Customers are choosing Zscaler's purpose-built Zero Trust platform. Let me highlight one new logo win where our superior security helped the customer after a breach. Despite extensive investments in firewalls and VPNs, a hospitality and gaming company experienced a crippling Ransomware breach. To restore their operations, they purchased the entire Zscaler for users bundle for 25,000 users. With Zscaler, the apps are now hidden from threat actors behind our Zero Trust Exchange and can't be discovered, exploited or DDoS. This customer also purchased our new Risk 360 solution to understand the organization-wide risk and to get actionable information to reduce it. We have shared with you that data protection is one of the fastest-growing solutions for us. For our customers, after implementing cyber protection, adopting data protection is the natural second phase of their Zero Trust journey. For example, a Fortune 500 travel and hospitality services provider more than doubled their annual spend with us with data protection being a critical component of the upsell. The first purchase was ZIA for 22,000 users to inspect all traffic, including TLS encrypted traffic for cyber protection. As the next step, they are implementing real-time in-line DLP for sensitive data. Our solution also enables this customer to enforce policies for secure use of AI applications. These deals highlight the breadth and depth of our Zero Trust security platform. We also help our customers achieve high ROI by eliminating tech debt and consolidating multiple point products. For example, a Fortune 200 financial services group turned to Zscaler to consolidate data centers and safely adopt cloud with the necessary security controls for regulatory compliance. They purchased Zscaler for users bundled for 10,000 employees and workload communication for 1,500 workloads. By leveraging our cloud platform, they will eliminate half of the data centers, reduce their MPLS spend and consolidate security and networking client products. We are eliminating several point products, including secure web gateways, firewalls, IPS appliances, VPNs, CASB and DLP from seven security vendors. This deal is expected to generate a remarkable 5x ROI for the customer. I'm also excited to share that ZDX one of our emerging pillars continues to gain significant customer adoption. It is an important part of every deal conversation due to its unique ability to eliminate IT blind spots. ZDX significantly reduces helpless hours spent on ticket resolutions and manual correlation or metrics. Let me highlight a new logo deal where ZDX played a pivotal role. A top-ranked U.S. hospital network purchased ZIA and ZDX advance plus for 87,000 users and ZPA for 40,000 users. What initially began as a ZIA and ZPA project quickly evolved into a significant ZDX opportunity. The ZDX component alone is seven figures in ACV. Unlike the existing performance tools, ZDX provides comprehensive visibility and root cause analysis for users, devices and applications. This deal is a great example of the leverage we gained from working with system integrators like Accenture, who was awarded this overall transformation project. We're also seeing strong customer interest in workload protection on other emerging product pillar. Our Zero Trust Exchange is designed for any to any secured communication. It may be users to apps workload to workload or IoT OT devices. Thousands of enterprises already leverage Zscaler platform for secure user-to-app communication. It is natural for them to extend our Zero Trust platform to secure their workload communication. To radically simplify multi-cloud connectivity and automated deployment of workload protection at scale, we recently released significant enhancements to our workload communications offering, including granular workload segmentation using AWS user-defined tags, the first Zero Trust security solution for workloads in the market, the only alternative is legacy virtual firewalls and real-time auto discovery of cloud resources. More than one-third of our customers have made initial purchases for workload protection. Workload communication often starts with small land deals. And we expect to rapidly expand to secure the growing number of workloads. Zscaler pioneered Zero Trust and SASE, both delivered by our cloud-native platform. we have established ourselves as a premier provider for user protection and are now making progress expanding into workload protection and IoT OT protection. We continue to push the boundaries of what our platform can achieve, extending it for B2B and 5G use cases. As we are like a switchboard for all communications, we collect full transaction logs and trillions of signals daily. We are utilizing those signals and logs to deliver AI-powered insights and automation for our customers. Let me discuss a few of the high-value products in our AI cloud family. We recently launched Risk360, which is the industry's first holistic AI-powered risk quantification and mitigation solution. It delivers up-to-date risk posture and recommends corrective actions to mitigate risk in a timely fashion. We have already closed 10 plus Risk360 deals and are in active evaluations with over 100 enterprises. For these deals, we are getting 6-figure ACV on average, and we expect to grow this value over time. Risk360 provides critical insights to CISOs when reporting on cybersecurity risk strategy and governance, particularly in light of new SEC regulations. Another exciting new product, breach predictor currently under development uses predictive and generative AI models to anticipate potential bread scenarios and eliminate those risks before they materialize. Early feedback from customers who have previewed breach predictor indicates the enormous potential value this solution can deliver. We are working with our technology partners to bring this world-class innovation to thousands of customers to proactively protect against potential breaches. While we have achieved tremendous success for user protection solutions, our platform's potential in other categories is just beginning. Our relentless innovations have paved the way for an ever-growing stream of opportunities. As our platform continues to scale and expand, our go-to-market efforts are continuing to evolve and scale as well. to enable the next stage of go-to-market scaling. I'm excited to share the appointments of two exceptional leaders, Mike Rich, CRO and President of Global Sales; and Joyce Kim as CMO. They bring a wealth of experience in driving revenue and pipeline growth. Mike joins from ServiceNow, Will as the President for Americas, we establish an efficient and scalable process to drive deeper engagements to large enterprises and to scale their business to over $8 billion in revenue and experience that's critical to the next phase of our growth journey. Joyce's previous experience includes CMO roles at Twilio, Genesis and ARM with expertise in building high-performance marketing teams and driving impactful marketing strategies and campaigns. With Mike assuming leadership of our sales organization, Dali in his capacity as the COO can focus on scaling our business operations. Dali has been instrumental in establishing the go-to-market process. which has helped Zscaler achieve a milestone of $2 billion in ARR. With our expanded portfolio of products and experienced CRO and CMO on board we will further scale our value-add sales process for larger platform deals, which will sustain our high growth. I'm thrilled to have strong go-to-market leaders who we believe will drive world-class execution to scale our business beyond $5 billion in ARR. Now I'd like to turn over the call to Remo for our financial results.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you, Jay. Our Q1 results exceeded our guidance on growth and profitability, even with ongoing customer scrutiny of large deals. Revenue was $497 million, up 40% year-over-year and up 9% sequentially. From a geographic perspective, Americas represented 53% of revenue, EMEA was 32% and APJ was 15%. As Jay highlighted, from a new business perspective, Federal had its best new ACV quarter ever, growing over 90% year-over-year. Our new ACV outside of the Fed also grew year-over-year. . Our total calculated billings in Q1 grew 34% year-over-year to $457 million. On a sequential basis, total billings declined 37% quarter-over-quarter with a difficult comparison to Q4, which had a $20 million upfront billing on a multiyear deal. As a reminder, our contract terms are typically one to three years, and we primarily invoice our customers one year in advance. Our calculated current billings grew 33% year-over-year, a seasonal decline of 32% quarter-over-quarter. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, grew 30% from a year ago to $3.49 billion, The current RPO is approximately 51% of the total RPO. We ended Q1 with 468 customers with greater than $1 million in ARR, adding 19 such customers in the quarter. 14 of the 19 $1 million ARR customer adds were new logos, which was a record for Q1. The continued strength of this large customer metric speaks to the strategic role we play in our customers' digital transformation initiatives. We also entered the quarter with 2708 customers with greater than $100,000 in ARR. Our 12-month trailing dollar-based net retention rate was 120%. Turning to the rest of our Q1 financial performance. Total gross margin of 80.7% and compares to 80.7% in the prior quarter and 81.4% in the year ago quarter. Higher public cloud usage for emerging products drove the year-over-year change in the gross margin partially offset by approximately 60 basis points of benefit from a change in accounting attributed to the longer useful life of our cloud infrastructure. As mentioned last quarter, as a result of advances in technology and efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment. Starting this quarter, we extended the depreciable useful life of these assets in our cloud infrastructure from four to five years. Moving on, our total operating expenses increased 11% sequentially and 26% year-over-year to $311 million. We continue to generate significant leverage in our financial model with operating margin reaching 18%, an increase of approximately 620 basis points year-over-year. Our free cash flow margin was 45%, including data center CapEx of approximately 6% of revenue, Free cash flow benefited from strong collections for Q4 billings, including the $20 million upfront billings I mentioned. We ended the quarter with over $2.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Next, let me share some observations about the macro environment and our framework for guidance for the rest of the fiscal year. While the global macro environment remains challenging, and customers continue to scrutinize large deals from our perspective, customer sentiment seems to be stabilizing. Our customer engagements remain strong, and we have a large and growing pipeline. However, we want to be prudent in our assumptions given the sales leadership change. In our outlook for fiscal '24, we're balancing our business optimism and continued sales execution with ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. With that in mind, let me provide our guidance for Q2 and full year fiscal 2024. As a reminder, these numbers are all non-GAAP. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $505 million to $507 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 30% to 31%, gross margins of 80%, including the change in accounting for useful life of server equipment. I would also like to remind investors that a number of our emerging products, including newer products like ZDX and Zscaler for workloads will initially have lower gross margins than our core products. We are currently managing the emerging products for time to market and grow, not optimizing them for gross margins. Operating profit in the range of $84 million to $86 million. Net other income of $15 million, income taxes of $8 million, earnings per share in the range of $0.57 to $0.58, assuming $160 million fully diluted shares. For the full year fiscal 2024, we're updating our guidance as follows: increased revenue in the range of $2.09 billion to $2.1 billion or year-over-year growth of 29% to 30%; calculated billings in the range of $2.52 billion to $2.56 billion or year-over-year growth of 24% to 26%, we still expect our first half mix to be approximately 42% of our full year billings guide; increased operating profit in the range of $360 million to $365 million, which reflects up to 250 basis points of operating margin improvement compared to last year; income taxes of $35 million; increased earnings per share in the range of $2.45 to $2.48 assuming approximately 161 million fully diluted shares. We expect our free cash flow margin to be up year-over-year and in the low 20% range. We continue to expect our data center CapEx to be high single-digit percentage of revenue for the full year, reflecting a three to four percentage points of headwind to free cash flow margins. We expect the timing of CapEx spend to be more towards the second half of the year as we invest in upgrades to our cloud and AI infrastructure. Our guidance reflects our plans to invest aggressively in our business to pursue our significant market opportunity. With our new CRO and CMO coming on board, we expect to step up our sales and marketing investments in the coming quarters. In addition, we'll increase investments in our technology platform and cloud infrastructure. With a large market opportunity and customers increasingly adopting the broader platform, we plan to invest aggressively to position us for long-term growth while increasing profitability. Operator, you may now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brad Zelnick of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thanks so much. And congrats on a strong start to the year and nice to see the leverage in these results. Jay, your distinction of SASE has always been clear and it's perhaps no more obvious than right now at a time when traditional network security providers are having a tough time selling more and more boxes. And it seems they're paying you a nice complement as they all double down their focus on the cloud and SASE. So as this all plays out competitively and you're increasingly subject to the law of large numbers, how should we think about your ability to sustain high growth and specifically the rate at which you can scale your emerging product portfolio? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Brad, very good question. It is flattering to see all kind of vendors becoming SASE vendors overnight. But the challenge for them would be, it's a different architecture. It's not an incremental change and feature you can add on to it. That's where we spent a dozen plus years building a true Zero Trust architecture, which is an advantage. That's why we became the market leader. We pioneered this market. We evangelized to the fact that this is what's needed for better cybersecurity and ransomware protection and cost reduction. The way I look at - to sustain high growth is the following. One, is there a market demand came out? The market is growing and expanding at much faster pace than I even thought. Two, do you have the right platform with the right architecture, the right functionality? You've seen us build this platform on a true Zero Trust architecture and expanded over the years. I think of what we had at the time of IPO versus what we have today. And the third area is go-to-market execution. We've done a great job starting with IPO, crossing $2 billion in ARR. And now we've got our sights set on crossing $5 billion. And we have been growing and adapting go-to-market also along with the platform. That's why I'm very excited about bringing two key leaders: Mike as CRO; and Joyce as CMO, who can help us take us to the next level. Great market execution, great platform. I think with that, I'm very excited about the opportunity in front of us.\nBrad Zelnick: Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Saket Kalia of Barclays. Your line is open.\nSaket Kalia: Okay. Great. Hi guys, thanks for taking my question here. Jay, maybe for you, just building off of that last question on some of the slowness that we've seen with the traditional network security guys and the challenges with appliances. The question for you is maybe do you feel like customers are more willing now to replace their appliance firewalls at least at the branch with SASE architecture like what Zscaler provides so well?\nJay Chaudhry: You know what I said many times, firewalls won't go away, but they will become like mainframes. We have been replacing firewalls at the branches from the last several years. Now that trend is accelerated. And from one of the new things that’s done to help accelerate the demise of firewalls and branches is our branch connector technology, which now we package to make it available. So you can become a Starbucks-like office in a matter of minutes rather than trying to wait for a long, long time. So we've seen a campus environment becoming just like that. The only place where firewalls have been playing a significant role for a while is the data center, the east-west traffic and the like. You know that traffic is going away from the data center and that demand has to go away. So a big thing for someone to do it right, had to really offer a Starbucks like branch and zero-trust architecture. Market has made progress with traditional SD-WAN. We think traditional SD-WAN is a transitory technology. And once we have [broached] (ph) the market with Branch Connector actually is the next big phase to make it simple. Very excited with the opportunity to make the world free of firewalls.\nSaket Kalia: Makes sense. Thanks guys.\nJay Chaudhry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Henderson of Needham & Company. Your line is open.\nAlex Henderson: I'm torn on what to ask, but I think I'll go with the question around the channels. So you guys have been doing a lot of work on expanding your VAR channels, expanding reach into federal, expanding reach into MSPs, expanding into the cloud arena as much as possible. Can you give us some sense of how you think the mix of your sales leads will be driven by those different channel opportunities as we move through the current fiscal year, please?\nJay Chaudhry: Sure. Alex, you rightfully said, we don't have a simple straight VAR channel that traditionally firewall and network security vendors had. We have VARs who play a role. We have system integrators and we have service providers. And then there's a separate set of SIs for federal business as well. Let's look at each of these areas. VARs were slow to adopt Zscaler but now as the market has moved more and more of them are embracing us and our leader, [Indiscernible] has launched a number of programs where we're seeing very good progress, with new source pipeline coming from our channel. The area we see probably a very rapidly growing opportunity is global systems incubators. Actually, my coming from ServiceNow, where a lot of partnership with global SIs have played a big role I expect that area to accelerate. And in this next level of fulfillment versus transformation. We like partners who work with us and work with partners - sorry, our customers to do transformation. And we have been selective. You aren't going to find us with 5,000 or 10,000 channel partners. Our partners are hundreds. And we are doing targeted programs. We're working with some of the very large global SIs and very large deals to do transformation. I mentioned one of these deals in my prepared remarks, and I mentioned another SI who actually brought Zscaler internal along with actually launching the service to go out there. Remo, do you want to add any more color?\nRemo Canessa: No, I think that's good, Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Okay. Thank you, Alex.\nAlex Henderson: No comment on internal sales? Which is obviously a piece of it?\nRemo Canessa: So yes. So we've increased our capacity in the quarter for our sales reps. Our plan is to increase capacity through the year. The one comment I'd make on Q1 is that we were - we did hit our expectations internally, but we expect to hit basically our sales targets for the year. The current sales capacity that we have supports our guidance. And as Jay mentioned, with the new leadership with Mike on board, we'll be looking to accelerate our hiring as we go through fiscal '24.\nAlex Henderson: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Joel Fishbein of Truist. Your line is open.\nJoel Fishbein: Thanks. And thanks for taking my questions. Great execution here. Jay, one for you, and then I'll jump back in queue. On these new advance plus bundles, obviously very exciting. Just can you share with - you said AIs included - some of the new AI included in that. Can you talk about adoption rates and whether or not you're getting any pushback on pricing as it relates to some of those bundles?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So we have had advanced bundles that include a bunch of functionality of ZIA or ZPA type of stuff. Now we have added functionality where some of the data protection can be done with AI advanced techniques, some of the cyber threat protection can be done using that. So we clear these bundles, we call them advanced plus. So we're getting very good traction. And these advanced plus bundles are about 20% or so higher than the non-plus bundles. So this is a good area. In fact, this is a good way for us to reach our customers as they're looking at buying these bundles with additional functionality, it's helping them, it's helping us. Now in addition, we are also creating some standalone SKUs. We talked about Risk360, a very popular recently introduced product. When I talked about having closed 10-plus deals in a pretty significant manner where the average ACV is sitting in six figures. And then you'll see some more SKUs coming down the road as you'll really be - as AI cloud is one of the big focus areas. And the reason we're making focus is because we have better logs, better data to train AIML models. The starting point of good AIML is the data that we have better than anybody else.\nJoel Fishbein: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens of Piper Stanley. Your line is open.\nRob Owens: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe building a little bit on Joel's question. You mentioned in your prepared remarks with an example around data protection as kind of one of the faster-growing solutions and how it doubled spend at an existing customer. Just curious the potential for that and what you're seeing relative to typical uplift when you're able to attach that solution? Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: You know when Zscaler customer started working with us several years ago, the number 1 focus for them was cyber protection, so they don't get compromised. Data protection was slower in adoption, data protection also takes a little bit work, there's more contributions and customization needed. And in large enterprises where our large customers have been, they've used Symantec 1, 2, as one of the primary data protection products. Over the past five, six years ago, we have expanded our data protection platform significantly, not just in line, but can be actually endpoint DLP cloud data protection, all those things, including EDM IDM technology are there. So with all that technology, we are in a great position to replace some of those complicated data protection products out there. And it's natural. If we are sitting in traffic path, if we are doing access and inspection, it's natural for the customers to use our cloud because the traffic is coming to a cloud from all kinds of positions. That's really driving our growth. That's why we talked about this data protection DRR is approaching $0.25 billion and it grew 60% year-over-year for us, and we see a lot of growth for quite a long time in this area. Did I answer your question?\nRob Owens: Yes. Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: The one comment I'll make is, we have more complete platform for data protection. And customers want one set of policies, whether they want to secure data at rest or data at motion. That's why it's picking up quite fast.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Gallo of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJoseph Gallo: Hi, guys. Appreciate the question. Remo, I appreciate the rationale on the full year billings guide. But just on methodology, is there any changes there? I mean you saw a strong 1Q driven by Fed stream why not pass along some of that beat. Is that solely due to the market? Or the go-to-market change conservatism? Or is there anything else you're seeing there with large customer calendar '24 budgets? And then maybe just to simplistically ask, is fiscal '24 billings more or less conservative now than it was 90 days ago?\nRemo Canessa: Great question. So I mean the guide that we gave is solely related to basically the go-to-market with our new sales leadership on board. We feel it's prudent to do that. When you take a look at close rates for Q2 this year versus last year, we're being a little more conservative with our close rates this Q2. From a market - overall market perspective, the macro still remains challenging, but we feel that things - that there's more of an acceptance to Zero Trust, there's more of an understanding of our platform. So we feel good. Regarding guidance, whether it's more conservative now or not, I'd like to say we like being prudent. And again, it's all related to go-to-market with our new CRO, and I don't want to comment any further than that.\nJoseph Gallo: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Gabriela Borges of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nGabriela Borges: Good afternoon. Thank you. Remo, I wanted to ask you about some of the idiosyncratic drivers in your federal business. And more specifically, as we think about all the momentum that you're seeing now, how should we think about the durability of growth in the federal vertical? Meaning, is this like a three to five year product cycle where we'll see a ramp and then we should be cognizant of a slowdown? Is it an 18-month to 36-month product cycle? How do we think about some of the visibility you have in federal and how it's going to impact your growth over the medium term? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: It's another great question, Gabriel. I'll start and then maybe Jay can come in also. We've invested significantly in federal. This is not an overnight basically what's occurring. This is occurring over the last five, six years of significant investments both from a platform technology as well as people within the federal organization that works for us. We're in 12 of the 15 agencies, cabinet agencies. As Jay talked about in the script, our growth rate in federal in Q1 was 90% year-over-year. I feel that we are very well positioned in federal, what we talked about, we've got incredibly strong federal team. And I feel that going forward, federal should be a good driver, potentially significant driver for Zscaler. And we're doing well in federal. I'll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. So this is the how I think about it. First of all, number of users in the federal commerce DoD, non-DoD. Yes, we do have 12 of the 15 cabin lab agencies, but they are in various stages. There's a big, big upsell opportunities there itself. Then DoD, just scratching the surface out there. So if you look at from a number of users' point of view, it's a massive market in front of us because we count number of users. Then there are workloads for federal. There's a whole range of IoT, OT devices in federal business that needs to be taken care of. So massive stuff, but then on top of that, it's a platform. Our platform has expanded, it keeps on expanding. So I think this is a significant growth opportunity for a long, long time. And then DoD takes us to next - sorry, federal takes to other federal friendly countries out there. They all want to follow the NATO friendly countries want to adopt what U.S. has done here. That's an opportunity for us. The state governments are getting very, very worried about adopting Zero Trust. That's another big opportunity for us. So very bullish. We've done some big investments, and that's why we have some of the best certifications for Zscaler platform than any other company out there.\nGabriela Borges: Thank you for the color. And congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ruykhaver of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes. Thank you. So Jay, we are seeing this convergence between cloud workload protection platform, [CSPM, CIM] a lot of other acronyms that are being thrown into this seat kind of bucket. We're also seeing a number of next-gen vendors that seem to have more of a product-led sales motion aimed at the developer, which contrasts with your approach, which is more a high touch A,B to C level. So as a product that fits between build and run time environment, and you could argue maybe that portfolio is shifting either to even further left. How do you balance those dynamics when you look to go to market with your CNAPP offering?\nJay Chaudhry: It's a very good question. So all those four letter acronyms you gave us. And we tried to track them. And there have been 100-plus vendors in that space over the past two years. So about a year ago, I used to see a new vendor show up every other day. For the last year or so it has slowed down and actually they're shrinking. But there's adjacent next to it. That is cloud workload communication. Cloud workload communication is about workloads soft, Internet workloads talking to each other. That's where our core strength comes in the Zero Trust architecture. We are the only vendor, I know out there. We have workloads talk to each other through Zero Trust architecture without being on the network. That’s our starting point. Then we look at the CNAPP as an extended. To me, CNAPP is almost like cases in many ways. You make API call, leading logs, you're leading configurations to figure out the risk and whatnot. And that is towards shifting more of the left. We believe that a combination of cloud workload detection, along with CNAPP, puts us in a better position. Regarding product net growth. I think there's an interesting opportunity for some of the companies obviously, we don't come from that side. I haven't seen many, many security companies have grown to hundreds of millions of dollars doing product that growth. But we are watching and monitoring the space, but we will be going from where our strength is. Our large customers, loves Zscalers users, now they're embracing Zscaler for workloads, for communication, and that allows us to extend it to CNAPP space as well. That's how we look at it.\nJonathan Ruykhaver: Yes. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Colville of Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nPatrick Colville: Hi, there. Thank you for taking my question. I mean, really impressive set of results, guys. So congrats on the start in the new fiscal year as you have with - you guys have shown very impressive momentum. I guess I wanted to touch on the leadership change. These two new executive level hires. How has Dali's role changed? Is he still at the firm? Or has he moved on? And if so, how can we expect his decisions to change going forward?\nJay Chaudhry: Dali has an active role as the COO of the company. He has played a phenomenal role in Zscalers growth you've seen over the past four years. He have built a great go-to-market machine that has helped us go past $2 billion in ARR. So Mike's goal is take us from here to $5 billion and beyond. This frees up Dali to focus more in his capacity as a COO to really help scale our business operations capabilities. Now what do you mean by that? As we are growing at a rapid pace. We have many things to improve on scaling side up in the operational side, streamlining our post-sale customer engagements. Ranging from support to TAM to deployment, to success. How do you bring them together to make it more productive and better stay in line for better value realization of the customers. Second example, we do cash process systems, productivity improvement, streamlining. If we do a better job in these areas as a company will become a lot more productive and Dali's experience across the company will help us achieve some of those key things that are needed\nPatrick Colville: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of John DiFucci of Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.\nJohn DiFucci: Thank you. Jay and Remo both spoke about the challenging macro backdrop. And I think Remo, if I - correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you said that you did not hit your internal targets for 1Q. I guess, what do you think the reasons for that were? I mean, you have new go-to-market people, and you explained that with the guide with Joe's question. And sometimes that means the previous people were an issue, but your COO is really good at it to say the least. I know Remo said customer sentiment is stabilizing, but I'm not quite sure how that sort of fits in. Has the macro gotten a little worse? Or is there something else that I'm not thinking about?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. The macro has not gotten worse. And the comment, John, was related to quota-carrying reps. So we didn't hit our internal projections for internal reps. We do expect to catch up. We've talked about before on earlier calls, we're in a huge market opportunity. We're going to invest significantly in our company. You can see in the second half, we're going to increase our sales and marketing spend based on our guidance. That's related to just overall, we've gotten new CMO on board with Mike on Board. That was the gist of the comment. It's related basically purely to quota-carrying reps. We did increase capacity, but not to the levels we wanted. And from my perspective, John, it's really execution on our part. We need to execute better on that part.\nJohn DiFucci: Got it. Thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Tal Liani of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nTal Liani: I'm sorry, I pressed on the mute button. Can hear me now?\nJay Chaudhry: Yes.\nTal Liani: Perfect. Okay. RPO growth was slower. Also, the billing guidance was a tad below, although you hit the quarter, you're above the quarter expectations. So I wanted to ask about the discount level contract duration. Was there any change in the pricing environment or contract duration this quarter that is driving the lower RPOs? And also, how do I think about - I know you don't provide kind of quarterly, but how do I think about first half versus second half in terms of billings and RPOs? Thanks.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I mean a lot of questions in there, but I appreciate you bringing off. RPO decline, it's primarily related to federal. Federal is a big piece of our business. And when you look at federal, federal contracts or even though they're multiyear contracts, really take federal in for one year in our CRPO. So that was a big driver for that. When you take out basically federal out of the contract duration, really contract durations are comparable year-over-year and also quarter-over-quarter. Discount levels, no, not really seeing anything on a discount level perspective. I'd say it's the same and has been the same for a while. First half, second half, you can expect billings to be in the 42% range in the first half and the rest basically in the second half. But the RPO basically relates to - primarily relates to federal business, which is one year - one year recognized.\nTal Liani: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Fatima Boolani of Citi. Your line is open.\nFatima Boolani: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Jay, this one's for you. You were very explicit about the success in the federal business coming from very strong wins and partnerships with federal SIs. So I wanted to better understand what the moat and differentiation is. And if you can help explain to us why this wouldn't necessarily cannibalize your direct business, which you're executing just fantastically in?\nJay Chaudhry: So our direct business versus channel business, almost all of our business is supposed to be changed. A few customers insist that they must do a deal directly with us. So the channel is supposed to bring leverage. The more channel partners are working closely with us, the more heavy lifting to do, better productivity, better our sales acceleration happens. So it's important for us. Now in a transformation sale like ours, the channel wasn't quite ready there to say, hey, tell me the latest box I'm ready to sell. We had to work with them to show them transformation. Federal government is driving big transformation at all levels. President's Executive order is asking for Zero Trust architecture. And there are a large number of systems integrators in the federal market who actually need technology like ours to make it happen. And in federal, it becomes more interesting as you must have certification up to certain levels, there are FedRAMP certification at the medium level at high level and whatnot and IFI. We've done most of them. So with certifications leveraging those system integrators we are able to drive transformation. And I think we are in a very good shape sitting there with a big market, working side by side with our partners. So there's no cannibalization. Did I make it clear? Or did I miss something?\nFatima Boolani: No, that’s super clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Hamza Fodderwala of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nHamza Fodderwala: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Remo, regarding your comment on the sales changes and the impact of the full year billings guide. Just curious, are you anticipating the leadership change will drive a broader restructuring in the sales org? Like you saw a few years ago when Dali came on Board? Or is it going to be more incremental? Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Yes. So the leadership we have in our sales organization is very strong with what Dali has created. I don't see significant changes. Maybe Jay can speak to it, but I don't see significant changes. And again, the structure that we've built under Dali's leadership was a very strong basically structure.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. In many ways, our sales process at Zscaler is very similar to ServiceNow sales process. It's consultative, it is top-down selling, it's enterprise focus. Really, so we expect the same kind of stuff to carry on, there needs to be - there will be ongoing refinements, but don't expect any big changes. Some of the things, as I talked to Mike early on as he's understanding the organization, you'll see probably more focus on top account program. We have a big opportunity to take our large customers and double, triple or quadruple the ARR with us because our platform supports it. You're going to see more focus on verticals. We already have some level of verticals, public sectors of vertical for us, health care, you'll see more focus area. You're also going to see more persona focus in our sales staff. And I mentioned early on too, you'll probably see more focus on global system integrators as they drive some of the large transformations, but no significant changes.\nHamza Fodderwala: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Hedberg of RBC. Your line is open.\nMatthew Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Remo, a question for you on the macro. There's been a couple of questions on billings and RPO and obviously, the federal strength. But I guess maybe I'm just a little confused because when I look back at your Q4 script, when you talked about the macros, you said you noted global uncertainty, but it seems to me like there was a change in tone from your comments here. I think you said - you noted customer sentiment is starting to stabilize. So I guess I'm just sort of curious, what drove that comment that things are starting to stabilize versus last quarter when you noted uncertainty? And is this something that happened during the quarter? Or anything that kind of prompt you to maybe change the script a bit from 4Q?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. I'll let Jay comment to...\nJay Chaudhry: I think what I commented last time, was there's a slight reduction in scrutiny of the deal so the tone I exactly used. I think what we're seeing though, we are saying there's no change in macro the way we haven't seen. So macro is not playing a role at this stage. To say the forecast needs to be assuming macros not getting any worse than it has been.\nMatthew Hedberg: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Shrenik Kothari of Baird. Your line is open.\nShrenik Kothari: Yes. Thanks for taking the question, and congress on the great Jay and Remo. It's great to see your focus on large transformative deals in top accounts as you just highlighted, Jay. The ongoing traction with bundled offerings across your emerging new products contributing to the new business. So all of that speaks to create in-house kind of innovation model that you have talked about. Jay, how do you see the role of strategic M&A play in expansion plans as we are starting to see with some others especially around cloud and data security. And what if any potential areas to focus? And Remo, can you provide the new versus upsell split in the quarter and how it compares to the expected the 40-60 mix. Thanks.\nJay Chaudhry: Yes. Very good question. So with tighter funding and lots of security companies out there, we're seeing lots of attractive opportunities coming our way. We are looking at a number of innovative technologies and strong development teams. It's an option. It's done. A number of small ones in the past some time Yes, there are some areas, interesting technologies, especially in the new world of data and AI kind of stuff. It's an option we're keeping. I think you will not see us trying to buy revenue through an M&A. They're going to see us buying innovative, disruptive technologies that can help us get to market sooner, faster is important. And that integrates with our platform. I hate to see acquisition being done where you have standalone products, they don't work together with each other. But we are actively exploring those areas. There's no reason why we should not be. Remo?\nRemo Canessa: Yes. And the new and upsell was 45% new, 55% upsell. On our year-end call, we said we expect upsell to be above 60%. That's still our expectation for the year. But for the quarter, it was 55% or so.\nShrenik Kothari: Okay. Thanks a lot, Jay and Remo. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Hi. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. I guess, Remo, I wanted to dig into margins and specifically maybe gross margins, I mean, you guys are about 3x the size you were 2.5 years ago. But you've hovered kind of in this just below 81% gross margins, give or take, 50 basis points or so. And I appreciate the comments you had that emerging products will initially have lower gross margins. I think that's been the case for some time. But how do we think as you continue to grow at an accelerated pace and scale, how can we expect that to impact your margins? How are you managing your infrastructure? And then maybe just an adjacent comment on sales and marketing, it seems as though that was quite a bit lower than billings. Did you hold back on sales and marketing spend ahead of the arrival of Mike and Joyce? Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Yes, a few questions. Did we hold back the sales and marketing spend? No problem. We hold back sales and marketing spend, not really. It's just the way things worked out. Maybe a little bit on the marketing side, but that's about it, but not really. From a gross margin perspective, our stated gross margin has been between 78% and 82% then you're right, Brian. We've been in the 80% range for a long time. The beauty of Zscaler, quite frankly, is the platform technology that's been created. When I started here, we're doing 30 billion transactions per day. We are doing 360 billion transactions per day right now. And we still have 80% gross margin. The benefit that we have is we can make decisions really to maximize gross margin or to get applications or applications or increase the strength of our product by going through public cloud. So we balance that. I would expect gross margins to be in the 78%, 82% long term, short term, midterm, I'd expect the 80% gross margin range. If we need to shift our focus with more increase in our margins, we will but we do manage it. We do look at it and the emerging products do carry lower gross margins. And we'll keep on innovating. We're not going to slow down building more products.\nBrian Essex: That’s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And that is all the time we have for questions today. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jay Chaudhry, CEO, for any closing remarks.\nJay Chaudhry: My sincere thanks to our employees, our customers and partners for delivering a strong quarter. Thank you for your interest in Zscaler. We look forward to seeing you at some of the investor conferences. Thank you.\nRemo Canessa: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."
