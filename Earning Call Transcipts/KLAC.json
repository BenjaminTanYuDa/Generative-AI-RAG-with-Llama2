        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Chelsea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation December Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you for joining the earnings call to discuss the December 2023 results and the March quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins. We will discuss today's results release after the market close and available on our IR website, along with supplemental materials. Today's discussion is presented on a non-GAAP financial basis, unless otherwise specified. Our full year references all relate to calendar years. A detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP -- of GAAP to non-GAAP results in the earnings material posted on our website. KLA's IR website also contains future investor events as well as presentations, corporate governance information and links to our SEC filings, including our most recent annual report and quarterly reports on 10-Q and 10-K. Our comments today are subject to risks and uncertainties reflected in the risk factor disclosure in our SEC filings. Any forward-looking statements, including those we make on the call today are subject to those risks, and KLA cannot guarantee those forward-looking statements will come true. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick?\nRichard Wallace: Thank you, Kevin. I will briefly summarize KLA's performance for 2023 calendar year and December quarter and then set up our view for 2024. For 2023 KLA revenue was almost $9.7 billion, down 8% versus the prior year. This was higher than our expectations coming into the year as strength from legacy node customers and semiconductor infrastructure offset weaker than expected leading edge investments in both logic and memory. While overall WFE spending was down for the year, there were areas of growth in the KLA business segments, including the infrastructure business supporting wafer and mass manufacturers, automotive and specialty semiconductor process equipment. KLA's service business grew 7% to $2.2 billion for the year. The company continued to deliver strong industry leading margins, with non-GAAP gross margins of 62% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 39%. Free cash flow grew 6% in 2023 to a record $3.2 billion. Moving to KLA's December quarter results, which were ahead of expectations as revenue grew 4% sequentially to $2.49 billion. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share was $4.28 and non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16. We saw sequential growth in all three of KLA's business segments. You can find specific details in our shareholder letter released earlier today. Additional highlights in the quarter include growing adoption for KLA's 8900 Series platform for high throughput macro inspection, increased demand in the legacy node and advanced packaging categories made the platform one of the best performing product lines in our optical inspection portfolio in 2023. Continued growth in AI enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. We continue to deploy deep learning and physics based algorithms across KLA's inspection and metrology product portfolio. This has improved signal and noise recognition and reduced process learning cycles as customers resolve critical yield challenges. KLA Service business grew 1% on a sequential quarterly basis to $565 million and remained on track to resume the targeted 12% to 14% annual revenue growth trajectory in calendar 2024. As we look at CY '24, I'm encouraged by recent reports from many of our customers that the demand environment is expected to continue to gradually improve throughout the calendar year. Through collaboration with customers, KLA is focused on preparing our teams for a return to growth as the leading edge and leveraging the KLA operating model to ensure readiness to support our customers' needs as the demand environment improves. In the near term, we see the March quarter at the low point for the year, we expect business levels to improve as we progress throughout the year. The KLA team will, as always, prioritize commitments to our customers and executing on our product growth apps. I'll now hand the call over to Bren to provide more specifics around the financials and our guidance.\nBren Higgins: Thanks, Rick. Our results demonstrated the consistent execution of our global team. Despite the challenges and complexity of the current industry environment, KLA continues to show resourcefulness and the ability to adapt to meeting customers' changing and fluid requirements. Revenue was $2.49 billion, slightly above the guidance midpoint of $2.45 billion. Non-GAAP diluted EPS was $6.16, above the midpoint of the guided range of $5.26 to $6.46. GAAP diluted EPS was $4.28. GAAP EPS was negatively impacted by $1.59 for goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charge. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.6%, just above the high end of the guidance range of 60.5% to 62.5%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.7%. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $839 million, GAAP net income was $583 million. Cash flow from operations was $622 million and free cash flow was $545 million. As I just mentioned, during the quarter, KLA recognized a goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment charge of $219 million for the PCB and display reporting unit attributed to a weaker long term outlook, primarily for the flat panel display business. We have begun investigating strategic alternatives for this business, which accounted for 1.4% of total revenue in calendar 2023. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment grade ratings from all three agencies. In December 2023, Fitch rating upgraded KLA's debt rating to A from A- with a stable outlook. Moving to our outlook. Looking ahead to calendar 2024, the exact timing of a meaningful and sustainable resumption in WFE investment growth continues to remain uncertain. Though there are signs of improvements in some end markets, this improvement is off low levels, impacting our customers' profitability and cash flow generation in the near term. KLA's overall demand is stabilizing around current business levels, plus or minus the guidance ranges. As of now, this translates into KLA revenue bottoming in the March quarter, driven mostly by a customer project delay occurring in the last couple of months. Based on current fast schedules in our June quarter shipment plan, we expect sequential growth to return in the June quarter and continue for the remainder of the calendar year. For calendar 2024, we currently expect WFE demand to be in the mid to high $8 billion. roughly flat to modestly up from the anticipated level in calendar year 2023. We expect that the second half of the calendar year will be stronger than the first half for WFE investment. This WFE estimate reflects our current top down assessment of industry demand as follows: In memory, we expect WFE investment to be slightly up from low levels with investments focused on high bandwidth memory capacity and leading edge node development. Both NAND and DRAM fabs are still a low utilization levels as consumer markets have not yet returned to the growth levels needed to bring factory utilization back to the high levels seen in recent years. Once customers consume this excess capacity and focus on node migration, we would expect to see new investments. Foundry logic is expected to be slightly up with leading edge investment returning to modest growth levels, Legacy investment declining versus 2023, and China legacy node investments remaining relatively flattish to current levels. As for guidance, KLA's March quarter guidance is as follows: Revenue is expected to be $2.3 billion, plus or minus $125 million. Foundry Logic is forecasted to be approximately 60%, and memory is expected to be 40% of semi process control systems revenue. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND the remaining 15%. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be in a range of 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point as product mix weakens quarter-to-quarter due to lower overall semiconductor process control systems revenue. For calendar 2024, based on current industry outlook, top line growth expectations, higher forecasted growth in services and expected systems product mix, we are modeling gross margins to be relatively stable around the mid 61% range to what we delivered in 2023. Variability quarter-to-quarter is typically driven by product mix fluctuations. Operating expenses are forecasted in the March quarter to be approximately $545 million, relatively flat with the December quarter. Our calendar 2024 operating expenses, we expect $5 million to $10 million incremental growth per quarter beyond the March quarter, in line with expected sequential growth in revenue. Prototype material purchases can drive variability quarter-to-quarter. For the calendar '24 tax rate based on current forecast, we do not expect material changes. You should continue using the 13.5% effective rate for modeling purposes. Other model assumptions for the March quarter include other income and expense net of approximately $45 million. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $4.93 plus or minus $0.60. A non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.26 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 135.6 million shares. In conclusion, we are optimistic that most end markets are showing signs of improvement. KLA will remain focused on supporting customers, executing on our product road map and positioning the company for a return of growth at the leading edge. The visibility into the precise timing of a sustainable demand recovery is still unclear, KLA is running the business to ensure delivery of a differentiated product portfolio that meets customers' technology road map requirements and to execute our business in line with our longer-term growth expectations. The KLA operating model guiding best-in-class execution, KLA continues to implement strategic objectives, which are geared to drive outperformance. With a focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence, KLA is able to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital consistently. The past few years have strengthened our confidence in the increasing importance of process control and enabling technology advancements and optimizing yield at a high design mix volume production environment. This bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite still challenging near-term demand trends. In the meantime, KLA business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain very compelling. That concludes the prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A.\nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you can just give the instructions and set up the queue.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like relative to your prior view, the March quarter came in lower by roughly about $200 million. I know you talked about a customer project delay that materialized just over the last couple of months. It looks like based on your December quarter end market mix and expected March quarter mix that it's a Foundry Logic customer. Was that a leading edge or mature node customer, was the delay more technology-related or just weak demand trends? And does the sequential growth outlook beyond March assume that this customer comes back this year?\nBren Higgins: Hey, Harlan. It's Bren. So yes, as we said in the prepared remarks over the last couple of months, we had a project that we were planning to ship roughly a couple of hundred million dollars of business too, that had a pushout that's extended, I think, somewhere around 12 months. So could we see it at the end of '24, maybe could be early '25 as well. So it was more leading edge centric. And as a result of that, as we backfill that business with other business, we did see the percent of China go up a little bit higher than we had thought we would see when we were giving guidance at the beginning of the quarter. So it was late in the quarter, obviously affected -- it didn't affect Q4 because of the moving around of other customers and slots, but certainly had an effect on Q1. As we think about sequential improvement into the June quarter, we also have, part of our revenue recognition policy is that when we ship to new customers, we have to go to acceptance to demonstrate that we can -- that our tools are meeting specifications around reliability and matching and so forth. And there are some shipments that we shipped at the end of Q4, and we're shipping it in the March quarter that are aligned with a couple of projects for new customers for the fats are opening late in the quarter. So our ability to get those acceptances and complete that process could be potentially constrained. So we'll see that revenue shift into the June quarter once you get the established performance, then that revenue happens at shipment going forward with that customer. But we do have some unique dynamics that are affecting us here in the first half. So it does give me some comfort about the sequential growth guidance as we move into June. But it is affecting what we ultimately guided for the March quarter, consistent with our revenue recognition policy.\nHarlan Sur: No, I appreciate the insights there. Your total Process Control Systems business outgrow WFE yet again, right, in calendar '23. Within that, Inspection significantly outperformed, right? It was only down 5%, but your patterning business was down almost 20%, which is actually worse versus WFE. And let's say, most of that full year underperformance was due to the sharp drop-off in patterning just in the December quarter. So was that tied to the customer pushout dynamics, as you mentioned or is it just the lumpy shipment trends in patterning? And I guess, do you guys expect Process Control Systems business to outgrow WFE this year?\nRichard Wallace: Yeah. Great question, Harlan. I think if you think about our business and the composition and how it moves with customers, Inspection, especially the leading edge Inspection is much more tied to development of new technology, whether it's in pilot or even ramp. And some of the metrology business is more tied to capacity. So when you see a falloff of capacity, it impacts metrology more than it would impact Inspection and that's what we saw in '23.\nBren Higgins: Hey, Harlan. It's Bren. On the relative performance, we do feel pretty good about the performance overall when you think about how much legacy business was in the year and how the leading edge fell off, which typically drives higher process control intensity. Also in WFE this year was a little unique in that there was a lot of carryover WFE from 2022 for a number of peers. And so that showed up in '23, it was really activity that we started in 2022. So when you take into account those factors and look at how well we performed in '22 relative to the overall market, we were -- our growth rate was 4x what the market was. The fact that we're mostly, I think, in line, maybe a little bit better than the overall market in '23 is I think, a pretty good indicator of the growing process control intensity that we're excited about here KLA.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.\nJoe Quatrochi: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to the pushout. So just so I understand, if we were to adjust for the couple of hundred million that's now pushed into the June quarter and assumed it was still in the March quarter, I guess, would you still expect that the June quarter would be up quarter-over-quarter or would it be more flattish like we were thinking or talking about last quarter of just the first half kind of still being a similar run rate of the business?\nBren Higgins: Yeah. I think it's more the latter, right? We've -- obviously, you've got a lot of moving parts in how it affects the quarters. But as we had talked about last quarter, we saw the business generally continuing at guided level. We guided with [indiscernible] right? We ended about performing by $40 million or so. So it would have been probably flattish, more or less. But this adjustment coming out obviously has the kind of impact, and I sized it earlier. So flattish, and then we would expect to see the second half start to improve a little bit.\nJoe Quatrochi: That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, I know you're going to -- you'll file your 10-Q probably tomorrow, but any color on where the RPO stood exiting in the quarter?\nBren Higgins: Yeah. And so RPO was down about $200 million. I expected you to ask that question, Joe. So yeah, $200 million quarter-to-quarter and with about 50%. So that takes you to about $10.6 billion, 45% to 50% of it to ship beyond 12 months. And then within that, we have about just short of $800 million in customer deposits.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.\nCJ Muse: Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess first question, can you speak to domestic China? And I guess to what degree '23 was helped by bare wafer and reticle inspection and your thoughts on how that progresses in '24? And I guess with the mix shift to perhaps maybe incrementally more DRAM. And I don't know in terms of the really core legacy, some shifts there, how you're seeing your kind of implied market share '24 versus '23?\nBren Higgins: So for China, CJ, I think overall, for China, it looks pretty flattish year-to-year. We did benefit from the infrastructure investment that I talked a lot about over the course of the last year or so. I would expect that part of the business to come down some as some of the digestion is happening more so on the wafer side than the reticle side. And so that obviously will get made up by what I would expect to be slightly higher foundry. I think the memory piece will shift to potentially ship to another customer. So I could see that being flattish overall. So we feel pretty good about the trajectory of China. There is some lumpiness given our ASPs. But I think through the year, it will be relatively consistent across the quarters, notwithstanding the timing of certain fab projects and construction schedules complete and so on. And then I think we'll start to see the percent come down as we move into the second half as you see other customers drive our expected growth as we move through the second half of the year. What was the second part of the question?\nCJ Muse: No. You covered it. I guess for my follow-up, as you think about kind of second half stronger than first half, how would you kind of rank order leading edge foundry logic versus DRAM in terms of the key drivers for you?\nBren Higgins: I think leading edge will be -- we'll see some growth in the year. It will be, I think, a fairly modest growth as we continue through the year. I would say, I'm just kind of looking quickly here, I would say that it is reasonably balanced across the year. So I would think that we'll see -- I would expect to see DRAM probably be -- actually, I think it's going to be pretty balanced as well from a leading edge DRAM point of view. So I think it's pretty balanced on both fronts. And then just ticking up a little bit as you move into the second half.\nCJ Muse: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have two of them too. One is, I was just kind of curious Rick, if you can kind of give color how to think about China revenues this year ex EPC?\nRichard Wallace: Well, Bren just covered that, but in the last question, but essentially flattish. I mean that's the general view for China this year. Flattish a little less infrastructure than we saw, especially and wafer vertical continues to remain basically level at this current run rate.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up. If I look at kind of like value optical inspection and you said that revenue should start improving over time. Where is the lead times today for them today versus, let's say, three months or six months ago and where do you expect them to go over the next few months?\nBren Higgins: Yeah. I'll start on that. On optical inspection, so we're still constrained on Gen 4 in terms of demand relative to our supply. I would expect to see supply increase this year. And that's part of our business, I would expect to do better than overall market as we move into '24. We have, right now, I think we've seen some normalization around Gen 5 lead times, which tend to be somewhere between seven months and nine months. But Gen 4 is still out over a year or so, but new capacity coming online. I think not enough for what we expect over the next year to 1.5 years. But then we have another tranche of capacity that will come online as we move into the '26 time frame. So we feel pretty good about what we have in terms of overall capacity, both within the – within KLA and our facilities, but also within our supply chain to support the growth that we expect as we move into ‘25 with more meaningful WFE growth. And then as we target 2026 financial plan that we laid out back at our Investor Day in ‘22.\nKrish Sankar: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel.\nBrian Chin: Good afternoon. Thanks. I want to ask a few questions. Maybe just mix someone might have asked this earlier in the queue. But taking your WFE sort of outlook for flat to modest based on your '23 base level, flat to modest growth this year, relative to sort of the pickup and maybe your revenue and WFE being sort of in the second half but kind of modest, right? You probably would need to see an acceleration in the back quarters of the year in order to kind of get to say even towards the mid -- the low to mid-single digit kind of growth that you're talking about for WFE at the moment. So I'm kind of curious, do you see Process Control intensity type of profile of spending this year sort of neutral in terms of WFE, you think intensity is higher or lower, relative to, again, that profile of spending this year? And then how does that reflect in your revenue?\nBren Higgins: Yeah. No, you're right in terms of the math, right? As we look at the first half of this year, which is, we'll call maybe slightly down versus the second half of '23 and then an acceleration in the second half would put you somewhere in the, I'll call it, high-single digit growth. That assumes that WFE is marginally up more or less from 2023. And so against that backdrop, with slight improvement in memory, I would expect our process control intensity to be roughly flat. So we were in the seven depending on your WFE number, but assuming $87 billion to $88 billion and WFE in '23, about 7.6% or so. So I would expect it to be similar as we move into '24. And as we expect to see more growth in leading edge investment as we move into '25, then we'll start to see favorability in terms of leading edge dynamics that tend to drive our business and higher process control intensity overall. So I think that's how to think about it right now.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Thanks. And then just given that emphasis this year on memory conversions and upgrade activity, can you comment on the areas where KLA benefits and how meaningful a benefit that this sort of spending represents?\nBren Higgins: You mean in terms of just where we benefit in memory investment or we expect to see -- I mean, certainly, you've got the -- in DRAM with more DRAM investment with the introduction of EUV, that tend to be a positive dynamic for our business. We saw process control intensity increases as we saw EUV introduced into DRAM. So that's probably one of the bigger positives for us. So you're right, as you start to do technology conversions, instead of new capacity will be a little bit more muted investment. But we would expect to see our customers continue to invest in the -- in their leading edge development for the next nodes. And so I think that will be the biggest driver for our business.\nBrian Chin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. I guess the first question is kind of looking beyond the 2024. And obviously, you don't expect you to provide any guidance there, but take any opinion that you have. Some of the other equipment suppliers that have had longer lead times were starting to express a little more confidence on a turn on '25. I don't expect that you've seen that in your order book yet, but interested to see what your customers may be talking about.\nRichard Wallace: It's a great question. And we have definitely had those conversations. I think that customers are looking at from a couple of perspectives. One, we do have long lead on the most advanced optical tools, but there's also a lot of development that we're doing right now to make those tools even better for the advanced logic ramps that are coming. So we're actually engaged quite a bit in R&D and in pilot with those customers. So we have a pretty good sense. They're all bullish about '25. I can't think of a customer that we have on a leading edge that isn't bullish about '25. But as you say, we're not going to see the orders for those yet. But we're certainly having those conversations. But more importantly, we're seeing the discussions happen around capability that we're demonstrating as they do pilot. The other thing is, we're seeing a trend toward more designs, and we talked about this for the past several years. One of the leading indicators for us is the advanced designs because that's an indicator of how broad a node is going to be. And we're seeing that continue and that will drive both business but also as a good leading indicator for the strength of '25. That's why one of the objectives for the company is to prepare for growth in leading edge because that's what we believe will happen over the next 24 months. As Bren indicated, not the next six months, we should start to see the green shoots of that toward the end of the year, and then we'll see it in '25 as the way we're modeling the business and our investment right now.\nChris Caso: Got it. That's very helpful. As a start-up, with regard to the foundry logic business, would you characterize and I guess what you talked about your WFE assumptions is some kind of slight growth this year. Is it safe to say that, that growth is tied to new node deployments and kind of technology upgrades and such as opposed to capacity at this point?\nRichard Wallace: It's a little bit of capacity, too. I mean '23 was down, right? And so we're seeing some expansion of capacity. The big node ramps aren't really happening as much this year, which is part of why the WFE gets driven up. And you heard TSM's call, and I think they are fairly bullish on their forecast, but we'd have to see what happens in the early parts of '25 for those ramps on, especially the newest technologies.\nBren Higgins: And we would expect the legacy business non-China to be lower in '24 than '23. So there's -- so it's being offset. You've got some improvement with the leading edge investment offset by some of the non-China legacy falling off a bit. So that's how we get to our forecast. And we'll see as we start -- we're having these conversations with customers. We're certainly planning for it from a capacity point of view, and we'll see as we progress through the year as we start to firm up when those shipments will actually start to take place.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. You talked about memory utilization remaining low. And I guess I feel like you guys kind of talked about that relatively early, and then you saw it kind of static. We've heard from memory customers, all kinds of things about different times that they brought it down and see like some of them bought it up. I just want to confirm that you're seeing that as kind of a steady trend? And then can you talk about how that affects your, the services revenue you can get from those guys?\nRichard Wallace: Yes. But having met with a number of memory customers recently, there's a marked difference in their tone, right now. And so when we talked to them last year, there's a lot of downcast looks about it because they had been ready for a much bigger, much bigger consumption of memory. And now I think they're starting to turn the corner on that. We do see conversion technology, but utilization is -- hasn't really changed much. Service continues to be higher than historically, we -- our utilization rates on our equipment are higher than historically, but because I think customers, even those that have the ability to flex down, the utilization on our systems have chosen not to. And so that's been a real strength for us. And why services for KLA did so well in '23, and we expect that growth to resume to the numbers we targeted a couple of years ago for '24 and beyond. So I'd say the posture is different, and we're going to -- and we expect to see that continue to strengthen throughout the year.\nBren Higgins: The customers don't have the same level of redundancy with what they buy from KLA versus a lot of process equipment. And when you're focused on trying to be as efficient with your capital as you can, you'll tend to really focus on trying to drive yield. So the way they buy process control, they don't buy a lot of extra. So if they take capacity offline for a process. They tend to run process control much more consistently. The customers that cut more in terms of utilization earlier have come back more. I think overall, to Rick’s statement, it’s been fairly flat overall. I think DRAM has tightened a bit because of some of the AI drivers for that. But on the flash side, I think it’s been fairly stable. And like I said, some improvement from folks who cut more aggressively early on.\nJoe Moore: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Bren, you talked about strategic alternatives for the display business. Can you help us out how big the display business was last year? And then in general, on the EPC business, there are kind of, also it's starting to [indiscernible] to mobility is getting better. Can you just talk about how you're looking at the EPC business, excluding display?\nBren Higgins: You're breaking up a little bit there, Atif. So in regards to the comments on display, it's about 1.5% of the revenue of the company. And there are parts of display that are more commodity based and there's aspects of that industry structurally where profitability is more challenged. And then there's some interesting parts of it, too, in terms of some of the future road map opportunities and where some of the higher end customers, customers are moving. So we will have more to say about that as we assess the alternatives we're considering. The rest of EPC is kind of the tale of two businesses overall. The specialty semiconductor business has done exceptionally well as we talked about in the shareholder letter. Really outperforming WFE overall. I think it's a combination of customer engagement, more applications, new products. So we're really pleased with where we're performing there and the ability to differentiate. And I would expect that to be roughly flat and with some mix shift. It has some diversity in terms of end markets between automotive and mobile and advanced packaging. So you could see a shift where automotive weakens, we'll see more investment on the advanced packaging side. So we're pretty positive on that. IQOS, we're already starting to see some improvement there, which tends to be a little bit of a leading indicator in terms of finished components. And so we're more optimistic about how that will translate back into the other parts of our business, given that that's a short lead time, more capacity centric business. So again, back to our views of some improvement as we move into the second half. PCB has been more mobile centric in terms of more consumer markets, more capacity centric. So that business has been weaker, but I would expect it to be a little bit better this year as well. And there are some product offerings that we have coming that start to take advantage of opportunities at high end PCB and substrates as those integrate into heterogenous packages. So we expect the APC business overall to be up, we'll call it, maybe high-single digits, a little less lead time over there. So a little harder to forecast off of the year we had in 2023.\nAtif Malik: Great. And then as my follow-up, Rick, you talked about uncertainty in leading edge with some push out. If your foundry customers decide to focus more in putting these investments of fabs in Japan versus U.S. Is there an impact to your business?\nRichard Wallace: Well, the work that they're doing in Japan is not at the leading edge, but it is part of their overall investment with the exception of the Japanese company that's investing there. So I would say, yes, of course, that's a different kind of business for us. It's important. But the leading edge business that's being done in the foundries isn't being done there right now with the exception of one. So we're talking about the -- what we're seeing and hearing is the development is going on for the leading-edge work. The question is, at what point will they be in a position to ramp that. So we -- the reason we're confident of the growth that's coming is because of the engagements we've had, the design starts that we see and the plans that we know that they've been discussing. So we feel pretty good about the setup as we go towards the end of the year and into next year.\nAtif Malik: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham.\nCharles Shi: Hi. Thanks. First off, I really just want to ask for some clarification about the service business expectation for calendar 2024. I think that you talked about higher forecasted growth in service. Is it higher than what you thought at the 12% to 14% this year or if you're just talking about higher growth than compared with your systems business? Just a quick clarification. Thanks.\nBren Higgins: Yeah. More in line with the long-term target model of 12% to 14% and closer to the high end of the target range. And that's really being driven by, we talked about some of the improving utilization that we expect to see as we move through the year, which if you think about our customers, their businesses get better. They have more demand, they start to consume the capacity they have. They have sustainability in that. And then as their profitability improves, then they start to invest in new equipment. So we would expect to see that play through as we move through the year. But we also will start to benefit from the tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022 as they move from warranty into contract. And so that should be a driver for service growth as we move into next year. So will be back in line with the overall target model in terms of how we're planning for the business next year. The great thing about service is this growth that happens pretty continuously. It does have a little bit of a dilutive effect on our overall margins, which is one of the factors in the '24 gross margin color that I provided. So even if we would expect to see revenue increase a bit, I do think that you'll see a little bit of pressure on margins. Now it tends to be based on the way we do the accounting accretive to operating margin. So it's -- at that level, it's pretty positive, but it does have an effect on the puts and takes within gross margin.\nCharles Shi: Thanks, Bren. Maybe another question, maybe a little bit longer term. I think in the past, you talked about particularly some of your leading edge customers reusing their capacity in the past and may put a little bit pressure a few cycles ago on your overall growth. Your largest customer, I think, last week, you talked about maybe converting some of the 5-nanometer to 3-nanometer. We don't know whether they're going to continue to do that. But any thoughts there and looking a little bit ahead, do you expect any sort of negative impact going forward? Thanks.\nRichard Wallace: You're right. I mean historically, customers have always tried to be reuse whatever they could. There’s a couple of factors that impacted going forward. One is, the technology that they’re going to need for 3 and then for 2 is upgraded from what they have at 5. And the second one is they still have volume at 5. So the question will be – historically, when this was the most pronounced was when there was a great fall off in an existing node going to a new node. So in our conversations with them and our modeling of it, we see it pretty consistent from what we’ve seen in the last few years, not as high as the reuse was several years ago. But that factor drives us to continuously provide more capability in the tool to give them incentive to go to the new technology or to upgrade the existing. So there’s nothing specifically new about this upcoming next generation of new technology, but it is definitely something customers are always trying to optimize their footprint.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Bren, I wanted to ask about book-to-bill. So it's below one for the fifth quarter in a row. It's up a little bit. It's up to like 0.9. So you're reaching some sort of like steady state. But it's a much different dynamic of what's sitting in RPO than what used to sit in backlog because you used to have four months to five months’ worth of backlog. And now if you assume half of the stuff is parked outside of 12 months and half is inside of 12 months, I mean it's not, I guess, that different than it was before, but you still have this $5 billion plus it's part beyond 12 months and that was never there before. So as we look pre-COVID and post-COVID, what changed? Why is there this $5 billion worth of bookings or RPOs just parked beyond 12 months? Because it isn't like your lead times have gone out that far. And I understand that with those long lead times, but it has always been a long lead times. So what's kind of changed for you?\nBren Higgins: Yeah. And I think the easiest way to think about that part of it is it's related to customers giving orders that are tied to facilities that they're planning greenfield projects. And so the schedules are driving the orders. And so it's one of those where it is a lead time centric. It's -- the customer has a project that's going to open in '25, they want their tools when they have that scheduled planned opening and so they've given us orders. In a lot of cases, you have some China business where you've given us orders and deposits that are tied to those schedules. So that's the biggest factor in the piece that's out. And you're right, it is a bit of a new phenomenon. I think that we started to see after the massive ramp that we saw from '19 to '22 or so. So -- and each quarter, it's been pretty consistent, and we've been teeing up a certain amount of that backlog every quarter, but it's been pretty consistent and it's been roughly 50% or so. So in the quarter we just completed, if you noticed, if you look at the balance sheet, you'll see the deferred systems revenue is actually a little bit higher, and that's related to the dynamic I talked about earlier, where shipments were higher than revenue levels. And that drove down the RPO, but the book-to-bill relative to the revenue was actually positive. So -- but I don't think that changes the nature of your question in terms of the trend line. It was a little bit better, more -- it's kind of consistent with what we thought and a little bit positive in the December quarter.\nTimothy Arcuri: Yeah. I mean, I got, it was up, definitely. But I guess just my follow-up on that is, what's the advantage? If I'm that customer and if your lead times are well inside of that, what's the advantage if I'm a Chinese customer to booking something that's going to sit in your backlog but partly on 12 months? I mean, unless I'm worried about export control and maybe, I think, because I have something I've given you a down payment that entitles me to get the tool, like is that part of it? I still don't know why I would park something like way, way beyond your lead times?\nBren Higgins: Well, if you're a new customer and you have new relationships with us, the demonstration of credibility in terms of, hey, we want this, we want to engage. We want you to put resources in place to support the fab and that takes some time to do so. And then in a lot of cases, that also comes with deposits for a portion of the orders. So I think it comes down to -- you don't want -- if you're one of those customers you want to ensure that when your fab opens, that this isn't a bottleneck or an obstacle to your ramp in your plant. And in a lot of cases, if they're newer customers to us, these aren't or I wouldn't say that the customers you know are booking orders that far in advance. But there are certain customers that want to make sure that we're prepared to support their plans. And so they give us orders to ensure that they're credible on those plans.\nTimothy Arcuri: Well, that's a ton of -- ton of customers that we actually never heard of before. Okay, Bren. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Thank you so much for taking the question. I have two as well. The first one is on High-NA. There seems to be a bit of a disconnect among some of your customers in terms of, I guess, their appetite to take tools and to develop using those tools. Curious how you're thinking about potential insertion of High-NA over the medium to long term and how should we think about the positive impact to your business from an intensity standpoint?\nRichard Wallace: Our views haven't really changed in terms of the timing for High-NA. We're encouraged to see the shipments of the tools that were well publicized. And I think that's great. It is going to take a while of course, as with any new technology to get those up and into production. So really haven't changed in terms of our view of when that turns into pilot and then when it turns to the high volume. But one thing that's clear is the increased adoption of EUV is good for KLA and the broadening of it, as we see it being more applicable to memory also creates more opportunities, not only just in the reticle space, but because we're now dealing with the deep activity challenges are greater as they start printing smaller features. It drives both the number and intensity of the tools that we need but also how they're run. So you need to run, for example, a BBP tool at a higher sensitivity, which, as you know, requires -- we keep adding capability, but it does require more capacity to cover the same amount of silicon to support that. So it's a very good transfer for process control and one that we're encouraged by. But from our standpoint, no change, which I guess is really good news because if we look back at EUV, it did delay several times. High-NA seems to be on track with the schedule that has been out there for some time now.\nToshiya Hari: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Bren. Just on the display business, so 1.5% of revenue last year. I'm curious, if you could speak to the profitability of that business. I mean, to the extent you do end up, say, selling the business, how should we think about accretion to gross margins and bottom line earnings? Thank you.\nBren Higgins: Yeah, profitability is less than 1.5 – 1.5% of KLA. So it’s 1.5% of revenue, the profitability is less than 1.5% of KLA’s profitability.\nToshiya Hari: Okay. I figure that much, but thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] All right. And we have no further questions in the queue. So I'll turn the floor back over to Kevin Kessel for any additional or closing remarks.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you again, everyone for your time. We know it's a busy day of earnings, a busy week. We appreciate it. We'll be in touch with sure all of you over the coming days, 10 weeks. And with that, back to you, Chelsea to provide any final instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the KLA Corporation December quarter 2023 earnings call and webcast.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the KLA Corporation September Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kevin Kessel, Vice President of Investor Relations and Market Analytics. Please go ahead.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you for joining us for our earnings call to discuss the results of the September 2023 quarter and our December quarter outlook. I'm joined by our CEO, Rick Wallace, and our CFO, Bren Higgins, to discuss our results released today after the market close, which are available on our IR website, along with the supplemental materials.

Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Rick will begin the call with some comments and quarterly highlights. Bren will conclude with our financial highlights, including our guidance and outlook. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Rick Wallace. Rick?\nRick Wallace: Thanks, Kevin. Before we cover KLA's September quarter outlook, I'd like to address the situation in Israel as it pertains to KLA. We have many KLA employees based in Israel. We're deeply saddened by the unspeakable acts of terrorism in the Middle East and the resulting war underway. Our heartfelt condolences are with all the victims and their families, friends and loved ones. At KLA, we're focused on employee safety and well-being and are making efforts to assist our teams through terrible circumstances, including resources and support for our employees and broader humanitarian support through the KLA Foundation. We all hope for a peaceful solution soon. Moving on to our September quarter results, which exceeded expectations. Specifically, revenue of $2.4 billion finished at the upper end of the guidance range. GAAP EPS was $5.41 and non-GAAP EPS was $5.74, both also finishing at the upper end of the respective guidance ranges. These results were driven by the strength and relevance of KLA's process control portfolio. Additionally, focused execution enabled continued free cash flow generation and capital returns. We are proud of how the KLA team continue to outperform in the marketplace and deliver on customer commitments. The overall business environment remains relatively stable for KLA. We continue to see strength in markets served by legacy nodes despite softness in memory and leading-edge, logic and foundry investments. As the industry continues to navigate the slowdown in the electronics market, we are closely monitoring any adjusting results that affect our customers' capacity. KLA continues to outperform the industry on a relative basis because customer investment in R&D for technology advancement and transition has proven to be more resilient to market pressures. If we look at some specific highlights in the quarter, revenue was driven by strength in legacy node investment globally and industry infrastructure investment. KLA's market leadership, product success and unpatterned wafer, optical and macro inspection also demonstrate the power of the KLA portfolio. Rapid growth of AI, both enables KLA's differentiation and helps drive industry growth. KLA is a pioneer and adopting AI to improve the performance of our systems and create differentiation. And KLA has a long track record of employee deep learning and physics-based algorithms in our core technologies. As the cost of compute has declined, we are now able to deploy this capability more broadly across our product portfolio, leveraging our AI expertise, KLA's inspection, metrology and data analytics systems help customers solve challenges associated with current process technologies and critical industry inflections, including gate all around, 3D memory, EUV lithography, and advanced packaging. KLA service business grew both sequentially and year-over-year, ending at $560 million in the September quarter and remains on track or high single-digit percent year-over-year growth in 2023. Finally, the September quarter was another excellent period from the cash flow and capital returns perspective, quarterly free cash flow was $816 million, which drove the last 12 months free cash flow up 3% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Total capital returns over the past 12 months were $2.4 billion. In summary, KLA's September quarter results demonstrate our continued process control leadership and the success of our portfolio strategy. Our consistent execution despite challenges in the marketplace highlights the resiliency of the KLA operating model, driven by the dedication of our global teams. I'll now hand it over to Bren to cover more details on our financial performance and our outlook. Bren?\nBren Higgins: Thank you, Rick. KLA delivered a strong September quarter, demonstrating consistent execution, despite a challenging work marketplace. Revenue was $2.4 billion, non-GAAP diluted EPS was $5.74 and GAAP diluted EPS was $5.41, with all three coming in at the upper end of the guided ranges. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.4%, 40 basis points above the guidance range due to benefits from a richer product mix and better service cost performance than model. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $534 million, in line with guidance. Total non-GAAP operating expenses comprised $311 million of R&D and $223 million in SG&A. Non-GAAP operating margin was 40.2%, non-GAAP other income and expense debt was $47 million, and the quarterly effective tax rate was 14%. At the guided tax rate of 13.5%, non-GAAP EPS would have been $0.03 higher or $5.77. Quarterly non-GAAP net income was $786 million. GAAP net income was $741 million. Cash flow from operations was $884 million, and free cash flow was $816 million. As a result, free cash flow conversion was a strong 104% and free cash flow margin was 34%. The company had approximately 137 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. The breakdown of revenue by reportable segments and end markets and major products and regions can be found within the shareholder letter and slides. Turning to the balance sheet. KLA ended the quarter with $3.35 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, debt principal outstanding of $5.95 billion and a flexible and attractive bond maturity profile supported by strong investment-grade ratings from all three agencies. KLA has an impressive history of consistent free cash flow generation, high free cash flow conversion and strong free cash flow margins across all phases of the business cycle and economic conditions. Over the last 12 months, KLA has returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including $1.7 billion in share repurchases and $726 million in dividends paid. I also wanted to highlight that on September 5, KLA announced an increase in the quarterly dividend level to $1.45 per share from $1.30, the 14th consecutive annual dividend increase. Since its inception in 2006, KLA has grown the quarterly dividend level and approximately 15% compound annual growth rate. Additionally, on that date, KLA announced an incremental $2 billion share repurchase authorization. These capital return actions reflect confidence in our business model and growth strategy as we progress along the path to our 2026 financial targets. Moving to our outlook. As we review the market and assess relative performance of our peers across the industry, we are adjusting our wafer fab equipment outlook for 2023 up to approximately $80 billion, reflecting a decline of approximately 16% from the $95 billion level in calendar 2022. While the timing of a meaningful resumption in WFE investment growth remains unclear as most underlying end markets remain soft, we continue to see KLA's overall demand stabilizing around current business levels, and we expect this demand profile to continue into the first half of calendar 2021. KLA's primary value proposition is focused on enabling innovation through technology advancements and transitions, which our customers continue to prioritize across all business environments. While capacity plans are often adjusted due to changing demand expectations, technology road map investments are more resilient. This adds additional confidence to our business expectations as customers align shipment slots with road map requirements. In this environment, we will continue to focus on meeting customer requirements, maintaining our high level of investment in R&D to advance our product road maps and KLA's market leadership and delivering strong relative revenue growth and financial performance. As for guidance, our December quarter guidance is as follows. Total revenue is expected to be $2.45 billion, plus or minus $125 million, foundry logic is forecasted to be approximately 68%, and memory is expected to be around 32% of semiconductor process control systems revenue to semiconductor customers. Within memory, DRAM is expected to be about 85% of the segment mix and NAND 15%. We forecast non-GAAP gross margin to be 61.5% plus or minus 1 percentage point, as product mix expectations are modestly weaker versus the September quarter and service period cost benefit realized in the September quarter normalizes. Inclusive of this guidance, calendar 2023 gross margins are expected to end up in the mid-61% range. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $540 million. Other model assumptions for the December quarter include non-GAAP other income and expense net of approximately $45 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 13.5%. Finally, GAAP diluted EPS was expected to be $5.54, plus or minus $0.60 and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.86 plus or minus $0.60. EPS guidance is based on a fully diluted share count of approximately 136 million shares. In conclusion, we remain focused on driving differentiation through innovation as we execute our successful portfolio strategy that supports our customers' technology road maps. Though the industry is correcting in calendar 2023 and sustainable demand recovery still remains unclear, we are sized in our business to ensure that we deliver a differentiated product portfolio that meets our customer technology road map requirements and that we have the capacity to execute our business in line with our long-term growth expectations. With the KLA operating model guiding our best-in-class execution, we continue to implement our strategic objectives, which are here to drive outperformance. Our focus on customer success, delivering innovative and differentiated solutions and operational excellence is what enables us to deliver industry-leading financial and free cash flow performance and return capital on a consistent basis. We are confident that process controls importance to enabling technology advancements bodes well for KLA's long-term growth outlook despite challenging near-term demand trends. KLA is well-positioned to deliver strong near-term relative financial performance driven by the better than market performance of our semiconductor process control and specialty semiconductor businesses and continued growth in service. KLA is also uniquely exposed to wafer and reticle infrastructure investments that are contributing to our relative outperformance in calendar 2023. Our business continues to stabilize and the long-term secular trends driving semiconductor industry demand and investments in WFE remain intact and are compelling. That concludes our prepared remarks. Kevin, let's begin the Q&A.\nKevin Kessel: Thanks, Bren. Chelsea, if you could please provide the instructions to queue for Q&A, and we'll begin now.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to revisit your suggestion that first half could be stable at this - the December quarter levels. So does it mean you're not expecting any change to your China shipment? Or if you could just give us how you are thinking about the mix in different end markets and geos. And then part B of that is, what assumptions are you making about the timing of memory recovery? Is that still second half awaited and can it be incremental to this conceptual first half outlook?\nBren Higgins: Hi, Vivek, it's Bren. So we are - I'm not going to guide the first half of the year in terms of what regions or customers might be driving. As we look at the overall sales funnel and look how we're sizing the factories, our stabilization comment is at the total company level, we see the business roughly operating at about the guided levels here over the next few quarters. So we'll see how it plays out. Obviously, it's a fluid and dynamic environment. I think we'll see the semi PC business be very consistent with that. We'll see the parts of EPC tend to be a little more capacity and shorter lead time type businesses. So we'll have to see how that plays through. But as we aggregate and just as we look out, trying to give you as much as we can into the first half, we see the business bouncing along at roughly these levels.\nVivek Arya: And anything on the potential recovery in memory, like if, let's say, memory were to be recovering in Q1, Q2, Q3, is that visibility you would necessarily have? Or if I ask it in a different way, what is kind of the difference between when you start to see it and when it actually starts to show up in your sales numbers?\nRick Wallace: Vivek, Rick here. When we talk to customers and we have had several conversations with memory customers recently. They've all kind of echoed the same thing in terms of historical lows right now in the market and utilization continue to be less than what they're hoping for, although stabilized. So we don't have any indication of any near-term change in that. And they will certainly let us know because we do have long lead items. So there are some products where we're still shipping based on the fact that they're for R&D work. But in terms of capacity increases, we have no indication of any near-term changes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On your services business, close to 25% of your sales, you'll be driving high single-digit percentage growth this year, and that's with customer production activity at an all-time low. But in your shareholder letter, you guys say that you expect growth in services to accelerate to your target range of 12% to 14% next year. I know you've got to waive those tools and systems coming off of warranty and on to contract. This would be a big driver. But what else are you guys assuming on the strong growth outlook for next year? And what are your assumptions for industry manufacturing utilization?\nBren Higgins: Yes, Harlan. So there have been drivers or long-term drivers around service growth that are implicit in our modeling and are continuing, right, in terms of the - the level of utilization of the installed base customers using tools for longer periods of time and so on. You did hit on the biggest driver in terms of our expectations for growth into next year is that we will have a number of tools that we shipped in 2021 and 2022, where we significantly outperformed the market. Those tools will be coming off of warranty and moving into contract and our attach rate is pretty high. So it does give us some visibility into that service stream. As you know, our contract percent of the total revenue of service is over 75%. And so that visibility allows us to not only be able to plan for, but also to optimize the cost structure that's underneath it in terms of how we deliver to our customers.\nRick Wallace: Yes. One other thing, Harlan, is that, as you know, our services isn't dependent on consumables. And so customers want to keep these tools up and going even when they have slower utilization in other parts of the fab, but then they definitely want to ramp them as they're bringing on new nodes and starting to ramp new technology. So it's kind of the best of all worlds in the sense we don't slowdown that much when it goes down, but then they're going to want to ramp as activity continues, whether it's on new technology or beginning capacity ramps on new technology nodes.\nBren Higgins: I think the final thing I'll say about it is Rick talked about memory utilization. If you look in foundry utilizations today, we are seeing some improving utilization to the leading edge and the legacy utilizations have - depending on where you're at and kind of the N-1 is a little bit softer, more mature nodes, it's a little firmer. So, utilization rates are stabilizing and increasing in certain parts of our business. And so that's an indicator for us as we look forward into 2024 in terms of additional growth for our service business.\nHarlan Sur: No. Great. That's hugely insightful. Thank you. Given the strong lineup and aggressive cadence of tech transitions, right, especially in foundry and logic and that's obviously driving more EUV layer adoption, right, which is driving demand for both your optical inspectors, vertical inspection, your entire portfolio of metrology products as well. If we look into next year with more tech inflections, to gate all around introduction of backside power distribution, next-gen advanced packaging architecture, is that wave of new tools, systems adoptions to support these transitions. Is that still in front of the KLA team? Or are you actually starting to see quite a bit of that now?\nRick Wallace: Well, so it's good insight, Harlan. I think there's two ways to think about it. One is we're definitely seeing R&D development around that, and we have for some time, but many customers have stalled their expansion and delayed. And as you know, there's been quite a lull in especially the leading-edge companies out there in terms of really much CapEx at all as it goes towards new technology expansion, but that's coming. And when that comes, we can map out layer accounts. We know we have a pretty good sense of deployment once it goes on the run card for these ramping up new nodes. And it's both on films. It covers both metrology, but also it covers inspection. And so I'd say it's in front of us as we get into calendar 2024 and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJoe Quatrochi: Yes, thanks for taking the question. First is for Bren, I know it will come out in the queue, but can you help us with the RPO where that was exiting the quarter?\nBren Higgins: It came down a little over $500 million quarter-to-quarter. So, you'll get the specifics in the 10-Q, which we'll be filing here in the next few days, but somewhere just north of $500 million. So, still pretty high levels, north of $10 billion overall, but did come down a little bit quarter-to-quarter.\nJoe Quatrochi: Okay, that's helpful. And then just in that kind of context, how do we think about the optical inspection lead-times? I think you mentioned that the demand remains stronger than supply, your ability to supply but how do we think about that looking into this first half of 2024? Do you expect that you'll start to see maybe some of that alleviate in the first part of next year as we get into more demand into the second half?\nBren Higgins: Because we've got some new supply coming on related to some extremely long lead-time parts, I would expect that we'll ship more in 2024 than we have in 2023. And so we still have a fair amount of imbalance here between where our customer demand is and our ability to supply. But there is some catch-up that's happening there. But those lead-times are still pretty long. The rest of the company somewhere around various across different products, more capacity-centric products. Lead-times are very normal today and around some of the unique products that are critical in terms of industry requirements, those are still a little bit longer.\nJoe Quatrochi: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nChris Caso: Yes, thank you. Good evening. I wonder if you can speak a bit about the China business right now. A little more color on the strength that you're seeing and you obviously heard this from your peers as well. And I think the investor questions right now are about the sustainability of the China revenue at these areas. I wonder if you could address that?\nRick Wallace: Yes, absolutely. So a couple of thoughts for KLA in particular relative to China. Because of the actions that were taken most of the investment, nearly all of the investment that all of that we're exposed to is on legacy nodes. And there's both mostly that's to support the industries that are in China where they want self-sufficiency such as EV, and you have a lot of projects going on that require basically greenfield. So you have a fair amount of inspection measurement across the board. But beyond that, there's infrastructure investment also going on in China relative to the legacy nodes, both now shop and also wafer manufacturing. Those projects, I think, are going to continue for some period of time. So what we don't see is any - I think the leading edge stuff has already been taken out and they stopped that and of course, for a lot of reasons. But the legacy continues and it's pretty broad-based. And we don't believe that's going to change in terms of the size or intent of those, and those are things that are projects that are in various stages as they continue to build. So we feel pretty good about the sustainability of the business as we see it right now in China. And Bren can give more specifics.\nBren Higgins: In the near term, in the September quarter, we saw the level as more elevated than what I'd call a run rate as we had other customers that were moving around in terms of deliveries. And so we were able to - so we backfilled that with some of this demand in China. So it did push up a little bit. I would expect it would drop somewhat in Q4, but certainly remain at elevated levels. And it's certainly something that has strengthened over the course of the year, consistent with Rick's commentary. So as we look at next year, we've got meaningful backlog with these customers, I've got a - in excess of 800 million in deposits for shipments for these customers. So I would expect that we'll see some sustainability of that demand as we move into next year. And I think it's really across the segments that Rick talked about. So as I think about growth into next year in that part of the business, I think from a baseline point of view, we see it's more or less flat. You have greenfield projects as you have construction dynamics that are influencing some timing issues. But in general, I would expect it to continue more or less at that level over a broader period of time. A lot of these orders we booked over the last couple of years and frankly, in the expansion period of 2021 and 2022, are more strategic and larger customers consume the bulk of our slots - so as we've seen some slowdown over the course of 2023, that's created a lot of availability for these shipments and these customers are performing in line with the commitments that they make.\nChris Caso: That’s very helpful. Thank you. Just as a follow-on to some of the other things you said with - as you're starting to fill some of those orders for, say, some of those Chinese customers that were you weren't able to fulfill because of some of the shortages before, what effect has that had on the backlog? And is your backlog visibility going out in time about the same as it was last quarter, a quarter before? Or is that backlog visibility is starting to shrink as you catch up on some of those orders that you weren't able to fulfill before?\nBren Higgins: I would say with new business coming into backlog, but it's not changing all that much.\nChris Caso: Right. So about the same.\nBren Higgins: I'd say, it's about the same. Visibility is pretty consistent. Like I said, construction issues would be probably the bigger factor of whether projects would push or not. In a lot of cases, these are our new customers that are getting established. And so aren't necessarily exposed to some of the economic sort of supply/demand drivers that would affect more established customers. Now, there are those kinds of customers also, and we're seeing normal behavior from them in terms of how they're balancing their capacity given their customer demand.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open.\nAtif Malik: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Bren, in the past, you have talked about the China domestic spending as one-third memory makers, one-third kind of mature foundries, and one-third as a new entrant the market? And my question is like you're talking about China to drop somewhat in Q4, which segment of the China market you're seeing the drop off in Q4?\nBren Higgins: Yes. I'm not - I don't have that detail here. There's another piece of that that's also related to the infrastructure investment that Rick talked about, the wafer infrastructure and reticle infrastructure. So, there's also a component of investment that's happening there. I don't - I'm not - we guide at the company level customer-specific activity, I'm not going to get into that.\nAtif Malik: Got it. And then Rick, I have a question on gate all around. Historically, you guys have benefited when the transistor move to FinFET architecture. And as we start to see initial orders on data around for some of the deposition companies. Can you talk about what that data around opportunity means for both infection and metrology for KLA?\nRick Wallace: Yes, great question. It means a couple of things. One, obviously, KLA has been in development for a while. So, we had start in terms of some of the architectures that we need to modify to support it. Specifically, we're leveraging Gen 4 technology instead of Gen 5 because of the nature of the contrast, ability of Gen 4 to see the defects that are relevant to get all around architecture. We've made those investments and seen those results, and that's been one where we've leveraged existing technology but also leverage the work we talked about with AI, to provide capability. So, we're well-prepared for that when it comes to the inspection challenges associated. Metrology, big opportunities there because you're looking both for increased level of precision when it comes to the actual measurement, larger sample size because of the concerns about consistency across the wafers and across wafer and wafer and also some of the specifics around the high K metal gate control that people are looking for. So, more capability. Again, we had a head start because as you know, that technology has been in development. So, we've worked with development partners on that. So, well-positioned to be able to support that as it expands. So, it's going to help both process control intensity when it comes to both inspection and with metrology, and we're well positioned to support our customers to do that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thank you. I want to ask about the DRAM strength that you guys are seeing. It seems like that was the main source of revenue upside in the quarter, and it looks to be - based on your comments, down slightly in the next quarter, in calendar Q4, how much of that strength is coming from shipping to the DRAM customers in China that you alluded to in the past? And how much of that is tied to advanced DRAM technology, high bandwidth memory and whatnot. And when you look at Q4, which part of that segment is going to come down?\nBren Higgins: Yes. So when I look at the details, certainly, the shipments into China, which were expected were a driver from the baseline. As I look at the December quarter, in DRAM, I think you'll see a little bit of a mix across customers, but I don't think the number really - the absolute number doesn't really come down all that much. So, most of the investment is in that area or it's in the area that you alluded to, right, in terms of supporting some of the AI demand that's out there. But - and then maybe just general R&D investment that's happening. So it's a pretty low level overall and the bulk of it coming from some catch-up related to the China customer that we referred to.\nRick Wallace: One other area, we are seeing some when it comes to the interposer in terms of packaging-related base fee. So that is also a driver, smaller at this point, but the growth projections are good. Remember, as DRAM is going to leverage EUV as the investment resumes, that's going to be a great opportunity for us to continue to penetrate when it comes to the R&D, but that's not what's driving it right now.\nSidney Ho: Okay. Great. And maybe a follow-up for me. If you look at the SPC systems revenue, it looks like it's going to be down 5% to 7% in calendar '23. I think a quarter ago, that number was like down 10% to 12%. Can you talk about what has changed? Is it just that the WFE market has improved somewhat? Or are there other KLA specific reasons that you will point out. But more importantly, how do you think that outperformance will do next year considering some of the areas that you are strong in this year may see some moderation? Thanks.\nRick Wallace: I'm sorry, for EPC or would that was SPTS.\nSidney Ho: Yes, for FCC?\nRick Wallace: Okay. Got it. Look, we had some strength - we continue to have strength, kind of the same things we talked about strength in optical. I think the process control intensity hasn't slowed across our customers, and we continue to see wafer being strong. We talked about macro being strong. So it's really across the portfolio of leading edge. The thing that's falling off the most when it comes to capacity has been the product areas that are most linked to wafer starts and those would be things like overlay and films. But when it comes to the technology inspection, continued strength there.\nBren Higgins: Yes. And I think the infrastructure parts of the business as well. We've seen that hold up fairly well, both in China, as we talked about in terms of doing mature, we're building capability to not only provide wafers, but also to do mature reticle sets for all the design activity that is happening. So you've got that. But then on the wafer side, you also have investments that are happening globally as those customers prepare for not only as capacity comes out fairly slowly in that industry, preparing for the resumption in demand that we're expecting here in the near future, but also different strategies around inventory stocking, more wafer-to-wafer bonding other demand for wafers. So that's also been a driver that we've seen hold together fairly well as we this year. Process control intensity is helping in I've been pretty open with it over the course of the last year that despite some catch-up that might happen with some peers related to challenges in 2022 with supply, we felt pretty good about our positioning and our exposure to some of the fastest-growing markets overall. The mix of business that's more logic, foundry-centric and this infrastructure exposure that I referred to.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Rick or Bren, I'm curious, you mentioned like the demand profile stays in the first half of next year. But some of your peers are called calendar 2024 like a transition year. And how do I overlay the fact that memory could rebound in the back half of next year, how to think about these industry WFE or KLA revenue profile next year?\nRick Wallace: So I'll take part of it and Bren can answer. We don't know what 2024 is going to look like. We just don't know. And we know what our customers are saying right now. But they don't really know yet either. So we're talking about a sustained level of business kind of being similar to what it is right now until we have a reason to believe it's going to go up. Customers talk about things improving. We have meetings and they talk about asking us to get ready. But until we actually see it happening, we don't really know. So it's very hard to talk about the levels. What we do know is you have historically low levels of investment company right now in memory, and we see the same thing as you do in terms of pricing. And then we're well positioned for ramping when it does ramp. We also know we have some very good indications on some of our long-term product that - our products that have long lead times. But as Bren said, like an optical inspection or capacity constrained, not demand constrained on those. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. We don't really have any unique visibility into 2024 than those general trends and the fact that utilization seems to have stabilized and is increasing on some of our market segments, but not much visibility beyond that.\nBren Higgins: Yes. Look, I made the comment about utilization rates, and I think that's encouraging in terms of the stabilizing environment that we're articulating here. That's certainly a factor. We, of course, we watch our customers business models, their profitability, their cash flows that will, okay, you're seeing the industry digest the capacity that was added and then get sort of healthy again and see pricing and all those things improve. But then one of the catalysts that are going to drive growth into next year. In our near-term, as we said in the prepared comments, we see roughly this level of business as we move through the first half of the year. One of the things that we really focus on is we've got to make sure that we're flexible enough to be able to respond. And so we've made a lot of investments over the last few years in our supply chain and our own capacity to make sure that we have the flexibility to respond, because I would expect that we could get surprised. We usually do. And so we want to make sure that we're in a position that we're not we're not constrained in our ability to supply and meet that when it happens. So that's our focus. And I think the color we provided in terms of how to think about the company and how we're sizing the company in the near-term is reflected in KLA.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thanks, Rick and Bren. And then a quick follow-up. As you said, has seen the recent export control work has no material impact to your outlook?\nBren Higgins: And so we're looking at that and working our way through it. It's quite complex. But preliminary estimates based on the, I'll call it, the baseline that was established in October of last year. Right now, we don't see any real material change to our business expectations related to those new regulations. But we're working our way through it, it's complex.\nOperator: Next, we'll have Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Bren, everyone's asking about 2024 WFE, but I guess I'm still a little confused as to what the right baseline is for this year because pretty much everyone has now guided for Q4. So if I take you plus applied plus Lam, yes, it's down 13%. So that would mean that your $80 billion number might be in the ballpark off of that mid-90s last year. But if I include ASML, it's like flat. I mean even if you exclude the fast shipments, it's fairly down. So how is WFE down this year? I guess I'm just trying to get some understanding of like how you get to that $80 billion number. Is it excluding ASML somehow? Thanks.\nBren Higgins: Yes, Tim, we're not experts on this. What we do is we take a look at what - we look at the universe of peer companies and how they report. If you look at what our customers say, we have some modeling that we do. And we come up with an estimate for that. So this year is a little hard because of fast shipments, and I don't even really understand all the nuances in that and that's for you guys to figure out. But also some of the issues that affected some of the other providers in late 2022 in terms of their ability or inability to deliver in 2022 and how that shows up in 2023. But when we look at how we're performing overall, we think that it's in and around that low. Certainly, the fact that we're down given our - our belief about our market position. And if you look at Semi PC based on the guidance we provided being somewhere around down, we'll call it, 9%, 10%, somewhere in that ballpark. It doesn't feel flat to me.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. All right, Bren. And then I guess my second question is on inventory. It's now up to almost 300 days. It's up like $500 million over the past six months, but we're not really sure when WFE picks up inside of next year. I get that you still have this huge $10.8 billion worth of PO that you're kind of working off. But why is this stuff parked so far out in the future? Is it - and if so, why hold the inventory now? What's the bottleneck? Is there something on your side still that's a bottleneck? Or is it more that the orders have been placed and maybe waiting for the fab to be ready to take the equipment and that's why you're building up the inventory. I guess I'm just not sure why you would build the inventory if this stuff is still parked so far in the future. Thanks.\nBren Higgins: Yes, Tim, it's a great question. It's a little bit of the trade-off that we make, and I spent a lot of time talking about how we were able to outperform the industry for a couple of years in a row in terms of some of the supply chain challenges that others were facing that we weren't. Part of it has to do with how we manage our suppliers. We do have a lot of long lead time parts and so if you just go back to, we'll call it, 15 months ago, we thought 2023 was going to be a growth year on top of what we thought was going to be $100 billion year in 2022. So we had made commitments. We were putting commitments out longer to get our suppliers to invest. We've invested in them in terms of partnering on their capacity expansions. We manage our - so I place those commitments to suppliers, we've been able to manage what we can, but in a lot of cases, we honor our commitments. And we feel that in the long run, we're in a good position in terms of the longevity of our platforms and where we expect demand to come from that will consume those parts. So some of it is what you're optimizing for in terms of our differentiation in terms of how we work with our supply chain, and we're accepting that we're going to be pretty good customers. We're going to move up to our commitments and take the parts that we've committed to. So we feel pretty good in the long run about our positioning in terms of our ability to grow when we see a reacceleration from the industry. And the other issue is that our service business continues to grow, right? It grows every year, and that growth drives a fair amount of demand in service. It's a high complexity high mix, low-volume business. And because of the customization of the parts, we tend to have to do end-of-life buys and have to buy a lot of parts to support that business. When you look at our margin profile overall for the company, feel like the trade-offs we're making are appropriate. And we think it's played a big role in our relative success.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Charles Shi with Needham. Your line is open.\nCharles Shi: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This morning, I think one of your smaller peers in Europe, they talked about seeing some weakening of the mature in foundry, logic side I wonder if KLA is seeing something similar. I mean either through your process control business or the PC business? If not, why is that? And I have a second question. Thank you.\nBren Higgins: Not really. Look, we're watching for certain parts of, I'll call non-China legacy exposure to automotive, industrial, some of those markets to see if that has an effect on customer demand. But right now, our expectations around legacy in the near term has been fairly consistent.\nCharles Shi: Got it. So Bren, maybe a question on OpEx. Both of your peers in the bay area, they are raising their OpEx for basically the next calendar year. How should we think about KLA's OpEx going into next year, say, you talked about you're expecting revenue to be run rating at the current level? Should we be thinking OpEx is kind of flat until you see the uptick in the revenue? I mean, before you really raise the OpEx. Thanks.\nBren Higgins: Run rating at the current level does give you a little bit of growth into next year. And as I said, we would expect to see growth in service. I actually think EPC probably has some modest improvement off of pretty depressed levels our incremental operating margin model drives how we're running the business in terms of expectations for leverage on incremental revenue. So I would expect to see a modest uptick in OpEx. We're also balancing sort of near term in terms of how we're sizing for the current environment, but also our long-term investment, requirements. And given our market position and our desire to go to market with the portfolio that we think is a competitive advantage for KLA does drive some requirements for investment. And we'll do that independent of top line when appropriate. But as we're looking out going forward, I would say that we'll probably see OpEx tick up a little bit as we move through 2024, but not a big change more in line with general kind of post living type adjustments overall.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. You talked about maybe a little bit of weakness at the cutting edge of foundry/logic. Wonder if you could talk about that. And then I guess, just contextually, if we're in an environment where there's very aggressive investment in gate all around and backside power, but they're sort of limited wafer requirements in year one for those technologies. I would think that helps KLA in terms of percentage of WFE, but can you just walk us through how much of your - how much money will they spend on the development of those processes versus the expansion of wafer that capability there?\nRick Wallace: Well, so we still - we do get investment at the front end, but for more for development, but the ramp phase is really where you see - that's where you see more of it. So you get it at the front when they're doing development and then this starts to ramp to get more. And we get less incrementally across the portfolio as you in high volume. So yes, it would help us in terms of intensity around those new nodes, but often, those companies are also expanding the trailing nodes at a similar time, more or tooth generation. So on balance, it doesn't look that different overall as most of these companies ramp up at if that makes sense. So you get it at the front end, but the rest of the - so you look at process control intensity, it doesn't really change that much in foundry/logic year-to-year because they're investing across multiple parts. The biggest change has come from the mix of foundry/logic to memory. And memory is increasing some. So yes, there are more layers, there's more investment going on, but it's still balanced by they're going to ramp. We hope not just the R&D, but they're going to be ramping in terms of across the board. That's how we get to the model that we is based on process control intensity, inching up over time as processes just get more challenging.\nBren Higgins: Yes. The road map schedules have held pretty well together. What we've seen is customers adjusting some of the capacity plans. So as you look at 2024, you're more likely to see, for example, more N3, you're going to see N2 activity and we'll start to see some of that soon. And - but most - the bulk of it will be more at N3. What you likely don't see is you probably won't see a lot of investment from our major customers and some of the more legacy parts of their businesses, where they pull back. But to Rick's point, we're seeing some of it. We'll see that investment as they ramp. We're seeing more investment today in production given the number of designs that are moving through the leading edge nodes and the different process flows is creating opportunities for or - and more challenges for our customers in terms of process control and defectivity challenges across different designs as they test design rules in different ways. So I think we have our normal historic exposure to R&D and to ramp. But over the last few years, we're seeing, particularly with the introduction of EUV and the progressing of scaling we're seeing more adoption in what we call the HVM or the high-volume manufacturing phases.\nJoe Moore: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBlayne Curtis: Thank you to let me take the question. I just wanted to follow back up on the comments you just made on foundry/logic. So it was flat. It seems like China is probably up within that mix, and then you said leading edge is weak. I'm just kind of curious how that changes for December. It seems like the outlook is fairly flat. So is that weakness in leading-edge stabilize, and then any perspective as to where leading edge goes next year?\nBren Higgins: So I feel like where we are today, I think your stabilization comment is the right one. I think we've derisked it and given that we tend to be more of a long lead-time provider. I think we've made a lot of the adjustments that we needed to make already in terms of how we're planning for this year. And as we move into next year, I think if you just sort of aggregate leading-edge activity, we'll see as customers start to provide a little bit more insight. But again, back to the stabilization comment, I don't see it declining from here.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks. I just want to ask on service, in your letter, you talked about getting back to that 12% to 14%. I just want to know, is that assuming any utilization increases? Or is that just purely the tools coming off of their agreement?\nBren Higgins: Yes, it's the latter. I think we're expecting utilization to slowly improve, but the bulk of it will come from new tools coming into contract.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks.\nBren Higgins: I think to expect to start to see overall industry improvement into 2024, the first thing you'll see is utilization start to improve. So we would expect that and then once you see that, and then eventually, utilization gets to a place where customers need new capacity and then those decisions happen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up. As you think about the R&D price, especially you highlighted gate all around at some point, we have to change the narrative to High-NA. And I want to just give an update, how do you see opportunities as it relates to High-NA specifically on the patterning? And I have a follow-up.\nRick Wallace: Well, I mean, what High-NA enables is the continuation of scaling, right? So that's been good news for KLA. You notice process control intensity in general, but more specifically for KLA has gone up as EUV has started to be adopted because now you're scaling - we're not on what was traditionally Moore's Law, but we're seeing scale it. So High-NA means there's going to be more scaling happening, and that's going to be good and specifically good for KLA because it drives the highest performance requirements, which plays to our portfolio strength. So part of what our modeling is when we look - we don't see a lot of High-NA happening in the time line that we laid out for 2026 for our Investor Day, it's after that. But we'll see early stages of it before 2026, and that will drive - continue to provide more opportunity for us to participate in higher process control intensity.\nMehdi Hosseini: Are you implying that Gen 5 could be - the use of Gen 5 could be extended to high-NA for…\nRick Wallace: Absolutely, absolutely. We're still using Gen 4. We're using Gen 4 now, because of the extensions that we made in the platform, not just in terms of wavelength, but adding more processing capability, the leveraging of AI, the use of both Gen 4 and Gen 5, actually Gen 4 will out ship Gen 5 this year, and we'll continue to see that adoption. So, it really is talking about the critical layers and we have more extensions in mind mine in the - on the works that we're doing right now for Gen 5 that will extend it well into the even in the high NA, which is going to come after that. So, we feel very good about our optical product portfolio.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Okay. And then the second follow has to be on China, it seems like for KLA and the peer group, the China mix is getting closer to 50%. Could there be a scenario where opportunities for KLA would actually step up given the fact that many of these customers are new, and they have yield issue. And I understand China is mostly for trading edge, but with new entrants, new players with the higher entrances and improving yield by these new players, have a higher mix of China for KLA relative to the peer group?\nBren Higgins: Well, we have a lot of customers that are subscale, that are trying to develop process capability and demonstrate capability to customers, also invest for viability over time in terms of longer-term node progression. So, in early stages, upscale stages like that, you're going to see a heavier investment in process control. Now, as they continue to put road maps, it might stay there because they never really had a huge meaningful amount of capacity at each node. But you do see higher levels of adoption early on as you're trying to - because if you think about it, you might buy a few process tools here and there, but you need the whole suite of process control. And so that's why we tend to see a little bit more activity there. But I think given the desire to progress along road maps into progress nodes, you're going to see, I think, a continued level of investment overall. But certainly, as you start to mature and if you're running a limited number of designs, process control intensity will hire in production than it used to be, is still lower than it is in what we'll call the ramp phase of a project.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Brian Chin with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrian Chin: Hi there, thanks for sneaking me in. I'll just ask one question then to get us out of here. But - and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I've gotten a sense maybe that given how strong the infrastructure bear wafer and reticle inspection business into China was this year that it could subside a little in the calendar 2024 relative to its strength again this past year. Is that sort of implicit in your outlook in the first half next year? And also, do you think that is proportional in any way to sort of the rate of China fab bill activity that you can maybe observe for next year?\nBren Higgins: Well, I don't think it's - I think the overall wafer infrastructure investment will - that's been faster than WFE growth this year will flatten out as we move into next year. So, there's that starts to slow down. On China specifically, though, I don't see it changing much. I don't think it's going to grow much next year, but I don't see it falling off. And that's across for silicon wafer but also around reticle capability.\nBrian Chin: Okay, great. Thank you.\nKevin Kessel: Thank you, Brian and thank you Chelsea. I just wanted to thank everyone again for their time and turn the call back over to you for any final instructions.\nOperator: This does conclude the KLA Corporation's September quarter 2023 earnings call and webcast.
