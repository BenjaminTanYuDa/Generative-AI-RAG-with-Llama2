A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as how we define these metrics and other metrics is included in our earnings press releases, which are available on our Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Cain: Thank you, Edward, and thank you all for joining us on the call today. I'm delighted to report that we have delivered a strong Q4 with all our key financial metrics exceeding our outlook. Highlights include growing Capella mix, continued big deal activity, including a particularly robust quarter for renewals and expansions, strong new customer logos, and overall excellent operational performance from all teams across the company. Total annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $204.2 million, up 25% year-over-year. Revenue in Q4 was $50.1 million, up 20% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating loss in Q4 was $4.1 million, representing a negative operating margin of 8.2%, 8.6 percentage points above the midpoint of our implied operating margin guidance range. We finished fiscal 2024 with strong momentum, capping off a historic year for Couchbase. We drove strong top-line growth in a challenging macroeconomic environment, including accelerating our net new ARR growth. We achieved important milestones with Capella, which now represents 11% of our ARR and over 25% of our customer base. We worked tirelessly to improve our operational rigor and improve our efficiency across the entire company, which resulted in meaningful operating profit outperformance and substantial operating and free cash flow margin expansion. We enhanced and refined our go-to-market motion across marketing, sales and our partner ecosystems. Our product and engineering teams delivered multiple important enhancements and capabilities across our platform and did so at an accelerated pace. And we welcomed many of you to our first Analyst Day as a public company just this last December in New York. I couldn't be more proud of the progress we made across all of our key strategic initiatives: deliver top-line growth, increase the mix at Capella, drive sales and marketing efficiency, and accelerate the pace of leverage in our model. Now, let me discuss some highlights of the quarter and the year. I'll start by reviewing the many innovations we have announced over the past few months. These have contributed to the inflection point we're seeing with Capella and will be instrumental in unlocking future growth and leverage opportunities. From day one, we've architected our platform to enable demanding applications to not only deliver premium performance, but also provide rich, hyper-personalized, differentiated experiences for end users. Because of our differentiated architecture, our multipurpose platform converges operational and analytical capabilities and seamlessly integrates advanced services like indexing, eventing, full text search and more in a single solution. This approach is why Couchbase can uniquely power adaptive applications for customers. We've built a strong foundation with differentiation we can sustain. And now, we've taken that foundation and have layered on new features and capabilities that we have recently announced that position us well for how adaptive applications are evolving with AI. First, we increased developer productivity by introducing the Capella iQ copilot into our database as a service. iQ allows developers to interact with Capella using natural language conversation, making database interactions more intuitive, efficient and accessible for developers. They can go from an idea to code in just a few clicks. Next, we further extended our platform capabilities by announcing a columnar service for Capella, which converges operational and real-time analytic workloads into a single platform. Customers can ingest data from anywhere into Capella in real time, reducing complexity and costs while increasing developer productivity. Initial feedback from the private preview has been exceptional and we are excited about what this key new service will unlock. Finally, as you may have seen last week, we announced vector search as a new feature in our platform, optimized for running on-site, across clouds and devices at the edge, including mobile and IoT. While vector database point solutions aim to solve the challenges of processing and storing data for LLMs, having multiple standalone solutions adds complexity to the enterprise IT stack and flows application performance. Our multipurpose capabilities eliminate that friction and deliver a simplified and unified architecture to improve the accuracy of LLM results. We also make it easier and faster for developers to build applications by using a single SQL++ query, which incorporates vector index, removing the need to use multiple indexes or products. And we are the first vendor to announce vector search at the edge, enabling organizations to run AI applications anywhere in connected or disconnected modes. I'm also pleased to announce that we are extending our AI partner ecosystem with LangChain and LlamaIndex integrations, enabling a common API interface to converse with a broad library of LLMs, while providing developers with choices for LLMs. Taken together, we're embracing the opportunity to enable hyper-personalized, high-performing and adaptive applications powered by AI that deliver exceptional experiences to their end users. Customers are responding very positively to how our approach is aligned to their AI-powered adaptive application journey. As you can see, we've achieved a lot in a short amount of time on both product innovation and customer uptake, and it's gratifying to see our efforts bearing fruit. As our Capella base continues to grow, we're seeing favorable consumption dynamics emerge as both existing and new customers realize our platform's unique performance and scale. We're seeing increased consumption across our customer base, which is indicative not only of the value we bring, but also gives us confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable growth. As such, we are committed to taking advantage of this recent inflection we've seen. We fully expect Capella to become an increasingly meaning driver behind ARR and net retention, as well as an important engine for new logo acquisition. And it will contribute to leverage across our entire business. Now, I'd like to turn to customer wins. In Q4, we saw new Capella wins across many industries, including manufacturing, media, fintech, technology, retail and telco. Array is a financial innovation platform that helps digital brands, financial institutions and fintechs get compelling consumer products to market faster. Array's offerings helps its partners drive revenue, increase engagement and empower millions of consumers to achieve their financial goals. This quarter, Array selected Capella to support profile management for its privacy application because of the compelling value and impressive database performance. In Q4, a leading cloud communications provider expanded its investment in Capella to continue supporting its real-time communications platform. This platform connects widely used applications to carriers worldwide with all conversations being managed and recorded with our cloud database platform. This customer initially began migrating to Capella because of the scalability and benefits that a fully-managed service provided to its developer team. They gain the ability to step away from database management and focus on developing core business applications. Another Capella expansion from the quarter came from a premier provider of life insurance in the Asia Pacific region. Couchbase powers Customer 360 data for this provider's many millions of customers. The customer decided to expand its investment in Capella on Google Cloud for cost optimization and to continue modernizing their architecture and database management in the cloud. Of note, this was our first multimillion-dollar Capella migration. We also continue to see robust large deal activity with the strong foundation of our enterprise server. A new enterprise logo for us this quarter came from a multinational financial services company and one of Europe's leading banks, BBVA. They selected Couchbase to replace another NoSQL database at a worldwide level because of the price performance our platform offered and they will be using Couchbase to power profile management for its entire customer base. Finally, as I previously mentioned, we saw robust renewal and expansion activity in the quarter with some of our largest customers. This includes a Fortune 500 shipping and logistics company, which saw the largest expansion in our history, and a major multinational technology company that provides software solutions for the global travel and tourism industry. Both customers rely on Couchbase for multiple applications and deployment modalities, and we're honored to continued their journey with them. As we look ahead towards fiscal 2025, we have a massive opportunity in front of us. Our foundation rests upon a carefully-architected platform purpose built to enable mission critical adaptive applications that are often being deployed at the edge in an increasingly AI-powered world. I strongly believe that our foundational tenets of scale, performance and flexibility have never been more relevant as we continue to leverage our core innovations while adding new ones. These include our new real-time analytic and vector search capabilities, both of which together have the potential to make a meaningful impact to our business. Our priorities going forward are to continue to drive sustained growth, capitalize on the inflection we're seeing across the business and accelerate the pace of leverage in our model. If I were to emphasize one of these priorities, it's the forthcoming leverage that I see building across all aspects of our business. This spans from how we innovate and deliver new capabilities and services to how we go to market, growing our outstanding customers, while also acquiring new ones to driving more efficiency in our P&L and model. Having held our annual kickoff last month, I can say confidently that we have a strong, motivated and highly aligned team in place to achieve our ambitions in fiscal 2025. At Couchbase, we're inspired by the generational opportunity that is in front of us and in being a trusted advisor for our customers, partners and the broader industry. It's an honor to be a strategic technology provider to so many organizations that are changing the way we interact through their modern applications. We have work to do and it won't be easy. But at Couchbase, we pride ourselves on attacking hard problems driven by customer outcomes. With that, I'll hand the call over to Greg to walk you through our results in more detail. Greg?\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Matt, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. We finished fiscal 2024 with another strong quarter as we beat guidance across all key metrics. We are pleased with our execution, our dedication to delivering value to our customers and our ability to navigate the environment while driving very strong outperformance in our operating loss guidance. I'll now walk you through our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 financial results in more detail. Total annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $204.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter, representing 25% growth year-over-year and 8% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Capella contribution as well as our core enterprise business. At the end of the quarter, Capella ARR was $21.8 million, representing 11% of our total ARR. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $50.1 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, and $180 million for the full year, an increase of 16% year-over-year. Revenue growth benefited from growing consumption of Capella and strength in our enterprise business, partially offset by declines in professional services. Subscription revenue for the fourth quarter was $48.1 million, an increase of 26% year-over-year and 9% sequentially, and $171.6 million for the full year, an increase of 20% year-over-year. Professional services revenue for the fourth quarter was $2 million, a decline of 42% year-over-year and an increase of 12% sequentially, and $8.5 million for the full year, a decline of 29% year-over-year. As a reminder, this was consistent with our expectations following outsized strength in professional services in fiscal 2023. We expect professional services to normalize at current levels in fiscal 2025. Our ARR per customer performance in the fourth quarter was $273,000, up from $264,000 in the third quarter, up 12% year-over-year, an indicative of the growing wallet share we have with large customers. As a reminder, as our Capella mix continues to grow in contribution, we expect ARR per customer growth could moderate or decline in future quarters. Our dollar-based net retention rate, or NRR, continues to exceed 115%, driven by strong renewal and upsell activity across our base of larger enterprise customers. Our NRR has been steadily improving, thanks to Capella. We exited the year with 749 customers, an increase of 34 net new customers from the third quarter. Capella once again represented the majority of new logos in the quarter, and we grew our Capella customer logo count by 41, over 25% from the third quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the strength of our new logo pipeline and remain confident in our ability to reliably expand logos as evidenced by our consistent ARR growth and our strong retention metrics. In discussing the remainder of the income statement, please note that unless otherwise stated, all references to our expenses, results of operations and share count are on a non-GAAP basis. In Q4, our gross margin was 90.4%, benefiting from sustained enterprise gross profit margin strength, lower services revenue mix, the completion of the amortization from some of our initial Capella investments and leverage as a result of our expanding Capella revenue base, offset by growing Capella mix, which carries lower gross margins. This compares to a gross margin of 86.3% a year ago and 89.5% last quarter. For the full fiscal year, our gross margin was 88.5% compared to 87.6% in fiscal 2023. As a reminder, as Capella mix increases, we expect gross margin will decline in fiscal 2025. Turning to expenses. We continue to invest to capture the generational opportunity we see in front of us, but are focused on driving leverage across our business. We are pleased with our execution on this front as our expense discipline and benefits from our cost savings initiatives resulted in us again outperforming our operating loss outlook. Our sales and marketing expenses for Q4 were $29.4 million or 59% of revenue compared to $26.7 million or 64% of revenue a year ago. For the full fiscal year, our sales and marketing expenses were $113.6 million or 63% of revenue compared to $101.3 million or 65% of revenue in the prior fiscal year. Research and development expenses for Q4 were $12.9 million or 26% of revenue compared to $12.9 million or 31% of revenue a year ago. For the full fiscal year, our research and development expenses were $50.5 million or 28% of revenue compared to $49.7 million or 32% of revenue in the prior fiscal year. General and administrative expenses for Q4 were $7.1 million or 14% of total revenue compared to $6.3 million or 15% of revenue a year ago. For the full fiscal year, our general and administrative expenses were $26.5 million or 15% of revenue compared to $25.9 million or 17% of revenue in the prior fiscal year. Operating loss for Q4 was $4.1 million or negative 8% operating margin compared to an operating loss of $9.9 million or negative 24% operating margin a year ago. Operating loss for the full fiscal year was $31.3 million or negative 17% operating margin compared to an operating loss of $41.3 million or negative 27% operating margin in the prior fiscal year. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for Q4 was $2.9 million or negative $0.06 per share. For the full fiscal year, net loss was $27 million or negative $0.57 per share. Before I turn to the balance sheet and cash flow statement, I want to mention an impairment charge of $5.2 million that we recognized in Q4. This impairment charge relates to a reprioritization of some R&D resources as we have focused our efforts on Capella, AI capabilities, services and related developments. This has been excluded from, but does not affect our non-GAAP results for the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q4 with $153.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We remain well capitalized to execute against our long-term growth strategy. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, totaled $241.8 million the end of Q4, an increase of 46% year-over-year, driven in part by the timing of robust renewal activity with some of our larger customers, several of which are on multiyear contracts, driving higher average duration than we have seen in recent quarters. We expect to recognize approximately 61% or $147.6 million of total RPO as revenue over the fiscal year 2025, which represents 26% year-over-year growth. As a reminder, we experience fluctuations in our RPO balances due to a host of factors, including renewal time as well as changes in contract duration. Operating cash flow for Q4 was negative $6.5 million, and for the full year was negative $26.9 million. Free cash flow for Q4 was negative $7.7 million or negative 15.4% free cash flow margin. Free cash flow for the full year was negative $31.6 million or negative 17.6% free cash flow margin. Now, I will provide guidance for Q1 and the full year fiscal 2025. As Matt discussed, we entered fiscal 2025 with very strong momentum across our businesses, and our pipeline remains strong. We achieved a critical milestone with Capella and expect it will continue to be an important driver behind all aspects of our business in fiscal 2025. Furthermore, we anticipate that our investment in our product capabilities, partner ecosystem and go-to-market motion will continue to complement our ARR momentum. While we continue to scrutinize our expenses as we remain dedicated to increasing our efficiency, growing our free cash flow and operating margins and driving leverage across the business with continued focus on increasing the Rule of 40 metric, we will continue to invest in our strategic priorities. As such, we expect to grow OpEx slightly faster in fiscal 2025 than in fiscal 2024. We remain committed to achieving positive free cash flow by fiscal 2026 and positive operating income by fiscal 2027, underpinned by 20%-plus compound annual ARR growth, as I discussed last December at Analyst Day. Finally, we remain mindful of the macro headwinds and continue to carefully monitor their impact on our business. As such, our outlook maintains a consistent degree of conservatism to account for the uncertainty as well as lack of visibility into how the macro may impact consumption trends for our emerging as a service offering. With these factors in mind, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect total revenue in the range of $48.1 million to $48.9 million or year-over-year growth of 18% at the midpoint. We anticipate ARR in the range of $206.5 million to $209.5 million, which represents 21% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of negative $8.5 million to negative $7.5 million. For the full year of fiscal 2025, we expect total revenue in the range of $203 million to $207 million or a year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint. As a reminder, we've historically seen variability with respect to the implementation timing of certain enterprise deals and new or migrated Capella customers, which impacts our revenue visibility. We expect this timing dynamic to influence the pace of revenue growth in fiscal 2025, with aforementioned large customer renewals continuing into the first half of fiscal 2025 and causing our revenue seasonality to be slightly more weighted in the first half of the year relative to what we saw in fiscal 2024. As such, we'd expect fiscal Q3 revenue could be flattish from Q2. We, therefore, continue to view ARR as a better indicator than revenue of the strength of our business. We expect full year fiscal 2025 ARR in the range of $235.5 million to $240.5 million or 17% growth at the midpoint. And finally, we expect a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of negative $27.5 million to negative $22.5 million. With that, Matt and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nMatt Hedberg: Great, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a really strong year. And it's really, really good to see the success with Capella and just general buying behavior improvement. I think it feels like it's a lot of hard work that's gone into that, so well done guys. On the strong customer adds this quarter, and I guess most specifically Capella wins, can you talk about sort of both that partner motion as well as sort of the direct effort there? Because I know it's been a lot of work, not only on the product side, but on the go-to-market side. Maybe where you're seeing some of the most success on some of the go-to-market initiatives?\nMatt Cain: Hey, Matt. How are you? Good to speak. Certainly appreciate the acknowledgment on the hard work. We do look at it as a historic year for the company. Look, we've been talking all year on the expectation that Capella is really going to help us on new logo acquisition. We saw great geographic balance in the quarter, continue looking after new logos as well as migrations. But you're right to call out the partner contribution. We've been really focused for some time now on driving robust relationships at a global and local level with the likes of AWS and the other cloud providers. I'd say that was a highlight in the quarter. But it wasn't only AWS. We called out the largest Capella migration we've ever seen with GCP. So, I think when you mentioned that this is a result of a lot of hard work, I'd say there's a lot of diversification to the outcome. And we had high expectations and continue to do so on a lot of fronts with Capella in general and the success with the partnerships.\nMatt Hedberg: Really good to hear that. That's -- it's great. And then maybe just as a follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you talked about vector search. Can you talk about what you expect to see some customer use cases for that? And maybe how you think that might impact monetization or growth rates from a customer perspective?\nMatt Cain: Yeah. Look, we're really excited to be on the forefront of what we think is maybe the largest market transition the world has seen and certainly the greatest catalyst to application innovation that we've seen for some time, you can appreciate that due to the nature of our sophisticated platform, we're fortunate to engage in a lot of future discussions with customers, and it's coming across a wide variety of verticals. A couple of examples that I would point to that I like a lot. Recently, we were talking to an e-commerce provider and they're envisioning, \"Well, how do I change the customer experience at the edge?\" An example could be, \"Hey, I want a new pair of shoes that matches the outfit that I'm wearing, that's the color of the car parked outside, available within 15 miles with inventory in store today.\" That would be really hard to do without the addition of AI and combining that with platform capabilities that allow not just vector search, but understanding text and range-based search and geospatial technology. And the fact that we've taken the comprehensive platform approach Capella and enterprise allows us to support those types of applications. Now, a lot of people, Matt, are excited about the upside of AI and those hyper personalized adaptive applications that are going to be increasingly common on our lift, but there's downside that enterprises are worried about. Another customer that we're actively talking about is in the logistics space. And they're looking about -- they're looking about integrating chatbot technology to drive efficiency throughout their organization. And while we're working with them, they have a peer in an industry where the chatbot went wrong, started making disparaging remarks about the company, negatively interfacing with customers. And so, what that points to is the downside of ensuring that enterprise information is protected and that you avoid the downside of AI getting angry. And so, we're engaged in POCs to prove that we can minimize the downside with our use of data and integrating multiple data sources, but also provide the upside of those unique experiences. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of the types of engagements that we're having with our customers and really taking pride of being a future strategic platform that they can bet on for the necessity of multiple use cases that we bring together.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks a lot, Matt. Well done.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please state your question.\nJason Ader: Yeah, thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Just wanted to try to square the guidance a bit with all the positive commentary and in particular the 25% ARR growth that you just reported for the quarter and for the year. It basically looks like based on the Q1 guidance, there need to be some deceleration as the year progressed in ARR growth. And just given all the good things that you have going on in the business, I'm just trying to reconcile that. And maybe there's something more specific going on, maybe you had some large renewals or early renewals in FY '24 that won't recur in FY '25. Can you just help us kind of square the guidance with all the positive commentary?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Hey, Jason, it's Greg. Good to hear from you. Thanks for the question. Look, we're obviously very happy with how we performed in fiscal '24 with ARR performance accelerating again yet another year. And we remain committed to being to growing our top-line 20%-plus. Obviously, we're early days into fiscal '25. We feel very good about how we've guided, and as we've always stated, we're working to, at a minimum, meet it, if not beat it. And I think we have established a good track record of that now. And so, we just got to go out there, as Matt said, and it's going to be a lot of hard work, but we know what's in front of us and we feel good about it. And like I said, we're still committed to over this medium-term period that we laid out over the Investor Day, be a 20%-plus grower. And that's what we've been working for, for the last month, and we'll continue for the rest of the year.\nJason Ader: Got you. So, it's just -- we're just going to be conservative on the year given all of the macro uncertainty?\nGreg Henry: I think we're going to continue to maintain the same level of conservatism that we had last year and with some of the macro and again as Capella continues to ramp over time. But again, we feel like we're in a good position and coming off a good year, and we'll go work at it for the next 11 months to deliver at least what we've guided to, if not better.\nJason Ader: Got you. And then, one quick follow-up for you, Greg, on the gross margin. Can you give us a sense of where gross margin -- where the gross margin outlook will be for FY '25 and beyond? I know you have Capella, that's a lower gross margin offering. So, can you just help us with the models there?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. It'll certainly continue to -- it'll tick down from where it is now. It'll probably tick down quarter-on-quarter as we go throughout the year as Capella becomes more and more meaningful to the business. So that's how I would think about modeling that as you go through fiscal '25.\nJason Ader: Got you. Okay. Thanks, guys.\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please state your question.\nRob Oliver: Great. Good evening. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Greg. Two questions for me. The first is on ARR. I know you guys have said that ARR could moderate as you ramp Capella, but you're continuing to see really nice growth up 12% year-over-year. And I know from the Analyst Day and from some of our conversations, it does seem like some of the Capella transitions are actually producing larger ARR numbers. So, would just be curious to know what sort of color you can provide and what you're seeing in that uplift on ARR as you move your customers to Capella? And then, I had a quick follow-up.\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Hey, Rob, great to hear from you. Yeah, look, we still feel great. I mean, we laid out, obviously, at the Investor Day how Capella was performing. We gave you the -- that for last Q3, the in-quarter net retention rate was 167%. So, when we bring those customers on, we continue to grow them very nicely. And we think we can maintain doing that. We talked about that we have continued progress in terms of Capella penetration of our ARR balance. We will continue to see that throughout the year. And we feel, again, very good about how Capella is performing both migrations, and as Matt talked about, the new logo piece of things. So I don't think we're going to see moderation from Capella. I think it's going to continue to be the tailwind, and that's why we felt confident at the Investor Day to talk about having this medium-term growth rate of 20%-plus for the top-line.\nMatt Cain: Rob, let me tell you an exciting story from recently speaking with a customer. They started off they were a very small Couchbase customer. And this is a company that you would know, big scale, big technology focus. At the beginning of this fiscal year, the one that we just finished, they were less than $20,000. Over the course of the year, we proved our value proposition to them with Capella. They had multiple applications that they migrated into Couchbase Capella, and we exited the year with them running north of $800,000 ARR. Now they would have said out of the gate, hey, we're interested in this, and we hear what you're saying on the value proposition. What the customer explicitly said that was running this is, I need to prove this out to me and my teams. These are mission critical applications that company is running on, and we need to be very diligent with how we prove this out, how we plan our workflows, how we plan our upgrade project. And that's indicative of conversations that we're having with a lot of customers on migrations. And as we've said before, we don't want to push customers before they're ready. We don't think that's smart. Reality is there's only so much that we would be successful with that. We want to be a trusted partner. So, we think there's a lot many, many, many more of those to come. We can't predict when we're going to get those growth rates, just like we wouldn't have predicted the scale of that one over the course of the year. So, I think we're just we got to balance what we can control and what we can't. And I think you hear us talking about the potential because that's real and customers are telling us how valuable it is once they get in there. But there's some work to do based on the mission critical nature of a lot of these applications.\nRob Oliver: That's super exciting. Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Greg. And then my quick follow-up is just, Greg, for you on Capella iQ and some of the costs associated with that. I appreciated earlier my previous question, Jason was pushing you guys on potential conservatism on the top-line and on ARR. And I guess, how firm a handle do you guys have on the costs associated with Capella iQ? And just wanted to get a sense for how you sort of factored that into the cost outlook for the year. Thanks again, guys.\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Thanks, Rob. Yeah, look, we have a I think we have a very good handle on the cost profile of Capella and can easily model that out. I think the more challenging piece, what Matt said, is just the pace of adoption and particularly the migrations that are going to drive the growth of Capella as we go here. So, I feel very comfortable about how we are on managing the cost and understanding how that's going to play out over the course of the next year or even several years. It's really about the top-line growth that's associated with it. So, we feel very good about where the -- that business is going and where we'll eventually get from a Capella margin perspective.\nRob Oliver: Awesome. Appreciate it. Thanks again, guys.\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please state your question.\nRaimo Lenschow: Hey, thank you, and congrats from me as well. Matt, one for you. Like, as Capella becomes like a bigger part of the overall mix and obviously the momentum is clearly there for you, how do you think about your sales approach and how you sell, how you incentivize the sales force? I'm asking because a lot of your peers that have gone through the same transition at some point discovered like you probably need to kind of think about differently, so think more about consumption rather than just kind of putting like a proper project in place. Like, is there anything on the horizon for you guys as we think about this year or next year? Thank you.\nMatt Cain: Raimo, great question. We had our sales kickoff week one of this fiscal year, and I was particularly excited about it. And people are asking me why the excitement. And obviously, we wanted to share the good news on the fiscal year and celebrate a lot of great work by many people. What I was more excited about is the work that we've done to get in front of this year. And despite the fact that we delivered results that we were proud of, knowing that we can do more, and a lot of it is understanding underlying dynamics of Capella and consumption at a much higher level than we did a year ago, because we have a lot of data that we can chew on. We're now able to look at our pipeline in an even more sophisticated way to understand, look, is this a customer that's building a net new application that needs to understand the capabilities and how to integrate SQL with natural language for developers? Or is this a use case where somebody is replatforming an application off a competitive solution and displacing an existing database for something like TCO and application rewrite is so much more important. As we peel those layers, we can be much more fine tune with our go-to-market approach and aligned to what prospects and customers are looking for. And so, we've layered this approach in to everything we're doing on the go-to-market, and that just goes above and beyond what we already had in place. Then, we can follow-up with specific enablement to our teams to say, \"Hey, if you're getting these types of questions, this is part of the value proposition that you need to point to\" or \"Here's how to leverage a trial or professional services.\" All of that is with the lens of Capella and consumption. And then over the course of the year, as we've executed on this inflection, really building the instrumentation that we need to understand every aspect of how customers are consuming. Maybe they're tracking below what we might have thought, maybe they're running hot, being able speak to them on a proactive basis to make sure that that's headed in the direction that we want it to be and we want them to be. So I'd say those are all different dynamics that the team is really leading into, and we're excited to keep pushing forward.\nGreg Henry: Yeah. And Raimo, I'll just add one thing is even last year and it will continue this year, we have an element of consumption as part of the sales compensation plan. So, it's not just about selling the project, but also getting consumption going as well.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yeah. Okay, perfect. That makes sense. And then, Greg, one for you, and it's more not so much for this year, but more conceptually. If you think about professional services, how do you kind of plan with that as a percent of the total? Or like how do you think about the growth there in the long run? Is there kind of like a base level that you need to do because some of the initial or early stage project -- early in the market kind of product releases, you kind of want to handle yourself to see the feedback quicker and the rest can go with partners? Like, if I think about modeling professional services beyond this year as well, like how should we think about that? Thank you.\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Thanks, Raimo. Yeah, I think modeling services going forward, at least for the next year or two, I think, we obviously had a significant outperformance in fiscal '23. I think we got to '24 was more of a normal level. And I think that's the way you should think about it going forward. And as we've talked about over time, as more of our business goes to Capella, the services -- because there's embedded obviously services is part of Capella, the professional services component will probably moderate and flatten out over time. It won't continue to grow because that's really -- the majority of the services we're driving today are on the enterprise business versus Capella. So, I think this year was a good year to sort of re-level set and see sort of moderate growth from here on out.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nMatt Cain: Thanks, Raimo.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Howard Ma with Guggenheim Securities. Please state your question.\nHoward Ma: Thanks. And I want to add my congratulations on a -- to a solid finish to the year. For either Matt or Greg, can you help us think about the mix of total ARR between Capella and Server exiting this year or enterprise exiting this year, so fiscal '25? What are the biggest pieces that would shift ARR mix to Capella? Is it more expansions of existing Capella customers or is it migrations for on-prem? And how much are on-prem renewals driving the mix shift? Thanks.\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Hey, Howard, thanks for that. This is Greg. Look, as we noted, we finished the year at 11% of our ARR was Capella. And I think I would go back to at the Investor Day, we said during that medium term four to six year horizon, we would be disappointed if we didn't get to at least a third of Capella mix, if not even half of the business. So just sort of plotting the course of that timeframe, because we are not guiding to Capella mix in fiscal '25, I would say though that the bigger drives are: first, migrations of enterprise customers over, particularly the large -- some of the larger scale ones, that will accelerate it; two, would be expanding the existing Capella customer base, which Matt gave a great example of just recently; and then lastly, look, we've talked about that new logos, you're going to see the quantity tick up, but they're going to be a lower starting point as we enter into the Capella journey. So that's probably the third one in terms of rank order, if you will.\nHoward Ma: Okay. I appreciate you rank ordering that, Greg. And just a follow-up for you. What is -- you mentioned the longer average contract duration, what is driving that? Is it renewals or new logos? And do you expect that to be a persisting revenue tailwind this year or only in the first half?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. So, Howard, in Q4, we did two renewals of our largest enterprise customers. One, we talked about within the quarter, one was actually in Q1, they renewed early. And so, those two went in and they were both multiyear deals. So, we saw a higher than average duration this quarter because of those two deals in particular. But again, I think it's going to get back to where we normally see the duration. I think that was anomalous for those two specific deals. And you obviously see it show up in RPO. And if you go back a couple of years, you saw a large RPO and then over time, those largest customers, they burn off their revenue they get to this renewal point, and then we put them back into the RPO and then the same thing is going to happen. So, it was a Q4 dynamic, I would say, from a duration perspective.\nHoward Ma: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks.\nGreg Henry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Schwartz with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is [Stefan] (ph) on for Andy Nowinski. Thanks for taking my question. I guess to start off on these large deals, I think you had mentioned there were some renewals coming up in Q1 as well. Was there anything that maybe pulled into Q4 that maybe had an impact beyond what you're expecting?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. We talked about -- this is Greg. We talked about last quarter that there was two large deals, in particular, like very large deals. And one was due for renewal in the quarter and one was not. And we weren't sure at the time whether that was going to close because it wasn't due in the quarter. They both did close. So, as we just talked about the duration of the RPO, pick those up. The one that was in quarter renewal obviously hit ARR and revenue. The one that was again just a little bit early into Q4, you'll see it in ARR, but it obviously hasn't started revenue because it has a Q1 revenue start date. So, those were the only sort of dynamics that were at play with those couple large deals.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Okay. And then, as a follow-up, as you think about capitalizing on this inflection in demand that you're seeing, how do you think about how that plays out in terms of investments in sales and marketing and R&D?\nMatt Cain: Look, we certainly want to continue with the momentum, and we're excited about it. But we're equally focused on the leverage side of the business on a go-forward basis. And so, when I think about momentum, leverage comes in multiple forms. The pace of innovation from our product team is better than it's ever been. And we haven't talked about up to this point on the call our internal use of AI, but that's helping our development teams be that much more productive. The more insights we have on Capella, the more fine tune we can be with features that we're working on. And so I expect that we're going to get much more efficient as we execute through this inflection. Same is true on the go-to-market side. Having an additional level of telemetry and signaling from the product side, getting into complementing our enterprise motion with more product-led growth, better fine tuning our spend based on the type of demands per my previous comment. And so, a big part of how we're thinking about inflection is continuing to go fast and being smart about all things Capella, but then being really excited about a more leveraged future across all aspects of our business. And that's before we benefit from the addition of AI into our platform as we take things to market. So, a lot of our focus is, again, continued execution that we're proud of and the momentum we've established, how do we maintain that and get into levels of efficiency and leverage that we know are possible.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Taz Koujalgi with Wedbush Securities. Please state your question.\nTaz Koujalgi: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First of all, for Matt or Greg, on vector search, can you again explain how you monetize that feature? Is that part of the base product? Is it an add-on? Do people pay for that separately on top of the core product?\nMatt Cain: Yeah, it will be -- Taz, it will be part of the platform. It's an extension of other features. And so that'll either license that or use Capella Credits like they would other components of the platform.\nTaz Koujalgi: Really helpful. Any -- still early, but any sense of what kind of uplift the customer gets when he starts using that feature of the product?\nMatt Cain: Look, it's too early for us to give you kind of financial trends and patterns. I think it's a big part of the value proposition. And what we think about Couchbase is, what are the application dynamics within our customer base? And what are they trying to do with their innovation agendas? You'd be hard pressed to find any enterprise that isn't quickly trying to figure out how to get the most out of this exciting technology of AI. Well, when you think about highly adaptive applications in an AI-powered world, that's going to really depend on a sophisticated data platform that brings together these features, but can also handle the scale and performance of massive data sets that include private information, public information, structured data, unstructured data at the cloud, at the edge. And so, I think when we talk about one of the biggest market transitions and opportunities that the world has ever seen, it's hard to put a number on the opportunity. What we're focused on is meeting the needs of our customers that are building these adaptive applications. And if you were to step back and say, lay out the aspects of a data platform for the future world, you'd be hard pressed to find one that doesn't have that has a better start than what we have. And we truly believe that we've been built for this moment. So that's really our focus. We continue to press hard on meeting customer needs. Monetization is going to be exciting, but again, early days for us to give you specifics.\nTaz Koujalgi: Really helpful. Just one follow-up for Greg. Very strong customer adds this quarter. Any comment on what that does to the average land sizes for new customers? Are you landing more smaller customers now because of the Capella traction or the average deal size didn't really change much?\nGreg Henry: Hey, Taz. Yeah, we're certainly as we've talked about with Capella, we're going to be landing more customers at a smaller land point and we are seeing that for sure. However, it doesn't mean that like in this quarter, we talked about a couple of large enterprise deals as well, and you see our ARR per customer continue to grow, although it should moderate over time with these Capella customers coming on. But yes, the land points will be smaller and we are perfectly fine with that because Matt gave the example before the customer starts at $10,000 or $20,000 within the year is at $800,000 So zero issue with landing spot and growing from there.\nTaz Koujalgi: Really helpful. Thanks, guys.\nMatt Cain: Thanks, Taz.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Please state your question.\nAndres Miranda: Hi. This is Andres Miranda for Rudy. I just have a quick question for you guys. How is the consumption growth trending with Capella customers? If you could talk a little bit about that? And the consumption growth in Q4 so far in Q1 was -- is in line with Q1 with recent quarters or better or worse? Any extra color that you can give on so far?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Hey, good afternoon. Yeah, look, consumption continues to be good for Capella. We're very pleased at where we are with, again, not only bringing customers on, but getting them going and using. We talked about where there's a number of our customers that are continuing to not only use at the pace that they bought, but actually use beyond the pace that they bought, meaning consuming faster than they thought they would. So, we still feel very good about those consumption trends. We talked a little bit about those at Investor Day, and they continued through Q4. And look, as anything we would do, we look at the most recent trends for the last three to six months as the best predictor of what's going to happen in Q1, and we've leverage that to model into our Q1 guidance. And just as a reminder, again, what we covered at Investor Day, if you look at the pace of growth of customers in Capella versus Enterprise, they grow about 2 times faster going from 0 to $100,000 and 4 times faster going from $100,000 to $500,000. So, we're seeing that continue. And again, I'll reference back the example that Matt shared before about a customer starting $10,000 or $20,000 and ending up a year later $800,000. So, we remain very bullish on Capella and the consumption capabilities.\nAndres Miranda: Okay. Sounds good. And one last question, if I may. Next 12 month RPOs were up very strongly over Q3. How much was that driven by strong renewals versus new deals? And should the next 12 months RPOs begin to track more in line with ARR in fiscal year '25?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. So, I think you were asking about RPO and ARR. The RPO, that was the question. Obviously, again, we talked about those couple of large enterprise deals being large not only large, but large multiyear deals. So, we saw a very nice increase in our RPO. You'll see that continue obviously year-over-year early in the year, but then obviously these customers will start burning off their revenue and the RPO growth will moderate. And I'd just say if you look at RPO over the last couple of years, it's a good sort of pattern set of what we probably would expect to happen over the next couple of years.\nAndres Miranda: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.\nGreg Henry: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Param Singh with Oppenheimer & Co. Please state your question.\nParam Singh: Yeah, hi. Thank you. Yeah, this is Param Singh on for Ittai Kidron, and thank you for taking my question. I know the revenue guidance have been beaten to death, but I just want to understand the impact from a higher mix of Capella. And as you look to fiscal '25, what are you embedding in your guide as an incremental headwind?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Hey, thanks, Param. It's Greg. So, a couple of things. Look, we as you saw with our Q1 guide, we feel good about how Q1 is going to shape up from a revenue perspective. In particular, again, I'll go back to that large customer that we signed in Q4 with a start date in Q1, which will give us an outsized upfront license revenue from ASC 606, which is a bit anomalous. So, if you think about revenue for the year, Q1 will be stronger than normal and then it will be sort of flattish for the next couple of quarters, just given the strength of that upfront license revenue. We don't necessarily see I know you referred to a headwind potentially with Capella revenue. We don't see that being a headwind. We see that being, if anything, a tailwind as we continue to move forward. So again, continued good strength with our enterprise customers and growth with Capella should help us, again, get to that medium term outlook of being a 20%-plus top-line grower.\nParam Singh: Got it. Yeah, I was thinking more in terms of revenue recognition, but I hear your point. So, if I think about Capella and columnar, the opportunity to provide an analytical database, what have you heard so far? What's the opportunity set in incremental workloads you can address with that?\nMatt Cain: Great. I'm glad you brought that up. It was a really important release for the year. And as we think about again our worldview that applications need to be highly personalized, highly interactive, available from the cloud to the edge, we think a fundamental attribute is being able to inject real-time analytics while the application is being used by users. And so, it's really about complementing the operational data store with real-time analytics. What's important about our approach to columnar also is injecting multiple datasets, whether that's from S3 or other competitive database solutions into the Couchbase engine, so that, that application is that much more sophisticated. So, I think about the amount of data that's in the platform that the application can draw its sophistication from, that's really the power of that combination. You then extend vector, which brings in AI intelligence delay on top of that. This is the power of the Couchbase platform in action.\nParam Singh: Any commentary on early feedback from customers here?\nMatt Cain: Yeah. Look, I mean, we're in preview. I'd say it's exceeded our expectations. Specific commentary on the ease of rolling that out, the you start to get into the complexity of things like ETL and moving data from one system to another. We can remove that complexity and converge all that capability into the Couchbase platform. Keep in mind, we're doing this with SQL++ and natural language. All of this is embedded in Capella iQ. So, the capabilities that our developers have at their fingertips that they didn't have even six months ago, I think is being acknowledged in these previews, and we expect that to continue as we move to GA.\nParam Singh: Okay. Thanks again for taking my questions, and great quarter guys.\nMatt Cain: Thank you, Param.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to Matt Cain for closing comments.\nMatt Cain: Thanks, operator. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. We're thrilled with our performance and believe fiscal 2025 will be another historic year for Couchbase. We look forward to speaking with you all again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. All parties may disconnect. Have a good day."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Couchbase Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Edward Parker, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Parker. You may begin.\nEdward Parker: Good afternoon, and welcome to Couchbase's third quarter 2024 earnings call. We will be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close today. With me are Couchbase's Chair, President and CEO, Matt Cain; and CFO, Greg Henry. Today's call will contain forward-looking statements which include statements concerning financial and business trends and strategies, market size, our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition and our guidance for future periods. These statements reflect our views as of today only and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any duty to update these statements. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, address matters that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks discussed in today's press release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. During the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures which are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as how we define these metrics and other metrics, is included in our earnings press releases, which are available on our Investor Relations website. With that let me turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Cain: Thank you, Edward, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Greg and I will provide details on our third quarter results, as well as our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024 guidance. I'll start off with a few highlights of our Q3 financial results. I'm pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter, once again, outperforming our guidance across all key metrics. Highlights include growing Capella consumption, continued big deal activity, healthy new business and expansions, strong new customer logos and overall excellent operational performance from all teams across the Company. We continue to execute across our key priorities, deliver top-line growth, increase the mix of Capella, drive sales and marketing efficiency, and accelerate the pace of leverage in our model. I believe our results this quarter demonstrate our increasing momentum across all of these fronts. Total annual recurring revenue or ARR was 188.7 million up 24% year-over-year, up 23% in constant currency and up 4% sequentially. Revenue in Q3 was $45.8 million, up 19% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Our non-GAAP gross margin remains best in class at 89.5%. Non GAAP operating loss was 5 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 11 percentage points above the midpoint of our implied guidance range. This demonstrates our focus on increasing efficiency across our business and continued operating expense discipline. I'd like to call out our momentum with Capella which continues to experience strong growth and is contributing more materially to our top line as well as net retention in fact more than a fifth of our customer base are now Capella customers. Capella continues to be an especially important engine for new logo acquisition which contributed meaningfully to the 24 net new customers we added across the board in Q3 doubling quarter-over-quarter and more than we added in the first and second quarters of the year combined. As our Capella base continues to grow, we're seeing favorable consumption dynamics emerge as both existing and new customers realize our platforms unique performance and scale, robust set of integrated services along with ease of use and rapid time to value. In Q3, we saw multiple instances of customers consuming ahead of their initial contracts and electing to buy more driving strong Capella consumption and contributing to our ARR and revenue outperformance. While we're still in the early innings of our journey, it's gratifying to see the investments we made in our cloud database bearing fruit as we expected they would. I am confident as ever in our ability to sustain durable long term growth. Turning to innovation, we continue to invest in enhancements and capacities that further extend the value of Couchbase as a cloud database platform for modern applications. Recall that last quarter we talked about our four part vision for AI, drive developer productivity, optimize AI processing, enable AI powered apps anywhere, and do it all with a vibrant partner ecosystem. From inception our architecture has been built to enable the most demanding applications to not only perform but provide rich hyper personalized context aware experiences for our end users. We refer to these as real time adaptive applications. Combining operational and analytical capabilities, our multimodal platform seamlessly integrates advanced services like indexing, eventing, full text search, and more in a single solution. Our platform is perfectly suited for the massive performance and scalability requirements that adaptive applications require. At AWS reinvent last week, we announced a new Capella columnar service on AWS which significantly enhances the ability to harness real time analytics to build adaptive applications. At the heart of this new service is the introduction of a columnar store and data integration capability directly into Capella which further converges operational and real time analytic workloads into a single platform. Capella columnar will also feature built in natural language processing with Capella IQ, the developer co pilot we announced last quarter. Capella columnar is a significant technical achievement that we believe brings substantial business value to our customers. The gap between analytic and operational processing is a longstanding barrier to making it easier for development teams to include the required real time analytics into their adaptive applications. As a result, our customers can ingest data from anywhere into Capella in real time reducing complexity and cost all while increasing developer productivity. Importantly, this new capability is a perfect example of how we leverage our unique architecture to further capture new workloads. In this case real time adaptive applications in our singular cloud to edge platform. Now, I'd like to turn to customer wins. In Q3, we saw new Capella wins across many industries including high-tech, government, business services, and financial services. One new Capella customer from the quarter with an AI powered customer intelligence platform provider. A top priority for this customer was eliminating maintenance costs and saving time with the managed service as its customer engagement application grows. Initially beginning on our community edition, this customer migrated to Capella this quarter because it delivered on all of the application requirements with the most compelling price performance. We also continue to see customers expanding with Capella. Yostar Games is one of the top publishers, developers, and investors of games in Asia Pacific. This customer initially selected Capella to deploy, manage and streamline its game database services. It has continued to invest in our database as a service because of Capella's impressive price performance, stability, and superior database performance to support rapid customer growth as its game continues to scale. Another Capella expansion from the quarter came from a leading global design and hospitality company. This customer leverages Couchbase to manage, organize, and analyze data for order management, fulfillment, and pricing for the thousands of products in its catalog. This customer originally selected Capella to reduce the maintenance and operational costs associated with the self managed database and made the strategic decision to expand its investment in Capella this quarter for additional operational benefits. Switching to new enterprise wins, we landed a Canadian subsidiary of an American multinational financial services corporation. This customer selected Couchbase to power a real time trading analytics application to analyze market trends enabling traders to make more informed decisions. This customer selected Couchbase for its superior database performance and high availability. Another new enterprise customer this quarter was a communication services provider that offers a low cost, high quality mobile service for its customers. This customer needed a high availability database platform to support the mobile billing system for its more than 5 million mobile carrier service subscribers. This customer selected Couchbase because of database's impressive scalability and suitability for cloud orchestrations while maintaining superior performance. Now, let me provide a few thoughts on the near-term demand environment. As we have discussed all year, the macro uncertainty continues to present headwinds for IT spending and we continue to see elongated deal cycles, extra layers of scrutiny and approval and customers electing to buy in smaller increments. These trends again persisted throughout the quarter. That said, I'm very pleased with our execution against these headwinds. We continue to not only see a healthy pipeline of opportunities for our cloud database platform, but also strengthening consumption trends as we start to achieve scale with Capella. And Despite the challenging macro environment, organizations continue to invest in long-term digital transformation initiatives where we are increasingly playing a strategic role in enabling these journeys. While we would prefer a stronger demand backdrop, [Audio Gap] you've often heard me say that Couchbase has been built for this moment and I think that's as true today as it has ever been. In closing, we are making progress on our initiatives, are committed to focusing on the areas we can control, and are nimble in navigating the ones we cannot. We remain dedicated to delivering against our key priorities for fiscal 2024, Focus on top line growth, increase the mix of Capella, drive further sales and marketing efficiency, and accelerate the pace of leverage in our model. Before handing the call over to Greg, I want to invite investors and analysts on this call to join me and the rest of the Couchbase executive team at our first Analyst Day in New York City next Wednesday, December 13th. We're excited to dive deeper into the foundation of our company, technology and strategy share details on Capella and how we are reimagining the database experience and demonstrate how we're delivering on our commitment to drive efficiency across our business and financial model. Finally, as I always do, I want to emphasize one of our core values that I've repeated many times before. At Couchbase, we attack hard problems driven by customer outcomes. With that, I will hand the call over to Greg to walk you through our results in more detail. Greg?\nGreg Henry: Thanks Matt and thanks everyone for joining us. We had another strong quarter as we beat guidance across all key metrics. Despite the elevated level of deal scrutiny that Matt mentioned, we are pleased with our execution, our dedication to delivering value to our customers, and our ability to navigate the environment while driving very strong outperformance in our operating loss guidance. I'll now walk you through our third quarter in more detail before providing our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year. Total annual recurring revenue or ARR was $188.7 million at the end of the third quarter representing 24% growth year-over-year or 23% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis and 4% sequentially. Without the incremental currency headwind experienced in Q3, our ARR would have been approximately $1.4 million higher or $3.6 million above the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenue for the third quarter was $45.8 million, an increase of 19% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Revenue growth benefited from stronger than expected consumption of Capella and strength in our enterprise business partially offset by declines in professional services. Subscription revenue for the third quarter was $44 million, an increase of 23% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Professional services revenue for the third quarter was $1.8 million, a decline of 36% year-over-year and 17% sequentially consistent with our expectations following outsized strength in professional services fiscal 2023. We continue to expect contribution as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2024 to be below historical levels. Our ARR per customer performance in the third quarter was $264,000 up from $261,000 in the Q2 up 14% year-over-year and indicative of the growing wallet share we have with large customers. As a reminder, as Capella continues to grow in revenue contribution, we expect ARR per customer growth could moderate or decline in future quarters. Our dollar based net retention rate or NRR continues to exceed 115% driven by strong renewal and up sell activity across our base of larger enterprise customers. Our NRR has been steadily improving thanks to Capella. We exited the quarter with 715 customers, an increase of 24 net new customers in the second quarter. As Matt mentioned, Capella once again represented the majority of new logos in the quarter and we grew our Capella customer logo count by over 25% from the second quarter, up from over 20% from Q1 to Q2. We're encouraged by the strength of our new logo pipeline and remain confident in our ability to reliably expand logos as evidenced by our consistent ARR growth and our strong retention metrics against the more challenging spending environment. In discussing the remainder of the income statement, please note that unless otherwise stated, all references to our expenses, results of operations, and share count are on a non-GAAP basis. In Q3, our gross margin remained strong at 89.5% benefiting from sustained enterprise gross profit margin strength and the completion of the amortization from some of our initial Capella investments offset by growing Capella mix. This compares to a gross margin of 88% a year ago and 87.2% last quarter. As a reminder, as Capella mix increases, we expect gross margin will decline over time. Turning to expenses, we continue to invest to capture the generational opportunity we see in front of us, but are focused on improving the efficiency of our growth. We are pleased with our execution on this front as our expense discipline and early benefits from our cost saving initiatives resulted in us again outperforming our operating loss outlook. Our sales and marketing expenses for Q3 were $27.1 million or 59% of revenue compared to $24.9 million or 65% of revenue a year ago. Research and development expenses for Q3 were $12.6 million or 27% of revenue compared to $12 million or 31% of revenue a year ago. We continue to thoughtfully invest in our as a service offering as well as additional features to bolster our platform. General and administrative expenses for Q3 were $6.4 million or 14% of total revenue compared to $6.6 million or 17% of revenue a year ago. Non-GAAP operating loss for Q3 was $5 million or negative 11% operating margin, 11 percentage points higher than the midpoint of our guidance compared to an operating loss of $9.6 million or negative 25% operating margin a year ago. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders for Q3 was $3.7 million or negative $0.08 per share. I'll now turn to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q3 with $156.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We remain well capitalized to execute against our long-term growth strategy. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO totaled $164.4 million at the end of Q3, an increase of 3% year-over-year. We expect to recognize approximately 68% or $111.8 million of total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, which represents 7% year-over-year growth. Operating cash flow for Q3 was negative $12.7 million and free cash flow was negative $13.8 million or negative 30% free cash flow margin. We are pleased with the progress we have made in our free cash profile and remain committed to driving further improvement. Now, I will provide guidance for Q4 and the full year of fiscal 2024. As Matt discussed, we continue to see solid momentum and our pipeline remains strong. Furthermore, we anticipate that our product capabilities, partner ecosystem, and go-to-market motion will continue to complement our momentum. That said, we remain mindful of the macro headwinds and continue to carefully monitor their impact on our business. As such, our outlook maintains a consistent degree of conservatism across all of these metrics to account for the uncertainty as well as lack of visibility into how the macro may impact consumption trends for our emerging as a service offering. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect total revenue in the range of $46.2 million to $46.8 million or year-over-year growth of 12% at the midpoint. We are raising fourth quarter ARR guidance last provided on our Q2 call and now anticipate ARR in the range of $198 million t7o $202 million, which represents 22% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. This compares to our prior outlook of $195.5 million to $199.5 million or 21% growth at the midpoint. We note that due to foreign currency fluctuations, our guidance incorporates an incremental 1% year-over-year growth headwind since our Q2 call. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of negative $8.2 million to negative $7.4 million. Now turning to our revised full year guidance, we are raising our full year revenue guidance and now expect full year total revenue in the range of $176.2 million to $176.8 million or year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint. As a reminder, we continue to anticipate contribution from services revenue in fiscal 2024 to be below recent levels due to customers electing fewer services as a result of macro related budgetary pressures as well as a naturally lower services attach rate with Capella. Furthermore, we've historically seen variability with respect to the implementation timing of certain enterprise priced deals, which impacts our revenue visibility along with new or migrated Capella customers. We therefore continue to view ARR as a better catered in revenue of the strength of our business. And finally, we are decreasing our operating loss outlook and now expect a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of negative $35.4 million to negative $34.6 million. With that, Matt and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Rob Oliver with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Oliver: Matt, I had a couple for you on Capella and then Greg, I had one for you. So Matt, just first on Capella. When customers that are current Couchbase customers are considering a database as a service, does that go to competitive bid and it sounds like you guys are getting nice momentum winning those, but maybe talk about how that process happens and what you've seen in terms of kind of win rates with those customers that know you? And then you mentioned usage patterns, have risen nicely. And I'd just be curious to get some context there, like better than your expectations, is it more in line with like how we would expect the adoption curve, are there new use cases you're seeing that have surprised you? So a couple of things there and then I had a follow-up for Greg.\nMatt Cain: Sure. So let me take these one at a time. I think Rob as it pertains to existing customers. Oftentimes they have chosen Couchbase because of our platform capabilities. And what we're able to with Capella is offer them additional value proposition, TCO, faster time to value, easier to expand use cases that is incremental to the value proposition we've already delivered. Very rarely if ever does that go into a competitive bid. It's more finding the right time for them to migrate their entire estate, a subset of their estate or focus on new workloads moving into Capella, because of that value proposition. The competitive dynamic that we're seeing is actually workloads that we don't support where because Capella has traction, people are reevaluating decisions they've previously made on other database as a service vendors and saying, well, Couchbase now that you are mature with Capella, we're going to open up decisions on workloads that you don't have which is one of the dynamics that's leading to our healthy expansion. And so the migration path is one that's very good for us. At the same time, we're careful to not arbitrarily try to push customers beyond, what they want to do and maintain balances as we manage those relationships. When it comes to usage, we are in fact seeing very healthy usage across the board, both in our ability to land new customers with shorter sales cycles, the rate at which they expand both with those workloads and new use cases. It's not really about additional types of use cases, just more that time to value relevance with the developer persona that drives to that consumption activity that again is really healthy and we're going to spend a lot of time talking about what we're seeing there.\nGreg Henry: And Rob, if I could just add, that's part of what drove some of the outperformance on the top-line this quarter particularly on revenue is that consumption dynamic Matt talked about.\nRob Oliver: And then Greg just one follow-up for you, just you've been very clear about the natural headwinds gross margin that comes from Capella, obviously sort of good problem to have here as Capella's ramping nicely. As we look out and think about our model in FY '25, are there levers do to offset that, not getting you not trying to get you to guide to a number here, but as we think about that gross margin. Are there levers do or things we should be thinking about that could be offsetting factors to that?\nGreg Henry: Yes, I think just at the do total level, the more Capella we have, it'll be diluted from a rate perspective. That said, as we get more mature and more scale of Capella, the margin rate will improve because there's some level of effectively fixed costs in there. And then the other dynamic you see why we had a really strong margin performance this quarter is. We did have some internally developed software for Capella going back several years as we launched that the development that's now off the books and it's done. So that's why you see a little bit more gross margin this quarter, but it will dilute over time. We just got to keep getting more volume and it'll improve the Capella rate we're seeing today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSanjit Singh: I guess, Matt, the other question I had on Capella is in terms of the workload that you guys are do starting to onboard onto Capella. Can you give us a sense of the nature of those types of workloads and how, as Capella addressing workloads that you may not have gotten before with Capella Enterprise?\nMatt Cain: So, Sanjit, first of all, the pace of new logo acquisition is certainly going up and Capella is delivering on the value proposition that we expect that it would, which is lower barrier to entry into the Couchbase platform. As I know you know, the level of capabilities we have in our platform allows us to serve many, many different use cases, everything from customer 360 to field and inventory management across a very wide variety of verticals and use cases. So, the dynamic that we're seeing with Capella is less about different types of use cases because quite frankly the breadth that we run today is quite extensive. It's more the pace of acquiring. In some cases, geographies where we may not have as much of a direct presence built out, we're benefiting from cloud partnerships and customers signing up. We're able to again shorten sales cycles, but then benefit from faster expansion. I think the ability to go directly to developers and move from trial to initial customer is something we've been talking about and we're seeing that. And that's not just net new customers, but that's also new applications in existing accounts where we may be able to migrate into a line of business or a particular part of multinational that we weren't able to get to begin with. So, overall really healthy, again, we've had very high expectations for Capella across all of these variables and we're really starting to see that come to fruition.\nSanjit Singh: That's really encouraging. I'm sure we're going to hear more about that next week in the ORIX at the Investor Day. Just as a follow-up, as we go into Q4, and obviously Q4 is a big quarter for everyone in software and I'm sure that's the case with Couchbase as well. Going into Q4, Greg, is there any way you can give us a sense of the size of the renewal base this year versus last year? How do you feel the sales team is in terms of being on top of those renewals given that the macro is still a little challenging out there?\nGreg Henry: Hey, Sanjit, good question. Yes, Q4 is a big one for us. It'll obviously be should be our biggest quarter ever. And the renewal pool is very healthy. It's slightly larger than last year and I would just add that, you probably saw we had a little bit wider guidance range at times. There's several of our largest customers have renewals coming up between Q4 and Q1. And depending on the timing of when they get done, obviously, the Q4 ones will happen now. The Q1s could happen in Q4, they could happen in Q1 depending on timing. But those will drive a significant amount of what that actually looks like. So, it's a big quarter, there's a couple of really big deals out there that are going to be really exciting to do and, that's what's going to drive Q4. So, we're looking forward to it and as we said we're looking forward to sharing more next week.\nMatt Cain: Sanjit, if I could just pile on. We talked about the excellent operational performance in the quarter. That's not just the efficiency and leverage that we demonstrated with the financial results, but it gets at some of the very things that you're asking about. Never have I been more confident in the functions across the Company inclusive of our go-to-market teams. Really understanding where we are with deals, understanding how to position with the right economic value, managing pipeline, just driving linearity across the big core. So, there are big deal dynamics at the big quarter, but testament to the teams for the operational rigor they have in place and I think they are doing a great job and we'll continue to deliver.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nIttai Kidron: Couple from me Greg, can you remind us on the RPO, why is that not a good indicator for your business? I mean it's been flattish for three quarters in a row and Capella cannot have too much of an impact on it given that it's a low-single-digit percent of your revenue still. So, help us understand, remind us again, the disconnect between RPO and revenue?\nGreg Henry: Look, on the RPO, I would just tell you and it goes back to the comment I just made on Sanjit. We have several of our largest customers coming up for renewal and typically they do multiyear renewals. So if you think about at the renewal point, if it's a multiyear deal, you're putting all that into RPO. And by the time you get to the end of that, there's not much left. And so, I think you'll see an improvement in RPO coming out of Q4 because of some of those particularly large deals which is why you're seeing some variability in the timing whereas obviously the revenue stays it grows, it stays relatively consistent over time. So, the revenue that full value of revenues running, but there's some of these deals that are renewing in Q4, there's only one quarter left of RPO in the backlog if you will.\nIttai Kidron: Are these multiyear deals, Greg?\nGreg Henry: Yes. These large deals are typically multiyear deals, at least two if not three year deals.\nIttai Kidron: And then, on Capella, on gross margin I understand the comments there, but maybe can you specifically comment on Capella specifically, meaning, is the gross margin of Capella still below 50% or has it already who improved above that level?\nGreg Henry: Yes, Ittai, we haven't obviously talked about that and spoken about the gross margin. I can just tell you that it has steadily been improving and we saw a very healthy uptick this quarter in particular and it's doing exactly what we thought in terms of the growth of the business and the margin rate and so it is improving. And like I said, we had that one time comparison adjustment. So, we feel good about where the margin rate is on Capella and where it's going to ultimately land. And as I was mentioning, the more volume we get there, it will only continue to improve.\nIttai Kidron: And then last one for you, Matt, on Capella itself. In what way are the customers that are adopting it, especially the new ones that are joining the platform different in their profile, in their use cases compared to customers you're bringing on with your on premise platform?\nMatt Cain: Again, I think it's less about the use case and more about the pace of adoption. We talked about, one of the new logos in the prepared remarks. We had another company that you know well multinational cyber security company chose us for price performance on an app that certifies all of the connectors to their platform and doing security health checks on behalf of their customers. That's aligned with an application that we would have serviced before, but not until we had Capella did we break through with that price performance, usability, time to value. We had another new logo, Swarm engineer, AI/ML based supply chain optimization platform and they chose us because it literally freed up developer time and resources with the managed service against other solutions that they were evaluating. Now if we were to go through the specific use cases in these verticals, we have comparisons and it's not like we couldn't get at that with Couchbase, but it's the incremental value proposition and ease of use and all the things that we've built into Capella that are getting those deals over the line. And if I were to take you through migrations and new applications inside customers, it's more of that value proposition coming to fruition. We have a very broad based platform and we continue to add to it with additional services. Customers have always valued that. We're now marrying up the consumption, the way they want to consume the technology with all those capabilities which we believe are differentiated and industry leading in our single cloud edge platform. So it's that combination that's providing the uplift, not necessarily an ability to get at new use cases because we work so hard to have those capabilities in place.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks, guys. Congrats from me as well. Matt, the accelerating net adds were great to see. I think you gave some statistics on first half or even Q2. Was there anything unique with this quarter's adds? Anything pull in for instance? I know you just talked about a large renewal cohort, but I guess I'm wondering in Q4, but I guess I'm wondering on the new business. Could this be a new run rate for kind of quarterly net adds?\nMatt Cain: Look, Matt, we've said quite transparently that this was an area that we need to improve in. And we're certainly pleased with the results and I think it shows that the first half was an anomaly. We still have ways to go. I will tell you it was the highest gross adds that we've ever had as a company and it was driven by the highest gross adds of Capella. Now, we've expected that and it's not just the Capella value proposition, it's also operational rigor and the things that we've been focused on, on a go-to-market, expanding our partnerships. So, there's a lot of what I like to say lines in the water to drive the proven there and there's no bigger focus area that we have as a company. And I think this is much more indicative of what we can and will be delivering on a go forward basis.\nMatt Hedberg: And maybe, Greg, this might be a topic of Analyst Day. But as we're thinking about our models next year, you didn't obviously guide us for fiscal '25. Are there any guideposts that you give us on sort of growth or margins, in sort of, we've known your philosophy on sort of like trying to focus on growth but also expand margins as well. Then any sort of commentary that you provide us with tonight on how we should think about next year?\nGreg Henry: Yes, hey, Matt, good to hear from you. Look, there'll be a lot more obviously next week. We are not going to be giving specific fiscal '25 guidance until we get to our Q4 earnings. So 90 days from now, but we will obviously provide some sort of long-term view of how we're thinking about it. That said, we are extremely mindful of profitability, free cash flow, op income and we are working to create a more efficient model, get more leverage out of the model. And again, I think you saw some of that continue to come through this quarter and all year and we're just committed to continue to improve our margin profile and move our way to profitability.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Ader: Just wanted to ask first for you, Greg, Q1, I know you're not giving specific guidance, but if I look at the last to Q1s, it was down a little bit sequentially from Q4 to Q1. So just remind us on the seasonality and any other kind of puts and takes as Q4 turns into Q1?\nGreg Henry: Yes, I'll give you some sort of how general is as I was alluding before, Q4 is typically our largest quarter of the year and Q1 is typically our smallest quarter of the year depending on the year of course. So I think the seasonality you've seen historically is reasonable to think about. But again, we're not guiding yet. As I mentioned, we've got a couple large deals that could fall in Q4 or Q1, Which would change sort of that dynamic. So that's why we're not ready to sort of come out with guidance because we just really need to see how that's going to play out timing wise. They're going to happen. It's just a matter of, when not if. But I think again seasonality wise, we've seen historically our Q4 to Q1 is typically it's not nearly as big as the renewal pool, just not as robust.\nJason Ader: And then for you, Matt, you talked about the columnar analytics feature. I don't know, it's just a big deal. Every company introduces features and talks about how great they are, but how important is this? Maybe talk about some use cases where this might be used? Just try to get a greater sense on the importance of this new capability?\nMatt Cain: We think it's quite significant. And as we look into the future, we start in thinking about what are trying to solve with their application strategy. And every company around the world is trying to figure out how to use technology to improve their business and get closer to their customers. And in order to do that, you need to not only have all of the operational data at your disposal, but to make these applications truly real time and adaptive taking their capabilities to the next level is injecting data that you're analyzing alongside the operational data store. And as much as people are focused on analytics in the world, the vast majority of enterprise data is not analyzed. And furthermore you have this significant gap, this latency gap that's existed for 50 years in the wall that exists between operational and analytical data. What we've done with this capability and our underlying architecture is enable a developer to develop these real time adaptive applications by combining not just the data that we manage on our data store, but ingesting data from S3, from other relational sources, sources like Mongo in a real time basis and then feed those insights directly into the application while it's performing. There's not eliminating ETL, reducing efficiency and with the underlying architecture to maintain the operational performance in SLA that modern databases require. So this is quite a big step for us. And when we think about the data layer for applications in an AI driven world obviously we've talked about vector being on the roadmap which will add to our architecture. But we like to think about the density of the application that we are supporting in that data layer. Operational, analytical, and all of these capabilities coming together in a single platform is our advantage and we think that never have our core capabilities and the platform that we've developed with these scale and performance cloud to edge requirements ever been more relevant. And so we're quite excited about that and getting quite frankly pretty phenomenal feedback from customers that understand the importance of this and aligning it to their overall digital transformation and application strategies.\nJason Ader: And can you give us some examples of use cases for the columnar analytics technology? Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Cain: Yes. So, this is about like taking applications to the next level. So I mean I'll give you a few generic ones. Let's say you’ll find something on an e-commerce store and we all know you get a recommended product. But what if that recommendation was completely personalized to you? What if the product descriptions matched what was happening in your life? If you're shopping in a home improvement store and it has the awareness that you're doing a home remodel, well, now the product descriptions map the type of home remodel that you're delivering and then can bring in the inventory that meets those needs at your local store. These are real time personalized occasions that are changing based on what's happening in your world with you as a user. Streaming services often recommend shows for us, but what if it's aware of what's happening in my connected home and recommends to pause something because the beer in my fridge is now the temperature that I like it and I'm not going to miss a particular portion of that game. Or I get an alert that another one of my favorite teams is starting that that level of adaptive application without slowing down the performance taking it to the next level. That's what happens when you take all of these analytics and feed it into real time applications with access to information from every possible input, structured, unstructured et cetera.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Reback: Matt, what if anything needs to change at Capella in order for it to be a true volume customer acquisition engine?\nMatt Cain: I think we're heading that direction. We're excited to spend time next week. We're going to talk a lot about this idea that Capella is at the inflection point. I think the product that we have, the usability, the integration of things like IQ is going to give us the opportunity to augment our highly sophisticated enterprise go-to-market motion and benefit from more product led growth. And I think we're to the point now where we have the solution. We're marrying that up with know, how we're marketing, how we're investing in go-to-market resources, how we're thinking about partnerships. And so, I do think we're at the point of that you know hockey stick where we're going to start to see that inflection coming.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Taz Koujalgi with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTaz Koujalgi: I have a question on Capella first one. So you're very positive on the new logo traction driven by Capella. Can you comment on the deal sizes or deal values of these Capella deals by comparing to enterprise new logo adds? Are these smaller? Are these at the same level of the enterprise new deals?\nGreg Henry: Yes. Taz, it's Greg. Thanks for the question. Yes, the new logos in Capella are certainly smaller than what we would see on the enterprise side of the business. But again, the time to value and again, we're going to talk about this a lot next week is the growth rate on that is substantial compared to the enterprise business. So, they start smaller but they grow faster and that we always assume that would be the nature of the Capella model. Now that said, there are times where we get larger ones, but in general they're smaller than the enterprise part of the business.\nMatt Cain: And Taz, we actually want that when we're building programs and incentives to get customers started. One of the friction points that we have in landing new logos with the enterprise business is trying to find the exact sizing that customers are going to commit to knowing that applications are dynamic and people are picking us because we're a platform. You know with Capella, we can remove that friction entirely. Just get people going and then they can you know add credits or you know go with the pure consumption model. So we anticipate that and if anything, I would expect it continues to come down as we add more volume. That's not to say that they're expected value or potential of spend is any smaller. It's just the efficiency of landing them and getting them going.\nTaz Koujalgi: And then, follow-up to that, Matt, if you mentioned in the call that you're seeing some customers this quarter, consume ahead of their commitments or credits. Anything that was done this quarter to, I guess, capitalize that? Do you think anything in the go-to-market to make, customers, I guess, consume faster or use their credit faster? The reason I'm asking is one of your peers who had earnings last night spoke about how they're changing their go-to-market model, in certifying their salespeople to sell not on a commitment, basis, but more on a consumption basis to drive consumption faster so that people don't just buy the credits and keep them unused. So anything that has changed on your go to market side to, I guess, make customers consume faster?\nMatt Cain: Look, if I were to talk about operational capabilities that we've matured dramatically over the course of this fiscal year, certainly the last six quarters, it would be on managing consumption, providing incentives throughout our go-to-market engine everything from quota carrying salespeople, SE resources, professional services, customer success in aligning to customer needs and being very aware of consumption. Certainly, we want to be prepared if people in rare circumstances are consuming below where we need them and adjust that and help them with the deployments that they anticipated. Maybe surprising, but a big part of that is understanding where customers may be running hotter than we think they need to and getting ahead of that so we don't end up with a customer relationship issue. So, the level of operational investment we've put there in systems, tools, process and people, consumption can be complicated to manage, but I think we're leaning into that complexity and feel pretty good about the operational rigor that we have in place to manage that as we go forward and the subsequent incentives, which for me we're in the business of satisfying customers and we want to make sure that we're helping them with their business strategies and making sure that Capella and Couchbase are a big part of that. Getting consumption right is certainly an important variable.\nTaz Koujalgi: Just one follow-up if I may. I think last quarter when we look at the number of new logos added overall and number of new logos that for Capella, Capella had a higher new logo adds. I guess you were saying that I think, you got the benefit of migrations of workloads from enterprise to Capella, so that's why the Capella number was higher. This quarter, I think the new logos and, Capella new logos are almost the same. Is it fair to assume that the migration activity from enterprise to Capella was a little lighter this quarter versus last quarter?\nMatt Cain: No. I think something might be getting lost in the takeaway there. I mean, we mentioned we're over a 5th of our customer base. Greg can talk about the quarter-over-quarter Capella growth, but again it was the majority of net logos. We saw a healthy number of migrations. I think all of that is up quarter-over-quarter. You have the specifics?\nGreg Henry: Yes. I mean this quarter that the Capella customer count you know, grew by more than 25% whereas last quarter it grew by 20%. So we're accelerating the pace of Capella customer adds. Both that's inclusive of both migrations and new logos. So we feel very good about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Howard Ma with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nHoward Ma: Great quarter, guys. I guess just the dovetail off of Taz's last question. When we think about the sales and market efficiency levers for Capella, where is the sales force in terms of efforts focused on migrations versus acquiring new deal logos? And that's it for me. Thanks.\nMatt Cain: Howard. Look, I think we're appropriately balanced to do our jobs as salespeople here we need to be taking care of our existing customers, growing those accounts because of the platform that we bring. That's existing applications, net new applications and then obsessing over adding new customers. You can appreciate that we have a fairly mature go-to-market model on any given rep may have a little more focus on an existing account. We have reps sort of almost entirely focused on new. But if we look at the collective army of field resources out there, there's not a moment that goes by at the Company that we're not obsessing over both. I think one of the things that's fantastic about Capella is, we not only talk exclusively about new logos, but new applications and our ability to win new apps both in new logos and in existing accounts is better than it ever has been. We spend a lot of time on our compensation and incentive plans to ensure that we have the appropriate balance. You know I spend a lot of time thinking about the operational focus and rigor across the board, but you know I think we need to achieve our medium- and long-term objectives we need to do both and I think we are striking that balance and if in any given region or territory or down to individual reps we're off, we make those adjustments on pretty real time basis. So, again I'm pretty proud of the operational execution across the board and testament to our field leaders and in navigating this dynamic along with many others.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. And I'd like to turn the floor back over to Chairman and CEO, Matt Cain for closing comments.\nMatt Cain: Thanks, operator, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. I'm sure you can tell we're very pleased with how the business performing and are working hard to make fiscal 2024 our best year yet. I look forward to seeing many of you all next week in New York Hope to see you then. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

You may begin.\nEdward Parker: Good afternoon, and welcome to Couchbase's second quarter 2024 earnings call. We will be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close today. With me are Couchbase's Chair, President and CEO, Matt Cain; and CFO, Greg Henry. Today's call will contain forward-looking statements which include statements concerning financial and business trends and strategies, market size, our expected future business and financial performance and financial condition and our guidance for future periods. These statements reflect our views as of today only and should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any duty to update these statements. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, address matters that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks discussed in today's press release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. During the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures which are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as how we define these metrics and other metrics, is included in our earnings press releases, which are available on our Investor Relations website. With that let me turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Cain: Thank you, Edward, and good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Greg and I will provide details on our second quarter results, as well as our third quarter and full year fiscal 2024 guidance. I'll start off with a few highlights of our Q2 financial results. Couchbase delivered a strong quarter, once again, beating our guidance across all metrics. I am pleased with the team's execution against our strategy to deliver top-line momentum while outperforming on profitability, all against a difficult economic environment. Total annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $180.7 million, up 24% year-over-year, up 23% in constant currency and 5% sequentially. Revenue in Q2 was $43.1 million, up 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Our non-GAAP gross margin remains best-in-class at 87.2%. Non-GAAP operating loss was $9.2 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 4 percentage points above the midpoint of our implied guidance range. This demonstrates our focus on increasing efficiency across our business and continued operating expense discipline. As we crossed the halfway point of the fiscal year, I'm especially proud of the progress we're making on the four key priorities we laid out for fiscal 2024: focus on top-line growth; increase the mix of Capella; drive sales and marketing efficiency; and accelerate the pace of leverage in our model. While there is much more to do across all of these to reach our full potential, our momentum is building. We believe we are set up for a strong second half of the year and, more importantly, beyond. We have many initiatives underway to continue our progress, but I want to touch specifically on the exciting opportunity we see with AI and how it will be a tailwind for all four of our key priorities. To begin, databases are the unsung heroes of AI, because without data, there is no AI. The fact is behind every application is a database. From day one, we've architected a cloud database platform that enables demanding applications to not only perform, but provide rich, personalized, differentiated experiences for end users. Combining operational and analytical capabilities, our multi-modal platform also seamlessly integrates advanced services, like indexing, eventing, full text search, and more, in a single solution for developers. Our platform and unique architecture are perfectly suited for the massive performance and scalability requirements that AI applications require. We're investing in additional AI capabilities that will further extend the value of Couchbase as a cloud database platform for modern AI applications. Generative AI is the next great catalyst for modern applications. Developers and customers are exploring ways to build AI powered apps that can run anywhere with our platform. To cement our long-term position as a destination for AI applications, our AI strategy has the following four pillars: first, drive developer productivity and adoption; second, optimize AI processing; third, enable AI powered apps anywhere, including at the Edge; and fourth, build and foster a vibrant AI ecosystem. With that backdrop, I'm excited that last week we announced a private preview of Capella iQ, which adds generative AI capabilities to our Capella offering to greatly enhance developer productivity. Developer productivity has never been more important given the pressure to rapidly innovate and deliver increasingly more complex workflows. This new capability in Capella will allow developers to use natural language prompts to quickly and easily generate queries and code, sample datasets and unit tests. What used to take a developer hours to code, takes minutes with Capella iQ, moving from thought to code in just a few clicks. I encourage you to visit our website and watch the demo video of Capella iQ to see just how profound of an impact the feature will have for developers. Leveraging generative AI to build and test applications more quickly and more easily in Capella leads to higher developer productivity and quality, with the ultimate result being faster and more efficient time to market. We expect this will drive increased Capella adoption and consumption. Our vision for Capella iQ is to be a co-pilot for developers that makes intelligent recommendations during the development process, and we will continue to build out and enhance this important new feature. On the go-to-market side, we continue to focus on improving efficiency by driving ongoing operational improvements and investing in our partner ecosystem. AI is undoubtedly gaining momentum across our partner ecosystem, which is why last week we also announced our Couchbase AI Accelerate Partner Program. This program is designed to make it easier for customers to build AI applications with Capella, and support integrations with the broader AI and data ecosystem. It reduces friction for customers who are building and deploying models for AI applications and includes technical, enablement and go-to-market opportunities for participating partners. Additionally, we continue to deepen and expand our relationships with our strategic partners who are starting to see next-gen AI applications deployed on their clouds. At AWS, we're developing ongoing ways to reach and serve our customers through an increasing number of go-to-market activities around joint asset creation, developer engagement and AWS summits around the world. And I'm happy to share that Couchbase is now a Google Cloud premier partner. The aforementioned recent announcements illustrate how exciting the AI opportunity tailwind is and how it drives further progress against our four key priorities for the year. While it is still early days, the potential for AI to drive significant transformation is enormous. That said, we continue to deliver additional important Capella innovations for customers at a rapid pace. Last week, we also announced several other new updates to Capella that further enhance the developer experience, increase efficiency, and make it easier to operate the cloud database platform. Our differentiated technology remains at the heart of who we are, and we will continue to work hard every day to rapidly bring market-leading enhancements and capabilities to our offering. Now, turning to customer wins, I am pleased with the breadth of activity across industries and our product portfolio that we saw this quarter. Starting with Capella, our managed service continues to gain momentum. Once again, Capella represented the majority of our new logos and was an important contributor to our strong net retention rate. In Q2, we saw new Capella wins across many industries, including financial services, academia, manufacturing, telco, hi-tech and gaming. We also continue to see existing customer migrations and expansions with Capella. During the quarter, leading global fintech company MoneyGram decided to expand its partnership with us and invest in Capella to offload database management and further improve TCO. Switching to enterprise, we were excited to add several impressive new logos during the quarter, including a large banking group in Europe. This customer had to migrate away from Oracle because its legacy relational database was not delivering the desired performance. This customer is using Couchbase for its derivatives clearing application and selected our platform for its superior performance and speed. I'm also pleased that we won an AI-powered application with Tondo Smart, a fast-growing technology company in Israel, that delivers a connected devices platform for smart cities. Tondo selected Couchbase to power its cloud-based smart city management platform, including AI for city sensor operational excellence use cases. This customer needed a cloud database platform that could deliver high performance, scalability and mobile use cases. Only Couchbase could deliver on these needs with the most compelling price performance. We also saw significant enterprise expansions with long-term customers, including a large Australian multinational banking company, one of the US's largest financial services companies and a major consumer electronics retailer. Additionally, Tesco, a British multinational grocery retailer and one of the world's largest retailers, has signed a multi-year agreement. Trendyol is the leading multi-category e-commerce marketplace in Turkey and one of the top e-commerce platforms in the world. Recently, Trendyol significantly expanded its partnership with Couchbase to help support many of its most important application, including its online shopping cart, delivery tracking, product catalog, coupons, claims, inventory management, pre-orders and customer personalization. This was one of the biggest expansions in our history, and we are pleased to be such a valued partner for Trendyol's growing business. Now let me provide a few thoughts on the near-term demand environment. As we discussed over the last two quarters, the macro uncertainty continues to present headwinds for IT spending and we continue to see longer deal cycles, extra layers of scrutiny in approval and customers electing to buy in smaller increments. These trends persisted through the end of the quarter, but I am very pleased with our execution against these headwinds. That said, we continue to see a healthy pipeline of deals and interest in our cloud database platform, driven by trends such as the rapid adoption of cloud, desire for greater cost efficiency and IT modernization. And though it is early days, we believe AI will drive a transformational impact for businesses, as customers re-imagine existing applications and create net new ones. AI requirements of extremely high performance and massive scale, coupled with the convergence of operational and analytical capabilities, are the foundational elements of how we are architected. These dynamics are creating additional tailwinds and opportunities for us as a company, while further leveraging the very strengths that make us who we are. You've often heard me say that Couchbase has been built for this moment, and I think that's as true today as it ever has been. In closing, we're making progress on our initiatives. We're committed to focusing on what we can control, and we are nimble in navigating areas we cannot control. We remain dedicated to delivering against our key priorities for fiscal 2024: focus on top-line growth; increase the mix of Capella; drive further sales and marketing efficiency; and accelerate the pace of leverage in our model. Before handing the call over to Greg, I want to emphasize one of our core values that I've repeated many times before. At Couchbase, we attack hard problems, driven by customer outcomes. With that, I'll hand the call over to Greg to walk you through our results in more detail. Greg?\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Matt, and thanks everyone for joining us. We had another strong quarter, as we beat guidance across all key metrics. Despite the elevated level of deal scrutiny that Matt mentioned, we are pleased with our execution, our dedication to delivering value to our customers, and our ability to navigate the environment, while driving healthy outperformance in our operating loss guidance. I'll now walk you through our second quarter in more detail, before providing our guidance for the third quarter and full year. Total annual recurring revenue, or ARR, was $180.7 million at the end of the second quarter, representing 24% growth year-over-year, or 23% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis, and 5% sequentially. Revenue for the second quarter was $43.1 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Recall that revenue in the year-ago quarter benefited from strong subscription revenue growth as well as outperformance in our on-demand business and strength in professional services, both of which are non-recurring. Subscription revenue for the second quarter was $41 million, an increase of 11% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. Professional services revenue for the second quarter was $2.2 million, a decline of 20% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, consistent with our expectations following outsized strength in professional services in fiscal 2023. We continue to expect contribution as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2024 to be below recent levels. Our ARR per customer performance in the second quarter was $261,000, up from $254,000 in the first quarter, up 14% year-over-year, and indicative of the growing wallet share we have with large customers. As a reminder, as Capella continues to grow in revenue contribution, we expect ARR per customer growth could moderate or decline in future quarters. Our dollar-based net retention rate, or NRR, continues to exceed 115%, driven by strong renewal and upsell activity across our base of larger enterprise customers. Our NRR has been steadily improving, thanks to Capella and our in-quarter NRR was the highest in the last three years. We exited the quarter with 691 customers, an increase of 12 net new customers from the first quarter. As Matt mentioned, Capella, once again, represented the majority of new logos in the quarter, and we grew our Capella customer logo count by more than 20% from the first quarter. We're encouraged by the strength of our new logo pipeline and remain confident in our ability to reliably expand logos, as evidenced by our consistent ARR growth and our strong retention metrics against a more challenging spending environment. In discussing the remainder of the income statement, please note that unless otherwise stated, all references to our expenses, results of operation and share count are on a non-GAAP basis. In Q2, our gross margin remained strong at 87.2%. This compares to a gross margin of 88.7% a year ago and 86.4% last quarter. As a reminder, as Capella mix increases, we expect gross margin will decline over time. Turning to expenses. We continue to invest to capture the generational opportunity we see in front of us, but are focused on improving the efficiency of our growth. We are pleased with our execution on this front as our expense discipline and early benefits from our cost saving initiatives resulted in us outperforming our operating loss outlook. Our sales and marketing expenses for Q2 were $28 million, or 65% of revenue, compared to $24.9 million, or 63% of revenue, a year-ago. Research and development expenses for Q2 were $12.6 million, or 29% of revenue, compared to $12.2 million, or 31% of revenue, a year-ago. We continue to thoughtfully invest in our as-a-service offering as well as in additional features to bolster our platform. General and administrative expenses for Q2 were $6.3 million, or 15% of total revenue, compared to $6.5 million, or 16% of revenue, a year ago. Non-GAAP operating loss for Q2 was $9.2 million or a negative 21% operating margin, 4 percentage points higher than the midpoint of our guidance, compared to an operating loss of $8.4 million or a negative 21% operating margin a year-ago. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders for Q2 was $8 million, or negative $0.17 per share. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q2 with $165.8 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We remain well capitalized to execute against our long-term growth strategy. Our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, totaled $170.6 million at the end of Q2, an increase of 2% year-over-year. We expect to recognize approximately 67% or $114.4 million of total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, which represents 11% year-over-year growth. Operating cash flow for Q2 was negative $500,000, and free cash flow was negative $1.6 million, or negative 4% free cash flow margin. We are pleased with the progress we have made in our free cash flow profile and remain committed to driving further improvement. Now, I will provide guidance for Q3 and the full year fiscal 2024. As Matt discussed, we continue to see solid momentum and our pipeline remains strong. Furthermore, we anticipate that our investments in our product capabilities, partner ecosystem and go-to-market motion will complement our momentum in fiscal 2024. That said, we are mindful of the macro headwinds and continue to carefully monitor their impact on our business, including bookings, pipeline conversion, retention and expansion rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, logo acquisition and sales productivity. As such, our outlook maintains a consistent degree of conservatism across all of those metrics to account for the uncertainty, as well as the lack of visibility into how the macro may impact consumption trends for emerging as a service offering. With these factors in mind, for the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we anticipate ARR in the range of $185 million to $188 million, which represents 23% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect total revenue in the range of $42.7 million to $43.3 million, or year-over-year growth of 12% at the midpoint. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of negative $9.9 million to negative $9.1 million. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we are raising our ARR outlook and now expect ARR in the range of $195.5 million to $199.5 million, or 21% growth at the midpoint. This compares to our prior outlook of $191.5 million to $195.5 million, or 18% growth at the midpoint. We continue to expect total revenue in the range of $171.7 million to $174.7 million, or a year-over-year growth of 12% at the midpoint. As a reminder, we've historically seen variability with respect to the implementation timing of certain enterprise deals, which impacts our revenue visibility, along with new or migrated Capella customers. We, therefore, continue to view ARR as a better indicator than revenue of the strength of our business. While we anticipated that contribution from services revenue in fiscal 2024 would be below recent levels, we now expect this dynamic to be more pronounced this fiscal year due to customers electing fewer services as a result of macro-related budgetary pressures as well as the naturally lower services attach rate with Capella. And finally, we are decreasing our operating loss outlook and now expect a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of negative $42.5 million to negative $38.5 million. With that, Matt and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Hedberg: Great, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the results here. Matt, I want to start with you. I think the way you outlined kind of the four ways you're thinking about Gen AI was super helpful. And I think in your script, you mentioned you plan to monetize it with sort of increased Capella adoption and consumption. But I'm wondering, for some of the other products like Capella iQ, is there an additional monetization strategy with that?\nMatt Cain: Matt, good to hear from you. Simple answer is that will be part of the Capella offering and we expect to monetize it with additional consumption, more developer reach, better go-to-market efficiency. So, we think there is a compelling impact to the business, but as far as, the service itself is will be part of again part of Capella.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. That makes lot of sense. And then, I know on the hyperscaler front, I know you've had a lot of progress with AWS. It was great to hear your comments on GCP this quarter. I'm just sort of wondering when you're seeing deals come in through partners like that, what is the profile of those customers look like? And how would you talk about sort of the pipeline for those hyperscaler-type deals?\nMatt Cain: Hey, Matt. So, we're excited about the ongoing momentum with AWS, obviously, the bar that we got over with GCP and their premier program, the announcement with our AI specific partner program and the benefits that are going bringing there. Investing in the ecosystem and thinking about our customers and developers and the total tools they want to use, partnerships are going to continue to be a big part of our business. Quite frankly, we're seeing success with partners across all deal types, up to and including our very largest customers that are working on Capella migrations, all the way to our [$5,000] (ph) starter packs and relatively new regions for us. We think a lot about not just partner source, but partner influence. And you can appreciate that all of the partner that we work with have tremendous reach and credibility with customers. And the extent to which we can build joint solutions, and have strategic account plans, and do territory planning with them, all of which we're seeing across the business really beneficial to us and a big part of that go-to-market efficiency that we've been talking about for some time.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks a lot, Matt. Well done.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nIttai Kidron: Thank you. Greg, I wanted to ask you about revenue, ARR and cRPO. So, looking at your revenue growth, I think it's the fifth quarter in a row where it's declining, decelerating from over 30% to now under 10% on a year-over-year basis. Your ARR, however, is holding quite firm at the 23%, 24% range. And you're cRPO is in the teens, in the low-teens. So, help me reconcile the three, how should I think about the evolution of these three key metrics going forward and why are they so far apart, I guess?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Hey, Ittai. Good to hear from you. Yeah, well, first I'd point out just ARR, obviously, does not include services or any of our on-demand business, whereas revenue and RPO, cRPO would pick all that up. So, there is a little bit of sort of apples and oranges there. And again, just for the revenue perspective, particularly for this quarter, there was a couple of things. Our subscription business continued to do well. Services, as we talked about it in our script, has been more impacted because of the macro, and so the demand is less. So, we're seeing that. And obviously, last year at this time, just from a year-over-year comparison, we sort of peaked from both subscription revenue and services revenue. And that's not repeating. I think the subscription revenue -- software revenue has been reasonably constant and we think we will continue to see an improvement on the subscription revenue as we go forward. On RPO and cRPO in particular, when we get towards some of the later stages of our contracts, whether their one-year or multi-year, that's when they sort of less in the performance -- remaining performance obligations. So, we have a couple of our largest customers that are up for renewal between now and Q1, and we think that we will see -- start seeing an improvement on the RPO as well.\nIttai Kidron: Okay. And just to be clear, you said Capella is not part of ARR.\nGreg Henry: No, Capella is part of ARR. What's not part of ARR is professional services, any on-demand business.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. And is it common to see Capella on demand, or it's mostly one-year contracts?\nGreg Henry: I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?\nIttai Kidron: Capella is it common to see consumption there on demand or is it mostly one-year contracts or one or three year?\nGreg Henry: The largest majority of the Capella business today is our annual credit model, which would fall into ARR.\nIttai Kidron: Got it, okay. Matt, one for you on the competitive side of the equation. Help me understand what you're seeing out there and what is changing for you. Some of your competitors are doing very well in the marketplace. I'm just trying to think about where do you see your place in the market. And then, on the competitive front, anything from a win rate standpoint, would greatly appreciate it. Thank you.\nMatt Cain: Look, Ittai, generally speaking, I'm pleased with how competitive we are. If we think about the nature of applications that we serve, the demand for high-performance and scalability and cloud to edge architectures have never been more prevalent than they are today. I think what's exciting to us is the additional, what I would call, at-bats that we're getting with Capella and moving down market and bringing the full power of the Couchbase platform and all those benefits with the consumption model that is often preferred by customers, certainly, a majority of them. But when we get into competitive situations and we do proof of concepts and show the power of the platform and the integration of the services, the value proposition, the TCO dynamics, the do more with less, I would say, in some ways, those value propositions have never been more relevant than they are now. And I think it increases the value that people see in our platform both existing and new customers. So, I'm pleased with how we compete. We wake up every day with the appetite to do more and do better. But we're well positioned with dynamics like migration to cloud, modernization and many other things that we've talked about before.\nIttai Kidron: All right, good. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Ittai.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you. This is [Dion] (ph) for Sanjit. I first have a higher level question sort of on the AI strategy that you laid out. I mean, it really resonates. And the way that we trying to you sort of think about these impacts are mostly in two ways, right, the new workloads related to AI apps, and then the migration which, in many cases, gets accelerated through AI. When you're thinking about kind of those two opportunities and I think you spent lot time talking about the first one of those two, where do you see kind of the big opportunities one or two years out? And then, what are you doing today to position for both or maybe for the bigger ones more so than the other ones? Anything that you can kind of share around your strategy, both on the migration side as well as kind of the new workloads side that you already talked about?\nMatt Cain: Yeah, look, I appreciate the question. I think if we step back and say why is -- why we are all so excited about AI, we think it's the next great catalyst for applications, both existing and new. And we talk a lot about the demand for rich, personalized, customized applications that we use in our personal and professional lives. And the demands on the database to be able to bring all that data to light, combine operational and analytical capabilities, leverage services like indexing, eventing and search in a single platform, that's never been more relevant. And if you think about the amount of data that's going to need to be processed to further bring light with even more personalization and customization for future applications, that lends itself very well to the Couchbase platform that was built for scale and performance from cloud to edge with TCO benefits. We're spending a lot of time with large customers today on their future plans of AI, and us being a platform that is strategic to them for their existing applications. At the same time, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we had a net new customer in an emerging geography that is an AI company for smart cities that realized the Couchbase was the platform that they needed to process all their data and enable the application that they're building. So, as we have always done, we take an architectural approach to the data layer. And then, upon a solid foundation, integrate services in a compelling way for both customers and developers. You combine all that with the Capella consumption model, and we're really bringing a lot of capabilities together in a seamless way that quite frankly other vendors just aren't architected to do, certainly at the scale and performance. And so, I think we're going to be able to get at both migrations and new workloads. As we look at the effect on our business, because of the size of some of our existing customers, when we monetize a migration that can be a little bit of a bigger contribution out of the gate, but we certainly spend a lot of time and attention on new logos. So, we'll be able to track the trending of which one is a bigger impact over time. But you'd be hard-pressed to find any customer that is thinking about a future data platform strategy that isn't inclusive of AI. And we think an integrated platform is the winning strategy and we're excited about our path forward.\nUnidentified Analyst: Makes a lot of sense. And then maybe just one quick follow-up question. Just when I'm thinking about reconciling the customer numbers, I think you have 12 customers this quarter, which was a step up from last quarter, but still maybe compared to your commentary around pushing down market around kind of view customer momentum, particularly around Capella, seems still a little bit low compared to some of the levels that you put out last quarter. Is there any way that you can help us think about sort of the new customer signings piece versus the customer churn piece? Is that churn piece still kind of weighing down that net add number? Or any kind of more granularity you can share on that, that would be super helpful.\nGreg Henry: Yeah, happy to give some color there. So, to your question, yes, we are still seeing a bit more churn on our smaller customers like we did last quarter, which are macro impacted. They do not have a big dollar impact. Our gross ads are performing well and in line with what we've seen historically. And as we mentioned in the script, Capella logo count actually is up 20% quarter-over-quarter. So, we're actually very pleased with how Capella is performing. We're still working through some of that smaller business churn. But overall, we think that we're going to start seeing sort of more favorable impacts to the customer count as we move forward through the second half of the year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRaimo Lenschow: Perfect. Thank you. Can you speak a little bit to what you see in terms of pipeline and how pipeline is evolving? It looks like this quarter things continue to improve for you. But like if you think about like early stage pipeline as you think about the back part of the year, what are you seeing there? And then, I have one quick follow-up.\nMatt Cain: Raimo, the simple answer is we feel really good about it. And hopefully, you've come to appreciate the level of detail that we have in how we measure that, everything from expansions in the back half, how we expect those to grow migrations to Capella, new logos and understand the dynamics that are different there, the early stage Capella progression in terms of trials into active deals. And so, I think as we look across the entirety of the pipeline, both in terms of size, scale, velocity, those metrics look really good. And we feel confident about the demand of the product, and quite frankly the execution of the go-to-market team to continue to grow and nurture the pipeline for the back half and beyond. But overall, I think it's an exciting mix of opportunities and indicative of the optimism we have in the business as we go forward.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yeah. And then, as we think about the professional services going forward and when you speak about revenue, subscription revenue was obviously better. Like, how do you think about the glide path there in terms of -- that professional services obviously then going to be a little bit of a headwind all the time. Like, how do you think about managing that journey, Greg? Thank you. Congrats from me as well.\nGreg Henry: Yeah, thanks Raimo. Look, we obviously think professional services is key to our business. We believe it actually generates more software sales, long-term for us. But right now, what we're seeing is customers when they're budget-constrained due to macro, they are opting to continue and grow on the software side, but a little bit less on the services side. So, services as we talked about at the beginning of the year would be slightly down versus last year. Given we outperformed last year, there's probably little slightly a bit more of a headwind than we expected. The second part of that is, as we get more and more into Capella, given that it's a service in to itself that the customers are going to have a less smaller attach rate to the Capella business from a service perspective. So, I think both of those things are starting to play right now. But look, we still think services are important for customers and we'll continue to push them, but we're very pleased at how the software part of the business is outperforming while services is a slight offset to that.\nRaimo Lenschow: Yeah. Very clear. Thank you very much. Congrats.\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Raimo.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Oliver: Great. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had two. Greg, I'll start with you since there was one earlier on customer count. So, the 20% growth in Capella customers, certainly sounds great. And then just from some of the other commentary you guys made, trying to triangulate it, feels like the contribution might be about half new logos and half existing customers on Capella. Is that right? And how should we think about that going forward? I know you guys have said Capella is going to be the single best source of new logos for you. But sort of in the coming quarters, how should we think about that split?\nGreg Henry: From a new logo perspective, Rob, is that...\nRob Oliver: Yes. Yeah, like, I'm thinking more Capella adds. It seems like -- because you guys had 20% growth of Capella customers, but based on your customers added and the commentary around that, some of them aren't new logos. So, I just wanted to get a sense of how that split is.\nGreg Henry: Yeah. I think -- so couple of things. One is we do expect that Capella will continue to be the majority of new logos, as we go forward into the second half of the year and into next year. That's just where we're seeing the most momentum. I would remind you that we do have customers that have both enterprise, Couchbase enterprise and Couchbase Capella. And so, in the total customer count, we only count them as one, but obviously when we give you the Capella customers, everybody who's got Capella, but some of them also have enterprise. So, just when you're trying to sort of reconcile the math, just to be aware of that. But again, we expect there to be the majority of that being Capella, but we're still obviously, as Matt was talking about the pipeline, we still have a good pipeline around enterprise business, too. So, we still plan on driving new logo business there. In terms of, if you think about ARR and revenue, clearly the migrations will be the larger, because given our enterprise nature and the large customers, that will make up the bigger amount in the near term until the newer customers get ramped up.\nRob Oliver: Okay, helpful, thanks. And then, Matt, you've gotten a couple of questions on AI and some of the macro already. So, I guess I'll ask about, Capella consumption trends intra-quarter, kind of what you're seeing in terms of customer usage for those that adopt Capella? Any color there would be really helpful. Thanks, guys.\nMatt Cain: Rob, we said a couple of times that we have really high expectations for Capella and we're pleased with the momentum. In terms of consumption, I would say that's meeting, if not exceeding, even our internal expectations. I think it's proving the value proposition of do more with less, getting people focused on application development while we run the database. I think they are realizing the benefits of the underlying Couchbase platform, faster, with more efficiency. We've talked about the -- driving the majority of net new logos, we're also seeing improvement on net retention rate, driven by the success of Capella. Your comment on balancing migrations in new logos is really important to us. While we are certainly focused on and excited on new logos and the area that we will do better, we see some really healthy migrations on Capella. In addition to the ones we provided, one of the largest hospitality companies in the world that's been an existing customer of ours, aggressively pursuing next-generation apps with Capella for the value proposition of scale and performance and cost effectiveness. And that's just one example. As we look at the pipeline and the planning that we're doing with existing customers, while managing the pipeline of new. We're looking at consumption dynamics in both cohorts, if you will. And my comment on exceeding expectations actually pertains to both, which is something adding to our excitement about Capella overall.\nRob Oliver: Great. Helpful color. Thank you very much.\nMatt Cain: Thanks.\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJason Ader: Yes, thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Just wanted to ask about the go-to-market side. I know we talked a lot about Capella here on this call. But are there any specific initiatives on the go-to-market side that are helping you get in front of new enterprise customers, which still seems to be like a challenge for you guys to get in front of -- to get the ad-bats and to get in front of those prospects?\nMatt Cain: Yeah, Jason, I would say there's probably not a thing that we're doing on the go-to-market side that isn't focused on getting in front of new customers, everything from demand, announcing new capabilities, building our pipeline, establishing channel programs, investing in geographies that are relatively new to us where we are seeing disproportionate demand and faster return. I think one of the things that we're very mindful of is, you need a compelling event for an application to be developed. And for the applications that we serve and a lot of cases they are truly mission critical, and there is a time element to that initial land. We've talked about shortening that quite a bit with Capella. But our teams are maniacally focused on new customer acquisition and managing the pipeline and there's not an hour that goes by at Couchbase that we're not thinking about how to get better there. So, as Greg mentioned, we expect that to improve. We're seeing the leading indicators that we would want. And I think it's an area that I would say unquestionably we can and will do better as we go forward.\nJason Ader: And just following up on that, Matt, can you talk about how any geographies? You mentioned sort of disproportionate success in certain geos. Anything that you can expand on there?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Hey, Jason, it's Greg. I'll add it. I mean look, there's a couple of regions in particular. So, we actually broke out are sort of EMEA region and we run it as Europe and then to TIMEA, which is Turkey, Israel, Middle East and Africa, and we're seeing very good activity there. We have a great leader there. And then the other one, which we've been investing in the last couple of years, is Asia Pacific, which has also been doing very well. And as you can imagine, because we're newer there, newer technology, we're seeing a lot of Capella activity and a lot of new logo activity coming out of Asia Pacific. So, those regions are really starting to become much more impactful to the business, as we've invested there over the last few years.\nJason Ader: Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Reback: Oh, great. Thanks very much. Matt, any reason you wouldn't break Capella out next year?\nMatt Cain: In what sense, Brad, like, reporting-wise?\nBrad Reback: Yes.\nMatt Cain: We expect to break that out when we're ready and are excited to be at the point that we can do that.\nBrad Reback: Okay. Switching gears, thoughts around using M&A to gain scale? Thanks.\nMatt Cain: Yeah, Brad, I mean I think we pride ourselves at being agile with our strategy and we're always doing build by partner analysis. It's something that would be an ongoing consideration for us. And as we think particularly about M&A, there is benefits beyond scale, like an improving the platform in a particular area. So, I'd say it's part of what we do, but I'm not prepared to make comments beyond that.\nBrad Reback: Great. Thanks very much.\nMatt Cain: Thanks, Brad.\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Brad.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Taz Koujalgi with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTaz Koujalgi: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. One for what [indiscernible] Greg. Greg, I mean you don't focus on billings as much, focus mostly on revenues and ARR. But if you look at the billings number this quarter, looks a little bit light. I think seasonally down sequentially, which is I believe never happened before. So, anything to call out there on the billing metric, any headwind on the invoicing or duration front?\nGreg Henry: No, not really, I would say, Taz. I mean, again, we've tried to say that billings for us is a bit noisy. We don't focus on that too much. We think ARR is a better measure, and a lot of it had to do with the timing of some of the renewals. Because we are still -- the predominant part of our business is the enterprise business. And the renewal timing or annual upfront when we get those billings is when we do the renewal. So, no, I wouldn't read into anything about the billings. Durations are steady, if not slightly improving from sort of the lows we saw in the sort of worst of the macro.\nTaz Koujalgi: Got it. Then just one follow-up for Matt. Matt, you've seen strong strength in Capella in the last few quarters. On the go-to-market motion for Capella, is there a self-service element where people are signing up Capella without requiring a field guy or a sales rep to get to them? If you could just comment on any self-service motion with Capella traction versus direct sales selling Capella to your customers?\nMatt Cain: Yeah, Taz, it's certainly part of the Capella value proposition. What I would say, complementing our more direct, highly instrumented, go-to-market model, enabling developers to come to us in their evaluation initial purchase, et cetera. So, it's certainly something that we're actively building as a complement to the overall business. And one of the benefits that we see there is, not just for new logos, but expansion activity where people within our existing accounts can get at new applications faster. So, we're focusing a lot on what we call the developer experience and getting into product-led growth. All of which is possible with the Capella offering and we're excited about the instrumentation and we have in place and the leading indicators of what that will do to the overall business.\nTaz Koujalgi: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Taz.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Howard Ma with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nHoward Ma: Thank you. Greg, ARR guidance assumes that you add about the same amount of net new ARR in the second half of the year as the $17 million added in the first half. Can you remind us if new bookings is normally more back-half weighted? And if so, are there any offsetting factors this year that would make the two halves more equal?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Hey, Howard. Appreciate the question. Look, obviously we feel good about the ARR performance and even the ARR guide and the outlook we have in the second half. To your question about the bookings, yes, there is slightly more weighted towards the bookings in the second half, particularly Q4 tends to be our largest bookings quarter. Again, this is the guidance which we feel good about it. As we've stated before, we set up guidance to hopefully at a minimum meet that, if not beat it. And again, we feel good about the momentum we have heading into the second half.\nHoward Ma: Okay, great. Thanks. And for Matt, do you think new Gen AI capabilities could accelerate your new customer acquisition engine near term? For instance, do you have any evidence that Capella customer prospects are placing more weight on capabilities, such as coating co-pilots when choosing a database management system, or is Gen AI more of a mechanism to drive expansion among existing customers? Thank you.\nMatt Cain: Howard, I think the simple question -- simple answer to the question is, yes. And we were excited to announce Capella iQ. I would tell you that the early sign-ups for private preview have exceeded my expectation, which I think is indicative of new customer activity. And if you think about the value proposition of Capella and just making it so much easier for developers, so much more efficient to get the full benefit of Couchbase, that's really important to us. And quite frankly something that we think is going to add a lot to how people think about and then directly and quickly experience Couchbase. So I think it's going to be an accelerant on both sides, new and migrations.\nHoward Ma: Great. That's encouraging. Thank you.\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Howard.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Rudy Kessinger with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nRudy Kessinger: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. On Capella, I know I speak for everybody in this call [regularly] (ph) awaiting further metrics you can share, could you at least comment maybe directionally just how Capella has trended as a percentage of new bookings over the last several quarters? Any increase you've seen? I know you said it's been the majority of customer signings. But how is it trending as a percentage of new bookings or total bookings? Anything you can share?\nGreg Henry: Yeah. Hey, Rudy. It's Greg. Good to hear from you. Yeah, look, again, Capella every quarter becomes a larger percentage of pretty much every metric, whether it's bookings, revenue, ARR or customer accounts. It just, it continues to grow. And so, which is what we expected. So, yeah, it just becomes a bigger component every quarter, because it's growing faster than the rest of the business.\nRudy Kessinger: Okay, fair enough. And on the ARR outperformance in the quarter and the $4 million raise for the year, what's the primary driver there? It sounds like that is primarily consumption exceeding expectations, but I know FX also flipped to a 1% tailwind in the quarter. Did that have any impact on the $4 million raise for the year?\nGreg Henry: A little bit, not as much. I think it was two things. I think it's the Capella acceleration we talked about the net retention rate continuing to improve and it being the best in three years. So that was -- part of it driven by Capella. But, Matt, also referred to some large enterprise deals we closed in the quarter with some very material expansion. So it's really -- again, it's a combination of both, I see it as sort of just broad-based performance in the quarter, quite honestly in terms of where we had set guidance and the pipeline strong. So, we're again excited for what we did here in the second quarter and the second half outlook.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to management for any closing comments.\nMatt Cain: Thanks, operator. To recap, we had another strong quarter. We remain excited about our opportunity with Capella, due to some very big trends in our favor. The rapid adoption of cloud, desire for greater cost efficiency, IT modernization and of course AI. We are cognizant of the macro environment and are sharply focused on execution during times like this, while also building for what we believe will be a very exciting future. Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings, and welcome to the Couchbase First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Edward Parker, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Parker, you may begin.\nEdward Parker: Good afternoon, and welcome to Couchbase's first quarter 2024 earnings call. We will be discussing the results announced in our press release issued after the market close today. With me are Couchbase's Chair, President and CEO, Matt Cain; and CFO, Greg Henry. Today's call will contain forward-looking statements which include statements concerning financial and business trends and strategies, market size and expected future business and financial performance and financial condition, and our guidance for future periods. These statements reflect our views as of today only and should not be relied upon as representing our views at any subsequent date and we do not undertake any duty to update these statements. Forward-looking statements, by their nature, address matters that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. For a discussion of the material risks and other important factors that could affect our actual results, please refer to the risks discussed in today's press release and our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. During the call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, as well as how we define these metrics and other metrics, is included in our earnings press releases which are available on our Investor Relations website. With that, let me turn the call over to Matt.\nMatt Cain: Thank you, Edward. And good afternoon, everyone. On today's call, Greg and I will provide details on our first quarter results, as well as our second quarter and full-year fiscal 2024 guidance. I'll start off with a few highlights of our Q1 financial results. Couchbase delivered a strong quarter beating our guidance across all metrics. I'm pleased with the team's execution on our strategy to deliver topline momentum, while outperforming on profitability all against a difficult economic environment. Total annual recurring revenue or ARR was $172.2 million, up 23% year-over-year. Revenue in Q1 was $41 million, up 18% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP gross margin remains best-in-class at 86.4%. Non-GAAP operating loss was $12.9 million and non-GAAP operating margin was 5 percentage points above the midpoint of our implied guidance range, demonstrating our continued operating expense discipline and focus on driving leverage in our model. I'm proud of how the business is performing despite the macro environment. And I believe we are more strategically aligned than ever before. Indeed, while there are external factors outside of our control, we continue to focus on what we can control. Innovating and investing for an exciting future, while placing increased rigor on our expense discipline. Recall that last quarter, we laid out our key priorities for fiscal 2024. Focus on top line growth, increase the mix of Capella, drive further sales and marketing efficiency and accelerate the pace of leverage in our model. I'll comment on Capella and our go-to-market progress and Greg will provide more details on the impact they're having on our growth and leverage results. Starting with Capella. Our R&D team is rapidly innovating to enhance our offering, reduce barriers to adoption and deliver even more value for customers. Last week, we announced our newest release of Capella, which will be accessible by the popular developer platform Netlify and features a New Visual Studio Code extension. This release makes it easier for developers and development teams to build modern applications on Capella. We also extended Capella's enterprise features and deployability, including new time series data capabilities to support a broader set of use cases. Looking forward, we will continue to focus our product innovation towards making Capella more accessible for customers and on improving the developer experience, all while delivering the enterprise-grade capabilities that have been the core of our DNA. In addition to Capella innovation, we continue to invest in initiatives that drive developer adoption and more efficiently drive growth. These are enabling users to discover the power of Couchbase sooner and are accelerating product-led growth for both new and existing customers. As a result of our efforts, we're enjoying higher engagement and visibility at more developer meet-ups and conferences, increased content consumption on a revamped developer website and valuable feedback from some of our most strategic customers at developer workshops. Customers are selecting Capella for their long-term cloud modernization strategies due to its performance, speed, scalability and flexibility advantages. Capella's best-in-class TCO and unique value proposition are especially important differentiators for cost-conscious customers during times like this. On the go-to-market side, we continue to create further sales and marketing efficiency by driving ongoing operational improvements and investing in our partner ecosystem. Last month, we announced the availability of Capella on Microsoft Azure marketplace further simplifying the process for customers to adopt Capella and deploy applications on their cloud of choice. We are excited about the opportunity for our Azure partnership to accelerate the adoption of Capella and bring the power of Couchbase to more organizations. Also on the partnership front, we are building on the momentum of our recently enhanced ISV partner program in conjunction with our expanded relationship with AWS through the launch of our ISV Starter Factory. This program supports ISVs with additional tools and resources to build and modernize their applications with Capella on AWS, reducing complexity and making it easier for organizations to modernize and migrate their applications. We remain closely aligned with AWS and are excited to participate in an increasing number of go-to-market activities with them. These include joint asset creation, developer engagement and AWS summits around the world. We will continue to evolve and broaden our partner ecosystem in order to help organizations accelerate their application development journey and grow our reach in the market. Now turning to wins from the quarter. I am pleased with the breadth of our customer activity across a broad range of industries, including technology, e-commerce, healthcare and travel. Starting with Capella, we're seeing increasing engagement and uptake of our as a service offering. During the quarter, we crossed a key milestone with the number of Capella customers now in the triple-digits growing dramatically year-over-year. Some exciting new wins included a fast-growing pet health and wellness company, a NextGen real estate technology company and a revenue cycle management software company. We also continue to see existing customers migrating to Capella. A Fortune 500 energy customer that leverages Couchbase for its main field application decided to migrate a meaningful portion of its estate to Capella. This six-figure deal was one of our largest Capella deals in the quarter demonstrating how our large enterprise customers can leverage the full capabilities of Couchbase while enjoying the greater flexibility, efficiency in TCO inherent to our on-demand offering. A Capella expansion during the quarter came from public and is really based online media company, which uses Couchbase to power its indexing and query for its search engine. As public continues to scale its business, it's expanding its investment in Capella, because they see compelling cost efficiencies compared to competitor solutions. On the enterprise front, we want to spotlight LinkedIn, who serves over 1.4 million profiles per second at its peak. They recently published an article outlining how their existing open source platform could no longer address the loads on their storage infrastructure, which was doubling every year. LinkedIn selection of Couchbase as a centralized storage tier cash resulted in more than a 60% reduction in tail latencies and trim the cost to serve by over 10% annually. Now turning to some thoughts on the near-term environment. As I have said before, there are things we can control and things we cannot control. We were prepared for both heading into Q1 and the quarter played out largely as we expected. One variable we, of course, cannot control is the macro environment. As we discussed last quarter and as you've been hearing from many of our technology peers, the uncertainty and volatility continues to present headwinds for IT spending. We're seeing longer deal cycles, extra layers of scrutiny and approval and customers electing to buy in smaller increments. These trends persisted through the end of the quarter and I am extremely pleased with our ability to navigate these headwinds. At the same time, we feel good about what we can control which includes driving operational efficiency while preparing for the future by building our field capacity and pipeline. We're committed to improving our profitability and if necessary have the right levers to find further leverage in our model and react accordingly. That said, demand indicators remain strong and we continue to see a healthy pipeline of deals and interest in our cloud database platform. The big secular trends of digital transformation, acceleration of the cloud and innovation at the edge are still in our favor. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the topic dominating everyone's minds. Let me spend a moment touching on how the fast-moving wave of AI-driven applications will power if not accelerate the secular tailwinds that offer specific opportunities aligned with our strengths. At Couchbase, we're exploring a wide range of initiatives both internally and externally to leverage AI to increase efficiencies across various aspects of our business. Some examples of this include research, generating tests and test data for code, exploring how generative AI can drive developer productivity and adoption of Capella and making our platform more operationally efficient. And while the benefits for Couchbase specifically in the industry more broadly are real and exciting, we believe the implications for our business and mission are more profound and increasing productivity and efficiency alone. Consider the following: the processing of unstructured data in real-time is becoming a necessity; modern applications require predictive insights and real-time decision-making for personalization; and the models are moving closer to the data for improved control and faster time to processing; this series of events collides when enterprises, who are building AI-driven insights into their next-generation applications leverage AI to run private models. It's at this point, where enterprise will require the combination of a high-performance operational database with analytical functionality making this an exciting opportunity for Couchbase. Much of the promise of generative AI is only recently being understood. But these core concepts will be familiar to many of you, who have been following Couchbase, because they are all foundational elements of how we are architected. Clearly, there is more to do to capitalize on this opportunity, but you've often heard me say that Couchbase has been built for this moment and I think that's as true today as it's ever been. In closing, we had a solid start to the year and the secular drivers behind our business remained strong. We're making progress on our initiatives, our committed to focusing on what we can control and are nimble in navigating areas we cannot control. Before handing the call over to Greg, I want to emphasize one of our core values that I've repeated many times. At Couchbase, we attack hard problems driven by customer outcomes. With that, I'll hand the call over to Greg to walk you through our results in more detail. Greg?\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Matt. And thanks everyone for joining us. We had another strong quarter as we beat guidance across all key metrics. Despite the elevated level of deal scrutiny that Matt talked about, we are pleased with our execution, our dedication to delivering value to our customers and our ability to navigate the environment, while driving healthy outperformance in our operating loss guidance. I'll now walk you through our first quarter in more detail before providing our guidance for the second quarter and full-year. Total annual recurring revenue or ARR was $172.2 million at the end of the first quarter, representing 23% growth year-over-year. Revenue for the first quarter was $41 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year. Subscription revenue for the first quarter was $38.5 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year. Professional services revenue for the first quarter was $2.5 million, a decline of 15% year-over-year, consistent with our expectations following outsized strength in professional services in fiscal 2023. We continue to expect the contribution as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2024 to be slightly below recent levels. Our ARR per customer performance in the first quarter was $254,000, up from $242,000 in the fourth quarter and indicative of the growing wallet share we have with large customers. As a reminder, as Capella continues to grow in revenue contribution, we expect ARR per customer growth could moderate or decline in future quarters. Our dollar-based net retention rate continues to exceed 115%, driven by strong renewal and upsell activity across our base of larger enterprise customers. We exited the quarter with 679 customers, an increase of four net new customers from the fourth quarter. Our gross customer addition count was consistent with levels we saw in Q1 over the past two years, but we did see some challenges with a handful of smaller mid-market customers, who are being impacted by the macroeconomic environment, including some who are no longer in business. That said, we're encouraged by the strength of our new logo pipeline and remain confident in our ability to reliably expand logos as evidenced by our consistent ARR growth and our strong retention metrics against a more challenging spending environment. In discussing the remainder of the income statement, please note that unless otherwise stated all references to our expenses, results of operations and share count were on a non-GAAP basis. In Q1, our gross margin remained strong at 86.4%. This compares to a gross margin of 87.3% a year ago and 86.3% last quarter. As a reminder, as Capella mix increases, we expect gross margin will decline over time. Turning to expenses. We continue to invest to capture the generational opportunity we see in front of us, but our focus on improving the efficiency of our growth. We are pleased with our execution on this front as our expense discipline and early benefits from cost savings initiatives resulted in outperforming our operating loss outlook. Our sales and marketing expenses for Q1 were $29.2 million or 71% of revenue, compared to $24.8 million or 71% of revenue a year ago. Q1 included costs associated with our annual sales kickoff event, which was held in-person this year, compared to last year's virtual format. Research and development expenses for Q1 were $12.5 million or 31% of revenue, compared to $12.5 million or 36% of revenue a year ago. We continue to thoughtfully invest in our as-a-service offering, as well as an additional features to bolster our platform. General and administrative expenses for Q1 were $6.7 million was 16% of total revenue, compared to $6.5 million from 19% of revenue a year ago. Non-GAAP operating loss for Q1 was $12.9 million or negative 32% operating margin, 5 percentage points higher than the midpoint of our guidance, compared to an operating loss of $13.4 million or negative 38% operating margin a year ago. Non-GAAP net loss attributable to common stockholders for Q1 was $12.3 million from negative $0.27 per share. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. We ended Q1 with $163.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We remain well capitalized to execute against our long-term growth strategy. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO totaled $165.6 million at the end of Q1, a decrease of 2% year-over-year. We expect to recognize approximately 68% or $112.1 million of total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, which represents 11% year-over-year growth. As we have noted, our total RPO performance has been impacted by a year-over-year contraction in billings terms as some customers are electing shorter-term contracts due to the macro uncertainty and because our sales plans no longer incentivize multiyear contracts as aggressively. Operating cash flow for Q1 was negative $7.2 million and free cash flow was negative $8.5 million or negative 21% free cash flow margin. We are pleased with the progress we have made in our free cash flow profile. We remain committed to driving further improvements. Now, I will provide guidance for Q2 and the full-year fiscal 2024. As Matt discussed, we continue to see solid momentum and our pipeline remains strong. Furthermore, we anticipate that our investments in our product capabilities, partner ecosystem and go-to-market motion will complement our momentum in fiscal 2024. That said, we are mindful of the macro headwinds and continue to carefully monitor their impact on our business, including bookings, pipeline conversion, retention expansion rates, deal sizes, sales cycles, logo acquisition and sales productivity. As such, our outlook maintains an elevated degree of conservatism across all these metrics to account for the uncertainty as well as the lack of visibility into how the macro may impact consumption trends for our emerging as-a-service offering. With these factors in mind, for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect total revenue in the range of $41.2 million to $41.8 million or a year-over-year growth of 4% at the midpoint. We anticipate ARR in the range of $176 million to $179 million, which represents 22% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. We expect a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of negative $10.9 million to negative $10.1 million. For the full year of fiscal 2024, we are raising our ARR outlook while maintaining our revenue guidance and decreasing our operating loss. We expect total revenue in the range of $171.7 million to $174.7 million or a year-over-year growth of 12% at the midpoint. As a reminder, we've historically seen variability with respect to the implementation timing of certain enterprise deals which impacts our revenue visibility along with new or migrated Capella customers. We therefore continue to view ARR as a better indicator than revenue of the strength of our business. We expect ARR in the range of $191.5 million to $195.5 million or 18% growth at the midpoint. And finally, we expect a non-GAAP operating loss in the range of negative $43 million to negative $39 million. With that, Matt and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question comes from Sanjit Singh with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nSanjit Singh: Thank you for taking the questions. And congrats on a nice start to the year net new ARR growth. I wanted to start my first question with guidance and just sort of look at that 22% ARR growth that you did this quarter. I think on a net ARR basis was even a little bit better than that. If I look at sort of the back half of the year in terms of what's implies, it implies I think flattish or actually down year-over-year net new ARR growth? And so just in terms of the expectations coming into this year than what you saw in Q1, just wanted to get a sense of -- are you seeing the year sort of come in as you expect it or it mean the underlying assumptions are largely holding or did you see incremental deterioration versus what you've guided to approximately 90 days ago?\nMatt Cain: Hey. Sanjit. This is Matt. I'll provide some opening commentary and then hand it over to Greg. Look, as we stepped into the year, I think we were particularly careful on articulating our perspective of things that we can control versus things that we can't. And as we mentioned in the remarks that played out largely as we expected in Q1. We continue to be excited about the progress we're making operationally everything from Capella to go to market. At the same time, we're cognizant of the fact that the macroeconomic situation persists and we want to be responsible with that as we think about the rest of the year. So I would say as -- at a very high level, things are progressing as we anticipated and Q1 was a nice start to enable us to have the year that we know is possible. There are some specifics around the number which Greg can give some perspective on.\nGreg Henry: Yes, Sanjit, thanks. Look, again, we feel very good about Q1 and the overall look. We have relatively good visibility, particularly into Q2 some deals obviously have closed now and we see the renewals expansion. Some of the consumption trending for Q2. The pipeline remains healthy. And so for the full-year, we're pleased that we raised the guidance by the beat in Q1 and we see that -- we still want to maintain an elevated level of conservatism. And as we've always stated, we established guidance to at a minimum deliver that if not try to overachieve as we go through the year. So that's how we sort of maintain the posture. But as Matt said, we're pleased and we think things are off to good start.\nSanjit Singh: That's helpful color. And then the LinkedIn comment was certainly a nice feather in the cap type win, any sort of context you could give us where they Couchbase, sort of, customary for before they start to replace their -- that core application that was driving all those users. What sort of the evolution to get them to where they are today?\nMatt Cain: Yes, Sanjit, that was an existing customer who has been enjoying the value proposition of Couchbase for multiple applications aligned with their next-generation application modernization strategy. And then further leaning into the capabilities that are offered with the managed service totally aligned with the value proposition that we've been articulating. And as you can imagine, we're having conversations with most if not all of our existing customers on the eventuality of taking advantage for Capella for their entire estate or a subset of it.\nSanjit Singh: Very exciting. Thanks, Matt. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Rob Oliver with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Oliver: Great. Hey, thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Matt, I had one for you. And then Greg, I had a follow-up for you as well. So, Matt, first off, the -- I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into that oil and gas when that you guys had, which was a Capella conversion obviously an industry that you guys have done really well in and just wondering what some of the template -- what some of the decision points were for that customer along the way. And if you can help us understand like what got them over the hump on the move to Capella. And if this sort of lighthouse went on Capella that could become a template for others within that industry. And then I had a quick follow-up.\nMatt Cain: Sure. So look, this has been a customer for us for some time. And one of the capabilities that they've been taking advantage of is our mobile capability, in addition to our core enterprise feature set. We've continued to grow the account over several years and have been having discussions with them about moving into Capella. I think ultimately, Rob, it became the compelling event for them where they were able to not only offload the database management and save money but also optimize internal resources. And there is almost an insatiable demand in our enterprise customers to modernize and build new applications but they often run into challenges and having the people and resources to do that. Capella helps with that very thing. This is a blueprint that we're using with many other customers and we're very carefully engaging with them on the right time for them to move again either their entire state or others. But look, the fact that we've architected the solution to be the full power of Couchbase with the additional value proposition of better TCO, better internal productivity as you can imagine that value proposition is resonating quite a bit with current environment and the foreseeable future with the application dynamics that I mentioned.\nRob Oliver: Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much. And then Greg, just one for you, just contemplating the full year guide. You called out some of that I think it was kind of low to mid-range customer churn that happened through the quarter. Just thinking about the full-year guide, can you just help us get comfortable with how that might progress throughout the year? Are we through most of that, as you guys kind of scrubbed that portion of the customer base, what -- how did you -- where did you land in the end? Thank you.\nGreg Henry: Yes. Hey, Rob. Appreciate the question. Yes, I think that's the case. I think we see the churn on the customers is anomalous this quarter. Like I said, like we said in the prepared remarks, the gross acquisitions were consistent with historical Q1. The losses we had were driven by a handful of smaller challenge customers and several of them are going out of business. We had no competitive losses. And the other thing I would say about the logos is the average loss logo was the second lowest we've seen in the last three years. So while you see the count, a lot of times that we share with you the dollar is also matter and we actually had a reasonable dollar of new logo. So in terms of how it's going to play out for the year, it's going to -- it's not going to materially impact the year per se, and it's already contemplated in the guide. So I think we're comfortable where that landed.\nRob Oliver: Okay. Super helpful color. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nGreg Henry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Matt Hedberg with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is [Anita] (ph) for Matt Hedberg. Thanks for taking my question here. It's good to see the improved leverage in the model. Can you remind us how you're thinking about the path to breakeven profitability and what are the drivers to get there?\nMatt Cain: Yeah, Thanks for the question. Yeah, again we're pleased that we were able to continue to demonstrate leverage in the model and inefficiencies. And as we stated before, it's our other discussions that we are committed to continuing to do that. We haven't given a long-term range outlook in terms of cash breakeven or profitability. And when we do our Investor Day, we plan on doing that but we certainly are committed to continuing to do that. And hopefully, we saw that we delivered a beat in the quarter. The flow-through of one of the $1.5 million for the full year, but we also in that $1 million flow-through. We also took another $1 million of FX headwind against expenses as well. So we're feeling operationally pretty good about the leverage and efficiency that will continue to gain and we're just going to keep marching towards profitability here.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And then one more from me. Now that Capella is available across all three hyperscalers, can you talk more about the traction you're seeing there? And is there a way to quantify the new business you're seeing coming from the three marketplaces? What is the more traditional go-to-market channel? Thanks.\nMatt Cain: As it pertains to the hyperscalers, a big part of our value proposition is allowing our customers to run applications anywhere from cloud edge and that consists of their own datacenters, inclusive of instances where they have deployments in any one of the big hyperscalers. And oftentimes, our customers have a multi-cloud approach where they're not totally dependent on a single hyperscaler, but combine that with Couchbase with the ability to do hybrid deployments and run applications all the way out to the edge inclusive of mobile devices, which is a big part of our differentiator. So we were excited to round out the portfolio with the addition of Azure, which has been part of our plan roadmap. And then as we indicated with commentary specific to AWS, we're now able to go after go-to-market partnerships and programs with the other providers, where we have solutions in market quite frankly to allow customers total freedom of choice and movement in between the cloud solution. So it's a big part of our value proposition. We thought about the market that way for some time even before we had Capella end market. And so I think it's an extension of how we think about supporting our customers and being the e-cloud database for modern applications. It's hard breakdown on numbers, that's not something we provide. Greg, I don't know if you have any more.\nGreg Henry: Yes. I mean, as Matt stated, we were working with all the hyperscalers both on Capella and through their marketplaces. So we continue to see good traction all around but we haven't given specifics on by vendor.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thank you.\nGreg Henry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nKash Rangan: Hello, thank you very much. Nice quarter. I just wanted to understand the consumption patterns you're seeing with Capella. Not sure if we quantified how it is contributing to revenue budget. Since you've been added for a couple of years, you probably have enough cohort analysis to conclude some pattern. So curious how much more visibility you're getting into the consumption model granted that consumption model itself relative to subscription. It's not that visible. But as you study the cohorts, what are your conclusions? And one of the things that you're doing from a contracting standpoint to ensure that you have some level of visibility as Capella contracts continue to ramp. Thank you so much.\nMatt Cain: Hey, Kash. Thanks for the question. Yeah, we are starting to get obviously some insights into the Capella consumption trends given that we've been at it for, like you said, a year and a half or so now. And look overall, we can see is once customers begin their journey on Capella, they tend to consume at a very healthy rate and a lot of them consume at a rate faster than they had originally anticipated. We're seeing some of our customers that are having to buy at least once or sometimes multiple times before they get to their first anniversary from a consumption. And look, we have monitoring, obviously very closely of the consumption trends by customer. We can see it all real time, so we know whether customers are under consuming and we can go help them get up and running faster. We can see where they're over-consuming. We can obviously spend time and make sure they're over-consuming for the right reasons and they're not going to get surprised. So we are seeing healthy trends there. And I think the theory is starting to play out although, we share the metric yet. But we do believe that net retention rate will probably be greater in our Capella customer cohorts than it is for the non-Capella customer cohorts.\nKash Rangan: And that should also result in a structural lift of the growth rate that the company as Capella becomes a larger part of the business obviously. And if that's the case, if you agree with that, how are you scaling your expenses alongside the increase in consumption so that you can still achieve the proper targets that you probably have somewhere in the not too long-term? Thank you so much. And that's it from me.\nMatt Cain: Yes. Look, we're -- as we've talked about even starting late last year and through current, we are focused on profitability rule 40 efficiency. So we are absolutely monitoring the topline and the pace at which it's growing and we're moderating the expenses to go with it, so that we can continue to gain that leverage and efficiency as we go. So we will be monitoring it closely. Obviously, we've talked for a while now that we've really shifted all of our focus and resources really around Capella from a development perspective. So we are all in on Capella there and we're going to try to continue to go as fast as we can. But again keeping in mind that we are focused on leverage and efficiency at the same time.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nRaimo Lenschow: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. The quick question on Capella. Do you see any patterns in terms of use cases that are emerging in terms of some clients kind of particularly focusing on certain areas? And what do you see there in terms of like test development and test development on Capella versus kind of production workloads? And then I have a follow-up for Greg. Thank you.\nMatt Cain: Raimo, a dynamic that I would bring attention to is kind of two sides of the spectrum as we think about new Capella customers to Couchbase. And on the one end, you have new logos or customers that are brand new to Couchbase in general and are signing up with Capella as their entree to the way to get access to the database. On the other side, you have some of our largest customers that are evaluating the eventual migration of existing applications into the managed service. And I think the dynamics of how a customer adopts it varies pretty significantly from some of the smallest deals that we see a new logo acquisition we just want to get people started and enjoy the growth that we're seeing in Capella. And on the other side, where people -- our largest customers are going to be pretty specific and probably run it through more robust testing and proof of concept before they eventually move into Capella. And I would say, as we're driving the transformation to cloud-first, that's probably a more important dynamic than any specific vertical or use case. We're quite frankly -- we're very fortunate that our platform services everything from financial services to NextGen Healthcare and gaming and everything in between. So I wouldn't say that Capella consumption model is changing the quote unquote vertical dynamic more so the how our customers thinking about getting into the managed offering. And again, depending on which side of the spectrum, it can be a different on ramp and we're setup operationally to support both.\nRaimo Lenschow: Makes sense. Thank you. And then Greg, one follow-up. After the New Year started, has there been any changes in terms of how are you selling in terms of incentive structure to get maybe more Capella in the big’s -- like how do you handling that transition and does that create headwinds for you that we should be aware of? Thank you.\nGreg Henry: Yes. Hey, Raimo. Yes, I think if I was going to comment sort of at a high level in terms of like sales compensation this year, we clearly made more shift to focus on Capella, that's what we're trying to drive. So there is a more incentive on Capella this year than there even was last year. We're still focused on obviously growing the business and new business. But clearly, Capella is the focus and where we're looking for the sales team to be motivated to go sell.\nRaimo Lenschow: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nGreg Henry: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Howard Ma with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nHoward Ma: Thank you. And thanks for sharing the triple-digit Capella customer set. Can you reconcile that number with the limited number of net new customer adds? I think it implies that if you triple-digit -- if you take 100 and imply that at least 15% of your existing server customers are now Capella customers. But can you comment on the pace of growth of these Capella customers since Capella has been available? And so I guess that's one part that the pace of growth. And then looking ahead, should we expect a meaningful acceleration in net new Capella customers or will -- for like foreseeable future for the next year or so, will most of that Capella contribution come from the existing customer base.\nMatt Cain: Yeah. Hey, Howard. Thanks for the question. Yes, so very pleased to reach that mark and you're right if you take the least triple-digit you'd get 15% of our customer set. So we align there. And I would just say that, as a reminder, we can have customers that have both Capella and non-Capella. And in some cases -- a lot of cases now, there is both. So we still see very healthy Capella customer acquisition. So we're seeing that for sure. I think the other thing to consider is, when you see the Capella customer count grow, it can grow through migration of existing customers as well. It doesn't have to all the new acquisitions. So again, healthy on the Capella side. In fact, look, for Capella migrations, we did 2 times the migrations in Q1 this year versus Q1 last year. So we feel good about migrating customers over and we also feel good about the pace of the add that we're delivering as well.\nGreg Henry: Howard, if I could hop on. I think the net number in Q1 is a combination of Capella and enterprise and it was really sort of two different stories there. So we have very high expectations for Capella and that's playing out largely as we expected. To be frank, this is an area of the business that we've been pretty transparent that we know we can do better and Capella will be the biggest driver of that. And so we continue to expect that as we move forward with the business. To your question on percentage of customers, if I go back to that dynamic of big existing customers that are migrating versus net new logos, I think we're going to see a higher number of customers on the new logos faster as we get new logos that start with Capella. But the dollar contribution is going to be more correlated with the timing at which our large customers decide to move into Capella. What you can't see reflected in the numbers or the conversations that we're having with those large customers. And I believe that it is an eventuality. At the same time, we don't want to try to push our customers before they are ready and they have resources lined up and determine that it's the right compelling event for them. And so it's really important for us as these customers are making two, three, five to 10-year decisions that we work alongside of them, particularly in current economic times and we're more focused on the mid to long-term prospects of the business. Then artificially trying to get quickly over some threshold of percentage of economics. So I'd say those are dynamics that we're very aware of and managing and we'll share more of that as we go forward.\nHoward Ma: Okay. Great. Thanks for adding that color, Matt, to what Greg was explaining. And Greg, just a quick follow-up. To be clear on guidance, I think last quarter you said that you're baking in a heightened level of conservatism into guidance relative to what you're actually seeing. Can you just clarify if that's still the case? Thank you.\nGreg Henry: Yes, Howard. It's quite similar to be perfectly honest. Obviously, we've just got one quarter under our belt and we've seen the results from Q1. So I think in the prepared remarks, we say we're continuing to have an elevated level of conservatism as we go through the year because we're very cognizant of what's happening out in the world today and we want to be in a position where, as I stated earlier, we can at a minimum meet the guidance if not beat it as we go forward. So I think things are continuing as we had stated a quarter ago.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Rudy Kessinger with [Technical Difficulty]\nRudy Kessinger: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Greg, I wanted to start with you and double-click on the customer churn commentary. I think you said it was -- on a dollar basis, you said it was I think the second-lowest in the last few years. Could you just clarify what comments you had thrown in there? And then just any other further color you could share with these smaller enterprises where their mid-market customers, any verticals and specific any regional banks to call out that churn. I know you said some that went out of business. Just any more color you can give on the customer churn?\nGreg Henry: Yes. No problem, Rudy. So first of all, there were no regional banks part of this. And what I stated before was, if I looked at the average loss -- dollar loss per customer, it was the second lowest we've seen in three years. So they were very small on the SMB side of things, customers. And as I said they were many that were quite honestly challenged with what's going on in the macro today that either put them out of business or we're on a path to go out of business. And so that was the churn piece, but the dollar component of it was relatively low, which is why I was referencing that while we share that count with you that doesn't always tell you the whole picture and the dollar -- the net dollar new logo for the quarter was actually pretty reasonable. But the count was impacted by those churns.\nRudy Kessinger: Okay, that's helpful. And then Matt, you mentioned I’d say in this call you've and then you’ve mentioned it in our past conversations potentially holding our Investor Day at some point in the future. Investors that I speak with are certainly looking for some kind of target date on operating breakeven or free cash flow breakeven that they can hang their hat on. And I certainly understand there might be some hesitancy to give some kind of intermediate long-term targets when you're in an -- operating in volatile macro as we are today. But just have you put any more thought to that? And when could we expect an Investor Day or getting some of those longer-term targets profitability?\nGreg Henry: Yes. Hey, Rudy. It's Greg. I'll take this one. Look, yes, we absolutely are still considering doing an Investor Day later this year. To your point on the macro, we want to really see where this is going to go but we fully intend when we do the Investor Day that we will lay out Capella metrics, a long-term model path to profitability. We obviously trying to share some of that as we go which is why we disclosed today about hitting the triple digits on the Capella customer account. And hopefully, we're seeing that the path to profitability has begun in terms of our ability to start getting leverage in the model and generating some efficiency and letting that flow through to the bottom line. So all is good. And we, like I said, we still plan on doing an Investor Day. And as soon as we land on a date, we certainly will let you know.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Taz Koujalgi with Wedbush Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTaz Koujalgi: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the impact, when a customer moves from on-prem to Capella, you've mentioned that you've seen a lot of success from customers moving from on-prem to Capella. Can you I guess help us understand would the uptick in customer spend is, I'm assuming Capella is obviously the higher price point. But when a customer goes from an on-prem offering to Capella that's a like-for-like capacity or like-for-like, I guess usage. What is the kind of uptake you see in customer spend?\nGreg Henry: Yes. Hey, Taz. It's Greg. Appreciate the question. Yes, I think how we stated it before is -- if a customer was spending a dollar on self-managed Couchbase enterprise and they move to Capella, they would go to like $1.50 to $2 depending on which flavor of Capella they chose. So that's sort of the uplift and that's assuming again like-for-like no additional volume or consumption just pure moving over.\nTaz Koujalgi: Got it. Very helpful. And just one follow-up. Your revenue -- any comment on linearity for revenue, because your revenue looks like it was better than usual seasonality. Usually, I believe Q1 revenues are down versus Q4 this quarter we saw that improve. I think your Q1 revenues were better than your subscription revenues in Q1. This quarter were better than last quarter. Any comment on linearity? Was it a more front and lower quarter? How does the linearity play out versus other quarters?\nGreg Henry: Yes. Look, we would expect subscription revenue will continue to grow over time. I think there is obviously timing involved with that in particular around the non-Capella piece and the way the accounting is for when you start the subscription term with the accounting rules. So some of that can drive some of the timing difference. But nonetheless, we expect it to continue to grow. Again, we feel very good about the performance in Q1 and that we're maintaining the guidance for the full-year. So I think it really has to do a lot of it with the timing of the start dates and that's why we've talked about in the past about ARR being the measure we think is more important, because it can cut through some of that noise, but you will see some -- again, some timing differences around revenue recognition based on how those rules work.\nTaz Koujalgi: Got it. Just one last one, if I may. Services revenue is a little bit lighter this quarter, I think, down year-over-year. What are we expecting for the rest of the year? Should that uptake or is there a reason why they were a little bit light to this quarter?\nGreg Henry: Yes, it's a good question. We had tried to share with people that last year was an outperformance on service. We had a healthy backlog and a higher than normal customer demand to deliver services. So we had a outperformance last year and that this year would be a down year just, because we can't -- we're not going to repeat that. And that the mix of services on our business was around 8% last year and we'd expect it to be even maybe potentially a little bit below normal, which is around 6%. So maybe 5% for the year is the way you should think about it, but you should still continue to expect to see that be a headwind for us the rest of the year.\nTaz Koujalgi: Got it. Thank you very much.\nGreg Henry: Thanks, Taz.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to CEO and Chairman, Matt Cain for closing comments.\nMatt Cain: Thanks, operator. To recap, we had a strong quarter and start to the year. We remain excited about our opportunity with Capella, due to some very big trends in our favor like digital transformation, acceleration of the cloud, innovation at the edge and AI. We're cognizant of the macro environment and are sharply focused on execution during times like this, while also building for what we believe will be a very exciting future. Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
