Finally, our third quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period will begin on Tuesday, April16th. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich. And good afternoon, everyone. We've delivered a solid second quarter, with results that came in ahead of our guidance. The macro backdrop in our second quarter remain uncertain, but stable relative to the prior quarter. We continue to see steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership or TCO.  Taking a closer look at the second quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all of our guided metrics. We delivered record quarterly revenue of $565 million and grew our ARR 26% year-over-year to $1.74 billion. We also had another quarter of strong free cash flow generation.  Finally, we achieved quarterly GAAP operating profitability for the first time in Q2, demonstrating the progress we continue to make on driving operating leverage in our subscription model. Overall, our second quarter financial performance reflected continued discipline execution. Our largest wins in the quarter demonstrated the appeal of the Nutanix cloud platform to organizations that are looking to adopt hybrid multi cloud operating models optimize the performance of their workloads and improve their TCO all while managing through some of the disruption from recent industry M&A.  A good example is a seven figure win with a global EMEA based provider of automotive technology solutions. This new customer had an existing three tier footprint in need of a refresh, but was frustrated by the recent price increases of their incumbent vendor and was also looking to have the flexibility to potentially move some of their footprint to the public cloud in future. They chose our Nutanix Cloud Platform, including our AHP hypervisor, as well as Nutanix Cloud Management, based on its superior TCO, built-in automation for infrastructure as a service. And its ability to seamlessly transition workloads to public cloud via our NC2 solution. We see this win as a good example of the value customers see in our cloud platform for both, modernization and providing a seamless pathway to the public cloud.  A second good example is a win with a large North American based hedge fund, that was looking to mitigate the growing cost of its public cloud hosted virtual desktop infrastructure or VDI. And for a more responsive solution to meet the performance demands of its traders. They chose to repatriate their VDI onto the Nutanix Cloud Platform on GPU based servers. Resulting in a meaningful improvement in performance and an estimated 60% plus TCO savings. We believe this win demonstrates the ability of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to seamlessly run and manage workloads wherever the optimal performance and TCO can be achieved, whether on premise, at the edge or in the public cloud.  A final example if one of our largest new customer wins in the quarter, with a global airline based in the EMEA region that was looking to modernize their feature infrastructure, while enabling a hybrid multi cloud environment. This customer chosen Nutanix Cloud Platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management to run their business critical application, leveraging its simplicity and built-in automation for infrastructure as a service. They also adopted Nutanix database service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organization, and Nutanix unified storage to service their unstructured data needs. We see this win as evidence of the value companies see in adopting our full stack solution.  Moving on, adopting and benefiting from generating AI, is top of mind for many of our customers. As such, interest remains high in our GPT in-a-Box offering, which enables our customers to accelerate the use of generative AI across their enterprises, while keeping their data secure. Last quarter, we saw our first win for GPT in-a-Box with a large federal agency. In this quarter, we saw multiple additional wins for a Gen AI ready infrastructure offering. While it's still early days, and the numbers remain small, I'm excited about the longer term potential for GPT in-a-Box.  Finally, on the partner front, I'm happy with the early progress we're seeing with our Cisco partnership. We continue to see good customer interest in our joint offering and saw additional wins for it in the second quarter. While it's still early in this partnership, I'm encouraged by what we've seen so far.  In closing, we are encouraged that the compelling value proposition of our cloud platform and the strength of our business model enable us to increase our top and bottom line outlook for fiscal 2024. We remain focused on delighting our customers while continuing to drive sustainable, profitable growth. And with that, I'll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. I will first review our Q2 fiscal '24 results, followed by guidance for Q3 fiscal '24. And finally provide an updated view of our full year fiscal year '24 guidance.  Results in Q2 '24 came in higher than the high end of our range across all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q2 were $329 million above the guided range of $295 million to $305 million representing year-over-year growth of 23%. The outperformance was driven by better than expected renewal performance due to a combination of good discipline around renewals economics, improved on time renewal performance, as well as early and core term renewals.  Revenue in Q2 was $565 million, higher than the guidance range of $545 million to $555 million and the year-over-year growth rate of 16%. ARR at the end of Q2 was $1.737 billion representing year-over-year growth of 26%. In Q2, we continue to see modestly elongated average sales cycles compared to historical levels. Average contract duration in Q2 was 2.8 years, slightly lower than Q1, and more or less in line with our expectations.  Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 87.3%. Higher than our guided range of 85% to 86%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 21.9%, higher than our guidance range of 14% to 16%, largely due to higher revenue and lower operating expenses as a result of timing of hiring. Non-GAAP net income was $136 million, or fully diluted EPS of $0.46 per share based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 299 million shares.  Q2 marked our first ever quarter of positive GAAP operating income of $37 million and a positive GAAP net income of $33 million, with fully diluted GAAP EPS of $0.12 per share. Given expected variability in quarterly revenue and timing of expenses, we would not expect to be consistently profitable at the GAAP operating profit level over the near term.  DSOs based on revenue and ending accounts receivable were 31 days in Q2. Free cash flow in Q2 was $163 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 29%, higher than our expectations due to higher billings and lower expenses in the quarter.  We ended Q2 with cash, cash equivalents and short term investment of $1.644 billion up from $1.571 billion at the end of Q1. We continued repurchasing shares in Q2 under the share repurchase program, previously authorized by our Board of Directors. Our sustainable generation of free cash flow enabled us to transition the net share settlement to pay for employees' tax liability on RSU Vesting in Q2, and going forward from our previous method of sell to cover. This, along with our share repurchase program will help us continue to manage dilution.  Moving to Q3 '24, our guidance for Q3 is as follows: ACV billings of $265 million to $275 million, revenue of $510 million to $520 million, non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 85%, on-GAAP operating margin of 7.5% to 8.5%. And fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 301 million shares. The updated guidance for full year fiscal year '24, which is higher than our previously provided fiscal year '24 guidance across all metrics is as follows; ACV billings of $1.09 billion to $1.11 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint of the range. Revenue of $2.12 billion to $2.15 billion representing a year-over-year growth of 15% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP gross margin of 85% to 86%. Non-GAAP operating margin of 12.5% to 13.5%. Free cash flow of $420 million to $440 million, representing a free cash flow margin of 20% at the midpoint.  I will now provide some commentary regarding our updated fiscal year '24 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles relative to historical levels. Our fiscal year '24 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assume some impact from these macro dynamics. We are also seeing a higher mix of larger deals in our pipeline, which is driving greater variability in the timing of our new and expansion business.  Second, the guidance assumes that our renewals business will continue to perform well. Third, the full year guidance continues to assume that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower compared to fiscal year '23, as renewals continue to grow as a percent of our total billing. Fourth, a reminder that the full year ACV billing is not the straight sum of the ACV billings of the four quarters due to contracts with duration less than one year. We expect full year ACV billings to be about 5% to 6% lower than the sum of the four quarters ACV billings.  In closing, we are pleased that our Q2 results exceeded guidance and to raise our top line and bottom line guidance for the full fiscal year. We remain focused on driving growth to capture the significant opportunity ahead of us and are investing prudently for that growth, consistent with our stated philosophy of sustainable, profitable growth.  With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim fish from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nJim Fish: Hey, guys, thanks, thanks for questions. Awesome quarter here. Look, I'm going to ask the obvious, that's on top of everybody's mind, and I'm sure you're totally prepared for. On the VMware opportunity and Rukmini, you even just mentioned, you know, you're seeing a higher mix of larger deals in the pipeline. So my question to you is, is what sort of pipeline or bookings build Have you seen relative to this stage last year, between either direct customers kind of coming to you or partners coming over to you as well in terms of signups? \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, why don't I start Jim, and Rukmini can give you color on the pipeline. So, first of all, I think, as you said, I mean, there are significant concerns from VMware customers regarding the Broadcom acquisition. And we think that this is a significant multi-year opportunity for us to win new customers and to gain share. Now, getting to your question a bit here, the timing and magnitude of these deals is a bit unpredictable. Our pipeline is quite substantial, and growing.  Now for a number of reasons, we expect contribution for the opportunity to build gradually, and here are the reasons. First one, Jim is that many customers signed multi-year ELAs enterprise agreements with VMware prior to the deal closing three to five years. So it buys them some time to make decisions. The second, converting from VMware 3-tier accounts or legacy storage accounts, which is a good chunk of VMware footprint, in many cases requires a refresh of their storage and our servers, right, one of the two, which could also impact the timing of the potential software purchases that they would make with us. Okay.  And the last piece is like with all these accounts, we typically ever land and expand motion. So the first deal could be followed, and then there's a lot of potential for expansion further than that.  And then Rukmini, you want to take this? \nRukmini Sivaraman: Sure. Yes, I'll add one thing, Jim, to your question is that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks about this. Higher mix of larger deals that we're seeing in our pipeline and that is driving the greater variability, we believe in the timing of our new and expansion business, as well as potentially contributing to the longer average sales cycles, because larger deals do tend to take longer to close.  And we believe that this higher mix of larger deals in the pipeline is driven by, you know, one, our segmentation of market, as we've talked about before, and the improved product readiness for those larger customers. And secondly, some of the dynamics that Rajiv talked about already regarding concerns from larger customers, regarding the impacts from Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. And so we have continued and continue to factor all of the impact of some of these dynamics into our updated fiscal year '24 outlook.\nJim Fish: Make sense. And just a follow up here. You know, there's a bit of confusion out there, from what I can tell on the conversations with investors between, what VMware can do that Nutanix can't do. And, so Rajiv, what differences actually exist, if any, or features or functions -- exist, what the differences kind of exist, if any, between vSphere, for example, and Acropolis or the VMware platform versus Nutanix platform, or features functions you plan to add in order to make it an apple to apples compare, or is it simply just a legacy market perception thing that you guys can't address, really what most of VMware could do? And really, why wouldn't we start to see that Acropolis attach rate get closer to, you know, 100% on every deal that you signed from kind of here on forward. Thanks, guys. \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So Jim, I think first of all, if you compare the full stack that Broadcom was offering with VMware Cloud Foundation, that, -- and our Nutanix cloud platform pretty much goes head to head against that, and we've got all the capabilities. That's a full stack that includes, the hypervisor, a software defined storage, networking and management. So we compare very well with that full stack and we're able to go to a very comparable offering. And indeed, as you can see, right our AHP penetration our hypervisor penetration, our install base is about 70%. And we are seeing new customers who adopt a full stack start with our own hypervisor, okay.  That part is fair. Now when it comes to the lower tier offering, VMware does have a vSphere and now it's called I believe VMware Virtual Foundation, VVF. That includes vSphere, some operations management capabilities, et cetera. Now, what you -- what I mentioned earlier, in response to the question was that, there is some amount of VMware, in fact a big chunk of VMware it's only the hypervisor that's connected to legacy storage, right 3-tier storage arrays.  Now, the way we go after the market is not to just simply replace the hypervisor with our hypervisor, because our hypervisor also is part of our complete solution, right, which includes our storage. So customers are actually making a shift from a legacy architecture that say hypervisor plus external storage to a modern HCI architecture that includes our hypervisor, but also the rest of our stack.  So there, it's not just a simple life for life, but it's a conversion, and modernization of infrastructure as well. So I feel pretty good about what we can do, we can handle all the workloads. We have a hybrid cloud solution, we have a modern app platform that customers can run Kubernetes applications on. We have partnerships with Red Hat for OpenShift. We have partnerships with our cloud partners like Azure and AWS. So from a capability of the portfolio perspective, we're very much there.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader from William Blair. Your line is open. \nJason Ader: Thank you. Hi, Rajiv, hi Rukmini. I just wanted to ask on that kind of follow up threads on the last question just on the 3-tier architectures out there. And most of those are running VMware today. Does it feel like this change with the Broadcom acquisition actually could accelerate the transition away from 3-tier architectures as customers maybe get a little bit disenfranchised, and are looking for alternatives? And then it's like, well, we never really looked at HCI that closely. But now, maybe we should. Are those kinds of conversations happening?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Very much so, I would say, Jason. So in fact, you're right. There's a lot of VMware with what we call 3-tier. And one of the things that Broadcom itself is doing has done by the way is that the VMware Cloud Foundation that includes HCI and that their default offering to a lot of the bigger customers. So effectively now, it's not just us doing HCI, but they're also putting, which puts a little bit of pressure on the 3-tier storage piece of it. And so we are clearly focused on that opportunity, in terms of -- and we've been doing that all day long, right, since we've started, migrating, legacy 3-tier over HCI, and potentially that this might help.  Now, the other thing we should also keep in mind just so that we don't lose track of it. There are even easier assertion opportunities now. Because there is a substantial base of vSphere plus VSAN HCI out there. And so that's almost the like for like. Those customers have already made the HCI decision, and they might be looking at, if they're looking to migrate away from VMware, we pretty much have a like for like solution that that we can migrate over to. And we are doing, we're not sitting idle here, right, we are doing a bunch of things to capitalize on the opportunity, I'd say three things that we're doing. First is that we have been targeting some more advertising dollars to maximize the awareness of Nutanix as the simplest, easiest, viable alternative for these customers.  Number two, we've also put in place incentives for our partners, who are helping customers get to our platform for new customers, as partners bring new customers to us, we give them more incentives. Number three, we're also helping end customers with migration. When they have a VMware environment, they're looking to bring our environment on, there's a period of time where they might have dual operating costs, and we try to help them out on that front. So we're also taking some very specific steps to go out for the opportunity.\nJason Ader: Great, and then a real quick follow up just on your comments on Cisco, that you're happy with early progress. When do you think, Rajiv that could start to really be a material contributor to the business? \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, we factored in a modest contribution this year, Jason, from Cisco. I do expect that the contribution is going to be more significant in FY '25. And we’ll cover that when we get to, you know, when we are ready to talk about that FY '25 guide. But, clearly, it takes time to build this up, we focused on enabling the full solution, training that sellers. And we're happy with the progress we're making. We are getting new customers through the cloud now. And they are motivated. So I think over time, it will build.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for next question. And our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is open. \nWamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you so much. You drove very strong operating leverage in the quarter. Can you talk about if there were any one time things in there? I think, Rukmini, you mentioned something around hiring I didn't really catch. But, was there any one time things in there when why is that rewarding lower next fiscal quarter? Then I have a follow-up.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. Hi, Wamsi. Thanks for the question. So the reference I made in terms of our operating margin performance in Q2, which was came in strong at 22% and higher than our expectation was, one revenue was higher than we expected. And expenses were a bit lower because of timing of hiring, and just overall good expense management. And we do expect that expenses will go up in the second half. So if you look at half over half operating expenses implied in the guide, that does go up in the second half, one way, and of course, Q3 compared to Q2, seasonally, the revenue is lower in Q3, that it doesn't in Q2. So those are some of the things that are factoring into the outlook.  But overall, you know, I'd say, we have continued to be focused on investing and investing thoughtfully on this growth opportunity that's ahead of us. And so that's the approach we've taken. And overall, we've been pleased to take up our full year outlook on both top and bottom line.\nWamsi Mohan : Okay, thanks. Makes a lot of sense. And then, Rajiv, I mean, you made some comments already. But can you perhaps maybe quantitatively talk about the wins that are coming your way because of this M&A? And, and sort of, you know, how many points of growth potentially we should be thinking about? Or how many points of share that you think you could see shift over to Nutanix, given this disruption, or even maybe if you can talk about it in qualitative terms around rate and pace of pipeline build? Just quarter-over-quarter over the last few quarters? That will be helpful. Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Wamsi first of all, I think it's going be hard for me to give you some very specific quantitative numbers at this point. But what I'd say is, is for sure, right, if you look at our last Investor Day, we talked about our TAM and the SAM as part of that right the $60 billion $70 billion TAM and SAM. And what we really expect is, I mean, we've always been going and continuing to grow market share and eat into that SAM, and what this event creates is an opportunity to speed that up. So it's the same, the TAM and SAM haven't really changed. It's still the same, but now we're able to get after more of it quicker.  Now, the challenge with quantifying it is that it's very hard to predict right I mean, as we bought that, how much of this is going to come out quickly? And this is what, it's a little early to, for us to say something there. So we've got, like I said, we've got customers who want to do something different, but they've got these three five year relays. They're not in a rush. There's some time it takes to convert customers, and they have to depreciate the hardware that they bought, for example. And then you know, the -- you bring us in for a small portion and expand. So all of these things create some unpredictability in terms of timing, and how quickly can we capture it. But, I certainly think that this provides us an opportunity for us to capture more of the market quicker, and we're trying to move as quickly as we can.  I don’t know, Rukmini, if you want to provide any color on the pipeline?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, I may add one thing to that, Rajiv, which is that. I think Wamsi your question is specifically around what we can tell about this opportunity as a result of VMware’s acquisition by Broadcom. And I say, I think the other nuance here is we've always competed against VMware, right. And so in some cases, it's quite clear to tell, well, this door wasn't open to us before. And now it is because of what they may be seeing from our competitor. But in other cases, and we talked about an example on the last earnings call, where existing customers of ours are maybe choosing to invest more than us or go single source with us, a partly influenced by this, right.  So this idea of in some cases, it's clear, in other cases, it's more of A factor, an important factor, but one factor, and so that those situations, it's harder for us to attribute specifically, dollars and pipeline and things like that, to this particular disruption in the competitive market. So, all those factors combined, are what makes us, feel good that this is a multi-year and opportunity, as Rajiv has mentioned, but difficult to get precise in terms of magnitude and timing.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Next question comes from Pinjalim Bora from JPMorgan, your line is open.\nPinjalim Bora : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the quarter. Rajiv, one of your partners, compare the Nutanix Cisco relationship and the buzz around it to the formative years of VCE and noted how VCE was kind of a game changer for VMware at the time. Do you think the Cisco partnership could be that pivotal for Nutanix? And secondly, do you think there any learnings from the rise and fall of the VCE that you can apply I guess, to this relationship? \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I've actually there at Cisco at that time, when the VCE partnership and clearly very cyclical initially. Now, I -- it's hard for me to compare VCE back then converged infrastructure with this. But I'll tell you the, this -- I'll give you the sort of the puts and takes. So clearly, Cisco has huge market leverage and market position, in terms of their sellers, and their access to big accounts, their presence in all these accounts.  Now, if you look at this particular space in the market, there are several positions, it's not that there are small, relatively small market share player when it comes to servers compared to some of their other competitors. So it's -- so they're not as strong in this segment of the market. However, I mean, they certainly have a big overall market cloud. So now, what could the two of us do together really to go into the market, and that's really I think, where I do see significant potential here. Over time, again, it has to take time to build up. And it -- Cisco also has a complex sell emotion, they have generalists, they have specialists. And right now, we are more focused on the data center specialists as they have and working together with them.  So to answer your question, I mean, it's still early days for us to predict how big this could be for us. And I would say, you know, we, I am optimistic, and I think this opportunity is also going to build up over time. And certainly continuing to -- and in fact there's a lot of cooperation happening between our sellers, and Cisco sellers in the field. So all good, good omens at this point in time, but still very early.\nPinjalim Bora : Understood. I guess we'll stay tuned. One question for you Rukmini, the ACV billings guidance for fiscal Q3. Seems like it calls for maybe a little bit higher sequential drawdown. I want to ask you the sales cycle elongation comment that you have made, was that versus Q1, the elongation in Q2 that you saw, was that sequential and are you assuming kind of a similar sequential? Higher elongation in the Q3 guide as well?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi, Pinjalim. Thank you for that question. So on this -- I think the first part of the question was on seasonality between Q2 and Q3. And so on that front, if you look back to sort of our initial guidance that we gave for Q3 last year, this time, Pinjalim, it was actually quite similar in terms of what we guided for Q3 versus Q2. But we were able to beat Q3 and so the actual I think, is what you're referring to, was smaller than what we guided to. But the decrease, I would say, is more or less in line with what we'd expect for seasonality and what we expected at this time last year, as well.  And then to your point on the average sale cycle, and modest elongation we're seeing there, it moves around a bit quarter to quarter, Pinjalim, but what I was referring to is that when we look back at to historical levels, it remains somewhat elevated. And so that's what I was referring to.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment, our next question. Our next question comes from George Wang from Barclays. Your line is open.\nGeorge Wang : Hey, guys, congrats on the quarter and the guidance, I have two quick ones. Firstly, you briefly touch on the potential, the discounts and promotions to promote VMware customers. And I just want to kind of see if you can elaborate on the approach for the fiscal partnership, the HyperFlex customers, maybe you can give some color just on the incentives, you guys are providing to kind of further drive the adoption from the older HyperFlex customers?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, we have, I think I would say that Cisco, with Cisco, clearly we have a, they are -- they've end of life HyperFlex, first of all, and there's a limited time where you know that so – they no longer selling the product, and there's a limited support window for it. So that by itself, by the way it creates an incentive for HyperFlex customers to migrate. And we through Cisco, of course, as a whole, Cisco has a set of programs for migration. And they're good at driving those types of migration initiatives. And we are supporting them as they do that. So this is being done largely through Cisco and through the Cisco router market.\nGeorge Wang: Also Rajiv, quickly, you talked about repatriation in the prepared remarks. I'm just curious, are you seeing a more visible inflection point in terms of the repatriation to the private cloud or is still a continuation of prior trends just besides lower TCO, kind of versus expensive public cloud. Can you can talk about other factors may contribute to continue repatriation to the private cloud?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I’ll give you two-part answer to that, George. So I don't know if I can call it a point of inflection. But certainly we are seeing more examples of people repatriating but that those are examples. It's hard for me to say you know that there's a whole trend here. Yes. But some are certainly repatriating like the example I talked about. But also, I think the other thing that we should keep in mind is that the bulk of enterprise workloads are still not in the public cloud. They're still sitting in data centers.  I'm talking about enterprise workloads, because what has gone to the public cloud largely have been net new applications. So for these workloads are still sitting in the enterprise environment, I think CIOs are being a lot more careful about how much of that do they take to the public cloud? So there's yes, there's some repatriation happening from the public cloud back on-prem. But there's also a lot more scrutiny and forethought being applied to what should I take going forward into the public cloud from where I'm at?\nOperator: Thank you one moment for next question. Our next question comes from Mike Cikos from Needham. Your line is open.\nMichael Cikos : Hey, thank you guys. And I, I wanted to eco my comments as well, in addition to the others as far as the great quarter and the results here. I picked a bit of a two parter here. But the first I know coming back to the financials, specifically Rukmini. Can you help us think about the benefit to the quarter from the co-terming that occurred? And if I guess to what degree anything was pulled forward that was expected to land later this year, when we think about the magnitude of the beat and raise for guidance?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Sure. Hi, Mike. So yes, I talked about renewals outperformance in Q2, and there were three factors that I highlighted to -- the reason for that I performance. One was better renewals economics. And by that, I mean just our team is able to get better pricing at the time of renewal, which is good. Secondly, we talked about better on time renewal performance, which was strong in the quarter as well.  And then the third piece, I think, is what you're referring to Mike, which is around I said that we did do a little better on early and quote on renewal. And those, as we've said before, we go out to our customers well in advance of a renewal being due and start that conversation early. And that's what they prefer, as well. And often, we will be able to transact those renewals earlier than when they are -- in an earlier quarter than when they are due. And co-terms similarly, at co-terms are beneficial both for us and for the customer, because it then brings a lot of their licenses that may have been purchased at different times, to all be aligned to the same end date.  And so those were generally welcome. As long as they are, you know, coming at a good economics for us, it's good for the customer, they give us cash up front. And so those are all generally things that we welcome.  Now, in terms of the dynamic of the pool forwards, I think was another sort of aspect of your question, Mike, I say, you know, there is normal variation, right, between quarters, and we would expect that to continue going forward. And I would say I think we had also talked about this dynamic between fiscal year '24 and fiscal year '25. And I'm not sure if that's way you're going, Mike. But at this point, we still do see that renewal available to renew for next year, the growth in that is accelerating compared to what we saw for fiscal year '24. Because that was partly earlier than co-term was but was also just a beginner cohort that is coming up in '25, which is reading to that accelerated renewals ATR in '25, compared to '24.  So overall, again, I would say, you know, pretty strong quarter from renewals perspective, and generally these are all the outperformance driven by things that we like to see, so nothing that I would sort of characterize as better than expected, certainly, but allows us to sort of suddenly manage the business on a more predictable basis going forward.\nMichael Cikos: Got it. And my -- it's funny, you're ending that response on predictability. I think one of the things that I've been going through on my side, this earnings season is certain companies have cited seeing larger deals in their pipeline, and greater variability based on when those deals close. So I wanted to get a sense of possible, but can you help us think about the magnitude when you're citing these larger deals? Like, are they coming with, like an X percent increase in size from a $1 perspective versus what you're historically seeing, just to help us get a better sense of that?  And then the second piece tied to that is, how do you get financing, driving those deals again, just because they are obviously more strategic, there's less certainty around the timing of when those close, just anything there as far as how you do gain confidence on that front? It's a high quality problem I have, I'll start with that. But I just want to make sure that you guys are thinking about this and wanted to see how you respond to that?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, it's a good question, Mike. And you're right. These larger deals are inherently more unpredictable, which is why I think my point on your previous question, right was renewals is generally more predictable, although, of course, in as with everything, there is some variability there, but definitely more predictable, right than the new and expansion portion. And so I won't give you a specific number, Mike, I know you were looking for like some percentage or size or something like that.  What I will say is when we look at our pipeline of opportunities, and we look at the mix of that, meaning how much is coming from deals of a certain size versus larger size. And if you think, you know, you may have buckets of, you know, deal sizes, what we're seeing in the data is that a larger proportion is coming from those higher, larger deal size buckets, than we've seen previously. So -- and that's in addition to the pipeline growing or just into the mix of it is also changing, to be weighted more towards larger deals.  So that's sort of the first part of part of the answer to your question. Now, in terms of just how do we get comfortable, we look at what's in the pipeline, we're looking at a lot of other things that we in terms of conversion rates and things like that. And it is related to the pipeline. And we put a probability on how many of those we think we can convert during a period of time. And so that's sort of a little more color into the methodology of how we're approaching this. And all that is factored into the guide that we provided.  But Rajiv, did you want to add anything? \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, just a couple of things. First of all, I think one of the reasons we're seeing these large deals is because we of course for a while we've been working on a portfolio, that product portfolio, which we think is ready for large scale enterprise deployments. And so we have segmented our focus a bit further up the market in terms of our own sales for segmentation, and then on top of that, we've got the industry disruption with VMware where many large customers, of course, who are not necessarily engaged with us before are now engaging with us. So that's the reason for why we're seeing more of these large deals in our pipeline.  Now, I think with respect to prosecuting these deals, I would say we keep getting better at going after these deals. I mean, we have a whole 360 approach towards going after this. We have executed sponsors on the big accounts where we have large deals, we have a full team assembled to go pursue these deals. And now having said that, so it's still going to be timing is going to be a bit unpredictable.  And the size of the things also tends to vary over time. So it doesn't completely replace the unpredictability. But it does. It's a sea of engagement, when you have these types of deals between both companies, we are investing resources, customers investing a lot of resources as well, because there's a lot of testing certifications, go into contract negotiations, security audits, a whole bunch of things that get through this process. And so I would say we as a company are getting better and better at going after these types of opportunities.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nMeta Marshall : Great, thanks. A couple questions for me. Maybe just on, you noted, clearly, some macro headwinds still. Just wanted to get a sense of any of the shape of that is it still things that are just a long game lead times? Are you seeing it on larger deals, smaller deals, certain verticals, certain types of projects, kind of just any change in color from the past couple of quarters, if there are any?  And then maybe on the second question, you know, I would imagine you guys are getting a number of resumes in your inbox right now just kind of given the disruption, just any notable hires, or how you're finding kind of the pool of talent to add in terms of some of your OpEx ads? Thanks.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Rukmini why don’t you take number one, and I’ll take the number two question.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, sure, Rajiv, so on macro, Meta, which I think was your first question. It's more or less remained stable, relative to what we've seen in the last few quarters are fairly consistent with what we've seen in the last few quarters. And we characterize that as somewhat uncertain, but stable. And, that's sort of what we continue to see. So no significant change from that, which again, as we talked about, did show up in the continued modest elongation of sales cycles compared to what historical levels.  Now, some of that could also be driven by this high, you know, larger mix of higher, larger deal sizes in our pipeline. So that's sort of showing up now. But again, that is also a factor of just the fact that we've gone up market, it's not necessarily a macro point. So on macro, nothing else I would call out in terms of specific verticals, seeing strength or weakness that we're noticing at this point. Somewhat uncertain, but stable is how I would characterize it. \nRajiv Ramaswami: And then Meta on the talent questions, there's no doubt this is --two years ago, it was a difficult market for talent, right, everybody was hiring. And it was a tough market as we tend to hire at the top of the pyramid in terms of software developers, now, that has changed quite significantly for us, right, in this market today, we're able to attract the best talent from every place, not just you know, VMware or other places, you might think, but also from hyperscalers, for example.  And, so we see a good tenant environment, we have been using that, of course, we have been hiring carefully, but selectively in both R&D and sales. And we are seeing really good talent come in the door. And overall, it's helping uplevel the talent that we have in the company and I'm very happy about that. And that's happening at the individual contributor levels, but also at the management levels, as well. So across the Board.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger from JMP. Your line is open. Eric, your line is open. \nErik Suppiger: Sorry, there, sorry. \nOperator: One moment. Let me go ahead and bring him back up. Okay, Eric, your line is open again.\nErik Suppiger: All right. Sorry about that. I want to just touch on the subject of larger deals in elongated sales cycles. As previously noted, there have been other vendors that have seen similar trends and there was some discussions around consolidation, customers that are getting more focused on consolidating onto a single or a few vendors as opposed to a lot of tools out there. Is that one of the things that could be contributing to the elongated sales cycle? Or is it more of an economic uncertainty issue?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I'm not sure as much, Erik, whether it's because people are consolidating, whether they're -- in our case, for example, certainly, there's a lot of like, okay, I've got an incumbent vendor that I need to rethink my strategy and bring on an automated vendor. And that's how we’re playing very much for us, right, very much in play. So, they were happy with the vendor prior, and now they don't feel happy. So they got to look at an alternative. And we are a very solid infrastructure alternative. That's one factor that's clearly play.  The second factor, as I mentioned a little earlier, that that we ourselves as a company, have gotten to a point where we have a portfolio that can address, pretty much across the enterprise, all the applications that customers are running. So all applications that you know, from small scale to very large scale. And that makes us a bigger player in our customers' minds, right? It's not that they're thinking about it as a vendor for just one use case anymore. They're thinking about as a platform vendor for them that can run other applications. And so that typically leads to a more larger strategic engagement with the customer, which also takes longer. So that I think is what's playing in our -- for us -- playing out for us now.\nErik Suppiger: Okay, very good. And then just on the ChatGPT in-a-box. Just curious if you have seen particular groups or segments of your customer base that are adopting that, who is doing AI in a private cloud these days? \nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. First of all, I'd say it's early days for us, Erik on that for sure. But we are seeing traction across all kinds of verticals. Financial services, defense, federal, in fact, one of our first events was with the federal agency, manufacturing, pharma or medical devices, so there's just many different verticals. But the use cases tend to be somewhat similar. Document summarization, search, analytics, co-piloting, customer service, enhanced fraud detection, these are some of the same sort of same use cases, but across a range of verticals.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Bollin from Cleveland Research Company. Your line is open.\nBen Bollin : Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Rukmini, you made a comment about investing carefully for the growth in front of you. And there's been a few questions on hiring. I'm curious about how your hiring plans have evolved since the start of the year, when you look at -- what you see out there, in particular, how you're managing the amount of inbound activity that you are seeing from partners and customers? And then I had a follow up.\nRajiv Ramaswami: So maybe I think Ben, so I think there's a couple of points. One is related to hiring the other this inbound activity from partners, customers, et cetera. So slightly different questions there. So, I think, on the hiring we, you know, we, if you look at our history here, we've been very, very tight on OpEx, apart few years for the right reasons. As we consolidated our portfolio, got some more focus into the company, and got our execution going.  And now this is the year where we are investing, our OpEx is going up as based on what we talked about, and what we're investing, judiciously continuing to drive both growth and leverage to our bottom line. But we're certainly investing, we're investing in terms of building out our portfolio from an R&D perspective, we’re investing in terms of our go-to-market, so that we can be more effective in terms of getting -- handling the demands that we started to see.  And to your point over the last, I would say, a year or two years, we've seen more than coming from customers, partners, and managed service providers. And we are -- we now have focused efforts in terms of addressing all of those, whether it be a larger set of customer engagement, whether it be more focus in terms of the partners, which was one of the priorities that I said very early on when we started here three years ago. So more focus on the channel, enabling them recruiting partners, giving them incentive, making them more autonomous. And extending that to our managed service provider partners where we continue to add more of them to our partner network over time.\nBen Bollin: Okay, that's great. Rajiv, one other question for you is, you commented earlier about some CIO scrutiny as it relates to the data center investments and public cloud investments. I'm curious if you're seeing any change in how customers are thinking about their longer term infrastructure planning, from an investment perspective, notably, because of what's happened with Broadcom and VMware? That's it for me. Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Well, I mean, certainly, Ben, so the bottom wave, I think, absolutely, it is, right. I mean, again, VMware was a great technology vendor with a lot of innovation, and customers and with a large footprint of customers, and now they have to rethink whether that's the right long term strategy for them. And so that says, okay, well, we got to either look at alternative providers, of which we are an easy alternative. Or they could say, well, I could go more to the public cloud, okay, which is not an easy thing for existing workloads, to just take everything and move to the public cloud, that's not easy to do.  And then they factor into the fact, cost regulatory aspects of it, and so forth. So, so clearly, I think, for us as a vendor, there's certainly, we see customers continue to invest in infrastructure modernization, in terms of digitization, in terms of running modern applications, not just in the public cloud, but also on prem. And like some of these new cycles that are happening now, like AI, for example. We’ll also find this path down the same route, right, which is, you know, it's starting out with a lot of training happening in the public cloud, but it's moving towards, okay, I'm going to run my AI, I'm going to preach -- I'm going to fine tune the training on my own data sets, which are proprietary that I want to keep carefully. And I'm going to have to potentially look at slightly different solutions for inferencing, which are going to be running closer to my edge locations. So these things are driving what we call hybrid multi cloud. And I think that's very much I think, the world that many of our customers are here for the next several years.\nOperator: Thank you one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from line of Dan [indiscernible], from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hey, it's Dan [indiscernible] for Matt Hedberg. Appreciate you taking a question here. To build off a recent answer that mentioned that 360 approach around VMware deals. Could you go into some of the mechanics and processes involved in migration over from VMware? I guess, you know, specifically, what tools are in place to facilitate migrations? And then how long does a typical migration take?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I mean, and the answer to that varies, but I'll go through the process Dan. So, there's clearly an assessment of what the workloads are, that our applications are, that are running on that infrastructure. That's one part of it and making sure that we can run all those workloads with good performance, which by and large is the case these days. The second is what elements of the stack have been deployed. And the more of the elements that they have deployed, the stickier or the more complex the migration becomes.  So for example, for a customer that definitely deployed a hypervisor, it's a largely automated move away from the hypervisor to our hypervisor, we have automated tools. In fact, our tools called move, we've done a lot of the VM migrations all day long. And so that's a relatively simple migration that can be done automated.  Now, at the other end of the spectrum, if they've invested a lot of custom automation work, custom security work on top of the stack, then some of those will have to be converted over that requires a professional services engagement, which also as part of our offering, to help convert over some of those onto our platform or on to more open type of platform. For example, automation, people are looking at Terraform as an example. So in those cases, it's a more complex migration.  I'll give you some examples, though, in a lot of cases, actually, what happens is that the migration planning takes some time, the actual execution of the migration is very quick. There was a case study that we published recently of a healthcare system that we've been engaged with for the past three years or so. The name of pediatrics is public this point, and they plan this migration for a few years. But when they actually came around to doing the migration, they were done within 90 days. So that's a typical example as a cycle of selling and engagement and everything and then getting everything ready. And then once it's very, they were able to migrate in 90 days, and I would call them as a medium complexity environment, they're not at the high end of the complexity, but they're not necessarily the lower, the simplest type.\nUnidentified Analyst : That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nVictor Chiu: Hi, guys, this is Victor Chiu for Simon Leopold. Just really quickly, can you help us understand what's baked into your full year outlook specifically, just, you know, the current guidance reflects gains from VMware at a similar rate, or you expecting this accelerates from here?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Victor, for the question. So the full year guide, assume some benefit from the VMware being acquired by Broadcom as we said at the beginning of the year, and no, it does not expect any acceleration at this point, right? It just assumes it has some benefit in there. It also assumes a small benefit, as we've talked about before, towards the end of the year, from the Cisco partnership, as well, but that, again, as Rajiv said, we expect that to grow over time, and certainly in fiscal year '25. But there's a small benefit from that baked in, as well, in addition to sort of all the other dynamics we've talked about on this call, including modest elongation, average sales cycles, unpredictability with regard to large deals in the pipeline, et cetera.\nVictor Chiu: Okay, great. That's helpful. And just lastly, I wanted to follow up on the macro question. We've been hearing through the channel that the sentiment on, you know, the HCI market overall has turned slightly more cautious. Can you help us understand what you're thinking for HCI growth overall this year, and how Nutanix performs relative to that?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, maybe I’ll take that. I don’t think, we haven't seen a slowdown or caution around its adoption, I think it's been the same kind of dynamic that we've seen in the past. There's a legacy infrastructure out there. The HCI capabilities are continuously gotten better over time where HCI they can run pretty much all enterprise workloads on the platform, and in many cases can do so with better performance even than legacy architectures. So better performance, better TCO, much simpler to operate.  So, but I think what we've always had to overcome as inertia. We've got a set way of doing things that customers have been doing for a long time. And here is a shift to a more modern software defined architecture and that shift we have to do, and we have to overcome that with all the -- but that's been what we've been doing the entire existence of the company. So I wouldn't see that there's been a bunch of change in how our customers are thinking about it. Certainly, or not in the last year or so that I've seen.\nVictor Chiu: Great, and, you know, how the growth, you know, what you're thinking for growth and kind of how Nutanix is growing relative?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yeah, I think we, I don't have much to add beyond what we comment at Investor Day, just last September, where we provided both your TAM and SAM opportunities and our growth outlook in terms of, you know, 20% ARR growth in terms of what we could drive through FY '27 is what we said there.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, this will conclude our question and answer session today. Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."

We hope to see you at one of these events. Finally, our second quarter fiscal 2024 quiet period will begin on Wednesday, January 17th. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Rajiv. Rajiv?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you, Rich, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered a solid first quarter with results that came in ahead of our guidance. The uncertain macro backdrop that we saw in our first quarter was largely unchanged compared with the prior quarter. However, we saw a steady demand for our solutions driven by businesses prioritizing their digital transformation and infrastructure modernization initiatives and looking to optimize their total cost of ownership. Taking a closer look at the first quarter, we were happy to have exceeded all our guided metrics. We delivered record quarterly revenue of $511 million, exceeding a $2 billion annualized run rate for the first time, and grew our ARR 30% year-over-year to $1.7 billion. We also had another quarter of strong free cash flow generation aided by good linearity. Overall, our first quarter financial performance was a strong start to our fiscal year. Our federal business is typically strong in our first quarter, and this one was no exception. We saw wins with several different agencies across all three of our expansion vectors, including additional capacity for existing workloads, capacity for net new workloads, and adoption of additional portfolio products. The wins also included expansion into the public cloud with NC2 on AWS, and our first win with a large existing customer for GPT-in-a-Box, our recently introduced turnkey solution for deploying generative AI. We view the breadth and diversity of our wins with this important customer as a testament to our ability to expand within our largest customers. Another notable win in the quarter was with a Global 2000 bank in the Asia Pacific region. This customer, who signed a significant expansion agreement, selected Nutanix as their sole platform for their future modernization initiatives and planned build out of multiple new data centers. This was a departure from their historical dual vendor strategy. They chose our Nutanix Cloud Platform, including Nutanix Cloud Management to run their containerized, business-critical applications, leveraging its simplicity and built-in automation for infrastructure-as-a-service. They also adopted Nutanix database service for managing and deploying their databases throughout their organizations. We see this win as a great example of our ability to partner with the largest and most demanding companies in the world, as they look to modernize and grow their businesses. Generating leverage from our partners remains a key focus. And towards this end, I am excited with the early progress we've seen with our recently launched Cisco partnership. This past quarter, our joint solution was made generally available to be sold by both sales forces. We also saw good customer interest and secured a few wins for this new offering, which were conversions of customers, who had previously been planning to purchase Cisco's HyperFlex. While it is still early days in this partnership, I am encouraged by what we’ve seen so far. Another positive development on the partner front in the first quarter was a significant expansion deal we signed with a North American managed service provider, or MSP. This partner was increasing its capacity to handle the expected growth of its Nutanix related business. We see this win as reflecting the growing traction we are seeing with our MSP partners. On the product front, this quarter we announced important enhancements to the Nutanix Cloud Platform to strengthen its capabilities against ransomware attacks on unstructured data. These new features enable organizations to detect the threat, defend from further damage and begin a one click recovery process, all within 20 minutes of exposure. They build on the strength of the Nutanix Cloud Platform to protect and secure customers' most sensitive data across clouds. These enhancements reflect our ongoing commitment to investing in our platform. In the past quarter, we continued to receive industry recognition for our Nutanix Cloud Platform, being recognized as a leader in the latest report from Forrester Research in this area. We view our position as one of only two companies named as a leader in this report, as a reflection of our strong competitive position in the market. Finally, it was a pleasure seeing many of you in-person at our recent Investor Day. We were happy to be able to provide an update on a large and growing market opportunity to discuss our long-term vision of enabling portable applications and to provide targets calling for an ARR compound annual growth rate of approximately 20% through fiscal year '27 and generation of $700 million to $900 million of free cash flow in fiscal year '27. We have received great feedback so far from our Investor Day, and look forward to continuing to drive towards the vision and targets we share. And with that, I’ll hand it over to Rukmini Sivaraman. Rukmini?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Rajiv. I will first provide commentary on our Q1 '24 results, followed by the guidance for Q2 '24 and fiscal year '24. Q1 '24 was a good quarter in which we exceeded the high end of the range on all guided metrics. ACV billings in Q1 was $287 million, above the guided range of $260 million to $270 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 24%. Revenue in Q1 was $511 million, higher than the guided range of $495 million to $505 million and a year-over-year growth rate of 18%. The outperformance was driven partly by stronger-than-expected performance from our U.S. federal government business, which grew significantly year-over-year in new ACV bookings. Our renewals performance also continued to be good. ARR at the end of Q1 was $1.664 billion, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 30%. Similar to last quarter, we saw a modest elongation of average sales cycles, relative to the year ago quarter. Average contract duration in Q1 was 2.9 years, slightly lower quarter-over-quarter and largely in line with our expectations, due to the higher mix of U.S. federal government business, which typically has lower contract duration. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 85.9%, higher than our expectations, due to higher revenue and a mix of factors leading to lower-than-expected cost of goods sold. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $360 million in Q1. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 15.6%, higher than our guided range of 9% to 11%, partly due to higher-than-expected revenue. Non-GAAP net income in Q1 was $85 million or EPS of $0.29 per share, based on fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 293 million shares. Linearity was good, and DSOs, based on revenue and ending AR were 24 days in Q1. Free cash flow in Q1 was $132 million, implying free cash flow margin of 26%, higher than our expectations, largely due to better-than-expected bookings familiarity. We saw a larger-than-expected proportion of Q1 bookings in the first two months of the quarter. And since our payment terms are typically 30 to 45 days, more of the bookings were billed and collected in Q1, than expected. We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $1.571 billion, up from $1.437 billion in '23. Under the share repurchase program, authorized by our Board of Directors at the end of August, we began repurchasing shares in Q1, through a 10b5-1 plan. Given the timing of the authorization, we were in the market repurchasing shares for only a portion of Q1. Moving on to Q2. Our guidance for Q2 '24 is as follows: ACV billings of $295 million to $305 million; revenue of $545 million to $555 million; non-GAAP gross margin of 85% to 86%; non-GAAP operating margin of 14% to 16%; fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 297 million shares. The updated guidance for full year fiscal year 2024 is as follows: ACV billings of $1.08 billion to $1.1 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 14% at the midpoint of the range; revenue of $2.095 billion to $2.125 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 13% at the midpoint; non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 85%; non-GAAP operating margin of 11.5% to 12.5%; free cash flow of $340 million to $360 million, representing free cash flow margin of 16.6% at the midpoint of the range. This updated fiscal year '24 guidance is higher than our previously provided fiscal year '24 guidance, across all metrics. I will now provide some additional commentary regarding our fiscal year '24 guidance. First, we are seeing continued new and expansion opportunities for our solutions, despite the uncertain macro environment. However, as we mentioned previously, we have continued to see a modest elongation of average sales cycles. Our fiscal year '24 new and expansion ACV performance outlook assumes some impact from these macro dynamics. Second, the guidance assumes that our renewals business will continue to perform well. And a reminder that while our available to renew, or ATR pool, continues to grow year-over-year, it is growing at a slower pace in fiscal year '24, but is expected to reaccelerate in fiscal year '25, based on our current view. Third, the full year guidance assumes that average contract duration would be flat to slightly lower, compared to fiscal year '23, as renewals continue to grow as a percentage of our billings. A reminder that the full year ACV billing is not the sum of the ACV billings of the four quarters, due to contracts with durations less than one year. We expect full year ACV billings to be about 5% to 6% lower than the sum of the four quarters ACV billings. Finally, a few thoughts on seasonality for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on our current view, we expect the trend in top line metrics in Q3 relative to Q2, to be more or less similar to what we saw in fiscal year '23. A reminder that operating expenses tend to be slightly higher in Q3 versus Q2, all else being equal, as Q3 includes the full impact of calendar year resets to payroll taxes. In closing, we are pleased with our Q1 results exceeding guidance and to raise our top line and bottom line guidance for the full fiscal year. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question for today will be coming from in Pinjalim Bora of JPMorgan.\nPinjalim Bora: Hey. Thank you. This is Pinjalim. Thank you for taking the questions, and congrats on the quarter, guys. Rajiv, I was surprised to hear your first customer for GPT-in-a-Box. So, that's what I'm going to ask. What -- maybe add a little bit more color around what this company is doing with GPT-in-a-Box? Is this more of a test dev kind of an environment, or are they looking to actually do something in production using GPT-in-a-Box? Are you seeing similar deals in the pipeline? How should we think about uplift in ACV? A number of questions, just surprised to see a new customer signing up so quickly.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, Pinjalim, so thanks for the question. It's still early days for GPT-in-a-Box. Actually, we've seen good inbound interest from customers, as well as prospective ecosystem partners. Now, we did land that first win for GPT-in-a-Box. It is a federal agency. And the use cases are along the lines of what we've talked about. A lot of use cases have to do with document, search, document retrieval that we were looking for patterns, looking for potential criminal activity, et cetera, right? And that's along the line for what this particular agency was looking to do. Now, from an offering perspective, it's still very early days for us. It's still early to really comment on when it's going to be a meaningful contribution to our numbers, at this point. And so that's what I can say about GPT now. Perhaps it might be worth recapping a little bit on a broader basis of how we see this market for us, if that makes sense. So for us, I look at AI, I've sort of said this at our Investor Day, but there's three parts to it, first is landing new applications. Lots of companies looking at new applications like this particular customer and many others. Lining that on our platform. And there, again, I think AI applications are going run around where the data is. And some of the data will be in the public cloud, but others are going to be sensitive. They're going to be in the private cloud in secure locations, for example. And for those types of situations, we can help with our GPT-in-a-Box platform to provide a turnkey solution for them to both fine tune and train model from their specific data, as well as do inferencing. That's the first piece in terms of landing new applications. The second is, of course, about making our own products better. And we do, for example, a lot of telemetry that we gather from customers and we can use back-end AI to analyze that, get insight. We have a product around operations management. In fact, that product we call AI Operations. And so again, there's a lot of AI behind it to make the operating environment and optimize the operating environment such as capacity planning, et cetera. So that's the second vector. And the third vector is really using it internally itself to make things more efficient and run us more -- automate more processes inside the Company. We are starting that out, for example, with customer service on our end. So that's a broader picture. Still early days for us with gen AI. But again, lots of interest, and we'll continue to engage.\nPinjalim Bora: Understood. One follow-up. We -- in the channel, we have been hearing that Red Hat has kind of thrown its hat on for the VMware opportunity with OpenShift’s virtualization technology. You obviously have a strong partnership with Red Hat. How do you kind of see that competition play out as both of you kind of go after the VMware opportunity.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. In fact, I mean, I think the -- this was actually the original thesis for the Red Hat partnership, that we complement each other very well, they, from an OpenShift perspective, being -- providing a complete platform for modern app development and b, being the underlying infrastructure platform. And so from their perspective, as they compete against VMware on the application side, we compete with VMware on the infrastructure side. So, the partnership was very good from that perspective, good synergies on our side. Now, we have seen several customers adopt OpenShift on top of Nutanix, that continues. And we've seen G2K wins here as well with including G2K banks, for example, running OpenShift on the Nutanix platform. So, it's a good synergistic relationship. We look forward to doing more with them. So in fact, this particular G2K bank in Asia Pacific, that I mentioned, was a good example where they're running OpenShift on top of our cloud platform.\nOperator: And today, our next question will be coming from Jim Fish of Piper Sandler.\nJim Fish: Just wanted to build off the last one and ask it a little bit more directly. You guys have talked about like a little bit of VMware contribution here this quarter. But, maybe you could walk us just through the pipeline. What does the pipeline look now that the competitor's acquisition has officially closed over to Broadcom and you've actually already seen them from what we've heard in our channel shacks at least, about them kind of raising maintenance prices pretty significantly. So can you just walk us through a little bit more detail on what you're seeing on the VMware pipeline itself going forward outside of just the Red Hat opportunity?\nRajiv Ramaswami: For sure, Jim, good question. And of course, very relevant, given what just happened with the transaction closing. So, even this last quarter, we did close some additional deals that I would consider to be influenced by the Broadcom VMware transaction. In fact, again, going back to that bank win that we talked about, the G2K bank, that was certainly influenced by this transaction. As we mentioned, it was a dual vendor strategy, but going forward, it's going to be a single vendor strategy with us. Now, the timing and magnitude of these deals is unpredictable. And also attributing the primary motivation for these deals also can be a bit nuanced. Because we compete every day, right, even before all of the acquisition news, so. But certainly it’s contributing. Now the transaction, of course, closed recently, but we don't expect that to have an immediate impact for us in terms of timing of potential risk. Clearly, some -- many customers have signed multiyear ELAs with VMware, prior to the deal closing. And for those that have signed that gives them some time to evaluate options going forward. There continues to be certainly a lot of concerns around all the stuff we've talked about in the past, pricing, increased pricing, potentially dropping support levels, et cetera. So we have a significant pipeline of opportunities, and it's growing and a good degree of engagement with prospects, driven by these concerns. It's just difficult to predict timing and magnitude of wins. And we continue to expect some benefit from these influenced by this transaction, and we certainly factored that in -- into our guidance for this fiscal year.\nJim Fish: Very helpful. And I’m surprised to hear a little bit about the Cisco partnership already picking up. I mean, we're two months in. Understanding it's easier with the installed base of HyperFlex to kind of sell or sell into that base. But, any way to think about if there are larger periods of renewals at certain times within that base, or if those renewals are accelerating, understanding you mentioned that the larger the wins there were more on the kind of customers evaluating HyperFlex and you guys get substituted in.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I mean, first of all, I think we're happy that we are -- our joint solution with Cisco became available this last quarter. So it's now in the field, both sellers are selling it. And those deals -- the initial deals, of course, naturally are ones where Cisco was either had already won them or was very close to winning them with HyperFlex, and now they're simply converting those over to Nutanix going forward. So that's one of the first parts. But with respect to new pipeline, really, I mean, we know that our pipeline takes 6 to 9 months to go close deals for us, right? So we don't expect a huge amount of Cisco this year. We expect some and we factored that into our guidance this year. And then we expect that to continue growing next fiscal year and beyond.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Matt Hedberg of RBC Capital.\nMatt Hedberg: Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. And I'll offer my congrats as well. Really solid quarter and guide, especially given the uncertainty of the macro environment. Rukmini, I had a question for you. You noted strong renewals in the quarter and obviously, it's becoming a bigger part of the mix. On the call, you talked about some new wins as well. But I'm curious, can you just step back and maybe double click a little bit more on the new business side of it. I know that, obviously, it's been more of a renewals business of late. But just where are we in the new business sort of aspect of the story?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi Matt, thank you for the question. So, if we think about Q1, I'll talk about Q1 performance versus maybe what you were alluding to, but then also maybe talk a little bit about the full year, Matt, to your point on just trends and so on. So in Q1, specifically, our overall sort of top line performance or outperformance really was driven by a combination of good execution across our new and expansion business. And within that, we talked specifically about our U.S. federal business, which had a really significant and nice year-over-year growth in new and expansion ACV bookings. So that was certainly something that we benefited from in Q1. Now for the full year, Matt, we've talked about, I think, some puts and takes that we are factoring into our outlook. One is that we are expecting some improvement in our new and expansion ACV performance, compared to fiscal year '23. We've talked about -- Rajiv just touched upon like some things that we're factoring in, in terms of benefits, whether it be a little benefit from our -- from what's happening in the competitive environment, some benefits from the fairly new Cisco partnership and so on. So we have some things that we're optimistic and excited about. At the same time, as you started your question, Matt, there is also uncertainty in the macro, which just means that it's harder for us to sit here and say exactly how the rest of the year is going to play out. So those are some of the things we've factored into our new and expansion performance for the year. I will say, I think as you pointed out, right, renewals tends to be much more predictable portion of the business, just given our GRR, as you said before, is in the 90-plus percent range, and we know when those renewals are coming up for the next transaction. And so that part continues to be predictable and continues to perform well. And so hopefully, that gives you a sense of revenue and expansion.\nMatt Hedberg: Super helpful. If I could ask one more. The gross margin performance has been great. And obviously, you guided to a really strong Q2 gross margin. Maybe could you double click there also, like what are some of the biggest factors driving that significant gross margin improvement?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. So, I think a couple of points that I would make. Again, I'll start with sort of the Q1 and maybe the Q2 guide, Matt, and then talk more broadly on gross margin. So for Q1, we attributed our gross margin outperformance, revenue coming in slightly higher, of course, because we beat on revenue. But we also had a mix of factors that led to COGS coming in lower. Now, there were a few things in there, Matt. I think that I would call out as one singular factor but a mix of things, some of which we believe will sustain and which is why we were happy to take up our full year gross margin number, last quarter when we gave you the first guide, we said approximately 84%, and we're happy to take it up to approximately 85%. So I would say it's just a mix of good execution on a few different funds, and a reminder that our COGS has a good portion of it is our support teams like for our customer support folks are in there, we have services costs in there. And so across a few different dimensions, we were happy to see gross margin do better and take some of that across to the full year guide as well.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from George Wang of Barclays.\nGeorge Wang: Congrats on the quarter. Yes, so, two quick ones. Firstly, just given better-than-expected free cash flow generation, just given kind of you guys started purchasing stocks. Just curious kind of any high-level plan going forward, how to model in terms of the share buyback, just given better free cash profile?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi George, thank you for the question. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did begin repurchasing shares in Q1, under the authorization of -- that we had from our -- that was approved by our Board in August. And we did that through a 10b5-1 program that we've set up. Due to the timing of the authorization, we were only in the market for a portion of Q1. And you'll see in the financial tables that we put out with the release that we spent about $17.5 million, repurchasing shares, during that time. So for a portion of Q1, we spent $17.5 million. And the timing and amount of the future repurchases will continue to depend on a variety of factors, George, including stock prices, just conditions of the market and so on. And so I won't get too specific in terms of outlook, but I wanted to give you at least a bit of color on what we did in Q1, acknowledging it was only for a portion of the quarter.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, great. Just a quick follow-up, if I can. Just can you kind of comment on backlog? Last quarter, you talked about backlog slightly improved in absolute dollars year-over-year, as you kind of factored into the FY24 guide. Just curious if you have any latest update in terms of the backlog level and any sort of plus and minus, how would that factor into the latest guide?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, happy to give you some color on that. So we used some backlog in Q1, as is seasonally typical for Q1 and expect some backlog to be consumed over the course of this fiscal year, as we talked about before. But as is to be expected in an environment like this, where things remain fairly uncertain from a macro perspective, the range of possible outcomes is wider than usual. And as we continue to grow, the absolute dollar number of backlog would also increase over time. So, a few different factors there. But yes, I think in Q1, we used some backlog as is typical for Q1, and we expect to use some backlog over the course of the year as well.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Michael Cikos of Needham.\nMichael Cikos: Congrats on the strong quarter. I wanted to cycle back to some of the comments when we're describing the revenue and the ACV billings outperformance, I know that we cited specifically U.S. federal. Can you give us a better sense, as far as what U.S. federal is as far as size or contribution to revenue or ACV billings? Understanding that there's probably seasonality with their year-end. But would just be good to get a flavor for how big of a component that is to the overall business? And then also, if you could shed some light, I know that you cited the improved linearity during the quarter. Is it -- is that improvement linearity tied back to the stronger U.S. federal business, or is it -- are those two independent items in your view?\nRajiv Ramaswami: So I can take a first crack at the federal piece, Rukmini you can go for the rest. So what I’d say is, look, largely, we don't have verticals, but we have two exceptions. And that's in the U.S., we have federal at vertical, and we have health care as another vertical. So from that perspective, federal is a significant portion of our business. We haven't broken it out exactly in terms of the percentages. But given the fact that it is 1 of 2 verticals and we have a focused team on it, it is important for us. And of course, there's also seasonality there, as Rukmini was alluding to here. I mean this quarter typically is strong for federal. So that's kind of what we have to say about Federal. Rukmini, you can comment on the linearity.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. So on the linearity, Mike, what we mean there is we have some expectations of how much bookings comes in, in month 1, month 2, month 3. And the reason that's important for free cash flow, right, is because we invoice soon after we get the booking, and we have 30- to 45-day invoice payment terms. And so, what we saw in Q1 is that compared to our expectations going in -- so we saw a larger proportion of those bookings come in month 1 and month 2. And you're right, there's an outperformance in fed as well, and of course, fed had their year-end, the U.S. federal government has their fiscal year end in September. So that was likely a factor in that. And so what that meant was that given, again, we invoiced right after we get the bookings, we were -- we collected more cash from bookings in Q1 than we had previously expected, which was a significant driver of the free cash flow performance in Q1.\nMichael Cikos: Understood. Thank you for clearing that up. I guess, the other question that I had, this is more specific to the 2Q guidance that we have here today, Rukmini. But if I could just take a look, I'm happy to see that the revenue is coming in above where the sell side models were, happy to see the strong gross margins and then the operating margin is also coming in ahead of where we had been. But one of the things that I'm looking at is the OpEx. The implied OpEx from Q1 to Q2 has a pretty material pickup after being relatively flat the last couple of quarters. And I just wanted to see what is it that you guys are embedding in that? Is it more maybe targeted go-to-market initiatives? Are you focused on hiring or potentially backfilling open positions? Like, how should we think about that OpEx ramp that you guys are putting now in the 2Q guide?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes. So, a few points on Q2 OpEx related to Q1, Mike. The first one is, as we talked about when we laid out sort of our initial full year guide on the last call, we talked about the fact that we plan to continue to invest to drive growth, while continuing to improve the margin profile. And that's the approach that we've taken for this year, and you saw some of that in the last call, but also we touched on this sort of idea at Investor Day as well. And so in general, we've started those investments. And as you can imagine, it takes -- we're continuing to hire. And so as you can imagine, that sort of leads to sort of an increase in Q2 as more of the folks come on board. The other piece is this is only for one month of Q2. But in the calendar year resets, and I alluded to this in my script as well, like payroll taxes and all that reset for calendar year '24, which means that we have one month of that in January. That also has an effect on the Q2 OpEx. That all said, of course, we were pleased, as you pointed out, to be able to raise both of our top line and bottom line guidance for the full year.\nOperator: And the next question will be coming from Erik Suppiger JMP.\nErik Suppiger: Two questions. One, you said the sales cycles continue to elongate. Are they still getting longer, or is it just they've kind of reached a level of extended cycles? Is it consistent with last quarter? Is it actually getting longer? And then secondly, you've had some time now to talk with customers about their Chat GPT-in-a-Box. What are the specific use cases that customers are using either what department are they using that for, or how are they using that in particular?\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thank you, Erik. I'll take the first one. Yes. And then Rajiv you can take maybe the GPT-in-a-Box question. So on sales cycles, what I said in my script, Erik, was that we're seeing some increased elongation, right, in -- a modest increase in average sales cycles on a year-over-year basis. I’m comparing Q1 to Q1, it has gotten longer in Q1. But if you look at average sales cycle in Q1, it was more or less the same as the last few quarters. So it's not like it's continued to lengthen early quarter-over-quarter, but year-over-year, it remains elevated. And this -- again, it's hard to sort of focus what's going to -- exactly is going to happen here, given all the uncertainties we've talked about, but that's what we saw in Q1.\nErik Suppiger: Okay.\nRajiv Ramaswami: So Erik, on the GPT-in-a-Box. By the way, it’s GPT not ChatGPT. So on the GPT-in-a-Box section, there are four use cases that we typically see. And again, I want to caution all this by saying it's pretty early. A lot of people are just trying to figure out how to use gen AI. But the four use cases right now. First, of course, is a classic customer service use case. That includes chat, that's one. The second is a whole bunch of operations having to do with documents, document, search documents, analysis documents, retrieval of key information from unstructured data, for example. So that's the second big, I would say, a use case. The third use case is co-piloting, generally providing assistive services, for example, to software developers or researchers in pharma for example. That's the third use case. And the fourth use case I would broadly classify as fraud detection or fraud prevention. And these are things across multiple verticals. I think these tend to cut across verticals, whether it be financial services or retail or our federal or other.\nErik Suppiger: Last question is you talked about the class of customer service. Is that the majority of the use cases at this point, or is it spread across those different four options?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I would say it's spread across. It's -- now the customer service one, for example, happens to be one that we are ourselves internally trialing right now within Nutanix. But I would say it's fairly broad-based across all of those four. And it's still very early, I have to say, to say, hey, we can actually say, hey, this percent of one use case versus the other. It's just, we are in the forming stages here.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Karan on for Meta. So just first question, I understand it's sort of a challenging environment today. But I guess just in terms of customer conversations or what you're hearing from customers in terms of 2024 budgets, I guess what are you hearing from customers on those budgets? And are you seeing a pickup in any RFP activity?\nRajiv Ramaswami: I wouldn't say there's anything specific we are seeing in our conversations with customers. I think, certainly, look, I would say they're still investing in their digital efforts, in their modernization efforts. Every customer call I have, there’s conversation on how they can be using AI inside their companies. So from a budget perspective, I would say, in general, I think, IT spending will probably grow faster than GDP growth. And within that, I would say software modernization spending will probably grow faster than that. But we haven't seen any specific trend other than the fact that there are -- customers are still on us, at least, they're willing to spend the money. They want to make sure there's a solid business case and there's good TCO and ROI for everything that they do. And there's certainly more inspection, which is what is causing the elongation in the cycle, right? They want to make sure there may be an additional level of approvals, for example, before they sign up on projects. But, they're still moving forward with projects.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful. And then a quick follow-up. Sort of at the Analyst Day, you mentioned some of the VMware share gains would likely take place, with just a little bit of share with each customer over time. I guess as you started to see these opportunities take place, are these shares maybe -- the share taking greater than expected, or is it just more opportunities or more at bats, or I guess just any color around sort of the opportunities you're seeing in share gains there?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. I think we commented on the overall situation from a VMware Broadcom perspective. Again, I think we are still at a point where we have a significant and growing pipeline of opportunities that we are engaged in with prospects. But it's hard to predict what portion of those will win? How much will they, for example, bring us in as a second vendor or the sole vendor or just use us as a negotiating lever to get a better deal from VMware. So there's a lot of uncertainty and lack of predictability there for the long term. So we've focused -- or the timing, for example, for when this might happen. So, we -- that's why we have -- we've modeled in some level of share gains here into our forecast for the year and incorporated into the guidance. But it's going to be -- I would again emphasize that it's going to be a multiyear thing for us here. And it's going to be a bit timing, and the exact share gains are going to be a little unpredictable.\nOperator: Our next question will be coming from Ben Bollin of Cleveland Research.\nBen Bollin: Rajiv, I wanted to ask about the Global 2000 Financials Awards. Could you share a little bit about what that process looks like? How long was the evaluation, the pilot? And how does the ACV ramp for that deal? Does it build over time, as they get more data centers? Does it commence at a full run rate? Just any color on that? And then, I have a follow-up.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. So this particular bank in Asia Pacific, the G2K bank, has been a customer for a while for us. And what they've been doing, of course, is the classic, they've been migrating from traditional legacy 3-tier infrastructure over to HCI. And for many years -- I mean, they've been a customer for a while now. And for many years, it was a dual vendor situation with us and VMware. And -- so they've been going down both parts. They had us, they had this sense. And this was a classic time, where we were coming due for renewal, and they were also looking to expand, significantly increase their presence, they’re growing and they had multiple data centers that they were going to go modernize. So for them, this was a time for them to -- for us to do an expansion along with the renewal, a substantial expansion. And like we've said with other G2K customers, generally, once we get in the door, they're pretty happy with us, and they do expand with us over time. In fact, we've given you some data at Investor Day in terms of how much the expansion is, like I think it was 25x or 26x over life. So this particular bank was similar, right? They liked us. They were comfortable with us. And then now they have this additional trigger that they were concerned about what would happen on the other side. So when they did do the expansion with us, they went with us as a sole vendor. So that's sort of how it played out for us.\nRukmini Sivaraman: If I can add to that, Ben. I think you had a question on ACV ramp. And just to clarify, our contracts, typically, they're sort of evenly spread up. There isn't a ramp within the year. So like this transaction and typically most of our transactions, it would be a total TCV amount divided by the contract duration. That's how we calculate the ACV of any given transaction.\nBen Bollin: Okay. That's great. The other item, Rajiv, I'm curious, you talked about the MSP awards. Can you share any thoughts about your strategy around go-to-market efforts? Do you have some programs specifically geared to pursue more of these partners that are potentially alienate by this deal? That's it for me.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes, I think that's -- again, that's both an MSP specific thing here and a broader thing here, as well in your questions, Ben. So on the MSP specific, I mean, for us, independent of this transaction. This was a an area that we want to do more in because traditionally, we have not had a big route to market through MSPs. So for the last couple of years, we've been building up our MSP presence and recruiting more of these MSPs to come on board as partners. And that continues. And this particular deal this last quarter was a good example of an expansion opportunity where they had done something small with us and now the standard is a significant expansion with us. So I do think that with the transaction happening, it's not only the customers of VMware that are going to be concerned, but there's also their partners and that includes the MSP partners. So, we are talking to the MSP partners, just like people with other customers and trying to recruit more of them on to the Nutanix platform. And so, this is still -- I would say, we are young when it comes to the MSP route to market. And so, there's potentially a lot more MSPs that we do need to recruit over time and get on board as our partners. And we have a team at Nutanix that’s focused on recruiting these partners and enabling that.\nOperator: The next question is coming from Ruplu Bhattacharya from Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: It's actually Wamsi here at Bank of America. I guess, Rukmini, if you could address seasonality. Your Q2 revenue guidance at the midpoint is calling for 8% growth. That is the lowest that we've seen over the last four or five years, but you're calling for Q3 seasonality to be down similar to fiscal '23, which is down the highest in the last several years. And I'm just wondering, are you seeing something around the macro that's causing you to view the seasonality this way, which is actually a little bit bias lower towards Q3 than historically, a little bit lower also in Q2 to the upside. Just wondering if you could share any color there.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Hi Wamsi, thanks for the question. So a few things I would say. One, on the Q1 to Q2 dynamic. We talked about Q1, of course, came in at a bit higher than our expectations, given the beat across revenue and ACV billings, Wamsi. So I think relative to that Q2, I think, to your point, still going to look based on our guidance, right, higher than Q1 as we seasonally see. So, I wouldn't read too much into that dynamic. And then, the reason we sort of gave the color on Q3 is to just note what we're seeing right now, based on pipeline and all the various factors we've talked about already, as it relates to things that are driving the top line. And I'll just remind folks, again, as we said in the prepared remarks as well that the full year ACV billings is at about a 5% or 6% discount with some of the four quarters given the annualization that we do each quarter for contracts less than one year. So overall, I'd say, Wamsi, I think I wouldn't read too much into the seasonality point, other than we're seeing -- this is what we're seeing in our pipeline. I wanted to give folks an update on that. And overall, we're happy to be able to raise our '24 ACV billings guidance, right, following a solid first quarter, but we've also factored in some caution overall regarding how the rest of the year plays out given some of this macro uncertainity.\nWamsi Mohan: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. And just on free cash flow out of clarification. When you think about what you would have normally called a normal booking linearity in the quarter, what was -- what would you say is the delta of overachievement in fiscal 1Q? And is that overachievement primarily what's driving the full year free cash flow increase, or are you expecting sort of -- is that free cash flow weighs beyond sort of the 1Q overachievement? Thank you so much.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Yes, great question, Wamsi. So two thoughts. So one on Q1, we, of course, don't guide to quarterly free cash flow. So I'm not able to sort of give you specifically how much we overachieved our own expectations for Q1 free cash flow, but we did overachieve it. And I will say that, in addition to the billings number coming higher, right, given we had a beat on ACV billings as well for Q1. So that helped, but the linearity was a significant factor in Q1, okay? So that did have a significant impact on the outperformance for free cash flow in Q1. And I think the second part of your question is around the full year free cash flow guidance. And what I'd say there is that in addition to benefiting from the raised top line guide, and of course, as you know, billings has a very high correlation with free cash flow, right? So the fact that we were able to raise our full year billings number. So that's one factor. But we're also expecting to see some benefit from somewhat better working capital management within the year than previously expected, including from improved linearity. So that is helping us to raise the full year free cash flow guide as well.\nOperator: And the next question is coming from Simon Leopold of Raymond James.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Victor Chiu [ph] in for Simon Leopold. Regarding the share shifts and competitive dynamics with VMware, are there instances where customers use both VMware and Nutanix?\nRajiv Ramaswami: A lot of customers use both VMware and Nutanix. And again, I think just to clarify, how they use. Sometimes their users is just -- they’ll have a dual vendor strategy. They'll do some with VMware, some with Nutanix. There's also -- we work together with Nutanix -- I mean, Nutanix works together with VMware’s hypervisor, ESX. So, we have a lot of customers who are deploying Nutanix on top of VMS hypervisor, ESX. And over the years, many of these have also migrated from ESX to our own built-in hypervisor that's included in the platform. In fact, again, I would say, over the years, we came up with our own hypervisor back in 2015. And today, if you look at our workloads across the entire spectrum of customers, about 65% of those workloads have migrated and they are now on just a Nutanix hypervisor. Most of those won VMware ESX hypervisors. But we are committed to continuing to interoperate very nicely with VMware. And so customers have the choice. They have -- it's all about providing a premium of choice for customers. So we interoperate with them, we can replace them fully. It's up to the customer.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. And are you having discussions with customers? Is your visibility kind of what -- into what their plans are going forward, kind of built into your assumptions and kind of the share shifts that come along with that, is that kind of built into assumptions or is there some dry powder that that potentially happens with the shift?\nRajiv Ramaswami: Yes. Like we said, it's hard to predict the timing and how big these things are going to be, right? And so, we have factored in some of this into our guide for the full year, and we'll have to see how things materialize. There's a lot of engagement, but what happens to these engagements from do we win them fully, do we win partially or do we win nothing and just become a leverage point for them to get a better deal on the other side? It's hard to predict ahead of time. So we have to see how it plays out. And it's hard to predict both timing and the degree to which they'll play out for each customer.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nRajiv Ramaswami: I don't think we have any closing remarks. Do we?\nRich Valera: No, I think we conclude the call now. Thank you.\nRajiv Ramaswami: Thank you all.\nRukmini Sivaraman: Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining the conference call tonight. You may all disconnect."
