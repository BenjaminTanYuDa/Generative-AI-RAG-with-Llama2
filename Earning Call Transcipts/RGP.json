        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Resources Connections, Inc. Conference Call. Currently, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to remind everyone that management will be commenting on results for the third quarter ended February 24, 2024. They will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. An explanation and reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release issued today. Today's press release can be reviewed in the Investor Relations sections of RGP's website and filed today with the SEC. Also during this call, management may make forward-looking statements regarding plans, initiatives and strategies and the anticipated financial performance of the company. Such statements are predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. Please see the Risk Factors sections in RGP's report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 27, 2023 for a discussion of risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's business results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from what is expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made during this call. I will now turn the call over to RGP's CEO, Kate Duchene.\nKate Duchene : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In Q3, we delivered solid performance across the enterprise despite a macro environment that continues to be sluggish and uncertain. In the quarter, client engagement extensions and client retention have been robust, with new project starts still taking longer to convert than previous cycles. On revenue, we performed consistent with expectations, while also continuing to deliver strong cash flow conversion this fiscal year. On SG&A and therefore, adjusted EBITDA, we well exceeded our expectations, remaining disciplined on cost in this environment and driving efficiencies in headcount. Our balance sheet remains pristine. During Q3, we saw a positive momentum in certain regions. Asia Pacific returned to growth from earlier quarters in the fiscal year. Our Mexico, India and Switzerland practices all grew year-over-year as we delivered long-term projects for large strategic clients. North America reflected the overall choppy operating environment as clients want more confidence in lower interest rates and improving economic indicators before moving ahead with many major initiatives. Countsy, which is our business unit delivering outsourced finance and accounting and HR services for startups, scale-ups and spinouts also grew in the quarter. In fact, Countsy is seeing the strongest demand for services since the pandemic. Our pricing initiative in the U.S. has progressed with a 1% increase in bill rate year-over-year. Overall, this quarter reflects success with what we can control, including superb customer service and client retention, improving operating efficiencies and maintaining a very strong balance sheet. This success will allow us to be fast and ready as soon as the broader buying environment improves. Turning to our operational metrics. We're pleased with that our pipeline remained resilient and steady through the quarter. The pipe is not created equal as we see growth in both health care and financial services opportunities, while other sectors are still cautious. Veracity, our full-service digital transformation business, added almost 100 new opportunities in its pipeline during Q3. We are laser-focused on all the opportunities involving technology, digital and portfolio change. Such deals are non-discretionary, longer term and require larger teams. For example, ERP cloud migration opportunities are on the rise, and we've built consulting, delivery and a talent pipeline ready to respond. We're also building thought leadership around SAP S/4HANA migration, including hosting events like the webinar held last week, which drew over 600 registered attendees. Of the largest closed deal won this quarter, the majority involved SAP and Oracle Cloud migration services, digital and finance transformation. During the quarter, we also continued to focus on enhancing our consulting capabilities, which we first outlined strategically during our last Investor Day. Last week, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire management consulting firm Reference Point. This accretive acquisition is expected to close by early summer, subject to customary closing conditions. Reference Point is an advisory firm serving the financial services sector across 4 areas of focus. Strategy and management, risk and regulatory compliance, digital and technology and data and analytics. Under the leadership of its managing partner Scott Goeden, Reference Point employs a differentiated consulting delivery model where engagements are led by former industry executives with exceptional backgrounds in technology, digital and data and risk management. Like RGP, the company builds delivery teams using a combination of experienced bench and on-demand talent. We believe this acquisition offers clear benefits to both organizations, allowing us to provide an integrated value proposition to accelerate the growth of our financial services business. With the largest consulting services spend, the financial services industry was one of the first sectors we invested in and has been a top 3 industry vertical for RGP since inception. This highly strategic acquisition will expand our portfolio of high-value advisory services, particularly in the technology, data and risk management arena. We offer reference point instant access to RGP's expansive financial services client base and an expert sales team that knows how to effectively sell into this space. RGP's robust talent engine will help scale its delivery teams with expert on-demand talent. We very much look forward to welcoming the Reference Point team into the RGP family. We feel fortunate to have once again found a business whose culture is well aligned with RGP's values and our focus on client centricity and client relationships and which expands our growth prospects moving forward. Next, I'm delighted to announce that Bhadresh Patel will serve as our new Chief Operating Officer. Bhadresh joined RGP in 2019 as the CEO of Veracity. He is an engineer by background and started his professional career at Anderson. He has more than 25 years of experience spanning top-tier consulting firms and boutique specialized consulting firms. A successful entrepreneur, Bhadresh has helped build 2 high-growth digital transformation businesses over the last 10 years. In joining RGP, he has proven to be a critical member of our executive leadership team serving as our Chief Digital Officer and leading Project Phoenix, which, as you know, is RGP's technology transformation initiative. He is perfectly positioned for this role as we continue to evolve our business to lead with strategic advice and follow with seasoned consultants who execute with excellence. He knows our enterprise well while also bringing innovative ideas to improve execution to drive sustainable growth. This evolution requires effective coordination across people, process and technology, domains that Bhadresh understands well. As we bring our core consulting capabilities together under a single umbrella, experience delivering with a bench plus on-demand model is critical. In addition, in today's world where every client problem has an element of digital, automation, use of AI and/or UX, Bhadresh's background and experience will be invaluable for the future of the firm. Bhadresh will assume his position later this month. In his new role as COO, Bhadresh will continue to lead Project Phoenix. We completed Wave 1 of the project in February with the implementation of our new talent acquisition software, our contract management software and the optimization of sales force for the go-to-market team. Our project team comprised of internal employees and our own expert consultants did a fantastic job in delivering Wave 1. From my vantage point, on the steering committee for Project Phoenix, I've seen our on-demand talent model work brilliantly. Our consultants have taken lead roles in program management, change management, data migration, testing, cutover and functional expertise. For any company undergoing system transformation, having the right combination of insiders and on-demand experts is critical. Most companies do not have the muscle they need solely in-house. We offer clients on-demand experts who deliver with excellent speed and efficiency. It is also a very differentiated client outcome when the on-demand talent is experienced, has judgment and has been to the rodeo many times before. Finally, I'm pleased to share the results of a recent survey we commissioned with YouGov to discover what priorities financial decision-makers are ready to fund when interest rates start to decline. We learned that more than 80% of the 200 financial decision-makers who participated in the survey plan to increase investment in workforce development. Specifically, most are prioritizing reskilling, upskilling current employees and utilizing new engagement strategies to blend full-time employees with external, on-demand resources. They desire knowledge transfer, independent perspective and financial flexibility. Also, more than half said they would invest new capital in digital transformation and AI. In discussions last week with the global pharmaceutical and medical device clients, I learned they are following this pattern exactly. They're funding a total talent initiative to inventory incumbent employee skill sets and development desires and capturing this data with new digital tools. They are also building execution teams related to strategic initiatives with a blend of internal employees and on-demand experts to target exactly the skill sets needed for specific projects for specific periods of time. They are adamant about not carrying full-time employees for skill sets needed only on a fractional basis. In sum, we're working hard to close every business opportunity with creativity and grit. We are improving our operating model to align our consulting capabilities with more focus and under one leadership structure to also deliver scale with the on-demand talent platform. We're improving brand positioning and training for all account development teams to enable more cross-sell to drive growth. Far from standing still, we are aggressively optimizing our business to quickly capitalize on improving conditions to deliver long-term shareholder value. I'll now turn the call over to Jenn.\nJenn Ryu: Thank you, Kate, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, we achieved $151.3 million of revenue, which was consistent with our outlook range provided in January. Both our gross margin of 37% and our run rate SG&A of $45.2 million were significantly better than the favorable end of the outlook ranges provided. We produced solid adjusted EBITDA of $10.8 million or a 7.1% adjusted EBITDA margin and have delivered $34.9 million of free cash flow in the last 12 months. On a same-day constant currency basis, revenue declined by 20% year-over-year as our clients continue to be cautious with the pace of spending in the face of uncertain macro conditions, particularly in North America and Europe. Our Asia Pacific region performed relatively better with a decline of 4% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis. Markets such as India and the Philippines continue to perform well, primarily attributable to project opportunities with our large strategic clients as they continue to shift their spend to lower-cost markets in an effort to advance transformation initiative while containing costs. In addition, Singapore and Australia grew over the prior year from the expansion of our digital business with CloudGo. Operationally, as Kate mentioned, our growth pipeline remained resilient during the quarter. While the velocity of converting new opportunities in the pipeline to actual engagements remain slow, extensions on existing engagements were strong. We also saw an uptick in average deal size on closed deals during the third quarter. While the current economic environment still lacks a bit of direction, we do believe we are starting to see more movement in the sales cycle in recent weeks. Consistent with our survey results that Kate highlighted earlier, conversations with our own clients suggest that budgets do exist, and targeted investments are highly concentrated in technology upgrades and transformation. We have been laser-focused on building our pipeline in this key area to grow our top line. Gross margin in the third quarter was 37%, once again, exceeding our 35.5% to 36% outlook range and reflecting a more normalized level of health care costs than we anticipated. Gross margin in the quarter also reflects the usual holiday seasonality and a heavier mix of business in Europe and Asia Pacific, where we tend to see higher pay bill ratios than in North America. As mentioned during our January call, the pricing environment across the globe has become increasingly competitive, and this trend continued in the third quarter. Furthermore, large multinational clients shifting work to lower-cost markets such as India and the Philippines have shifted our global revenue mix and therefore, weighted average bill rates. Enterprise average bill rate for the quarter was $119 constant currency, down from $129 a year ago. Despite the pricing pressure, our U.S. stand-alone average bill rate was up 1% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We will continue to optimize our overall operating results by effectively balancing pricing and volume growth. Now on SG&A. Our run rate SG&A expense for the quarter was $45.2 million, which, as I noted, was also significantly better than our outlook range. We have remained disciplined with cost management and the reduction in force we executed in late calendar 2023 contributed approximately $3 million of SG&A savings over the prior year quarter. Variable compensation expense was also favorable in the third quarter, reflecting a true-up in bonus expense to align with the company's overall financial performance this fiscal year. Turning to liquidity. We continue to generate healthy free cash flow despite the macro environment. We ended the fiscal quarter with $114 million of cash and cash equivalents and 0 outstanding debt. After distributing $4.7 million of dividends and after $3.7 million of continued investments in our technology implementation with total available financial liquidity of $287 million at the end of the quarter, we will continue to focus on investing in the most impactful areas of the business, including completing our technology transformation project and pursuing a disciplined M&A strategy to accelerate long-term growth and profitability, while continuing to return cash to shareholders through dividends and by opportunistically repurchasing shares under our share repurchase program, which have $45 million remaining at the end of the third quarter. Now let me provide an update on the key areas of investment in capital deployment, our technology transformation project and strategic acquisition. We have made tremendous progress and launched our new talent management and contract management systems in North America during the quarter. Our financial systems go live is planned for later in the calendar year. We are already seeing immediate benefits, including enhanced speed and accuracy and talent matching, ease of talent marketing campaign and improved visibility into consultant and contract status. We will continue to extract value from the new platform as we optimize system functionalities and user adoption, and we believe this technology will enable us to achieve higher operating leverage and positions us perfectly to scale for growth. On the acquisition front, as Kate stated, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Reference Point, a strategic advisory firm serving the financial services industry, which is an important vertical for RGP. We expect this acquisition to be accretive to our financial performance. I'll now close with our fourth quarter outlook. As we anticipated, the pace of revenue conversion for new opportunities in the pipeline remained sluggish in the third quarter, putting pressure on early fourth quarter revenue trends, coupled with the timing of completion for certain large engagements, early fourth quarter weekly revenue run rate has been modest compared to the third quarter. We project fourth quarter revenue to be in the range of $137 million to $142 million. Gross margin in Q4 will continue to reflect the competitive pricing environment and the current global revenue mix. With a higher proportion of revenue coming from Europe and Asia Pacific, we estimate gross margin in Q4 to be in the range of 37.5% to 38%. We expect our fourth quarter run rate SG&A expense to be in a range of $50 million to $52 million with more normalized variable compensation expense. Non-run rate and noncash expenses for the fourth quarter will consist of technology transformation costs and stock compensation expense, both of which will be approximately $2 million. In closing, these 5 headwinds presented by the prolonged market uncertainty, we see compelling opportunities ahead as macro conditions start to recover, and we're ready to execute and excited about our business model and longer-term outlook, with a durable variable cost model, a pristine balance sheet, ample liquidity and impending accretive acquisition of Reference Point, we believe we are well positioned to continue driving long-term value creation for our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] It is from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Can you give us a little more detail with regards to Reference Point? Like how large is it? What's the growth rate? How much did you -- are you anticipating spending?\nKate Duchene: Sure. Mark, I'll start and then Jenn is going to jump in. We did have 1 correction in our prepared earnings script that we want to clarify, which Jenn will do in just a moment. With respect to Reference Point, we're not disclosing the size at this time. It is a boutique consulting firm, and we expect to close this within the next 60 days. What this enables us to really do is bring together their strategic advisory work and then more fulsome execution. They have left opportunity on the table given that they don't have as much execution scale that we do, especially from a global perspective. For example, there's an opportunity that's already in front of us with an existing client actually of both firms. But our competitive bid will be stronger together because we allow Reference Point access to our Center of Excellence talent pool in Mumbai, for example. So we really are excited about bringing our capabilities together very synergistically to serve what you know has been a long-term industry vertical for us, and where we have a very strong sales team.\nMark Marcon: Is there something that you wanted to correct from the transcript?\nKate Duchene: Yes. Jenn is trying to jump in. I can't hear you, Jenn\nOperator: [Operator Instructions].\nKate Duchene: Okay. I'll jump in and correct this. It was the disclosure we made about APAC being down constant currency, 4% that stat is actually much better, and it's really a 1.8% decline constant currency. So we just want to call that out. It's not, again, a 4% decline, a 1.8%.\nMark Marcon: Okay. Great. And can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in North America, both in terms of the ability to close deals. So I'll start there and then I want to ask about pricing and then the markets specifically. But just in terms of like, Kate, you're close to your clients, what exactly do they need to see? Because GDP has been healthy. Employment growth has been healthy. Obviously, interest rates are still high. But what exactly are they waiting for?\nKate Duchene: I think broadly, they're waiting for the first interest rate decline that is going to show -- it's going to be a firm line in the sand that we're moving in the right direction. So I do think the Fed's decision will unlock more capital. I would say, I characterize my outlook as more bullish on opportunity right now while remaining cautious on timing. . So we are starting to see these green shoots, especially around technology migration. I was just reviewing prior to the call, both are closed one for Q3 and our biggest pipeline opportunities in Q4, most involve technology change, most require project management, change management and then the wraparound services that I already talked about in my prepared remarks. So we are starting to feel more bullish about opportunity. It's really timing. That's the challenge. I'd say the other thing, Mark, about revenue, and we're conservative about that is that we do have a couple of major projects for in the energy sector that will roll or conclude in Q4. And so we've taken that into account. Now we've already identified new opportunities at those clients. But there may be a gap between the prior projects ending and the ramp-up of the new projects that we have to take into consideration.\nMark Marcon: Really appreciate that. And Kate, can you talk a little bit about like some of your major markets, whether it's the Tri-Cities New York area or if we think about Northern or Southern California or Chicago, what are you seeing in those markets? And I'm just trying to factor in like, okay, you gave us the North America numbers, but like how are those biggest offices doing? And how would you compare and contrast that to some of your not small offices, but smaller offices within the U.S.\nKate Duchene: Yes. I think the smaller offices would serve more middle market. Clients have been a little bit slower because that buying base has been more conservative. I really look at it not as much territories, Mark, but industries like where are we starting to see momentum in industries. So we talked about financial services. Pipeline is definitely growing in financial services, in health care, our longest-standing client has -- we have 3 big proposals into that client right now. I feel bullish on our opportunities to continue to serve them, but it's just when those projects will start. The next category that we're starting to see spending again is in the retail or consumer goods space. That's particularly true because that's an important concentration of clients in Europe. And then last, I'd say manufacturing is starting to come back a little bit. So that impacts more of the Chicago area, that's central of the country base probably impacts Atlanta a little bit more too. So that's really how we think about how we're gaining momentum. Let me also talk about technology because we mentioned in our earnings call a couple of quarters ago that we were starting to see some movement in technology, which has also been a very strong sector for us. And I'd say that we're seeing kind of fits and starts, we'll see some momentum, then we'll see more layoffs. Then we'll see things get put on hold because nobody wants to start a big project with on-demand talent when they've just done layoffs. So that's been a little bit, I'd say, herky-jerky, but we're starting to see more momentum in the media and entertainment space, which is pretty exciting. And that will have some positive impact in Southern California where we've had some leadership and turnover changes. So we're addressing those actively as we get ready for more opportunity there. So I hope this color has been helpful for you.\nMark Marcon: Absolutely. And then can you just talk a little bit more about the pricing within North America. What are you seeing from the big 4 and other competitors? We've obviously been reading about some of the things that they've been doing. But just wondering when you're competing with them how does that come through? Would you anticipate that pricing would actually continue to stay up year-over-year in North America? Or how are you thinking about that?\nKate Duchene: Yes. So, Jenn.\nJenn Ryu: I'm back to you guys. I'm so sorry. I was having some technical difficulties. I think I heard -- Mark, I think I heard Kate correct the one of the stat that I said in Asia Pac, instead of a decline of 4% is actually an increase of 1.8% on a constant currency basis. Yes. So I want to make sure that we clear that up. And then maybe I'll take a stab at the pricing question, Mark. And then Kate, feel free to jump in. I mean, what we're seeing from the big 4, we talked about this in the last call, obviously, the big 4, they deployed bench resources. And when they have some bench resources, they can kind of deploy for free, they're certainly doing that. And they also have deployed offshore resources. Therefore, they can blend the rates down. And there's a lot of competition when we compete with the boutique staffing firms, too. For sure, they tend to want to race to the bottom in terms of pricing. To combat that, I mean we're actively -- we talked about this last quarter, actively building our own kind of offshore talent delivery hubs and then using them as much as we can in order to blend down the rates while protecting our margin. Obviously, we've got to now strike a balance between volume and pricing to maintain our market share. But the good news is, given our predominantly variable cost model, even with lower bill rates, we're still able to maintain our margin. So that's what we're seeing. Hopefully, that helps that, Mark, hopefully, that answers your question.\nKate Duchene: Yes, I would, Jenn, add that we remain very focused on value-based pricing, Mark. That is not changing. But when you have the big 4 giving their bench resources away for free, it puts your rational pressure in the short term, not the long term.\nOperator: It comes from the line of Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Steinerman: Jenn, thanks for the revenue guide for the fourth quarter. Could you just go over what that would be on an organic constant currency basis year-over-year in terms of a percentage change on a same-day basis? And if you could mention if there's a difference in days in this fourth quarter versus the year ago fourth quarter.\nJenn Ryu: Yes. Sure. The full quarter guidance at the top -- at $142 million, which is the top end of the range, it's about a 23% down compared to year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis. And there is no -- in the U.S., there is no business day difference.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Marc Riddick with Sidoti.\nMarc Riddick: So I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks, financial services and health care. I was wondering if you could touch a little bit on those, particularly maybe starting with financial services, what maybe some of those drivers are. Is that a regulatory driver? Are you seeing a little bit of a pickup from improved M&A out there, which seems to be off to a decent start so far this year?\nKate Duchene: Yes, I'd say primarily, it's tied to regulatory requirements. Some technology investment in change. Financial services that have grown with a lot of consolidation system alignment is something that we're starting to see those large organizations address. And I think there is some activity related to M&A, and we're starting to see an uptick in request for project management type resources, Marc.\nMarc Riddick: Okay. Great. And then it was very encouraging to see the launch in North America around the talent management system. I was wondering if you could -- I think you mentioned in -- Jenn, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the financial system launch. I wasn't sure if you said calendar year or fiscal year. Is there sort of a ballpark time frame we should be thinking about for that?\nJenn Ryu: Yes. Yes. The financial systems will go live later this calendar year.\nMarc Riddick: Calendar year. Okay. Okay. Excellent. And then I was sort of thinking about, I guess, maybe sort of circling back to the M&A question but in a different way. I appreciate the commentary around Reference Point. So there's now been a couple of transactions during the year. Could you maybe sort of give your thoughts and views as to are things getting to be more attractive out there as far as potential acquisition targets and maybe the volume of what's out there, the quality of what's out there and the valuation?\nKate Duchene: Yes. So we're very much focused on continuing to invest in our digital capabilities and looking at companies that bring, I would say, more forward-looking capabilities to bear because we're so strong in functional expertise here. And so investing in more of the Veracity-type platform is something that we're looking at and looking globally. We did CloudGo, which is now part of the Veracity brand in late calendar '23 and we've been looking to add to that platform as well and valuations are getting more reasonable. So our pipeline of companies that we're looking at has grown. We're also, though, in a very targeted way at capability to add to what we might have. So think about the procurement supply chain space that seems to be gaining some momentum in terms of project retention and budget in our client base, and we'd like to grow our capabilities there.\nMarc Riddick: Okay. Great. And then the last thing, I know you had made commentary around the fits and starts around technology activity. And I was wondering, do you get any sense that some of that is maybe tied to some of the regulatory pressures, whether they be home or abroad or whether or not the customers are more sort of tied to the interest rate discussion that you mentioned earlier.\nKate Duchene: Yes. I think it's tied to interest rate and I think headcount decisions that those firms are making. I don't know that I would say it's so tied to regulatory. I don't feel qualified Marc, to answer that question fully. But I do think that at our largest account, for example, that is a technology company, we had been worried about some roles that we knew were coming, and those folks have all been extended, and we see now growing opportunity in that account again. So I think it's a matter of those firms tended to over hire more coming out of the pandemic. And now that they're rightsizing or justifying more of that headcount, it's really a matter of timing again more than, I think, opportunity.\nOperator: And as I see no further questions in the queue. I will turn it back to Kate for final comments.\nKate Duchene: Thank you, operator. Well, thank you, everyone, for attending the call. We'll look forward to adding Bhadresh to our earnings call following the end of our fiscal year and talking to you all again then. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And with that, I conclude the conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to remind everyone that management will be commenting on results for the second quarter ended November 25, 2023. They will also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. An explanation and reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the press release issued today. Today's press release can be viewed in the Investor Relations section of RGP's website and filed today with the SEC. Also during this call, management may make forward-looking statements regarding plans, initiatives and strategies and the anticipated financial performance of the company. Such statements are predictions, and actual events or results may differ materially. Please see Risk Factors section in RGP's report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 27, 2023, for a discussion of risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause the company's business results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from what is expressed or implied by forward-looking statements made during this call. I'll now turn the call over to RGP's CEO, Kate Duchene.\nKate Duchene: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and Happy New Year. Thank you all for joining us today. In Q2, we delivered solid performance across the enterprise despite a macro environment that continues to be sluggish and uncertain. This quarter can be characterized by green shoots and continued tenacity. Again, we have shown well with respect to engagement extensions and client retention, and our pipeline finished the quarter strong. As we shared last quarter, new project initiation has been slower to materialize and opportunities have pushed to the new calendar year. On revenue, we performed in the stronger half of our guidance range while also continuing to deliver strong cash flow this fiscal year. On SG&A and therefore, adjusted EBITDA, we've well exceeded our expectations as we continue to remain disciplined on cost in this environment. Our balance sheet remains pristine. During Q2, Veracity delivered sequential revenue growth, earning new business from the sustained appetite for digital transformation services and capabilities. We also expanded Veracity's digital presence across the Asia-Pac region through the acquisition of CloudGo, a digital transformation firm and elite ServiceNow partner. We're excited about this acquisition, the exceptional talent this adds to our company and we are already beginning to see synergies between Veracity and CloudGo. The Northern California market, which I had mentioned last quarter, also grew sequentially. And again showing positive movement in the tech sector after more than a year of decline. Regional performance in rest of North America reflected the overall choppy operating environment with clients remaining cautious about new spend until there is greater clarity around interest rates and economic direction. Our Mexico, India, Philippines and Switzerland practices all grew both sequentially and year-over-year as we delivered major projects for large strategic clients. Our pricing initiative in the U.S. is progressing well with a 1.3% increase in bill rate year-over-year. As you'll hear more from Jen in a moment, Europe showed even stronger improvement in pricing. Turning to our operational metrics. We're pleased that the pipeline remains steady through the quarter. And in post quarter December, more extension opportunities in the pipe were converted into close one engagements. In Europe, pipeline grew throughout Q2 as clients engaged in planning discussions for 2024 and pent-up demand around technology transformation and transaction support moved to the forefront. Our Asia-Pacific business, particularly in India and the Philippines continue to show demand strength from our large global clients as they increasingly move more activity to offshore global business service centers. Across all geographies, we're experiencing an uptick in in-person client meetings, which is a positive indicator that clients are engaging and planning for projects to get underway in the new calendar year. Given the areas in which we're seeing consistent and rising demand for professional services, especially digital transformation and cloud technology support we believe we are well positioned to capture market share in 2024 and beyond. As mentioned last quarter, we closed more business related to cloud ERP implementations and optimization. Our pipeline is heavy with opportunity at large and middle market companies to implement and unlock the value of technology and prepare for the implementation of AI with improved data governance and business process standardization. This is exactly the type of work for which RGP shines and can deliver significant value. In our financial services practice, we see rising demand for regulatory remediation, another area of strength for RGP. In health care, we've built an offering to support revenue cycle optimization and claims reimbursement capture and our large provider client base. These opportunities are significant longer term and allow us to get deeper into our A+ client set, which creates cautious optimism that revenue conversion will improve in 2024. During Q2, we completed additional research around client decision-making to help us prepare for what's next. We pulled 1,000-plus leaders from companies with at least $1 billion in revenue to understand what's on the agenda and how our capabilities line up to that need. We found that transformation initiatives are a priority as large organizations are taking on an average of $21 million-plus transformation initiatives this year alone. They also report finding the right skill sets for critical transformation initiatives has become more complicated in an ever more disrupted world. Our research further uncovered that a hybrid workforce strategy that blends internal talent with skilled outsiders enables company to realize competitive advantages by building constant transformation into their core DNA. We refer to this approach as the dynamic workforce model, and we believe it is becoming increasingly more prevalent in business today. Adoption of the dynamic workforce model is being accelerated by transformation overload as our research uncovered that only four in 10 organizations reported they had enough internal talent to staff all their planned initiatives. This research matches with the Manpower Group Employment Outlook Survey reported in December. In that survey, which included an even bigger pool of 40,000 plus employers across 41 countries 75% of respondents reported they're struggling to find the skill sets they need. These skills shortages have wide-ranging impacts on transformation initiatives, ranging from project delays, missed critical goals and more difficulty in achieving operational change. Thus, based on our research, the proportion of outside talent on transformation teams grew to 45% in 2022 and is expected to reach 48% this calendar year. Connecting this research to our business model, we are highly encouraged. The global pandemic proved once and for all that highly skilled talent can collaborate effectively regardless of location or FTE status. C-suite leaders recognize the power of hybrid talent models, and we're seeing more CEOs and CFOs work with HR leaders to adjust talent strategy accordingly. The talent side of the equation is equally embracing these ships. Expert talent is actively choosing to pursue their professional passions in a more independent way. In fact, we've consistently seen our retention rates increase in recent years, now even exceeding those reported by the traditional partnership models. The choice, transparency and control and client engagements, we offer our consultants is a key differentiator. These attributes also serve to create a client experience that is differentiated for the good. Experts who choose their projects feel more empowered, engaged and committed to the client's success. In short, we may have been ahead of our time when we launched the first agile professional services business model 20 plus years ago when we spun off from Deloitte. We are now emboldened to see that today's clients and talent and like are eager to embrace what we have built and perfected. Our focus for the rest of the fiscal year is on the execution of three strategies: First, we will continue our diversification path, expanding consulting services, especially in digital and technology transformation. As we have earned trust with our clients, they have asked us to deliver more strategic advice, including assessments, tools, methodologies and expert talent. We acquired Veracity in 2019 and the start of this strategy, and it has been a successful combination. We most recently added CloudGo to continue the expansion of this strategy globally. We will also continue to scale such targeted consulting services with our Agile Expert business. Second, we will execute our talent strategies to build in-demand pools of talent around the world that can be used to quickly assemble blended delivery teams. These teams can be built to grow our consulting assets faster and we'll improve our win rates by offering clients blended rates and intellectual arbitrage. We've established two centers of excellence this year in Manila and India and have made good progress in growing these talent hubs. Finally, we will continue to push forward our technology transformation initiative to drive even greater operational efficiency and financial performance as one global enterprise. We'll soon launch the first wave of the technology transformation initiative benefiting our global talent function. We're excited that this enhanced software will improve our supply and demand match and enhance our global service to our clients. Jen will share more detail in her remarks. In sum, we're working hard throughout our organization to close every business opportunity with creativity and grip. At the same time, we are retaining the best consultants and improving operations with streamlined process, improved technology and global connectivity. The macro environment is not easy, and far from standing still, we are aggressively optimizing our business to quickly capitalize when conditions improve and to deliver long-term value. We have what business needs today. I'll now turn the call over to Jen.\nJennifer Ryu: Thank you, Kate, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, we achieved $163.1 million of revenue, which was in the upper half of our outlook range provided in October. Our run rate SG&A of $47.4 million was significantly better than the favorable end of our run rate SG&A outlook of $53 million to $55 million. Notwithstanding an uncertain macro environment, we produced solid adjusted EBITDA of $16.1 million or 9.8% adjusted EBITDA margin and have delivered $54 million of free cash flow in the last 12 months. On a same-day constant currency basis, revenue declined by 19% year-over-year as our clients continue to be cautious with the pace of spending in the face of the uncertain macro conditions. Regional performance was reflective of the overall environment. In North America, although certain pockets such as Northern California, Atlanta and Veracity have started to show signs of recovery compared to the beginning of the fiscal year. Many major markets were still affected by the broader economic environment. Our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions performed relatively better with more modest declines of 9% and 10% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis. Markets such as Switzerland, India and the Philippines grew over the prior year quarter as well as sequentially, primarily attributable to project opportunities with our large strategic clients. Operationally, our growth pipeline remained resilient during the quarter, while the velocity of converting new opportunities in the pipeline to actual engagement remains slow, extensions on existing engagements have been healthy. Our solid pipeline suggests that demand, in fact, exists, and it's a matter of when, not if clients will move forward with the execution of their initiatives. These opportunities represent real upside for our business as macro conditions improve. Gross margin in the quarter was 38.9%, reflecting a heavier mix of business in Europe and Asia-Pacific, which typically carry higher pay bill ratio compared to North America. Gross margin in the second quarter also reflected a 90 basis point adverse impact from the spike in health care costs. As a sponsor of a self-insured medical program, we know the number of medical claims can spike from time to time. But in general, we do not believe the trend this quarter is indicative of our health care costs in the foreseeable future. Next, I want to provide an update on our pricing initiative. We're seeing more competitive pricing pressure in the current environment, even against this backdrop, our U.S. average fill rate rose more than 1% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2023, and Europe was up 5% on a constant currency basis. Average bill rates in both regions also improved on a sequential basis from Q1. However, due to the shift in revenue mix to regions with lower bill and pay rates enterprise average bill rate for the quarter was $121 constant currency, down from $128 a year ago, while the average pay rate was $58, down from $60 a year ago. Strategic pricing will be a continued point of emphasis and expansion for the rest of fiscal '24 and beyond. Turning to SG&A. Our run rate SG&A expense for the quarter was $47.4 million, which, as I noted, was significantly better than our outlook range. Variable compensation expense was favorable in the second quarter, aligning with the company's overall financial performance this fiscal year. In addition, the reduction in force we executed at the start of the second quarter contributed approximately $2 million of SG&A savings in the quarter. Restructuring costs associated with this effort was $2.3 million, and we expect $10 million to $12 million of annual savings on a go-forward basis. Effective tax rate this quarter was 43%, largely attributable to an outsized amount of stock option expirations and the capitalization of acquisition costs for tax purposes. Turning to liquidity. We're proud of our ability to continue to generate robust free cash flow despite the macro environment. We distributed $4.7 million of dividends during the quarter and repurchased $5 million worth of common stock at a weighted average price of $14.13 per share, leaving $45 million available in our share repurchase program at quarter end. Pursuant to our stated strategy to expand our digital consulting business, both organically and inorganically, on November 15, we closed the acquisition of CloudGo, a digital transformation firm and an elite ServiceNow partner in the Asia Pacific region. CloudGo's strategic capabilities and regional positioning will play a key role in our growth plan. together with Veracity, this combination will position us better to support our clients globally. Initial cash consideration of $7.7 million was paid during the quarter while remaining consideration of up to $12 million will be determined by CloudGo's performance against a set of target performance metrics over a two-year earn-out period. CloudGo did not contribute significant revenue or EBITDA to our second quarter results. We ended the fiscal quarter with $95.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and zero outstanding debt, with total available financial liquidity of $269 million at the end of the second quarter, our capital allocation will be focused on investing in the most impactful areas of the business, including completing our technology transformation project and continuing to pursue a disciplined M&A strategy to accelerate long-term growth and profitability while continuing to return cash to shareholders through dividends and by opportunistically repurchasing shares. Now let me provide an update on our technology transformation project. We have made tremendous progress and plan to go live with a set of new talent management and contract management systems in North America during the third fiscal quarter, followed by our financial systems go-live planned for later in the calendar year. The new platforms will not only improve the efficiency of our business processes and enhance data visibility for better decision-making, they will also provide a much more favorable experience for our clients, consultants and employees. We incurred $4.4 million of implementation costs in the quarter, of which $2.8 million was capitalized with the remaining $1.6 million included as non-run rate operating expense. I'll now close with our third quarter outlook. While it has certainly been a challenging year, we are encouraged that our weekly revenue has been stable over the last 13 weeks. We expect the pace of revenue conversion from opportunity to close to remain sluggish in the third quarter. After giving effect to the holiday impact in Q3 and including CloudGo, we project revenue to be in the range of $150 million to $155 million. Gross margin in Q3 will be compressed by the typical seasonality during the holidays, including the reset employer payroll taxes at the start of the new calendar year as well as the current global revenue mix with a higher proportion of revenue coming from Europe and Asia Pacific. We estimate gross margin in Q3 to be in the range of 35.5% to 36%. We expect our run rate SG&A expense to be in the range of $51 million to $53 million, which includes CloudGo's SG&A expense and again, reflects the increase in employer payroll taxes at the beginning of the calendar year. Non-run rate and noncash expenses for the third quarter will consist of approximately $2 million of technology transformation costs and $3 million of stock compensation expense. In closing, while we acknowledge the headwinds presented by the prolonged market uncertainty, we also see compelling opportunities ahead as macro conditions start to recover. And we're ready to execute and excited about our business model and long-term outlook. With a durable variable cost model, a pristine balance sheet and ample liquidity, we believe we are well positioned to continue driving long-term value creation for our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we now will open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nStephanie Yee: Hi. Good afternoon. Can I ask for the revenue guide that you gave for the third quarter, what's the implied revenue decline on a constant currency same-day basis?\nJennifer Ryu: Hi, Stephanie. The full year guidance at the top of the range at $155 million is approximately a 17% year-over-year decline on a same-day constant currency basis.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. Great. And then could you help us understand how much of CloudGo was included in the third quarter outlook. And I guess how much on an annual basis, CloudGo is expected to contribute to RGP.\nJennifer Ryu: Yeah. We don’t expect very material immediate impact on our financials from this acquisition. This acquisition is more strategic in nature. We believe that this is going to enhanced our capabilities to serve more clients, and there’s a lot of tremendous amount of synergy to drive future value. So given the size of the acquisition, we’re not disclosing their financials.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. You may proceed.\nAndre Childress: Hey. This is Andre Childress on for Mark. I appreciate you taking the questions and Happy New Year, everyone. So Kate, last quarter, you talked about some green shoots and you talked about those same green shoots as well this quarter with regards to the pipeline. As we get to the end of the year, we ended the year, what are you seeing and hearing from your clients with regards to their expectations for calendar 2024, now that budgets are set?\nKate Duchene: Yeah. I still think that we're seeing more opportunity around digital transformation, as I said in our prepared remarks and continued optimization of cloud ERP opportunity. In fact, today, Andrew -- Andre, I got another request from a client to introduce our services around cloud, ERP, both system selection and implementation services. And there's a lot of wraparound work tied to that, which is around data governance, data cleanup, and process improvement. So that's really where we're still seeing opportunity in our conversations with clients. I do expect in Europe that we might see some uptick around transaction work. especially around decisions to divest business, and we're in conversation with a couple of large clients about how we could support some divestiture strategy.\nAndre Childress: That makes sense. And last quarter, you also laid out expectations in terms of a softer first half for the calendar 2024 year and then the back half stronger as things have progressed over the past three months, how have those expectations changed or how should we think about that?\nKate Duchene: Yeah. I think unfortunately, the close of 2023 -- calendar 2023, has still been sluggish. And it's a crystal ball to say exactly when we'll see the shift occur. I think every client is looking for a little more macro certainty and getting more clarity around economic conditions, especially around interest rate decision-making. So that continues to be a little sluggish. As Jen said in her prepared remarks, we believe it's a matter of when, not if. And so we stay very ready to support these initiatives that our clients are talking to us about. It's just getting them to pull the trigger. And that is all business decision-makers getting a little more comfort and a little more optimism about where the economy is headed.\nAndre Childress: That makes a lot of sense. And then one more for me and then I'll hop back in the queue. Jen, you had some commentary about competitive pricing dynamics. Could you just explain a little bit more about what you're seeing in the market from a pricing perspective, particularly in the U.S.\nJennifer Ryu: Yeah. Sure. I mean the pricing environment has gotten tougher as all of the professional services firms are competing for, in general, a smaller pool of work. When we compete against the big four, they'll often have offshore operations and blended teams, and that averages down the rates and making it tougher to win the work. And that is another reason I think Kate alluded to or talked about in her remarks, is this another reason why we're building our offshore talent pool to stay competitive. And on the other side, when we're competing against staffing firms and they've been racing to the bottom on pricing to win work. So that's where kind of the competitive pressure is coming from. With that said, I think new work is getting more challenging on pricing, but we are still working through to catch up on pricing on our existing MSAs. So far, we haven't really had much pushback from our clients with this regard. So I think we've done a really great job over the last multiple quarters, 6 to 8 quarters to raise our pricing, and I think there's still probably some room to go there.\nAndre Childress: Sorry, just one more follow-up, just given you touched on it. So the center -- the centers of excellence that you're building out internationally. Could you just talk a little bit more about that strategy and how you think about that building out over the next few quarters and integrating that and blending that with your other talent pools as we think about that going forward? Thank you.\nKate Duchene: Yeah. Andre, I'll jump in here. I talked about it a little bit in my prepared remarks. We, for example, just won a big piece of work with Veracity for a financial services client that's continuing their digital transformation. And the reason we won the work is because we are blending, not only rates but we have tapped into a very strong talent pool in India around ServiceNow capability. So it's not just being able to bring labor arbitrage and the cost of labor down. It's also finding the talent that the world needs today. I mean as I mentioned, our own research and the manpower outlook from December still highlights that finding the right skill sets is one of the biggest challenges as every company is continuing to digitize and introduce more and more technology and AI into what we do. And so it's not just about cost anymore, it's about finding the right talent pools that can offer our clients and especially on these consulting engagements, what they need. So, we’re very excited about what we’re building in India, and we’re doing the same thing around finance talent -- finance and accounting talent in the Philippines. I mean we’re all reading the stories about finance and accounting talent exiting the profession in North America for a variety of reasons. And so needing to find these talent pools that exist in other parts of the world, I think will be increasingly important to remain not only competitive financially, but also competitive in terms of winning the work.\nAndre Childress: Great. Thank you so much for that color.\nKate Duchene: You’re welcome. Thank you and Happy New Year.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Marc Riddick with Sidoti. You may proceed.\nMarc Riddick: Hi. Good evening.\nKate Duchene: Hi, Marc.\nJennifer Ryu: Hi, Marc.\nMarc Riddick: So I wanted to start with -- thanks for all the color that you've already provided. I wanted to start with if you could give some thoughts and commentary around sort of where you finished the quarter on the headcount and kind of where you -- comfort level as to maybe what you're seeing maybe for the next couple of quarters, if you're kind of where you want to be or if you feel as though there are other adjustments that need to be made are some areas that you would -- would need to shore up or how should we think about sort of where we ended the quarter versus where you might want to be six months to 12 months from now?\nJennifer Ryu: Marc, are you referring to consultant headcount? I just want to make sure I'm answering...\nMarc Riddick: Yeah.\nJennifer Ryu: Yeah. So our consultant headcount at the end of the quarter it didn't really decrease all that much from the end of last year around the same time. One movement is because we added a pool of consultants or talent from CloudGo from this acquisition. And then the other -- you remember the consultant count that you're looking at, at the end of the period is as of one point in time. So it depends on the talent that we're adding to serve or, for example, our large clients in the Philippines, and we had some kind of onetime add there, a group of independent consultants that's working on that. So overall, if you look at the average, our consulting count, I would say, decreased about anywhere between 300 to 400 , if you look at the average year-over-year. Yeah.\nMarc Riddick: Okay. And then I was wondering if you could -- shifting gears. I mean, I appreciate the commentary on CloudGo. I wondering if you could talk a little bit about -- you did briefly touch on uses of cash. And certainly, there's another $5 million or so on share repurchase during the quarter. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the acquisition pipeline that you're currently seeing, whether that look has changed, evaluation is changed or maybe how you're looking at the current pipeline today versus maybe three months to six months ago?\nKate Duchene: So let me just comment on M&A and pipeline activity, and then I'll hand it to Jen to talk about our uses of cash and capital structure. But, we continue, as I've talked about, we are building more diversification in our business to follow higher-margin and higher-growth businesses. We see consulting as an opportunity for us to also scale with our Agile business. And the Veracity and CloudGo business is exactly a testament to that strategy. And so as we continue to do that, we're going to look at additional consulting assets that can drive that strategy forward. We're also in the process of analyzing and mapping what our consulting capabilities have been in our PCS business and bringing them closer together with what Veracity does in their strategy practice, especially around user experience. So we bring both user experience and functional expertise closer together. Again, that is a part of strengthening the consulting part of our business and then being able to scale those practices with our agile talent. And M&A will play a role in that. Jen, now I'll hand it to you.\nJennifer Ryu: Yeah. So from a capital allocation standpoint, Mark, we have a number of areas in the business as we want to continue to investing to drive long-term growth. So one area, as I said in my remarks, is to complete our digital transformation project. And for the remainder of the year, we’re still looking at about anywhere between $8 million to $10 million of spend in that area. And as I also said, we’re going to – we’re looking at our acquisition pipeline and continue to assess the deals in the pipeline, and that’s an area we could deploy some cash. And just as a reminder, right, on a year-to-date basis, we have spent around $15 million on shareholder return via dividends and share buyback so far. I think given the uncertain environment and just overall lower expected earnings in this fiscal year, we are going to remain prudent on our capital allocation strategy.\nMarc Riddick: Great. And then the last one for me. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned around a couple of client verticals, financial services was mentioned, I believe. You mentioned some of the geographic footprints around some of the Northern Cal and – versus the rest of North America and that kind of thing. So why you could talk a little bit, were there any other sort of areas that might be ventures, things like pharma and health care and anything that kind of stood at any particular either positive or negative as far as recent activity? Thanks.\nKate Duchene: Yeah. I’d say, and this isn’t new, but I’d say, as we’ve talked about before, the health care industry overall is behind in terms of their digital transformation. And so we continue to see opportunity there, as – and there have been some big transactions in our client base that we’re hoping to get work from in the pharma space. So I see that as some green shoots coming up. Financial services is still around regulatory remediation as there are focus on consent orders and cleaning up, I think, both compliance reporting, but also a lot of data issues in financial services. Especially as you connect the front of the house to the back of the house, and there’s still a lot of work to do because in huge financial banking environment, the systems are often very disparate, and there’s still a lot of work ahead for these organizations to address some of the problems. So we’re staying very close to this client set. And our financial services practice, I’ve been very pleased with their performance, and I see that that’s continuing to strengthen a bit as we move through the rest of the fiscal year.\nMarc Riddick: Thank you very much.\nKate Duchene: Thank you, Marc.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Kate Duchene for any closing remarks.\nKate Duchene: Well, again, I want to thank everyone for continuing your interest in RGP. We're working hard, and we'll look forward to talking with you after the end of our third quarter. Thank you again, and Happy New Year.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

I'll now turn the call over to RGP's CEO, Kate Duchene.\nKate Duchene: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for being with us. We delivered solid performance during Q1 despite the continued uncertainty in the macro environment and despite Q1 traditionally being our most seasonally impacted quarter given summer holidays and consultant vacations. On both revenue and SG&A expense, we performed in the stronger half of our guidance range while also continuing to deliver strong free cash flow. During Q1, Countsy delivered solid growth over prior year quarter. The Northern Californian market grew sequentially, showing movement in the tech sector after 12 months of a quiet buying environment. Regional performance in the rest of North America reflected the overall choppy operating environment with clients remaining cautious about new spend while extending current engagements. Our pricing initiative is progressing as planned with over a 2% increase in bill rate in the U.S. quarter-over-quarter and 4% in Europe, constant currency. Turning to our operational metrics. Pipeline remains resilient. Engagement extension showed an uptick from the prior sequential quarter, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of our consultants within the client environment. In recent weeks, we are seeing numerous new opportunities being added to the growth pipeline in certain pockets of North America. In Europe, we're growing the pipeline again as 2024 client budgets are being finalized and pent-up demand around technology transformation and transaction support are moving to the forefront. The Asia Pacific region, particularly in India and the Philippines, continues to show demand strength from our large global clients as they optimize their offshore service centers. In Q2, we're highly focused on revenue capture across all markets. And following the summer holidays, we have seen healthy meeting activity with in-person client connectivity on the rise globally. Based on many discussions with clients, we believe patterns are starting to break for the better. One of our largest clients reports that 10 months of uncertainty is coming to an end. Budget discussions have been renewed with recognition that there's too much pain in the system that needs to be addressed. Business resiliency is critical. Many organizations are now reaching out for support to unlock the value of prior technology implementations. For example, we have clients large and middle market in need of support implementing additional modules of S/4HANA, SAP's modular cloud-based ERP. We're also assisting and optimizing performance of previous S/4HANA implementations with business process redesign, project and change management, all capabilities in RGP's sweet spot. For such work, clients do not want to hire full time, but rather in-source talent to deliver the expertise with flexibility and agility. In addition, we see increasing demand for our expert solution offerings, including expansion of global shared services workflows, IT, audit and compliance as well as operational accounting and finance. In our financial services practice, we see increasing needs in regulatory remediation. With these client conversations as the foundation, we're cautiously optimistic that the buying environment will approve late this calendar year and into 2024. In the near term, we will continue to expand our capabilities and engagement models, Agile consulting and managed services. This strategy will improve our ability to weather market cycles and dynamics to react more quickly to varying pockets of need. For example, tax and treasury services are nondiscretionary even in a challenged macro cycle, while PMO services related to a client's market expansion are green lit with improving market cycles. In addition to our core Agile Expert business, we're also extending our total addressable market on both ends of the human capital and consulting continuum. HUGO is an engagement channel for an adjacent segment of the F&A market requiring more role-based support and lesser scope than team delivery. Digital transformation consulting expands the right side of the continuum with strategy to execution, UX to digital product development. Looking further ahead, our business model is well aligned to the future of work. We support clients in more agile and flexible ways in the areas of finance transformation, operational excellence and digital transformation. We have the exceptional talent that clients want and need to execute critical project initiatives. We also know how to attract and retain that talent who is migrating toward our model. As the Wall Street Journal reported two weeks ago, the labor crisis is here to stay. Retirement trends, lower birth rates and restrictive immigration policies around skilled talent suggests no improvement anytime soon. Thus, demand for agile talent, experts who can work on project teams and plug critical skill set gaps will increase opportunity for RGP over the long term. Increasingly, talent itself is looking to lend its expertise to platforms like RGP who offer a different compelling career experience. RGP's attractive proposition to this talent is especially apparent in the finance and accounting field, where the profession faces an existential crisis. There are two few CPAs for market demand with many of them exiting the profession because they do not want the partnership model. RGP provides a career that values their skill set in a more dynamic model built on choice, flexibility and control. Especially given current market conditions, RGP is proud of the strong cash flow that so well reflects the underlying strength of our business model. As a result, we have a clean balance sheet and no debt. We have consistently paid a quarterly dividend for over 10 years with six annual increases during that period. And as much as ever, we're staying disciplined on cost structure to ensure we continue to deliver value to shareholders. Before I hand it over to Jenn, I want to leave you with my thoughts on how the new fiscal year will likely progress. We expect the current year's annual revenue trends to reflect the opposite of fiscal '23. Meaning last year, the first and second quarters were the strongest, reflecting the continued post-pandemic bounce back. This year, we believe the second half of the fiscal year will be stronger, given the nature of our solid pipeline and as the economy and buyer sentiment improve. As noted in the CFO's survey conducted by Duke University's Fuqua School of Business and the Federal Reserve Banks of Richmond and Atlanta, which was released last week. CFO optimism around revenue, hiring outlook, and the economy in general has increased for 2024 which adds to our cautious optimism for this current fiscal year. In closing, I'm pleased to share that Harvard Business Review published an article last week, co-authored by me and business strategist, Antonio Nieto Rodriguez, titled creating a cohesive team for corporate transformation projects. This piece, based on our recent research reinforces the benefits of building a blended team to deliver transformation work the highest impact and most successful outcomes. Please visit our website for a link to the article and the insights shared. I'll now turn the call over to Jenn.\nJenn Ryu: Thank you, Kate, and good afternoon, everyone. This quarter, our revenue of $170.2 million and gross margin of 39.4% were both within our outlook range provided in July. While run rate SG&A of $55.5 million was better than the favorable end of our run rate SG&A outlook. Notwithstanding an uncertain macro environment, we produced solid adjusted EBITDA of $11.5 million, with a 6.8% margin, and we continue to generate strong free cash flow. On a same-day constant currency basis, revenue declined by 17% year-over-year as our clients continue to work through challenges in their own business and hold back the pace of investments. Regional performance was reflective of the overall environment. North America, specifically in the U.S. market was the most impacted by clients' hesitancy to spend as they manage their earnings through the elevated inflationary and interest rate environment resulting in a year-over-year decline of 19% in revenue. Our international business showed resiliency with a modest decline of 4% year-over-year on a same-day constant currency basis. While many international markets experienced similar macro and client trends as the U.S., albeit less severe, they were avoid by growing markets such as Switzerland, India and the Philippines. Operationally, as Kate mentioned earlier, our growth pipeline remains resilient, illustrating healthy appetite from our clients to execute operational improvements and our strong client retention. However, conversion into engagement remains slower than normal in Q1, driven by more cautious budget planning on the part of our clients. While extensions on existing engagements have been healthy, new opportunities in the pipeline require more persistence and time to close. These opportunities represent real upside for our business as macro conditions improve. Gross margin in the quarter was 39.4%, reflecting a heavier mix of business in Europe and Asia Pac, which typically carry higher pay bill ratio compared to North America. Gross margin in the first quarter was also impacted by less favorable leverage of indirect cost of services on lower top line revenue. Next, I will provide an update on our pricing initiative through which we've made good progress raising bill rates across the majority of our regions. Our U.S. average bill rate rose 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and Europe was up 4% on a constant currency basis. However, due to the shift in revenue mix to regions with lower bill and pay rate, enterprise average bill rate for the quarter was $124 constant currency, down from $128 a year ago. While average pay rate declined to $59 from $61 a year ago. Strategic pricing will be a continued point of emphasis and expansion for the rest of fiscal '24 and beyond. Turning to SG&A. While we always approach cost management discipline, we have been even more judicious given the current environment. Our run rate SG&A expense for the quarter was $55.5 million, more favorable than our outlook range. We continue to identify opportunities to streamline our cost structure, including aligning resource levels to the demand environment, reducing travel, occupancy costs and other discretionary spend. Earlier this week, we commenced a reduction of our U.S. management and administrative workforce intended to reduce costs and streamline operations. We expect approximately $10 million to $12 million of reduction in our annual SG&A run rate. Turning to liquidity. We are proud of our ability to continue to generate robust free cash flow despite the macro environment, which came in at $81 million or 130% of EBITDA over the last 12-month period. We ended the fiscal quarter with $112.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and zero outstanding debt. We distributed $4.7 million of dividends during the quarter, with total available financial liquidity of $287 million, we plan to invest in the most critical areas in the business to drive long-term growth and profitability. While continuing to return cash to shareholders through dividends and by opportunistically buying back stock through our share repurchase program, which has $50 million available at the end of the quarter. We continue to push forward our multiyear technology transformation project. We incurred $5 million of costs in the quarter, of which $3.1 million was capitalized with the remaining $1.9 million included as non-run rate operating expense. Post go-live, we anticipate the new technology platform will drive long-term value by improving our operating efficiency, enabling scale and enhancing even further the stickiness of our talent platform. I'll now close with our second quarter outlook. The early second quarter revenue trend has been stable compared to the end of the first quarter. We anticipate timing challenges related to deal closes and project starts to continue through the second quarter. With early Q2 daily revenue trending slightly below the first quarter daily run rate and after giving effect to less business days in Q2, we project revenue to be in the range of $160 million to $165 million. We anticipate Q2 gross margin to be similar to Q1, currently estimated to be in the range of 39.2% to 39.7%, reflecting the global revenue mix and the lower top line projection. We expect our run rate SG&A to improve to a range of $53 million to $55 million. Non-run rate and noncash expenses for the second quarter will consist of $1.5 million to $2.5 million of technology transformation costs $2 to $2.5 million of restructuring costs and $1 million to $2 million of stock compensation expense. Fully capitalized costs related to the technology implementation in the second quarter is estimated to be around $3 million. In closing, I want to reiterate what Kate stated earlier. As we navigate through a changing economic environment, during the first half of this fiscal year, quarterly comparisons over the prior year may not be indicative of our underlying annual performance. Based on the opportunities we're seeing in the pipeline, we believe the pace of revenue conversion will improve as the macro conditions start to recover, and we're ready to execute and excited about our business model and longer-term outlook. With a durable variable cost model, a pricing balance sheet and ample liquidity, we believe we are well positioned to continue driving long-term value for our shareholders. This concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Steinerman with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nAndrew Steinerman: Hi. I have two questions. The second one could probably be harder than the first, but I'll give it a try. On HUGO, could you give us any sense of scale and success like how many active users you have in your database or anything quantitatively. The second one is talk about the current uncertain macro and clients hesitancy to spend. But economists tell us that we're not in a recession currently. Do you feel like that label might be misappropriated. Maybe your belief is we are in a mild recession that we're going to recover from. And obviously, that you're also suggesting that the recovery of the macro will help your second half. Is that really coming from your economist view your main views that economists of that or your clients?\nKate Duchene: Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Let me take both of those, and then Jenn could add some color. So on HUGO, this year is about our commercialization efforts in three markets. And we're very pleased with the talent inflow into the platform, and we've exceeded our goals there, and we are working to increase client registration and offerings. We've presented HUGO as an option for some larger enterprise clients, too. So we are optimistic about the reception we have received. We're not prepared at this stage given how small HUGO is to give you more specifics than that, but we are on track. With respect to the broader question, and that is a hard one. I think I read Jamie Dimon's interview yesterday in terms of his comments. I don't think we're in a recession. I think that his comments about just a muted economic environment stagflation is probably more likely right now. And that means that we're all going to have to work harder and pursue every opportunity. I'll tell you, we are very focused on sales motion right now and ensuring that our people spend time with clients talking about the initiatives they have and where our capabilities measure up. Our comments about the second half of the year are not so much based on what the economists are saying because that has been a I would say, a bumpy road, but more on the conversations that we're having with clients and what we're hearing them tell us about their budgeting process and what they expect in 2024.\nAndrew Steinerman: Perfect. Thank you.\nKate Duchene: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for the question. Our next question comes from Andre Childress with Baird. You may proceed. Andre, your line is now open. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Marc Riddick with Sidoti. You may proceed.\nMarc Riddick: Hi Good evening. I wanted to ask maybe sort of a couple of questions that are more along the lines of sort of controlling the controllables, I guess. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you finish with consultant count at the end of the quarter. Maybe you could sort of talk a little bit about some of the thoughts as to sort of your own needs going forward, whether we are looking to maintain that level, pay at that level and kind of how we feel about that? And then also maybe if you could give a bit of an update. I know that there had been some mentions to sort of relooking at the organizational structure following the announcement of resignation. Maybe you can talk a little bit about maybe where you are with that or maybe some hiring trends or anything like that, that we should be aware of? Thank you.\nJenn Ryu: Mark, this is Jenn. I can take the first question and maybe Kate can comment on the second one. Our consultant count at the end of the quarter did decrease, as you can imagine, due to the demand environment. We do have - for our bench consultants, we are doing everything we can to deploy them and to keep them engaged. We're putting in a number of measures to share available consultants with our entire sales team and talent team globally and also proactively approach clients to see if there's a need there. I think our consultant count, as you know, fluctuates based on our demand environment, and that's also part of our overall variable cost model. That is unique to our business.\nKate Duchene: Yes. So I'll jump in. I think, Marc, correct me because you got a little soft. So I hope I heard all of your question if I didn't just please ask it again. I think you asked about organizational structure and how we're continuing to build the business going forward. As we've talked about, we really have three components kind of our business currently. We have our agile model, which is the core of RGP, meaning we provide expert talent to work on project initiatives in our client environments or to fill role or skill set gaps at a professional level in our client base. We also have certain assets in our portfolio that are consulting soup to nuts veracity is the perfect example. We want to do more this year in setting up CFO advisory at the true consulting unit. And this is all about making us easier to buy and easier to sell in our client base. And then the third component is Countsy, which is our managed services business in an outsourced solution for finance and HR services more in the start-up environment. And we're also looking at how we can provide services to divested assets of businesses. That don't want to stand up their own full financial function, especially in light of today's lack of accounting and finance talent. So those are kind of the three segments we see continuing to pursue that as we grow. And again, it's about making us easier to buy and easier to sell in our client base.\nMarc Riddick: Okay. Then I was just sort of wanted to also follow up then on the - I think there were some of the commentary in the press release a couple of months ago that you're considering adding a couple of people to replace TIM or maybe some things might be, I just wasn't sure if there's an update available there as to as to adding to the leadership bench there?\nKate Duchene: Yes. So I think that we will, through the balance of this fiscal year, reposition what we need in senior leadership positions. I think that the future of the COO role will look different than it has in the past for good reason as we build real leadership of the segments that we're talking about. And we continue to improve what role and function that COO position can deliver across the enterprise. One of our initiatives this year too, Jenn talked about pricing, that's important, but also to do a better job of cross-selling across our assets into this client base. And as we determine what we need in that regard, we'll be sharing more about the roles that we'll put in place. And I don't necessarily think, Marc, these are going to be new roles. We have some really talented people that are ready to step up. And so it may be reproposing or repositioning some of the existing talent we have.\nMarc Riddick: Excellent. Thank you.\nKate Duchene: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Andre Childress with Baird. You may proceed. Andre, you maybe on mute, your line is now open. And I'd now like to turn it back to Kate Duchene for any closing remarks.\nKate Duchene: Yes. Thank you, operator. And Andre, if you have a question, please feel free to give us a call off-line. But I want to thank everyone for attending this call. I can assure you we are focused and motivated to serve clients with excellence and value as we all learn to work differently in today's environment. We look forward to reporting again after Q2, and we'll talk with you in January. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
