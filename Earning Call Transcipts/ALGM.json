It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Allegro’s President and CEO, Vineet Nargolwala. Vineet?\nVineet Nargolwala: Thank you, Galen, and good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal year 2024 conference call. I’m pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter against a weaker backdrop in fiscal Q3, consistent with expectations and our guidance. While we expect continued inventory digestion across markets in the short term, our design win momentum continues at record levels and reinforces our confidence in our ability to grow above market over the mid- to long term, consistent with our target financial model. Furthermore, we are actively managing the business to optimize profitability and cash flow throughout the cycle. In Q3, we delivered sales of $255 million, up 2% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength in automotive. Sales in our strategic growth areas, including e-mobility and Industrial, which includes clean energy and automation, we’re up approximately 20% year-over-year to $150 million or 59% of total sales. Innovation with purpose is our core value. During the quarter, we announced the launch of the second product of our high-voltage isolated gate driver portfolio. Allegro’s newest Power-Thru solution has crucial safety features designed to protect against high operating temperatures in electric powertrain systems. It also provides high performance in noisy environments present in microinverters in solar applications, power supplies and data center applications and onboard chargers for electric vehicles. Recall that a high-voltage isolated gate driver technology came to us through our acquisition of Heyday just over a year ago. The progress we are making with our Power-Thru product family demonstrates our ability to effectively integrate acquired technology and bring it to market quickly. We’re applying the same approach and intensity to our recent acquisition of Crocus which further strengthens our magnetic-sensing IC portfolio and extends our leadership in this very important product category. I’m pleased to report that the integration of the Crocus team and its TMR technology is progressing really well. The acquired business is fully transitioned into our systems and processes. Product sales are underway with sampling activity accelerating in e-mobility and industrial markets. Both the Allegro and Crocus TMR offerings are now combined under a common brand ExtremeSense, which now represents the world’s leading and most comprehensive portfolio, offering the highest accuracy, the lowest power consumption and the highest sensitivity for the world’s most demanding applications. Feedback across the customer base has been very encouraging, and the strong majority of our customer discussions recently at CES featured TMR. Moving on to the broader macro environment. Industry estimates indicate that calendar year 2024 automotive demand will be stable with continued growth in xEVs, which includes battery electric vehicles and full hybrids. While xEV adoption varies greatly by geography, the growing number of xEV launches proves that the momentum is strong and increasing. Recall that Allegro is well represented in all automotive segments with our solutions supporting all powertrains. Today, ADAS represents the majority of e-mobility sales and xEV the fastest-growing component. And while e-mobility is a key strategic focus, nearly half of our automotive sales are in other automotive applications such as ICE powertrain and safety, comfort and convenience, which is agnostic of the choice of powertrain. Additionally, OEs use of both hybrid and full electric platforms to meet fuel economy and emissions regulations positions us well. Allegro’s content in full hybrid vehicles is similar to that in BEVs with both significantly higher than that in ICE. And so Allegro wins, no matter which platforms OEMs invest in. While automotive demand remains stable, and we see continued strong momentum in e-mobility, we are seeing certain inventory dynamics where tiers and contract manufacturers are paring back inventory from the 8 to 10 weeks during the supply chain crisis to pre-pandemic levels of 4 to 6 weeks as carrying costs pick up a factor and OEMs and support premiums for inventory. Despite these dynamics, we expect our automotive business to deliver above-market growth for fiscal year ‘24, consistent with our target financial model. Our fourth quarter sales outlook comprehends macroeconomic conditions including ongoing inventory digestion in industrial and consumer markets as well as pockets of inventory rebalancing in automotive. Looking to the future. We continue to see strong design win activity with 80% of our Q3 design wins in our strategic growth areas and more than 50% in the area of e-mobility. Key highlights from our third quarter design wins include the following: in automotive, we were awarded multiple programs by a leading Japanese OEM for an xEV platform. This was for current sensors on onboard chargers and AC inverters and for our magnetic position sensors for electronic power steering systems; in China, we were awarded multi-solution design wins for xEV powertrains and EPS systems with a leading automotive OEM using our current sensor and power technology; in the industrial end market, we won several designs using our current and isolation sensor technology for clean energy applications, including solar and EV charging; in data center applications, we recorded several design wins with our motor drivers with a major OEM for cooling, high-performance AI servers using port traditional fabs as well as liquid cooling. We remain focused on serving our customers and extending our market-leading positions. We’re investing for the future with a focus on maximizing growth in these strategic focus areas while positioning the business to scale and grow profitably. This focus is being rewarded by our customers with more business and our record design wins indicate that we are winning in the market. In fact, for fiscal year 2024, we are on track to close over $1 billion in design wins with the majority turning to revenue over the next 3 years. This is proof that our strategy is working, underpinning our confidence in our ability to deliver above-market performance over the long term. I want to thank our teams globally for serving our customers and the continued execution of our strategy. I’ll now turn the call over to Derek to review the Q3 financial results and provide guidance for our fourth quarter. Derek?\nDerek D’Antilio: Thank you, Vineet. Good morning, everyone. Starting with a summary of our Q3 financial results. Sales were $255 million, gross margin was 54.6% and operating income was 27.2%, and adjusted EBITDA was 34% of sales. As a result, earnings were $0.32 per share, 10% above the midpoint of our guidance range and exceeding the high end. Total Q3 sales increased by 2% compared to Q3 of fiscal ‘23, and sales to our automotive customers were $195 million, an increase of 18% year-over-year and representing 76% of Q3 sales. E-mobility sales increased by 6% sequentially and 45% year-over-year representing 54% of third quarter auto sales, up from 44% a year ago. Industrial sales were $46 million, declining 25% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Other sales, which includes consumer applications were $14 million, down 17% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. Sales through our distribution channel, which comprise the majority of the industrial and other sales were down 10% sequentially as expected. We continue to monitor our channel point-of-sale sell-through closely to manage inventories to appropriate levels. From a product perspective, magnetic sensor sales were $154 million, declining 13% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Sales of our Power Products were $101 million, increasing 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Sales by geography were again well balanced with 30% of sales in China, 24% in the rest of Asia, 17% in Japan, 15% in Europe and 14% in the Americas. Now turning to Q3 profitability. Gross margin was 54.6% and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin has remained healthy through this sales decline as a result of our fabulous and our flexible manufacturing model. Operating expenses were $70 million or 27% of sales, down from 28% of sales a year ago and included 2 months of Crocus. Third quarter R&D expenses were 15% of sales and SG&A was 12% of sales. Operating margin was 27.2% of sales compared to 31.3% in Q2 and 30% a year ago. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 10%, slightly better than expected due to the geographical mix of income. We are now projecting our full year non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12%. The third quarter diluted share count was 194.6 million shares and net income was $62 million or $0.32 per share. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended Q3 with cash of $224 million. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $77 million and free cash flow was $42 million, an increase of $27 million or more than 170% sequentially. From a working capital perspective, DSO was 41 days compared to 40 days in Q2 and inventory declined by $8 million and days in inventory were 124 days compared to 136 days in Q2. Capital expenditures in the third quarter were $34 million as we are completing a capacity expansion of our operations in the Philippines. Also in the third quarter, we opened a new Philippines tech and shared services center and made investments in R&D labs in strategic locations. I’d like to take a few moments now to speak to the actions we are taking to optimize our financial performance with a focus on free cash flow. First, we continue to prioritize investments in our strategic growth areas, specifically in R&D and sales. However, in response to the recent slowdown in sales, we have aligned factory costs with production levels and taken actions, which have contributed to an $8 million or 11% sequential decline in organic operating expenses. We now expect organic operating expenses to decline by approximately 9% in the second half of fiscal ‘24 compared to the first half. To further optimize cash flow, we are managing our material purchases, including wafers to align to current production levels. We are also nearing the end of our most recent capacity expansion in the Philippines. And as a result, we expect CapEx to decline by approximately $25 million or 30% in the second half of fiscal ‘24, compared to the first half of the year. Now I’ll provide a few additional updates on the Crocus acquisition. As Vineet mentioned, integration is progressing well and planned synergies are on schedule. In Q3, we completed the full systems integration and a number of tax and legal steps to allow us to utilize significant pre-acquisition tax net operating losses and enable us to begin to realize tax and operating benefits. Finally, I’ll turn to our Q4 and full year 2024 outlook. We expect fourth quarter sales to be in the range of $230 million to $240 million, which reflects continued inventory digestion. At the midpoint of our Q4 guidance, we are projecting sales growth of 7% for fiscal ‘24, with auto sales expected to grow in the high teens in fiscal ‘24. Based on our current view and historical cycles, we estimate continued inventory digestion for a couple of quarters, and we expect Q1 of fiscal ‘25 for the June quarter to be our trough quarter. We expect Q4 gross margin to be between 53% and 54%, reflecting the projected product and channel mix. We expect operating expenses to be approximately 31% of sales, and Q4 operating expenses include a full quarter of Crocus and the annual payroll tax reset. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12%, and our diluted share count to be approximately 195.8 million shares. As a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.19 and $0.23 per share. Now I’ll turn the call back to Jalene for the Q&A session. Jalene?\nJalene Hoover: Thank you, Derek. This concludes management’s prepared remarks. Before we open the call for your questions, I’d like to share our fourth fiscal quarter conference line up with you. We are attending Wolfe’s Inaugural Semiconductor Conference on February 15 at the Jay Autograph Collection in San Francisco, California; Susquehanna’s 13th Annual Technology Conference on March 1 with attendance virtual and Morgan Stanley’s TMT Conference on March 4 at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, California. We will now open the call for your questions. Kevin, please review the Q&A instructions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We’ll pause for a moment while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research.\nChris Caso: I guess just a first question on the guidance for the March quarter and some of the commentary you had on the June quarter as well. Could you characterize that between the auto and the industrial segment? Obviously, industrials already pulled back quite a bit here from the peak. In terms of the sequential decline that you expect for March, and it seems like you’re also implying a sequential decline in June. How would that be broken out between the 2 segments?\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes, Chris, this is Derek. So when I look at -- we don’t really guide by market, right? But when I think about Q4, we’re seeing that be across all end markets, and it’s really the inventory digestion continuing, particularly in industrial. Other is starting to come to a trough. And then in auto, as Vineet mentioned, there’s some dynamics of inventory kind of clearing out in the auto market. We expect that to continue into Q4 and Q1.\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes, Chris, this is Vineet. Thanks for the question. So I think the -- we have been pretty transparent and have communicated the inventory digestion in the industrial and other markets. I think the order dynamic is more recent, and it’s really a rebalancing. As I’ve engaged with CEOs of base OEMs and the tiers, it’s clear that the automotive OEM demand continues to be pretty stable. And indeed, the xEV production estimates continue to be very robust. Really, the pressure is coming from the contract manufacturer in the tier side where there’s a rebalancing of inventory back into the pre-pandemic levels. And that’s a little bit of what we’re seeing here in fiscal Q4. And as Derek alluded to, we’ll see some of the same time is continue to the next quarter.\nChris Caso: As a follow-on to that, Vineet, you made also a comment that you expect to kind of outgrow the market within auto. When you say that, are you define the market as sort of auto units, which is still expected to grow this year or core of the auto semiconductor peers? Take into account that the end market still grows but inventory comes down. Said more simply, do you expect that in calendar ‘24, you’ll be able to grow the auto market on a year-on-year -- your auto revenue on a year-on-year basis?\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes, Chris. So a couple of clarifications there, right? So any time we talk about outgrowing the market, it is from an auto perspective, it’s based on auto production. So that’s the basis. And if you recall, when we talked at our Analyst Day, we laid out a model which talked about 7% to 10% growth above auto production. That’s how we characterize the market. Our comment which I think Derek made in the prepared remarks was with respect to full year fiscal ‘24, including our Q4 guidance, where we expect for the full year fiscal ‘24 top line to be about 7% year-on-year growth. When within that, automotive to be exceptionally strong high teens. And so that’s consistent with our model. And as a reminder, we are long cycle. The quarter-to-quarter, we’ll see some perturbations. But really, what we’re focused on is full year growth and really pleased with how the team has executed that strategy to deliver that kind of growth considering the backdrop.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.\nGary Mobley: Derek, you’re guiding the fourth quarter gross margin down about 110 basis points sequentially. Can you bridge that delta for us between lower distribution mix, pricing and contribution Crocus and the other factors that are affecting that? And then as it relates to the start to the fiscal year ‘25, I would assume that with June quarter revenue trending down again sequentially, should we expect another leg down in the gross margin as well?\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes, Gary. So our Q3 gross margin came in about 60 basis points better than sort of the guidance. Some of that was mix. We did see some pricing dynamics, particularly in the channel in Q3, which is the first place you usually see the pricing pressure because that’s market-based. We saw that start in Q3. Going into Q4, we’re starting -- we’re having the negotiations and their calendar year contracts with our customers. So there will be some pricing going into Q4 before we get the benefit from our vendor pricing negotiations for about a quarter or so. So that’s a part of the Q4 guide down by, call it, 100 basis points off of Q3. Some of that is also the distribution mix, which we expect to be again down in Q4 as we continue to manage channel inventories. And then the last piece, you’re right, Crocus is an element to that with their fixed cost as we start to see synergies come in the second half of calendar ‘24. Going into Q1, I’d expect gross margins to remain in that 53% to 54% range, Gary, for the short term here. The good news is when we model our gross margins now that we have a really variable cost structure and a flexible manufacturing model, they hold up significantly better than they would have when we had multiple facilities and multiple fabs. So I expect gross margins to hang in that 53% to 54% range in the short term. And of course, over time, as the distribution normalize, we’ll come back up to and then heading towards our model of 58%. And the last thing I’ll mention is, in Q3, organically, our gross margin was over 55% for Allegro.\nGary Mobley: Vineet, I want to ask more of a longer-term focused question. China is a very important market in the overall automotive market for sure. And so my question to you is, what sort of investments are you making there in terms of forging relationships with localized foundry partners, back-end partners and whatnot? How are you showing China domestic customers that you’re willing to invest in the market in an effort to win their trust to maintain their business?\nVineet Nargolwala: Gary, thanks for the question. And you’re right, China is incredibly important to us. And actually, in the most recent quarter, we saw some really nice growth in China despite all sort of the macro noise that you hear, which just reinforces the belief we have to be in China to win with the Chinese customers, and we’re really pleased with the progress we’re making. To the question you asked, we are investing in localizing a part of our supply chain in China. We have inked an agreement with local OSAT, and we expect in the next 12 to 18 months, we’ll start shipping from our China partners locally. And we are also working with a foundry partner in China which will take a little bit longer to qualify wafers, but it’s part of the plan. And so it’s important for us to demonstrate to our Chinese partners and customers that we are indeed investing in the region. Not just for supply chain resilience from their perspective, also to take advantage of economies of scale locally. And so we’re really excited about the progress we’re making, and we’ll continue to update everybody as we make progress.\nOperator: Next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.\nNick Doyle: This is Nick Doyle on for Quinn. So sentiment around EV as low, at least in the U.S., I think the China data points continue to be strong. And I understand Allegro is a bit agnostic to EV versus ICE but wanted to get your sense on customer sentiment. What are you seeing from U.S. EV customers? Is there better design activity than the recent data point suggests from guys like Tesla and GM?\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes, Nick, thanks for the question. And so let’s take a step back. I think as you look at emissions and fuel economy regulations globally, the end outcome is pretty clear that all OEMs will have to move towards a pretty high mix of battery electric vehicles or some sort of emissions-free vehicle in order to comply with those regulations. The path there is going to be different for each OEM. Some OEMs are investing completely and totally in battery electric vehicles. Others are taking more of a mixed approach with plug-in hybrids and equal part of their focus and strategy. And as you point out, the positive for Allegro is that we are really agnostic to whether the platform is plug-in hybrid or it’s full battery electric. Our content is very similar. And it’s about 1.5 to 1.7x that of a pure ICE vehicle. So we’re really pleased regardless of the direction any OEM takes, and we’re ready to support the OEMs and the tiers with a really broad portfolio of magnetic sensing and very targeted power applications. From a design activity standpoint, I would tell you that every OEM is investing significant amounts of capital in R&D into electrifying their fleet. And it’s various degrees of electrification, as I’ve just pointed out. I can’t comment on any specific OEM. But suffice to say that every OEM is working on a bunch of new models, which will hit the market over the next 2 to 3 years. And so I think from a consumer standpoint, it’s going to be a really exciting time because there will be a ton of choice when it comes to battery electric vehicles or plug-in hybrid vehicles at all price points and from every brand.\nNick Doyle: Great. And maybe you could talk about the design win activity in data center, specifically the AI liquid cooling. I think your exposure there was something new. We kind of heard at the start of the year. What is it about your power solutions that enable you to win these AI liquid cooling sockets?\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes. Nick, thanks for the question. So this has been a pivot from our partners that we work with that serve the data center infrastructure market as AI data centers or AI chips are proliferating through data centers. The cooling approach or the cooling solution is much different than a traditional data center. AI chips are larger and they run hotter. And so the power consumption and the heat dissipation is orders of magnitude higher than a regular data center chip. And so just air cooling is not enough. And that’s why a lot of our partners are innovating and coming up with really clever liquid cooling solutions. And so when we look at the data center market, our design win activity through this inventory digestion period, has actually stayed pretty strong. And now we’re starting to see the first design wins on liquid cooling solutions where essentially our motor drivers are used not just now for fans but also for the pumps that are used to pump the liquid and to make sure that the level and the pressure of the liquid is staying consistent. So really excited about what the potential is here. And I think we’re just getting started.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.\nVijay Rakesh: Just Vineet and Derek. Just a quick question here. If you look at your outlook, I think it looks like the key is the inventory destocking, especially on the margin line. As you look at June quarter, do you think [Indiscernible] and OEM inventories get back to normal in that 4- to 6-week range that you talked about?\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes, Vijay, thank you for the question. It usually takes a couple of quarters, right? Historically, it’s taking, generally speaking, about 3 quarters. So I’ll call the December quarter, the first quarter, March is the second quarter and June is the third quarter. So if history is any guidance, that would be the case that Q1 will get back to normal. So we expect right now that Q1 will be our trough quarter. And we’re going to see that across end markets. We’re starting to see it -- it’s really kind of a rolling cycle, as you know. So within our consumer business, that’s getting to a trough right now, and that could come sooner, right? And that could start to rebound a little bit sooner. And then I’d expect industrial to rebound. In auto, the dynamic, as Vineet mentioned, is relatively new with the auto inventory rebalancing at the tiers and the subcontractors, which will be, I think, last to kind of complete that rebalancing.\nVijay Rakesh: Got it. And then on the auto side, obviously, a big chunk of your sales there is 75% or something. But the outlook for fiscal ‘24, up 15% to 18% versus where LVP is. Can you talk to what’s driving that? That’s it.\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes. So let me give you the numbers. For our fiscal ‘24, which ends in March, we expect our auto sales to be up high teens and overall sales to be up 7%. And for that same period, LVP is about 8%. So we’re about double that, a little bit more than double that, consistent with our model, so 7% to 10% outgrowth on top of that. And really what’s driving that has been the continued design wins and the growth within EV and xEV and the e-mobility side. So the e-mobility side of our business go from 44% of auto a year ago to 54% of auto the same quarter this year.\nVijay Rakesh: And then would you expect to continue that into fiscal ‘25 that same above LVP 10% above LVP growth?\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes. We’re not guiding for ‘25 right now, and we’re going to continue to watch the market closely for ‘25, Vijay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Blake Friedman with Bank of America.\nBlake Friedman: Just kind of wanted to approach the comments on June from a different perspective. So when I look at your auto and industrial peers on a fee to top basis, most are down anywhere from 20% to 35%. And -- and when I look at your March quarter guide, it implies declines on a peak-to-trough basis, closer to mid-teens. So I know you mentioned June would mark the trough of the cycle, but is it fair to say Allegro the peak-to-trough declines this cycle can finish at the lower end of that range?\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes. So the way we haven’t given any guidance, Blake, with respect to the June quarter, right? But we had a decline of about 8% in the December quarter. Our guidance is about a decline of 8% in the March quarter. And so again, if history is any guide, we’re expecting that these 3 quarter cycles, we’ll continue to see that kind of a decline in the March quarter as well.\nBlake Friedman: Got it. And then just more of a longer-term question on gross margin. I know you outlined the puts and takes to kind of -- in the short-term recovery. But to get to your 58% target, can you maybe describe that bridge from 54% to 55% to 58%, puts and takes from there?\nDerek D’Antilio: Sure. Good question. So when I look at our Q3, we were actually above 55% on an organic basis before we start to get synergies for Crocus. So that was about a 70 basis point headwind for the Crocus -- first quarter of Crocus and we’re continuing to work to get synergies on their business. And as that business scales, we’ll also get gross margin. The other piece of it is our distribution sales are obviously down. And as we’ve talked about in the past, that’s about 800 to 1,000 basis points higher than the OEMs just because of the volumes. So as that starts to normalize, that’s generally about 100 basis points. That kind of brings us back up to that 56% to 57% range. And then our supply chain teams continue to work on a flexible manufacturing model by moving products or standard product to subcontractors, as Vineet talked about China supply chain and then continuing to leverage our back-end facility in the Philippines, but we continue to -- we have opportunities for optimization. And we just finished a large capacity expansion in the Philippines and that’s something that happens every few years. That’s not going to continue into next year. So we’ll continue to leverage the Philippines. So we think with our vendor leverage as we scale our Philippines facility and getting synergies from Crocus, and as the distribution sales start to normalize, we get to that 58% level. And we were there, of course, 2 quarters ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.\nJoshua Buchalter: I guess I wanted to follow up on the previous one, and I apologize for beating the inventories digestion to that. But did you just say that you expect the June quarter to be down as much as the December and March quarter? And I guess big picture, can you talk to confidence that you’ll be able to get this inventory cleaned up by the June quarter? And any anecdotes about where inventory levels are at your end customers would be helpful.\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes, Josh. So right now, inventory levels in the channel where we have direct visibility and contractual visibility are elevated. Those are above our target ranges and that’s why distribution sales are down. We continue to manage distribution sales down in watching that POS and watching the inventory in the channel. We’re starting to see that clear in consumer and as I said, I expect that consumer is probably at a trough first, which is the March quarter. Industrial continues to clear, particularly parts of the data center, parts of solar, that may take another quarter to clear out of there. Auto is a relatively new dynamic, of course, with the rebalancing of the inventories that Vineet talked about. And yes, we do expect if history is any guide, that the June quarter decline would be similar to the decline we saw in the December quarter and the March quarter.\nJoshua Buchalter: Okay. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about Crocus. I believe you mentioned some initial traction in the prepared remarks on e-mobility. Are those products -- does that indicate that the products are close to or are auto qualified and maybe you could talk to a bigger picture about how your engagement with your customers have changed now that you’ve got Crocus in the company and expanding your current sensing portfolio.\nVineet Nargolwala: Josh, this is Vineet. Thanks for the question. So I can indeed confirm with pleasure that we have now auto qualified the Crocus product. It is what we call a generic call. Now we will -- as we are engaging with each individual customer, obviously, there’s a qualification cycle as per the unique design. But we are very actively engaged across automotive and industrial customers. And I’d characterize the engagements and some of the excitement in 2 ways. One is with the industrial base that Crocus had where maybe there was a little bit of trepidation on engaging with a smaller company, a start-up company. That’s gone away, and now we’re able to engage with a much more comprehensive portfolio around sensing and power with those customers. And so those customers are really excited to engage with us and really take advantage of the whole portfolio. On our customer base, where perhaps some of the more challenging applications, we were working through some of those technical challenges. The addition of the Crocus TMR stack has now made the solution very obvious and very easy. And so we are accelerating the adoption of the TMR stack onto our parts. And really, as I mentioned, we are now going to market through a common brand. ExtremeSense TMR is now the world’s most comprehensive magnetic sensing portfolio on TMR, really addressing the most demanding challenges around sensitivity, around speed of response around low power consumption. And so we see really an endless set of opportunities that we can address together. So really excited about the 2 technologies coming together under one brand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Thomas O’Malley from Barclays.\nThomas O’Malley: I wanted to ask about the auto trends into March, but I wanted to ask more specifically on the makeup of those auto trends. So if you look at the December quarter, you’re still seeing really strong growth on a year-over-year basis from the ADAS and xEV rev. But your core non faster-growing auto business was down 7. Could you talk about when you look into March, what your expectations are for the split between those 2 businesses? Do you see sequential declines in some of the faster-growing ADAS and xEV revenue? And just given all of the weaker data points on EV that we’ve been hearing lately, is that the reason for the incremental auto weakness for the next 2 quarters? Or is it really more of the core, more SAR kind of levered auto?\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes, Tom, this is Derek. So in the Q3 quarter, you’re right, e-mobility was up strong. The traditional auto business was down. And if you remember in our guidance, we talked about the UAW strike in the United States. It did actually have some impact. When we looked at the pull ahead with the Detroit Bake 3. Sales were down significantly in Q3 compared to Q2. There was a pull ahead we saw in Q2, and we expected that. And rolling into Q4, we don’t -- we’re not going to break that out guidance by market. But it’s really the inventory digestion primarily at the tiers and at the subcontractors. It’s not specific to end market demand, certainly not EV, and certainly not ADAS.\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes, Thomas. This is Vineet. So I’ll just add to that. As Derek pointed out, we had some order push-pull dynamic with our North America customers, largely around the UAW strike. At the same time, we’ve seen some really strong growth with our China customers and our Japan customers. And so I think that’s the dynamic we’re seeing. If I take a step back and I sort of look at the mid- to long term, we know that Chinese OEMs, Japanese OEMs, European OEMs are really forging fast and furious towards an all-electric future. The North American OEMs are taking their own path with a mix of plug-in hybrids as well as battery electric vehicles. And we’re serving all of them in their own unique way. But I think the path on each region to an all-electric future will be slightly different and will take a slightly different time line.\nThomas O’Malley: Helpful. And then my follow-up is just on the gross margins. A bit lower into March, but I think you mentioned mix. Can you talk about how you see that margin profile recovering? I mean if lead times have come down and the channel looks a little bit different than it did over the last couple of years, shouldn’t margins stay kind of more at these levels? And if you look at auto potentially recovering, does that help bring those margins back after the June-September quarter time frame? Can you just walk me through the puts and takes of how much recovery do you see in the gross margins? And how quickly you think that comes back?\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes. As I mentioned, our Q3 gross margin was about 60 points better than we had guided to at the 54.6%. Within that, Allegro’s organic gross margin was still over 55%. So organic gross margin is still very good and very healthy. It holds up well based on the flexible manufacturing model that we have. Going into the March quarter, we’re guiding to 53% to 54%. And that projects a continued decline in distribution sales, which, as I mentioned, generally has significantly higher gross margins than OEM sales because of the volumes they’re buying. Product mix also plays a part in that from quarter-to-quarter. And then the third piece of the March quarter is the continued Crocus integration and Crocus fixed cost before we start to see synergies in the second half of the year. So I’d expect that gross margin to remain in that 53% to 54% range for the near term, the next couple of quarters. And then as we start to get synergies, start to see the normalization of the distribution, I expect that to go back up to 55% in the medium term, and then we’ll work towards our model of 58% back to where we were a few quarters ago.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I’m not showing any further questions in the queue. I’d like to turn the call back over to Jalene for any closing remarks.\nJalene Hoover: Thank you, Kevin. We appreciate you taking the time to join us this morning. This concludes the call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today’s presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day."

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Allegro’s President and CEO, Vineet Nargolwala. Vineet?\nVineet Nargolwala: Thank you, Jalene, and good morning, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal year 2024 conference call. I’m pleased to report that we continued a strong performance in fiscal Q2. We delivered sales of $276 million, up 16% year-over-year, driven by continued strength in automotive and non-GAAP earnings per share established a new record at $0.40, up 29% year-over-year. We continue to execute our strategy of growing our business in e-mobility and select industrial markets, including clean energy and automation. Sales in these strategic growth areas were $154 million or 56% of total sales, up 37% year-over-year as we continue to gain share and outpace the competition. Automotive revenues in Q2 grew 31% year-over-year. Within that segment, e-mobility, which is the electrification of vehicles and increasing adoption of ADAS features continues to fuel Allegro’s growth. Sales into e-mobility applications increased by 60% year-over-year to 50% of Q2 automotive sales, establishing a new milestone and up from 41% in Q2 of 2023. Last quarter, we highlighted macro concerns related to China, a sentiment that was echoed by many in the semiconductor space as well as other industries. In September, I travelled to China with several members of my executive team, where we met with our customers, channel partners, suppliers and teams to obtain a comprehensive view of the market dynamics on the ground. While there are clearly challenges in the broader Chinese economy, we came away even more excited about the opportunities for Allegro, specifically related to e-Mobility and clean energy. The enthusiasm and respect from our customers and our partners for Allegro’s long-standing heritage in automotive as well as for a track record of delivering innovative, high-quality products continues to position us as a partner of choice for Chinese OEMs who are increasingly capturing the world’s imagination and targeting a more global presence. As a proof point, we saw continued strong second quarter design win activity and shipments in China, which increased both sequentially and year-over-year. With local incentives for EVs extended until 2027 and increasing consumer enthusiasm for EVs, we have solidified plans for localizing key aspects of our supply chain, which will help us better support our customers in an increasingly competitive landscape. We were also pleased to celebrate the opening of our new Shanghai office, punctuating our commitment to our customers and our growing local team in the strategically important region. Looking to the future. We continue to see strong design wins in our strategic growth areas, including e-Mobility, clean energy and automation. E-Mobility alone represented approximately 2/3 of second quarter design wins. This design win momentum and the significant content opportunity associated with those design wins continues to drive our above-market performance and support future growth. A great example is BMW’s selection of Allegro as the sole current-sensor IC supplier for traction inverter systems used across the company’s entire fleet of battery electric vehicles. Allegro’s current sensor integrated circuits deliver market-leading accuracy, enabling precise motor control, leading to a superior driving experience and extended driving range by minimizing power losses. Additionally, our current sensors built in overcurrent detection and self-diagnostics enabled BMW to meet the highest level of safety and reliability while reducing the number of components used in the traction inverter. There has been some discussion lately about slowing momentum for EVs and whether hybrids are a better option. The transition to fully electric vehicles is a significant one and major technology transformations usually don’t happen in a straight line or without bumps in the road. BEVs are still projected to grow strong double digit over the foreseeable future as they remain the best way to meet emissions requirements. And I want to emphasize that Allegro’s content in full hybrid vehicles is significantly higher than that in ICE vehicles and similar to that in BEVs. So Allegro wins, no matter which platforms OEMs invest in and grow. This reinforces our confidence in the long-term target growth model we set at Analyst Day in the March of 2023. Beyond e-Mobility, we’re seeing some near-term auto movement in our automotive business, primarily related to the impact of the UAW strike as OEMs and tiers rebalance their production plans. In Q3, we still expect our automotive business to grow year-over-year. Let me now comment on the industrial markets. In Q2, growth in Industrial Automation and clean energy helped offset declines at data center and broad industrials to deliver 6% year-over-year growth in industrial sales. The continuing macro trends are starting to have an impact on overall demand, leading industrial OEMs to become more cautious. Looking into the third quarter, we expect to see a sequential decline in industrial sales as OEMs trimmed their production schedules and managed their inventory. Our other market which is less than 10% of our sales and largely serves consumer applications has seen significant declines on a year-over-year basis due to slowing consumer demand and inventory correction. In response, we will continue to manage channel inventory tightly in both the industrial and consumer markets while still maintaining our market positions. While our backlog remains robust, our Q3 sales forecast reflects normal third quarter seasonality, heightened macroeconomic trends, elevated inventory levels in industrial and consumer markets and the lingering impact from the UAW strike in automotive. Over the mid and the long-term, continued strong momentum in design wins, especially in our strategic focus areas of e-Mobility, clean energy and automation and the deepening and expanding collaboration with leading OEMs like BMW reinforces our conviction in the target model of low double-digit sales growth and above 32% operating margin. Finally, I’d like to take a few moments to discuss the Crocus acquisition, which we closed on Tuesday this week. We’re delighted to welcome the Crocus team to Allegro and look forward to working together to serve our customers. Crocus’ IP and products complement Allegro’s portfolio while accelerating our road map and plans to deploy TMR to highly demanding applications by several years. Allegro’s TMR technology is strong in ADAS and Crocus will bolster our leadership in xEV applications as well as expand the aperture in industrial and consumer applications. Crocus’ industrial presence is complementary to Allegro’s leadership positions in automotive and industrial markets and will benefit from a strong global sales, engineering and supply-chain footprint. Putting this all together, we expect this business combination to strengthen Allegro’s leading position in magnetic sensing with world-leading Hall effect and leading-edge TMR solutions, which further enhances our long-term growth. I will now turn the call over to Derek to review the Q2 financial results and provide guidance for our third quarter. Derek?\nDerek D’Antilio: Thank you, Vineet, and good morning, everyone. Starting with a summary of our Q2 financial results. Sales were $276 million. Gross margin was 58.3%, operating income was 31.3% and adjusted EBITDA was 37.1% of sales. As a result, earnings were $0.40 per share, an increase of 29% compared to Q2 of fiscal 2023. Sales to our automotive customers were $206 million, or 75% of our Q2 sales, an increase of 9% sequentially and 31% year-over-year. All automotive sales categories grew sequentially and year-over-year. E-Mobility sales increased by 13% sequentially and 60% year-over-year, now representing 50% of second quarter sales -- auto sales, up from 41% a year ago. Industrial sales were $51 million, declining 25% sequentially with the largest percentage declines in data center and broad-based industrial. This largely reflects the timing of shipments between Q1 and Q2 and our careful channel inventory management. Second quarter industrial sales increased by 6% year-over-year. Other sales, which includes consumer applications, were down -- were $19 million, down 10% sequentially and 42% year-over-year, reflecting inventory destocking. Sales through distribution declined as expected and were down 8% sequentially as we continue to manage the channel closely. Channel inventories appear to have stabilized and POS was up sequentially. From a product perspective, magnetic sensor sales were $176 million, increasing 1% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. And sales of our power products were $100 million declining 4% sequentially, but increasing 2% year-over-year. Sales by geography were well balanced with 25% of our sales in China, 21% in the Americas, 20% in the rest of Asia and 17% each in Europe and Japan. Highlights in the quarter were 14% sequential growth in Japan and 12% sequential growth in China. Now turning to Q2 profitability. Gross margin was 58.3% compared to 57.8% in Q1 and above our guidance range of 56% to 57% largely due to favorable product mix and foreign exchange. Operating expenses were $74 million or 27% of sales, declining by approximately $1 million sequentially and from 28% of sales a year ago. Second quarter R&D expenses were 14% of sales and SG&A was 13% of sales. Operating margin was 31.3% of sales compared to 30.8% in Q1 and 27.9% a year ago. Operating margin dollars increased by 30% year-over-year on a comparable sales increase of 16%, demonstrating the continued strong operating leverage. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 11.4%, slightly lower than expected due to the geographical mix of income. The second quarter diluted share count was 195.1 million shares and net income was $78 million or $0.40 per diluted share. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended Q2 with cash of $378 million Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $47 million, and free cash flow was $16 million. From a working capital perspective, DSO was 39 days, down slightly from Q1 and days in inventory were 136 days compared to 132 in Q1 on slightly lower inventory balances. Capital expenditures in the second quarter were $31 million as we continue to build out our back-end operations in the Philippines. Before I move to Q3 guidance, I’ll make a few additional comments about the Crocus acquisition. As Vineet mentioned, we’re excited to have closed the Crocus acquisition two days ago on October 31. Since announcing this transaction in August, our teams have been planning for integration, which is now well underway. We are ready to begin selling Crocus products through our sales channels and expect to begin to realize cost synergies beginning in calendar 2024 as integration progresses. We also expect to utilize Crocus’ significant tax net operating losses within the first year of close by repatriating IP from France to the U.S. This will allow us to efficiently integrate Crocus into our operations, leverage our U.S. tax rate and obtain many of the same benefits typically associated with an asset transaction. In connection with the closing of Crocus we executed a $250 million term loan at SOFR [Ph] plus 275 basis points. In pro forma after closing, we have approximately $200 million in cash, and our net leverage is well below one turn. In addition, I’m pleased to report that Moody’s upgraded Allegro’s credit rating to Ba3. Now with that backdrop, I’ll turn to our Q3 outlook. Including two months of Crocus, we expect third quarter sales to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million. Our guidance contemplates a return to normal third quarter seasonality, the lingering impacts from the UAW strike and careful channel inventory management. Our long-term model, including low double-digit sales growth is still intact and in fiscal 2024, we expect our strategic focus areas of auto and industrial to outgrow the underlying markets. We expect the gross margin in Q3 to be approximately 54%, reflecting the projected product and channel mix as well as the initial impact of Crocus. Operating expenses are expected to decline by 4% sequentially and are anticipated to be approximately 28% of sales. We continue to make investments in R&D and sales in our strategic focus areas as we work towards our target operating model. We are also taking prudent actions to manage expenses and working capital as we navigate near-term macroeconomic uncertainties. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 12.5% and our diluted share count to be approximately 196.5 million shares. As a result, we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.27 and $0.31 per share. In Q3, we expect the Crocus impact to be $5 million in sales, $3.5 million in interest expense and $0.03 dilutive to EPS for the 2 months that Crocus is included in our results. Going forward, Crocus will be integrated into our magnetic sensor business. Now I’ll hand the call back to Vineet for some concluding remarks.\nVineet Nargolwala: Thank you, Derek. We believe our core growth engines and target financial model remain intact. We remain focused on executing our strategy that leverages the intersection of our industry-leading technology with the megatrends of electrification and automation in the automotive and industrial markets. We take great pride in our core value to innovate with purpose with the goal of delivering the greatest value to our customers, and we remain as bullish as ever and excited about the journey ahead. I want to thank our teams around the globe for delivering great results in Q2 and for their continued hard work and dedication to serve our customers. Now I’ll turn the call back to Jalene for the Q&A session. Jalene?\nJalene Hoover: Thank you, Vineet. This concludes management’s prepared remarks. Before we open the call for your questions, I’d like to share our third fiscal quarter conference line up with you. We are attending UBS’ Global Technology Conference on November 27 and 28 at The Phoenician in Scottsdale, Arizona. Wells Fargo’s Seventh Annual TMC Summit on November 29 at the Terranea Resort and Rancho Palos Verdes California; and Barclays TMT Conference on December 7 at the Palace Hotel in San Francisco, California. We will now open the call for your questions. Amanda, please review Q&A instructions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to start off my questions by focusing on the two largest global automotive markets, the U.S. and China. Last quarter, you called out some bookings weakness in China. But since then, we’ve seen some reacceleration in their light vehicle build rates. So maybe if you can just speak to the bookings trends that you’re seeing in China. And I would have thought that the UAW strike would not be tremendously material for overall global light vehicle production, but maybe if you can just call out or size the impact as you see it here as we go through the third quarter.\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes, hi Gary, this is Vineet. Thanks for the question. So you’re right. Last quarter, we had expressed some concerns about trends in China. And I think we were pleased to see that the bookings returned quite strongly for our China business. And certainly, our visit to the region, spending a week on the ground with customers and partners reinforce that the e-mobility trend continues to be really strong and vital within the China customer base. And I think we’re just seeing a resumption and a continued acceleration of the order rate. On the UAW part, it’s difficult to quantify, but I will tell you that we are seeing order movement between quarters. And we’ve said this before, we are several steps removed at times from the OEMs in terms of the supply chain or the value chain. And so we don’t always get a direct correlation between a platform and our product but it is clear to us that there has been some order movement between quarters as the tiers and the OEMs rebalance their production schedules as a result of the strike and our managing the various inventory positions as well.\nDerek D’Antilio: And Gary, this is Derek. We saw a demarcation. Our auto sales were up 9% in Q2. And we saw a demarcation between sales after the strike started in September with the big three automakers in Q3. So while it’s been settled now at this point, there’s still some linger effect. So it’s not material, but it does have an impact on Q3. The other things that impact Q3 are a return to some normal seasonality, which has been above 4% or 5% prior to the supply chain crisis for the last few years.\nGary Mobley: Thanks. As my follow-up, I wanted to ask about distribution inventory. What was the mix for the second quarter sales? And I would assume since point-of-sale was up in sell into the distribution channel was down 8% as you called out, the inventory decrease in the distribution channel. And maybe you could just speak to the -- where it sits today, measured in weeks relative to where your normal range is?\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes. So we’ve talked in the past about our target range as being about 10 to 12 weeks. And I would say that we’re kind of at the higher end of that range right now, Gary, and we’ve been there now for this quarter. And what we’ve seen is the inventories in the channel have stabilized. The good news is POS was up higher than our sell-in to the channel and we’ll continue to watch that very closely and the split in Q2 was about 50-50, so 50% OEM, 50% distribution. We expect that split in Q3 to be higher OEM and a little bit lower distribution as we continue to manage that. And that’s part of the reason why the gross margin guide in Q2 is coming down. That’s about 100 basis points, as I’ve talked about in the past, we’re selling it to the channel because of the volumes has a significantly higher gross margin. So we’ll continue to manage that very, very closely in the short term to make sure that we’re not over shipping into the channel.\nGary Mobley: Thanks guys.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis at Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the inventory in industrial. I mean you went through a cycle in the other consumer bucket, and there’s a period where you were kind of shipping the backlog. I’m just kind of curious what your perspective is in industrial, how much inventory is there and kind of how long this correction might take?\nDerek D’Antilio: So I’ll start with some numbers Blayne, then I’ll turn it over to Vineet. But when you look at industrial, we continue to shift from backlog really in Q4 and Q1. So our industrial sales were actually up 17% in Q1 compared to Q4. Q4 had 14 weeks, so it was really up in the low 20s. So coming down 25% in Q2. Part of that is the timing of when our scheduled shipments were scheduled to ship. So that’s part of it. But there is inventory in the channel, as I just talked about. We continue to watch that closely. We certainly expect sales to distribution and industrial to be muted again in Q3 and be down again in Q3 as part of our guidance, and we’ll watch that closely until we think that we’re not over shipping to demand.\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes, Blayne. What I would add is when you think about the end markets within our Industrial business, this broad industrial, which again is highly fragmented set of different applications. But one of the big markets is solar. As we supply our set of ICs for a variety of applications that make up the solar ecosystem, the solar business is pretty muted at this point. And so when we take a step back and take a look at the inventory positions at our distributors that serve the industrial market, so data center is another one. And we say the inventory positions are well within the comfortable range, maybe at some places, they’re a little bit higher, we’re watching the POS very carefully to make sure that we are not creating or exacerbating the inventory problem. And so that’s why we are intentionally managing our shipments into those industrial distributors. But I would say that the end markets of data center and solar, in particular, are the ones that are muted. And I think it’s anybody’s guess as to how long it’s going to take for those markets to recover and come back, okay? But it’s probably going to be a couple of quarters, at least.\nBlayne Curtis: And then the $5 million from the Crocus acquisition, is that being recorded in the industrial bucket?\nDerek D’Antilio: Largely, it will be in the industrial bucket, Blayne, yes.\nBlayne Curtis: Okay, thanks guys.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Blake Friedman of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nBlake Friedman: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to touch on gross margin again. I know you gave some brief comments. But last time you were around this $250 million revenue level, gross margins were still able to hold around 58%. And so just in the 54% guidance for December, just was hoping you could quantify more of the puts and takes into that.\nDerek D’Antilio: Blake, this is Derek. Yes, I mean, our gross margins have only touched 58% twice once this quarter and once two quarters ago. In this quarter here in Q2, we had a really positive product mix, magnetic sensing and in particular, some products within that. We also had some positive foreign exchange. What I’ve talked about in the past is kind of the near-term gross margins being in that 56% range. And when I look at Q3, if I exclude the initial impacts of Crocus the base business gross margins are about 55%, and that includes a headwind of around 100 basis points from the decline in channel inventory. So as channel inventories start to normalize, the base business goes back to around 56%. And product mix can have about 100 basis point plus or minus impact on that gross margin. So we’re still working towards our structurally improving our cost structures and working towards our target model of 58%. On the Crocus business, their variable contribution margins are quite acceptable to us right now but they are business that needs to scale. And as we start getting some of the cost synergies and bringing in some of our supply chain and some of our logistics, we expect to get their gross margins overall to our target model well over time.\nBlake Friedman: Great. Very helpful. And then also just maybe within your December guidance as well. Just specifically in terms of your autos outlook, I know you mentioned it should grow year-on-year. But is there any way you can kind of talk about the buckets in terms of e-Mobility and non-e-Mobility as we kind of look in the next quarter that would be great. Thanks.\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes, Blake, this is Vineet. I’ll answer that. So we continue to be very pleased with our momentum in e-Mobility, and we expect e-Mobility to stay strong as we look to the next quarter sequentially. We are seeing some order movement in our ICE shipments or product set. And so we expect that to be down but as we said before, on a year-over-year basis, we are still expecting overall order to have good growth.\nBlake Friedman: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter at TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Buchalter: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on that second one from Blake. I mean, -- in the outlook for -- which should grow year-over-year. I mean, I have to model a pretty sharp sequential decline to get anywhere close to flat year-over-year. It sounds like really the only headwind that you’ve explicitly called out was the order movement related to the UAW strike. And I guess, can you help any more details you can give us on the auto segment from a sequential basis? Or are there any other pockets of weakness that you think you’re sort of under shipping demand right now? Thank you.\nDerek D’Antilio: One number thing I’ll clarify, Josh, year-over-year, we expect auto to well outgrow the market. So auto for the overall year, fiscal 2024 versus 2023 will well outgrow the market.\nJoshua Buchalter: I was just on a follow-up on that. I mean, your confidence that after under shipping in the third quarter on the auto basis, you should return to sequential growth. Could you remind us of like what seasonal is because it’s been so atypical for the last several quarters?\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes, Josh, we’re not saying it will return to sequential growth next really. We haven’t commented on Q4. We’re saying that Q3 auto is going to be down probably mid-single digits in Q3, e-Mobility will remain robust. The sharper decline in Q3 is going to be industrial and other, as we’ve talked about. For the fiscal year, though, we expect auto to be well above market growth rates and well above our target operating model of 7% to 10% above auto production growth.\nVineet Nargolwala: And then, Josh, within that, obviously, e-Mobility is what is really driving overall growth for us in auto. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are really agnostic in terms of the content between full hybrids and BEVs. And so the content is very similar for us right now. And so we are agnostic and actually supporting both platforms and growth in both platforms for our customers. It’s correlated to that pure ICE vehicles would see some decline. And I think that’s pretty well understood broadly by third-party estimates as well and our safety confident convenience business is really agnostic to the powertrain. So that continues to be really stable and starts to see a little bit of content lift with more electrified content.\nJoshua Buchalter: Okay. Got it. Thank you for all the color there. And for my follow-up, you called out -- I understand you don’t have perfect visibility into the channel. And it sounds like things are stabilizing from a channel perspective in industrial. But as I think about your on-book inventories, they’re still running higher than they have in the past. Are you comfortable with where things are now? Is there more work to do on -- for your on-book perspective that over the next couple of quarters? Just curious how you’re thinking about that. Thank you.\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes, Josh, this is Derek. So the odd books inventories, the absolute dollar amount came down about $1 million from Q1. The days went up a little bit on the sales down about 1%. So I think we’re still comfortable with those levels because the majority of that inventory is in wafer and actually in die bank now. So the good news is we’ve been able to put in place more progress and move that inventory to die pro die bank, which means it’s good die. And that lasts quite some time, but we are continuing to manage those inventory levels to make sure that we’re aligning wafer receipts with projected demand. And certainly managing finished goods inventories, and we’re also managing working capital very tightly and CapEx, as you might imagine here in the near term.\nJoshua Buchalter: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christopher Caso at Wolfe Research. Chris, your line is open.\nChristopher Caso: Yes, thank you. Good morning. I guess the first question is regarding the backlog and visibility going forward. Obviously, lead times have been long, product has been short. As things get a little bit more normal, how does that affect your visibility in the backlog as we look into the December quarter and does that have any implications for the March quarter? What do you consider to be kind of normal seasonal behavior for the March quarter? And what sort of visibility do you have for that now?\nVineet Nargolwala: Chris, this is Vineet. So I want to start answering that question by saying that the visibility that we really get is first based on our design wins. So our design wins and the customer forecast that comes with those design wins is really what we use for our call it, our mid to long-term planning purposes. And that sets the table for our R&D investments, our capital investments, our factory planning and so on. And then in the near term, that forecast gets turned into orders, which then become part of the backlog. And you’re right that as lead times have come back more into the normal range, the backlog has moderated to what we would call the normal range, right? Typically, it’s two quarters with what we would consider normal. We are back within that range. So we have good visibility for the next couple of quarters and the forecast continues to evolve based on the design wins. So hopefully, that gives you a sense for how we think about visibility and how we think about the next couple of quarters.\nChristopher Caso: Got it. If I could ask a follow-up on the Crocus acquisition. If you could speak to the rationale for that because obviously, you guys were ready doing internal work on TMR sensors. What was the decision to go out and buy as opposed to continue that development internally?\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes, Chris, great question, and really appreciate the opportunity to come back to this topic because it’s really important. So as I said in my prepared remarks, Allegro has traditionally been really strong in developing TMR for ADAS and our business in auto. And when we looked at the Crocus technology and how that has evolved in the last couple of years, we found that to be a really good fit for xEV applications as these applications started to become more demanding in terms of accuracy and robustness over temperature and over life. And so we felt at some level, yes, it’s a build versus buy decision. But by bringing Crocus into the portfolio, we’ve accelerated our road map by several years and we can now bring this TMR technology today with a little bit of work from our engineers, make it automotive grid and bring it to our automotive customers pretty much instantaneously. And that’s the work that’s going to happen over the next few days and weeks where our sales team, along with the Crocus team is going to go to all of the automotive customers. And I’ll remind you that Crocus today doesn’t really have any automotive business, largely industrial. And so we’re going to bring this technology to our automotive customers and some of our more demanding industrial customers. And we’ll be able to really grow this -- grow TMR within the overall space and certainly within the Allegro portfolio. So we’re really excited about the prospect of bringing a much more comprehensive magnetic sensing portfolio to our customers. And we believe that this would help us differentiate even further in the applications we serve as well as open up new applications for us to go after.\nChristopher Caso: If I could just follow up quickly on that, too. And given the need for qualification, the auto customers, the need to bring those up to automotive grade, can you give us a sense of what the qualification time would be and when we’d start to see an impact at those auto customers?\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes, it’s a great question. So auto calls typically are long cycle, right? It takes at least a year to get auto call if you’re starting from scratch. The good news is that the Crocus team was already in process of qualifying their technology at several key OEMs. We can now come in and help accelerate that. And so we believe that we’ll be able to see some impact from automotive customers much sooner than what a traditional call cycle would call for.\nChristopher Caso: That’s helpful. Thank you.\nVineet Nargolwala: Thanks for the question, Chris.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton at Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nQuinn Bolton: Just I guess trying to think about the puts and takes around the auto outlook. You’re guiding it down in December. Some of that seasonality, some of it’s the UAW strike. But all of those things feel like they’re shorter term in nature. And so I guess I’m struggling to think why you wouldn’t return to kind of normal seasonality or strength again in March. I mean are you guys seeing a broader slowdown in auto that’s calculated into the current outlook? Or do you -- I guess, why wouldn’t you return to normal seasonality in March?\nVineet Nargolwala: Quinn, this is Vineet. So we’re not explicitly guiding for next quarter. Having said that, we are not seeing a slowdown overall in auto, right? So a while back, we had talked about auto production still being muted, coming off of the supply chain crisis and still needing to get to somewhere in the range of 90 million units globally in order to achieve overall balance in the industry. And I think we’re still -- the industry is still on the way there. Whether -- and we can debate what the mix is going to be. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we have become very agnostic to the mix between hybrids and BEVs. And that’s largely the two primary flavors that we believe the OEMs are really working on. So we’ve also said earlier today that we see continued strength in e-mobility and it’s really some near-term movement around orders between quarters plus the seasonality that is calculated into our Q3 guidance here.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. But -- I mean it sounds like you guys agreed that the strike and seasonality are kind of shorter-term events. And so it doesn’t sound like you see anything longer term, that’s causing to become more cautious on the outlook. You’re just giving December quarter guidance, you’re not commenting beyond, but we should be reading into these comments that this is an extended slowdown.\nVineet Nargolwala: That’s correct. So I think our comments right now are just limited to Q3. We don’t see any broader slowdown in automotive. Obviously, it’s a very dynamic market right now. But at this point, we don’t see any reason to believe there’s a slowdown in auto.\nDerek D’Antilio: And to bifurcate a bit, Quinn, that’s absolutely true. But industrial and other does have a different dynamic, right, where this is -- historically, it’s taken a couple of quarters of inventory digestion in the channel where those products are sold in those two markets.\nQuinn Bolton: Understood. And then Derek, just kind of try to parse the gross margin. It sounds like the channel mix to OEM, which is about 100 basis points. Sounds like Crocus is about 100 basis points. I guess in the near term, if I just run the math, it looks like Crocus comes in with effectively zero gross profit to kind of impact overall corporate margins by 100 basis points. How should we be thinking about the gross margin trajectory over the balance of this year and then into fiscal 2025? Do you think it sort of stays in this $54 million to 55% range given sort of the drag on Crocus? Or do you think that you can kind of get back to that more that 56% level that I guess I would call more your sort of near-term target for gross margins?\nDerek D’Antilio: Yes. So the first -- this first quarter, the initial impacts of Crocus include some kind of sort of start-up costs, if you will, Quinn, and the gross margins are above zero, so sort of rounding with those numbers. But if you -- the core of the base business in Q3 is about 55%, and that includes the headwind from the channel inventory management. So that brings it to 56% if we kind of normalize the channel business on a go-forward basis. We also expect to start to get some synergies on the cost side as we move back into operations for Crocus and some of the other things to our suppliers and our back-end facility in the Philippines in 2024. So in the medium term, that 56% gross margin is what we expect, and then we’re continuing to work towards our target operating model of improving our gross margins by 50 to 100 basis points and getting to 58%. Something I’d mention in Q3 is it’s the initial quarter of Crocus from OpEx, right? And OpEx is still down 4%. It would have been down 10% without Crocus, and we’ll continue to bring them into our organization, part of our magnetic sensing business as we integrate that.\nQuinn Bolton: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh at Mizuho. Please go ahead. Vijay Rajesh, your line is open. Please go ahead. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Natalia Winkler at Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nNatalia Winkler: Hi, thanks for taking my question. So on the BMW announcement, you guys highlighted that it’s a sole source kind of win for you. And I was just curious, like, is this a normal approach for some of those e-Mobility design wins you guys are seeing? And also, have you seen any shift between kind of the sole source and dual-source approach coming out of the shortages? Are you seeing kind of incrementally OEMs using one model sourcing versus the other?\nVineet Nargolwala: Hi Natalia, this is Vineet. Thanks for the question. And the short answer is that it depends on the OEM. I would say that, yes, there is certainly efforts on the part of some OEMs to make sure that they have at least a dual source for some of the key components. But there is also our case where we have redundant sources of manufacturing. So we are able to bring supply chain resiliency to bear. And so when we present to our OEMs it’s the most comprehensive portfolio of products, especially when it comes to magnetic sensing and some of the power applications we serve. And then we talk about the supply chain resiliency that’s in-built into our supply chain with multiple sources for wafers, multiple packaging and assembly and test locations. And so that allows us to get to a sole source position. I would tell you that the complexity of designing the xEV powertrains and systems as well as the demanding nature of some of these applications where we certainly presented the best option that can meet those needs across life, across a wide range of operating conditions lends us to be sole sourced in most of these cases.\nNatalia Winkler: That’s very helpful. And as a follow-up, Vineet, would you speak a little bit more to the data center dynamics? It sounds like over the last few quarters, you guys have highlighted somewhat the weakness in there. Has there been any structural kind of change to what’s pulling the demand? And are you seeing any sort of near-term or midterm tailwinds that might kind of shift that dynamic?\nVineet Nargolwala: Yes. Natalia, it’s a really good question. So first of all, data center is a very small part of our business. It’s less than 5% of our total sales. In the near term, we don’t really see any change in the data center dynamic. We’re in constant communication with our data center partners, tiers and distributors and they’re not indicating any sense of a change in direction or the market starting to recover. The positive, if I can call out, one, is that we continue to have new design wins with our data center customers. So we’ve, in the past, talked about the shift towards 48-volt architecture. That results in new platforms, new product requirements and for us, new design wins. And as the industry moves to 3-phase fans or 3-phase motors there’s more content for us. We’re seeing design win activity associated with that. But for the next couple of quarters, we don’t really see any potential recovery in the data center space.\nNatalia Winkler: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh at Mizuho. Please go ahead Vijay. Vijay Rakesh your line is now open. One moment for our next question. At this time, I am showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to hand it back to Jalene for closing remarks.\nJalene Hoover: Thank you, Amanda. We appreciate you taking the time to join us this morning. This concludes this morning’s conference call."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to Jalene Hoover, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. \nJalene Hoover : Thank you, Carmen. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Allegra's first fiscal quarter 2024 results. I'm joined today by Allegro's President and Chief Executive Officer, Vineet Nargolwala; and Allegro's Chief Financial Officer, Derek D'Antilio. They will provide highlights of our business, review our quarterly financial performance and share our second quarter outlook. We will follow our prepared remarks with a Q&A session.  Our earnings release and prepared remarks include certain non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures that are discussed today are not intended to replace or be a substitute for our GAAP financial results. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, which is available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.allegromicro.com. This call is also being webcast, and a replay will be available in the Events and Presentations section of our IR page shortly.  During the course of this conference call, we will make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are based on current expectations and assumptions as of today's date and as a result, are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from projections.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Allegro's President and CEO, Vineet Nargolwala. Vineet? \nVineet Nargolwala : Thank you, Jalene, and good morning, and thank you all for joining us for our first quarter 2024 conference call. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong start to fiscal year 2024, including record sales of $278 million, up 28% year-over-year. On a trailing 12-month basis, we've achieved $1 billion in sales, marking a new milestone. We've also achieved record non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.39, an increase of 63% year-over-year.  Our financial performance demonstrates the progress we are making towards executing the strategy that we laid out at our recent Analyst Day event. We continue to sharpen our market focus on e-Mobility and select Industrial markets, including Clean Energy and Automation, with sales in these strategic growth areas increasing 63% year-over-year to $159 million or 57% of total sales, up from 45% in Q1 of 2023.  E-Mobility, which includes the increasing electrification of vehicles and higher adoption of ADAS feature sets, continues to drive Allegro's above-market growth. Total Q1 automotive revenue grew 27% year-over-year, outpacing auto production growth of approximately 6% over the same period. Sales into e-Mobility applications increased by 58% year-over-year and represented 48% of our Q1 automotive sales, up from 39% in Q1 of 2023.  Our solutions-based design approach continues to be well received by our customers. Nearly 60% of first quarter automotive design wins were in e-Mobility. A recent example during the quarter was a multi-portfolio chipset ADAS design win with a leading North American OEM further validating our strong value proposition. Our design win momentum and the significant content opportunity associated with those design wins, continues to drive our above-market performance in automotive.  Moving on to the Industrial market. Growth in Clean Energy and Automation drove 70% year-over-year sales increase in Q1, resulting in record Industrial sales. First quarter Industrial design wins leverage our sensor technology for DC charging, residential solar inverter and energy storage applications, where we see expanding opportunities for our solutions. We continue to align our investments in R&D and customer support capabilities to focus on high-growth secular megatrends in Automotive and Industrial markets that intersect with our technical expertise and market-leading sensor and power product portfolios. I'm excited about the launch this quarter of the first device in our new Power-Thru portfolio that leverages technology from our acquisition of Heyday Integrated Circuits last October. In addition to validating our ongoing commitment to innovation and execution, this launch serves as a proof point for the rapid pace at which our team can integrate new technologies into commercially viable and market-ready products.  Our new Power-Thru isolated gate driver offers a single package solution with an up to 50% smaller footprint and a 40% efficiency improvement compared to competitor offerings. This helps designers achieve their efficiency and power density goals in Clean Energy and e-Mobility applications. This is especially important for higher switching speeds inherent in GaN and SiC where Power-Thru helps unlock the full potential of these wide-bandgap technologies. This is the first of many new products to come in our new Power-Thru portfolio, and I want to congratulate the team on this first and very important milestone.  Next, I want to talk about another important milestone, but first in our ESG journey. I'm pleased to have released our inaugural ESG report just last week, which highlights the significant steps we have taken thus far towards building a more sustainable future. Our commitment to ESG is directly aligned to our corporate strategy and growth plans through the products we innovate and the applications they enable, which in turn support a greener and more sustainable world.  In addition to solving customer challenges like reducing emissions, making applications more energy-efficient and harnessing renewable energy, our innovative teams are also imagining ways to enhance our impact on the communities where we live and work. As we -- after the need for more clean energy with innovative, efficient, socially responsible and environmentally conscious solutions, we're building long-term value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank our teams who delivered another outstanding quarter, while further accelerating our strategy with the launch of innovative new products and moving our ESG initiative forward. I could not be prouder of our team and what we continue to build every day while executing our strategy and serving our customers.  I'll now turn the call over to Derek to review the Q1 financial results and provide guidance for our second quarter. Derek? \nDerek D'Antilio : Thank you, Vineet. Good morning, everyone. Starting with a summary of our Q1 financial results. Q1 sales were a record $278 million. Gross margin was 57.8%, operating expenses were 27% of sales. Operating income was 30.8% and adjusted EBITDA was 36.3% of sales. As a result, earnings were $0.39 per share, an increase of 63% compared to Q1 of fiscal '23. Sales in the first quarter increased by 28% compared to Q1 of fiscal '23 and 3% sequentially.  As a reminder, our Q4 had 14 weeks and on a comparable 13-week basis, first quarter sales increased by 11% sequentially. Please keep this in mind with respect to all sequential comparisons. Sales to our automotive customers were $190 million or 68% of Q1 sales, an increase of 4% sequentially and 27% year-over-year.  Within automotive, e-Mobility sales increased by 7% sequentially and 58% year-over-year, representing 48% of first quarter sales, up from 39% a year ago. Industrial sales were $68 million, increasing 18% sequentially and nearly 70% year-over-year, led by Automation and Clean Energy. Other sales, which includes Consumer and Computer Applications were $20 million, declining 30% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. From a product perspective, magnetic sensor sales were $174 million, increasing 4% sequentially and 27% year-over-year. And sales of our power products were $104 million, increasing 1% sequentially and 29% year-over-year.  Sales through distribution represented 56% of our first quarter sales, reflecting the transition from Sanken to a Japanese distribution channel during the quarter. Excluding Japan, Q1 distribution sales were approximately 41% of sales compared to 43% in Q4 and 37% a year ago. Once again, no single end customer represented more than 10% of Q1 sales and sales by geography were well balanced with 22% of sales in both China and the rest of Asia, 21% in the Americas, 20% in Europe and 15% in Japan.  Now turning to Q1 profitability. Gross margin was 57.8%, consistent with Q4 and above our guidance range of approximately 56% due to favorable product and channel mix as well as favorable foreign exchange. Operating expenses were $75 million or 27% of sales compared to 28% in Q4 and 30% a year ago. First quarter R&D expenses were 14% of sales and SG&A was 13% of sales. Operating margin was 30.8% compared to 30.2% in Q4 and 25.3% a year ago.  Operating margin dollars increased by 56% year-over-year on a comparable sales increase of 28%, demonstrating the continued leverage in our operating model. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 12.6%, slightly higher than our guidance of 11% due to the geographical mix of income. The first quarter diluted share count was 194.9 million shares and net income was $77 million or $0.39 per diluted share, an increase of 5% sequentially and 63% year-over-year.  Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended Q1 with cash of $362 million. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $49 million, consistent with Q4 and free cash flow was $4 million. We also significantly enhanced our liquidity by closing a new $224 million revolving credit facility to replace an expiring $50 million revolver. From a working capital perspective, first quarter DSO was 40 days compared to 45 days in Q4 and days of inventory were 132 days compared to 127 days in Q4.  As discussed in our last call, we continue to rebuild our wafer and die bank, which allowed us to reduce our delinquent backlog and improve our lead times, which declined by approximately 30% in Q1. We are also investing to expand our operations in the Philippines to support anticipated future growth and first quarter capital expenditures were $45 million.  Before I turn to Q2 guidance, I'll provide some color on what we are seeing in the business environment. Automotive in certain Industrial markets, including Clean Energy and Automation have been resilient in the first half of calendar '23. Double-digit market growth projections for our strategic growth areas and our design win momentum continue to give us confidence in the low double-digit long-term growth targets that we articulated at our March Analyst Day.  Global auto production remains robust and is expected to increase by 5% in calendar '23 to nearly 87 million units and EV sales are projected to grow by approximately 30%. In the Industrial market, government policies, regulations and investments are driving the clean energy market with an estimated $1.7 trillion in investments announced this year. We are, however, cautious in the near term given the macroeconomic uncertainty with increasing interest rates, inflation and geopolitical concerns. More specifically, we are monitoring China closely, where auto production declined 15% in the first half of calendar '23.  Our sales in China in Q1 declined 13% sequentially or 7% on a comparable 13-week basis. We are seeing multiple factors at play in China. OEM finished goods inventory is higher than normal due to the transition to more stringent emission standards and at the same time, China's renewal of its new energy vehicle tax incentives, combined with OEM price reductions are expected to increase sales volumes in the midterm. And as a reminder, our sales are very well balanced geographically and China represents about 1/4 of our sales.  We believe that our products and strategy will drive long-term above-market growth, but macro uncertainty and rapidly changing business environment, particularly in China, makes it difficult to precisely predict quarter-to-quarter impacts. We are watching these macroeconomic factors and leading indicators in our business closely so we can best serve our customers and continue to execute to our target financial model.  Now with that backdrop, I'll turn to Q2 outlook. We expect sales in the second quarter to be in the range of $270 million to $280 million. The midpoint of this range is a 16% increase compared to Q2 of fiscal '23. We expect gross margins to be between 56% and 57%, reflecting the projected product and channel mix. And we expect operating expenses to be between 26% and 27% of sales. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 13% and our diluted share count to be approximately 196 million shares. Based upon these assumptions, we anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.39 per share.  Now I'll turn the call back over to Jalene for questions. Jalene? \nJalene Hoover : Thank you, Derek. This concludes management's prepared remarks. Before we open the call to your questions, I'd like to share our second fiscal quarter conference line-up with you. We are attending Needham's Virtual Semiconductor and Semi-Cap one-on-one conference on August 22. And Jefferies Semiconductor, IT Hardware and Communications Summit on August 30 at the Four Seasons Hotel in Chicago. We will now open the call for your questions. Carmen, please review the Q&A instructions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. \nGary Mobley : I appreciate the qualitative comments with respect to visibility, but maybe if you can quantify things a little bit more and quantify what your customer order lead times are given that, I believe, the link with backlog as you cited, is down 30% sequentially. And maybe if you can quantify where your backlog sit today relative to where it has been recently and what sort of revenue coverage you might be contemplating in the second quarter revenue guide? \nVineet Nargolwala : Gary, this is Vineet. Thanks for the question. So you asked a few questions in that question. So let's take it one by one. I would say that, I think starting with lead times, we're really pleased with the work the teams have done to bring our lead times back into what are so called industry standard lead times. There's a few packages, I would say, are still constrained. We're working through those. But on the whole, we are very pleased with the progress we've made. And as we've said before, as lead times come back into a normal range, we expect the backlog to moderate.  So I would say the backlog is now back in what I would consider normal levels as well. That said, our order patterns continue to be very strong. Our design wins continue to be really good. And so on the mid- to long term and certainly the visibility we get into our forward-looking business makes us feel really confident about the growth rates that we committed to at the Analyst Day. Derek, I don't know if you want to add anything more to that? \nDerek D'Antilio : Yes. And Gary, with respect to Q2, we feel really good about the Q2 guidance. That's largely covered by our backlog. And within that, we'd expect auto to be up marginally in Industrial and other to kind of be flat to down slightly in Q2 based upon the projected shipments that we have scheduled in our backlog. \nGary Mobley : That is helpful. And if I can ask a follow-up question about gross margin, I believe the beat in the first quarter was about 180 basis points. Maybe if you can single out the contributing factors between mix, revenue mix and FX tailwind and embedded in your Q2 gross margin guide, is there an expectation of a continuation of the foreign exchange tailwind? \nDerek D'Antilio : Yes. Thank you, Gary. This is Derek. So really, the larger proponent of Q1's beat was on the product mix, and that will vary from quarter-to-quarter. So we had a very favorable product mix in Q1. We've also benefited from the transition in Japan from Sanken as a distributor -- as a Tier 1 distributor to the distribution channel, and that's been marginal. The foreign exchange was the smaller piece of Q1, it was still impacted but we do expect that to start to normalize in Q2. So Q2's guidance reflects our projected shipment mix along with normalization of the U.S. dollar and the Philippine peso. \nOperator: And it comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. \nJoshua Buchalter : I wanted to follow up on the segment guidance you just gave. So we dive back into the numbers correctly, which is a big if. The Industrial segment, it seems like it's going to be down after a couple of quarters of very strong growth. Is there any sort of inventory digestion going on there? And then kind of same thing with the other segment, it suggests down pretty sharply again in the fiscal second quarter, are we -- how close are we to that for bottoming? \nDerek D'Antilio : Yes, Josh, this is Derek. So the results for the last couple of quarters, and particularly the mix between market and even in Q1 were really a result of what we've shipped -- shipping out of backlog, making allocation decisions. Going into Q2, there's still some of that. From a distribution channel standpoint, we're at target levels right now. We've continued to rebuild that distribution channel over the last four quarters. As you know, that troughed about a year ago. We've continued, I think, to work with our distributors. We're at target levels right now in our distribution channels. So within Q2, I'd expect sales to distribution to be down marginally and sales to OEMs to be up slightly. \nJoshua Buchalter : Okay. Got it. And then I also wanted to ask about China from your prepared remarks. You mentioned it declined 7% in the quarter. Was that commentary mainly focused on autos? Or was it more broadly across your other segments? And do you expect China to grow into the back half of the year as some of the auto numbers have picked up in recent months? \nVineet Nargolwala : Josh, this is Vineet. So I'll take that one. I think before I jump into some China-specific remarks, the context here is that any time you go to a big technology or market transition, it's never a straight line, right? It's never linear. And the transition to an all-electric future is going to be no different. Now China does have some specific issues that it's dealing with. But we believe that in the near term, there is going to be choppiness across all our end markets.  Derek pointed out that auto production declined in China in the first half. We're certainly seeing some impact of that. Industrial continues to be, from an inventory standpoint, still elevated. But make no mistake, China is a very important region for us. It's very important for the entire automotive industry, is the lead of our volume when it comes to autos and EVs and local Chinese OEMs or Chinese brands are now playing a much bigger role and the global stage when it comes to EV.  So we're really confident and have a lot of conviction in our mid- to long-term thesis around China and the China OEMs. Near term, like we said, it's going to be a choppy market. It's a little bit like solving from multivariable calculus, right? There's a lot of variables at play. And as Derek pointed out, it's a little hard to pinpoint the quarter-to-quarter transition exactly, but we feel really good about the mid- to long-term perspectives in China. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And it comes from the line of Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. \nChristopher Caso : I guess the first question would be around lead times. And I think your comments said that they were down about 30% in the first quarter. Can you talk about where that stands against where lead times would normally be? And is it increasing supply still likely to bring those lead times down further as we go through the year and what impact they may have on your order rates? \nVineet Nargolwala : Yes, Chris, this is Vineet. I'll take that one. So our lead times, as I said, we've -- our teams have done a great job of reducing our delinquent backlog and bringing the lead times back into what we would consider a market competitive or industry standard. Having said that, we do have plans to further reduce our lead times, especially targeted around our distribution channel, some of our Industrial customers, where point-of-sale really matters.  And so you can expect us to continue to bring down our lead times. I think from an inventory level, Derek can add some more, but we feel really good about where we are with our inventory levels now. And the nature of that inventory being in sort of die bank, I think, gives us a lot of optionality. \nDerek D'Antilio : Yes. And I think, Chris, I expect inventory levels from a dollar standpoint to flatten out from here on. As Vineet mentioned, we have sufficient die bank. And it's really there to support our customers from a quick term standpoint. So we feel good about the current levels, but I wouldn't expect it to increase from here. \nChristopher Caso : Okay. Great. As a follow-up, follow-up is on pricing. And I guess we've heard some commentary from others, perhaps some uncertainty about what will happen with foundry pricing as we go into next year. Can you talk about your view of what you think is the cost situation as you go into calendar '24? And if that changes, how that may affect your pricing to your customers and your revenue on a year-on-year basis next year? \nVineet Nargolwala : Yes, Chris. Maybe I'll start with the second part first. So we've been very consistent in our commentary around pricing. And our pricing, especially in our automotive business, which is about 70% of our business has always been value proposition based. We are in long-term agreements with most of our customer base. It's very hard for us to sort of do transactional pricing. So it's not a question of input costs go up or down X and hence, price goes up or down Y.  So I think our value and the innovation we drive in our products helps drive the value proposition and the pricing equation. And so we feel really good about the stickiness of that pricing as we go forward. From an input cost standpoint, I would say that the pace of change has moderated, but inflation hasn't completely gone away. And so we are in active dialogue with some of our major suppliers and partners around what's changing, what to expect as we go into the next calendar year, but we feel good about balancing sort of the input and the output here from a cost standpoint. \nOperator: And it comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. \nQuinn Bolton : Congratulations. On the next quarter and outlook, I guess, Vineet, I just wanted to come back to your commentary around the China market. It sounds like you're seeing perhaps some volatility in the auto business in China. But if you look beyond China, I assume the rest of the geographies, you're not seeing anything that makes you nervous about the outlook for the other geographies. Is that the right interpretation of your prepared comments? \nVineet Nargolwala : Yes, Quinn, thank you. That's exactly right. So I would say, when we look at our other regions, the order patterns, the stability is fairly consistent with what we've seen in our past quarters. It's really China, and the commentary was very China-specific that it's hard to sort of pinpoint exactly the quarter-to-quarter transitions, we're really bullish about the mid to long term.  But in the near term, there are multiple variables at play that make it really hard to pinpoint to quarter-to-quarter transition. So it is very China-specific. The rest of the regions, I think, are performing as we expected. And certainly, we see -- while we're watching it closely, we don't see any near-term churn in those regions. \nDerek D'Antilio : And Quinn, as you know, one of the nice parts about our business is that each of the sort of five regions are approximately 20% of our sales, so it's pretty well balanced. \nQuinn Bolton : Got it. And just a follow-up on the China business. I don't know if I missed it, but did you make comments about where you thought dealer inventory levels were within China? I know production seems like it had slowed, but do you have any thoughts on inventory levels of vehicles within the China market? Are they elevated? Are they back to normal? I think some of your auto peers had suggested that dealer inventories in China may now be back to more normal levels? \nVineet Nargolwala : Yes, Quinn, what we commented on was that there is a phenomenon happening right now in China where there is a transition to a more stringent emissions standard. And that has driven some excess inventory of the leftover models that are perhaps not compliant to the new emission standard. So that's going to take a little bit of time to work through. This is pretty consistent with what OEMs have commented publicly as well as other tiers have. So we're not alone in seeing this phenomenon. Having said that, we see the EV market continue to grow nicely and the added incentives that exist in China or were renewed in China around EVs, I think are going to be really good for the long-term growth of the EV market. \nQuinn Bolton : Perfect. And then just maybe for Derek, just on the wafer allocations among TSMC, UMC and Polar, is there any sort of mix shift that you see this year among your suppliers that could create either margin tailwinds or headwinds? Or do you think that the margin outlook and foundry pricing is pretty stable? \nDerek D'Antilio : So I don't anticipate a significant shift in the mix. In Q1, it was about 20% Polar, 70% UMC give or take, 10% TSMC. That will vary a bit quarter-to-quarter. And pricing and the revenue per wafer will vary as well. So I don't anticipate that having a significant impact on our gross margins. As Vineet mentioned, we also continue to work with our customers and our vendors to make sure we're marching towards our target financial model point. But I don't anticipate the wafer allocation itself, they have a significant impact on our gross margins this year. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] All right. I'm not showing any further questions. I will turn it back to Jalene Hoover for her final remarks. \nJalene Hoover : Carmen, I'm not sure if you can hear us or not, but thank you so much. \nOperator: Go ahead. \nJalene Hoover : Okay. Thank you so much. We appreciate everybody for taking the time to join us today. This concludes this morning's conference call. \nOperator: Thank you all for participating, and you may now disconnect."
