At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Chief Investor Relations Officer, Ms. Gabrielle Brown. Please go ahead, Ms. Brown.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Lachlan Murdoch, Executive Chair and Chief Executive Officer; John Nallen, Chief Operating Officer; and Steve Tomsic, our Chief Financial Officer. First, Lachlan and Steve will give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and then we'll take questions from the investment community. Please note that this call may include forward-looking statements regarding Fox Corporation's financial performance and operating results. These statements are based on management's current expectations, and actual results could differ from what is stated as a result of certain factors identified on today's call and in the company's SEC filings. Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA or EBITDA, as we refer to it on this call. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and our SEC filings, which are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you, Gabby, and thank you, all for joining us this morning. Against the backdrop of an active news cycle and another robust fall sports schedule, our fiscal second quarter again illustrated the strength of Fox. The growth we delivered in affiliate fee revenues was the standout this quarter, with the Television segment growing by 10% and the Cable segment returning to growth, once again demonstrating the power of our brands and our programming. We now largely completed our fiscal 2024 affiliate renewal cycle, having achieved our commercial goals without disruption and setting a solid foundation for renewals in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As expected, advertising revenues in the quarter were down, primarily due to comparisons to last year's major cyclical events, including the mid-term elections at the TV stations and the broadcast of the Men's World Cup in the Cable and Television segments. Parsing through the cyclical comparisons, our concentration in News and Sports coupled with the outstanding performance at Tubi is clearly an advantage in a mixed advertising environment. More specifically, sports advertising was very healthy during the quarter and we saw particularly strong demand for the NFL and College Football, which continued into the NFL playoffs. At News, the second quarter was more nuanced, while preemptions and the direct response market adversely impacted quarterly growth, we sequentially narrowed the gap between the current and prior year in ratings and in pricing. We were also able to increase our viewing share over the previous quarter, and the positive trends in share ratings and pricing have carried over into the current quarter. Last week, I visited our bureau in Jerusalem, met with our talented and dedicated staff there, and saw firsthand the devastation wrought by Hamas on October 7. Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers go out to the victims of that day, the innocents killed in Israel, and in Gaza, and the hostages still denied the embrace of their families and loved ones. The work our correspondents, our camera people and our producers do reporting on these events is important, outstanding, and deeply appreciated. Now, on to Sports, in calendar 2023, 96 of the year's 100 most watched telecasts were live sports. Fox was responsible for 29 of the year's 100 most watched shows, more than any other network. This marks the fifth straight year that Fox has topped the industry in live sports viewing and demonstrates the unparalleled reach and engagement our content achieves. The 30th NFL regular season on Fox concluded with an average of 19 million viewers across all games, with America's game of the week averaging 25 million viewers, an eight-year high. And Fox NFL Sunday logged its 30th straight year as the number one NFL pre-game show. That strength continued into the post-season, with Fox's three post-season windows delivering a best ever playoff average of almost 45 million viewers across the wildcard, divisional, and championship games. In digital, we saw strong engagement at Tubi, which finished with a very impressive 62% growth in total view time and 17% growth in revenue. Tubi's library of over 240,000 movies and TV episodes coupled with ubiquitous distribution drove engagement, helping Tubi reach 78 million monthly active users, log almost 2.5 billion streaming hours in the quarter and set a new monthly record of 855 million total viewing hours in December alone. Tubi has consolidated its position in the streaming landscape, ranking as the most watched free TV and movie streaming service in the United States, according to Nielsen, and surpassing Peacock, Max, Paramount Plus, and Pluto TV in view time for seven consecutive months. At FOX Entertainment, the second quarter saw programming strength, with Fox having the season's number one new broadcast entertainment series in Krapopolis, hats off to Dan Harmon, the number one new game show debut in Snake Oil and the number one cooking series in Hell's Kitchen. We're also pleased with the very strong start of our mid-season lineup and the early success of We Are Family and The Floor. Before I hand over to Steve, I'll comment on the sports platform we announced last night between Fox, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery. This new and unique digital distribution platform is focused on sports fans outside of existing paid TV offerings. Upon launch in the fall of 2024, the platform will offer a broad suite of sports, including those from a combined 14 linear networks that broadcast sports today. The inclusion of our networks in the platform is consistent with our strategy, being proudly consumer first and distribution agnostic. Across the distribution ecosystem, our traditional Pay TV market will remain our dominant customer base for some time to come. As such, we remain committed to our existing distribution partners, where our strong portfolio of leadership Sports, News and Entertainment brands thrive in their bundled offerings. This unique new platform opens up a new market for us, one that we at Fox have not accessed before and that we're excited to participate in. As always, we are focused on delivering value for our shareholders in a thoughtful and disciplined manner, and we will continue to explore every opportunity to maximize that value over the long-term. Let me now turn it over to Steve for his comments on the quarter's financial results.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. With the vast majority of our fiscal 2024 affiliate renewals now successfully completed, Fox delivered 4% growth in total company affiliate fee revenues, led by 10% growth at Television and a return to growth at Cable. This growth reflects the must have nature of our content and the value that our distribution partners place on it. Consistent with our expectations regarding event cycles, advertising revenues this quarter were impacted by the absence of the FIFA Men's World Cup at FOX Sports and mid-term political revenues at the local television stations, along with lower advertising revenue at FOX News Media. Collectively, these factors contributed to a 20% decline in total company advertising revenues. Total company other revenues grew by 14%, driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues. All in Fox reported total company revenues of $4.23 billion, down 8% from the prior year. Total company expenses decreased 5% over the prior year, primarily due to the absence of the Men's World Cup at FOX Sports and fewer hours of original scripted programming at FOX Entertainment due to the strikes. However, this was partially offset by the first year step up under our new NFL rights agreement. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $350 million as compared to the $531 million reported in the prior year quarter. Net income attributable to stockholders of $109 million or $0.23 per share, compared to the $313 million or $0.58 per share reported in the prior year period, largely due to the EBITDA impact I just mentioned, along with the net changes in the fair value of the company's investments recognized in other net. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 12%, reflecting a one-off remeasurement of our deferred tax assets as a result of changes in state tax laws. Excluding this impact on other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $0.34 per share versus last year's $0.48. Turning to our segments, starting with Cable, which reported 2% growth in total quarterly revenues. Cable affiliate fee revenues increased by $5 million with growth in pricing from our distribution renewals, outpacing the impact from industry subscriber declines running at approximately 8%. Cable other revenues increased $124 million, largely driven by higher sports sublicensing revenues associated with our college sports and international soccer agreements. This growth in affiliate and other revenues was partially offset by a 23% decline in Cable advertising revenues. At FOX News Media, advertising revenues were impacted by a softer direct response marketplace, low comparative ratings, and higher levels of preemptions due to our breaking news coverage of global events. Meanwhile, at the national sports networks, we measured against last year's broadcast of the Men's World Cup. Expenses at the Cable segment were 14% lower than the prior year, with savings mainly gained from the absence of the Men's World Cup, as well as lower legal programming and production costs of FOX News Media. Taking all these factors into account, quarterly adjusted EBITDA at the Cable segment grew 60% over the prior year quarter. Moving to our Television segment, which reported total quarterly revenues of $2.54 billion, down 13% from the prior year. The TV segment reported strong 10% growth in affiliate fee revenues as price increases across all Fox affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. TV advertising revenues were down 19%. The solid growth of Tubi was more than offset by comparisons with last year's cycle of major events, including the FIFA Men's World Cup and mid-term political revenues, as well as the relative mix of World Series matchups and game counts. Also at TV, revenue from our entertainment production companies was impacted by the SAG and WGA related disputes. This contributed to a $64 million decline in TV other revenues, most of which was offset by a commensurate reduction in expenses. Overall expenses at the TV segment remained flat as higher costs under the NFL agreement and a modest increase in investment at Tubi were offset by lower costs from the absence of the Men's World Cup, lower college sports rights costs, and fewer hours of original scripted content due to the strikes. Together, these revenue and expense impacts led to a quarterly adjusted EBITDA loss of $138 million to our TV segment, compared to an EBITDA contribution of $256 million reported in the prior year quarter. Turning to free cash flow, where we recorded a deficit of $615 million this quarter. This is consistent with the normal seasonality of our working capital cycle, where the first half of our fiscal year reflects the concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising related receivables. In terms of capital allocation, fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased an additional $550 million through our share buyback program, bringing the total cumulative amount repurchased to $5.15 billion, or 25% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the program in 2019. In addition, today we announced a $0.26 per share semiannual dividend. These capital return measures are supported by our robust balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion in cash and $8.4 billion in debt. These balances are before taking into account the repayment of our $1.25 billion note in late January. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby to open up the Q&A.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now, we would be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We have a question from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Good morning. Lachlan, obviously, big news in the news, sports joint ventures. I'd love to get your thoughts, really around that product and opportunity in kind of two areas. First is, what is the opportunity that you guys see in the United States for a product like that? Obviously, we're all focused on the cord cutter sort of TAM, but how many people do you think are interested in a product like this? And then do you see any risk to particularly Fox News, this is the first time you guys have offered a product with just Fox broadcast. So how'd you balance that when you thought about putting this business together? Thanks so much.\nLachlan Murdoch: Hey, thank you very much, Ben, and good morning. So the opportunity is huge. And that's really because this sports focused platform is focused entirely on cord -- not cord cutters, but cord nevers. So if you look at the American market, roughly, say, 125 million households in America, and roughly half of those are not within the traditional bundled cable ecosystem. And so the target for this product, which is going to be, I think, incredibly innovative when you see it roll out is really that universe of, call it, 60 million odd households that currently don't participate in the bundled cable and pay television ecosystem. So we think it's a tremendous opportunity. We've been working on it for; I think it's been reported this morning fairly accurately for several months now. I've been lucky enough to -- I have seen some of the prototypes for this service. And again, it will be unique. And I think very innovative when you see it rollout. In terms of the risks, and particularly for Fox News, I think the risks are very low, and that's because of the focus of the sports product being on the cord nevers. Fox News continues to be the top rating cable network. And our distributors, our partners, really value that channel and that brand as it really drives tremendous viewership and audience and engagement for them and we think we'll continue to do so within the traditional cable and pay television bundle. Thank you, Ben.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: We go to Robert Fishman with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Good morning, everyone. Sticking with the sports news, so we've long discussed with you the benefits of Fox to a sports led skinny bundle. So I'm just wondering, any additional background you can share on what pushed this deal forward now, including maybe any flexibility you built into your recent affiliate fee renewals? And then on a related note, should we expect to see any changes in your approach to negotiate future sports rights and any comments you want to share about the Netflix, WWE deal that might impact these negotiations going forward. Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Well, let me start back to front, Robert. So there's no impact on the Netflix, WWE deal at all. So I don't think that plays a factor in this. And in fact, in how we approach our portfolio of sports rights, we will be aggressively competing in the sports market for sports rights that nothing has changed there. The primary business and value in Fox Sports is competing both for every subscriber in the traditional cable -- Pay TV bundle and advertiser viewer and ultimately advertiser. So sports remains a competitive business, which, we -- frankly, we thrive in, and we don't see any difference to that. What led to this? Now, I think we've answered many questions on these quarterly calls over many years about that when we are ready to launch a streaming service such as this, and we will do it. And we've been monitoring the space, obviously, for years, past few years in particular. And as we developed with our partners the concept around very unique and innovative products, we felt now was the right time to launch such a product really into a new market, right? It's a new market where there's no product serving the sports fans that are not within the cable or TV bundle. So it accesses -- for us, it accesses a whole new market and really drives tremendous amount of new reach that we weren't servicing before.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, next question, please.\nOperator: Next is John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Thank you. First, just quickly on the sports TV, just any cash contribution or can you size any cash contribution required from Fox? And then turning to advertising, obviously, a number of things affecting the numbers this quarter. You guys have some positive color as we look into next quarter. Just any color, one, I'd say, on the TV side, what you're seeing at this point in terms of political, and then with the improvement in the ratings and the year-over-year, the gap that you're seeing closing, can we assume that the 23% on the cable outside is sort of the worst number and any color on the sort of slope of the improvement we should see as we head through the year? Thanks.\nLachlan Murdoch: I've lost track forgive me. Okay, so [indiscernible] advertising and cable --\nGabrielle Brown: Cable advertising.\nLachlan Murdoch: Cable advertising.\nJohn Hodulik: Gabrielle, you got it.\nLachlan Murdoch: After this, we won't need any more questions. We'll cover the whole gamut. Thanks, John. On the cash side, I'll let Steve fill in. But it's some -- obviously this business has both the marketing and other costs associated with running the business in the partnership. But there's also the revenue that we garner through affiliate fees for our networks that come out as the business grows. But I'll let Steve on the details.\nSteve Tomsic: Yes. So John, I think it's a touch early for us to be giving some forecasts around sort of the contribution or deficit from the JV, but sort of as we look at it, it'll be accretive to us from a net-net perspective when you take into account the affiliate fees that we'll collect as revenue versus whatever funding we need to make to the JV. We think from a net-net to Fox perspective, it'll be accretive pretty quickly.\nLachlan Murdoch: And then, on advertising, I think the advertising outlook is, as I -- as mentioned with news, but you could apply this term to the overall market. It's nuanced as we look at it. If I start with sports, we had a very solid regular NFL season from an advertising perspective, and I think a stronger NFL post-season, which we were very pleased by, but also that was a smaller revenue line. But we had a fantastic College Football season, really, I think the story of this past autumn was really the strength of College Football, and particularly as advertisers, you sort of founded and appreciated the quality of the audience watching College Football. Coming up, if we look forward, obviously we have the DAYTONA 500 and then the start of the regular Major League Baseball season in March. And there's a lot of positive momentum with advertisers with those. Fox News, you have positive trends of VR pricing. Direct response pricing is still down, but as you start to lap the comparisons from last year, it's certainly improving quite a lot. We have an impact from preemptions with election and unfortunately with war coverage. So the preemptions are affecting and ratings are continuing to improve. So we're happy with where we are at Fox News as all those trends are improving steadily. Local stations is probably the most mixed. But you have a bad comparison, particularly in the current pacings with Super Bowl comps this time last year. It's probably about $50 million in Super Bowl revenue, just in the station group this time last year. So the comparisons are quite tough as we go forward, but we remain confident that we'll see a record political cycle. This is slightly ameliorated, I think in the current quarter with the lack of a competitive primary competition, but we're already seeing business in the first half of next year start to flow in from a political perspective. And it's -- obviously, it's sort of natural because our stations, we have large number of stations in key political markets like Georgia and Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Wisconsin. So we're very confident in a very strong political cycle once that really starts to flow. And then finally with Tubi. Tubi's TBT is continued to grow, I think at 62%, 63%. And obviously with the TBT growth, the revenue is following, the revenue growth is slightly less or somewhat less than it was last year. But in the sort of streaming environment, we're very happy with its growth. So that's -- on advertising, scattered pricing is all up above upfront pricing, so that's positive. And then finally, on the cable affiliate subscribers and fees, we are in an environment where I think we called out it's roughly 8% cable erosion, and yet our cable affiliate fees have grown in this quarter. So I think that really shows the strength of our brands and our programming in the cable universe. So we're very pleased with that. Thanks, John.\nGabrielle Brown: Next question, please, operator.\nOperator: It is from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. Back to the sports platform, Lachlan, you seem really confident that it won't affect the Pay TV bundle, which is, I just want to get some color on that, given that sports has been really the glue that's kept it together. So why do you feel so confident that it will not impact that? And then what is the openness to ad partners, and will this have a separate advertising organization? How will the ads work in your content?\nLachlan Murdoch: So, hi, Jessica, by the way, so the -- first on how it affects the overall Pay TV bundle, again, the key market, the market that we will be driving towards is the market that sits outside the sports fan who sits currently outside of the traditional Pay TV bundle today, and there's tens of millions of them. So we are very confident that this is a large market and a large opportunity that we can address without undermining the traditional bundle. We -- obviously, we've been working on this for several months. We've done lots of sensitivity analysis, and we would not be launching this product if we thought it was going to significantly affect our Pay TV affiliate partners, and that's very important to us. We remain, I think, the biggest supporters of the traditional Pay TV bundle. We think there's tremendous value in the Pay TV bundle for the consumer who wants to get it all at an affordable price. The big bundle is still the best way to get that programming and those brands. So we are confident that this product will be additive and will give us incremental subscribers and not affect significantly the traditional bundle. And the openness to add partners, that's not something that we're considering at this stage. We think that the 14 linear networks that this service offers gives people a tremendous amount of content between ABC affiliates, Fox affiliates, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPN News, the SEC Network, Fox affiliates, Fox Sports 1 and 2, the Big Ten Network, TNT, TBS and others. It's a tremendous offering that covers the majority of the key sports in this country: NFL, NBA, WNBA, Major League Baseball, NHL, et cetera, college, obviously NASCAR and so on. So we think it's an incredibly strong offering and at this stage, we're not contemplating adding partners to it. I think the third question, Jessica was on advertising revenues. And so advertising revenues will flow through this, so that the advertising that we have on our linear networks will flow into this service and will just give us increased reach to market that hasn't seen those that advertiser engage with those clients before. So we think it's a net positive. Thank you, Jessica.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Very good. That will come from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Please go ahead.\nMichael Morris: Hi, good morning. Thank you, guys. So I wanted to ask about two areas of strength in the quarter. The first one on the sports sublicensing. Can you share a little more detail on what that was, how it impacted profitability, and how to think about whether or not that's a recurring revenue and profit source? And then my second question is on the affiliate acceleration, which is great to see. We know that the rate of cord cutting is going to be impactful on that number. It's very hard to predict. But on pricing alone and the precedent that you just set, should we look at this as the first quarter of a sustained stronger pricing dynamic? And how long do you think we should anticipate that you can continue to see this type of growth being fueled by those new contractual relationships? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: I thought it was unfair that Steve would get the easy question and then you asked the second question. So anyway, good morning, Michael. I'll let Steve address the sports sublicensing first.\nSteve Tomsic: Hey, Mike. So our sports sublicensing revenue we have in the Cable segment. So we have -- we earn sports sublicensing income in relation to various sort of college sports properties and international soccer rights. Some of these rights come with some variable based economics to them, which we saw in the quarter. I think you should see this as somewhat a one-off. It's not going to repeat like this in future quarters, future years. And if you want to try and dimensionalize it, then the size of the increase in cable other revenues between this quarter and previous quarter last year is a pretty good guide to the net benefit to us from those sublicensing arrangements. \nLachlan Murdoch: So on the affiliate revenue acceleration, I think the -- if you look at it in two, can we sustain that? We've now completed all of our distributions or renewals in this cycle that will affect the remainder of this fiscal year. So there's no more renewals negotiated that will affect this fiscal year. And obviously then we're rolling into renewals that will take effect after this fiscal. If you look at the underlying rate of decline around 8%, and this goes back to a little bit of what John's question, if we look at that 8%, actually in September and October, it was better than 8%. It was a little bit better. And then -- and this, we believe was the impact of football and sports viewing in the fall. But then after October, sort of as you get into November and December, the rate returned, decline returned to its sort of baseline at 8%. So for the immediate future, we don't see that changing. There's some cyclicality within that. But I think the 8%, yes, number that we're sort of baking into our assumptions. With that, we believe as we've achieved in over the last year, where we've renewed over a third of our distribution, we've been able to achieve rate increases that have made up for those declines. And that is because of the strength of our brands, the strength of our programming, and really where they sit, having sort of a focused strategy on a key number of very core brands that are essential for the -- for distributors and for their customers that will be able to maintain similar rates of change going forward. Thanks, Mike.\nGabrielle Brown: At this point, we are out of time, but if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you again for joining today's call.\nSteve Tomsic: Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, everyone. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T executive teleconference. You may now disconnect."

And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Lachlan.\nLachlan Murdoch: Thank you, Gabby, and thanks everyone for joining us this morning. I just want to start with a comment and a note of thanks. We are living through tumultuous times. And at the outset I want to acknowledge the work our journalists are doing covering the horrific October 7, terrorist attack and the subsequent ongoing war in the Middle East. From the reporting of Trey Yingst, Greg Palkot, Mike Tobin and Lucas Tomlinson in Israel; and Steve Harrigan in Beirut to the deep analysis and insightful commentary by our reporters and hosts including John Roberts and Trace Gallagher to the essential and brave work of our on-the-ground producers and camera crews, Fox's fulfilling its mission, defined report and analyze the news of the day without fear or favor. News reporting is hard and word reporting is perhaps the hardest. And while the horror Central to this new cycle and were heavily on those we ask to expose them their exposure is necessary. And so our team deserves our admiration and our gratitude as they continue to work tirelessly and under demanding conditions to keep us up to date on events far away and on their impact closer to home. My sincere thanks to them all. Now turning to today's first quarter earnings release. Against a backdrop of an active news cycle and a robust sports schedule, fiscal 2024 has started off on a solid operational and financial footing. Fox's focused portfolio of assets continues to distinguish itself and deliver exceptional results. Financially, we are now comparing against the fiscal 2023 cycle of events that delivered then record revenues and EBITDA. Despite this comparison, we posted total revenues this year slightly ahead of last year's record. On the affiliate side, we reported 2% total affiliate growth led by 8% growth of the TV segment in the quarter. Importantly, we have continued to secure constructive renewals, which deliver for our partners and reinforce the value of our brands and program. Advertising revenues in the quarter decreased by around 2%, principally due to a comparative quarter last year that was much heavier in political ad revenues at our local TV stations. We understand there is inconsistency around the broader advertising market, particularly in entertainment but our focus on live sports and news continues to deliver with healthy national pricing and demand in addition to continued momentum at Tubi. Underpinning revenue are our core brands, which consistently resonate with viewers and the consumption data clearly shows this. With total viewing of FOX brands, up 2% in the quarter. FOX Sports was a big driver of that consumption especially, with its broadcast of the Women's World Cup where the US versus the Netherlands on FOX was the most watched Women's World Cup game match, ever on US English language television. From summer to fall, our lineup is bolstered by our football packages led by the NFL on FOX we are averaging over 17 million viewers Tubi gained. Based on the strength of our remaining schedule, especially from Thanksgiving to Christmas, we expect that engagement to improve significantly. In College Football, interest is reaching new highs Fox's big new Saturday is progressing to a third straight year as the number one game window in all of college football averaging almost six million viewers. At Tubi, we had another enviable quarter delivering 30% revenue growth driven by an impressive 65% lift in total view time. Tubi surpassed 70 million monthly active users in September, logged nearly four billion streaming hours in the first half of the calendar year and remains the number one AVOD player and most watched free ad-supported TV streaming service in the United States. Additionally, Tubi has beaten Pluto Max Paramount+ and Peacock in view time for five consecutive months. One reason for the high engagement level that Tubi is its extensive content library that now exceeds 60,000 titles which translates into more than 225,000 movies and TV episodes in addition to approximately 300 fast channels. And during the quarter, Tubi introduced Rabbit AI a Chat GPT four powered recommendation engine, to help users navigate this incredible range of titles. Tubi also offers a unique and compelling proposition to advertisers. Our recent MRI study of streaming peers concluded that Tubi saw the fastest growth amongst young and diverse populations. And that Tubi is able to deliver high-value, net new audiences with 33% of Tubi streamers unreachable on other top AVOD services. Now turning back to Fox News, the strength of our overall news coverage and the reach of our linear audio and digital content is unmatched. Whether it is the conflict in the Middle East, the upcoming 2024 election cycle or volatility in the financial markets, FOX News is increasingly their viewers first choice. The launch of our new expanded Primetime lineup in mid-July, further solidified Fox News' leadership position not only in cable news but in all of cable, finishing the quarter as the most watched cable network in both total day and Primetime. FOX News maintained its lead as the most watched cable news network, beating CNN and MSNBC in and total viewers and in the demo for both prime and total day. We have seen that they continue and expand in the current quarter with October viewership increasing over 20% from the first quarter, with over 30% growth in the key demo. Ratings leadership during the quarter, was achieved across the platform. The Fox News channel had the top six cable news programs with P2+ And the top seven programs within the demo. In P2+, the five led the way in terms of viewers followed by Jesse Watters Primetime and Hannity of the five, Gutfeld, Hannity and Jesse Watters Primetime were a top four programs in the demo.  And Fox Business News ended the quarter as the most watched business cable network beating CNBC in total viewers during the business day, for the sixth consecutive quarter. The election cycle started off with the successful Republican presidential primary debate, which is Fox News channel's highest-rated telecasts since election day 2020, and the highest-rated non-sports telecast of the year across cable. While the debate kicked off the election cycle, once we get deeper into it our local station group will benefit greatly from increased political spend in the coming quarters. Over at FOX Entertainment, we started the 2023 to 2024 broadcast season as the number one network in the key adult 18 to 49 demo and Fox ranks as the top network and entertainment program. First, in at least 10 years. FOX has three of the top four highest-rated premieres of the 2023/'24 season to date in Krapopolis, the Simpson and The Masked Singer. And the season's number one new game show with Snake Oil. Across the company fiscal 2024 is shaping up nicely. We look forward to a great enthusiasm across the fall sports season underpinned by the NFL, college football and now the completed World Series, continued viewing growth at Tubi and renewed momentum at Fox News and our local stations as the election cycle heats up. Our balance sheet remains a core asset for FOX and we will continue to deploy it in a disciplined and thoughtful manner that delivers value for our shareholders. Finally, I would like to congratulate my father on a 70-year career at News Corp and Fox. His enduring legacy can be felt in both of these companies. And I can assure you that he is still very much involved and will continue to be for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to take you through the operating details of the quarter.\nSteve Tomsic: Thanks, Lachlan, and good morning, everyone. FOX reported total first quarter company revenues of $3.21 billion, which is slightly above the prior year quarter. This was led by a 2% increase in affiliate fee revenues as the pricing gains from recent distribution renewals more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. From an advertising perspective, we of course faced the tough comparison to last year's record midterm political revenues at our local stations. This coupled with continued softness in the direct response marketplace at FOX News more than offset the benefits we saw from the broadcast of the FIFA Women's World Cup, the 30% revenue growth generated at Tubi and continued support of national pricing for live content. Taking as a whole, our advertising revenues declined 2%. Meanwhile total company other revenues increased 2% or $6 million. Quarterly adjusted EBITDA was $869 million as compared to the $1.09 billion reported in the prior year quarter. Expenses increased this quarter driven by higher rights amortization and production costs associated with the Women's World Cup, the first year step-up from our NFL rights renewal and increased expenses at our digital businesses. Net income attributable to stockholders of $407 million or $0.82 per share, compared to the $605 million or $1.10 per share reported in the prior year period. This move largely reflects the EBITDA impact I just mentioned along with the change in fair value of the company's investment in flat to up recognized in other net. Excluding this impact and other non-core items, adjusted EPS was $1.09 versus last year's $1.21. Turning to our operating segment results starting with television where we delivered total quarterly revenues of $1.78 billion or a 4% increase year-over-year. This was driven by an 8% increase in TV affiliate revenues with healthy growth in fees across all FOX-affiliated stations more than offset the impact from industry subscriber declines. Advertising revenues at our TV segment grew 1% led by the benefits from the broadcast of the Women's World Cup continued growth at Tubi and the timing of college football broadcast, partially offset by the absence of last year's midterm political revenues and lower ratings of the FOX network. Television other revenues increased 6% in the quarter, primarily a result of the timing of participations tied to our entertainment production initiatives. The growth in revenue at our television segment was more than offset by a 10% increase in expenses, including costs associated with the Women's World Cup, the first year step-up associated with the renewal of our NFL rights and continued investment at Tubi. Together these revenue and expense impacts led to quarterly adjusted EBITDA of $351 million in our Television segment compared to the $409 million reported in the prior year quarter. Our cable segment reported total quarterly revenues of $1.39 billion, a 3% decrease year-over-year. Cable affiliate revenues were down 2% in the quarter, largely a result of industry subscriber declines, which continue to run in the 8% range. Cable advertising revenues were down 8% as a broadcast of the Women's World Cup and the Men's CONCACAF Gold Cup were more than offset by the continued impact of a softer direct response marketplace and lower ratings at FOX News Media. Notably though, we continue to see healthy national linear and digital demand from advertisers of Fox News Media. Cable other revenues increased by $6 million in the quarter due to the timing of sports sublicensing revenues. Meanwhile expenses at our cable segment increased 13% led by higher programming rights amortization and production costs for the Women's World Cup and Gold Cup, the timing of college football broadcast at FOX Sports 1 and contractual rights increases across our sports portfolio. All-in-all, this resulted in adjusted EBITDA at our cable segment of $607 million compared to the $742 million reported in the prior year period. Turning to cash flow, where free cash flow which we define as net cash provided by operating activities less CapEx was negative $70 million in the quarter. This is consistent with the seasonality of our working capital cycle, with the first half of our fiscal year is characterized by a concentration of payments for sports rights and the buildup of advertising-related receivables, both of which reversed in the second half of our fiscal year. From a capital deployment perspective, fiscal year-to-date we have repurchased a further $300 million through our share buyback program. We have now cumulatively repurchased $4.9 billion representing approximately 24% of our total shares outstanding since the launch of the buyback program in 2019 and we remain committed to utilizing our full buyback authorization of $7 billion. This is supported by the strength of our balance sheet, where we ended the quarter with approximately $3.8 billion in cash and $7.2 billion in debt. This excludes the $1.25 billion of senior notes that we issued in early October. The proceeds from which we intend to use to pay down the corresponding maturity coming due in January 2024. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Gabby.\nGabrielle Brown: Thank you, Steve. And now we will be happy to take questions from the investment community.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] One moment for first question. And that will come from Robert Fishman from MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.\nRobert Fishman: Good morning everyone. After deciding on passing on the WWE renewal can you share anything specific on how you evaluated the ROI of the deal in the context of driving higher advertising and affiliate fee revenue? And then, maybe just more broadly can you discuss whether you expect to see any impact on future sports right negotiation if the Disney Charter renewal impacts the industry rate of cord cutting or affiliate fee growth going forward? Thank you.\nLachlan Murdoch: Hey. Good morning, Rob. There's a lot in there. So let me unpack it bit by bit and if I hope I don't miss anything. So how we -- I think we've talked about this before, but how we analyze the WWE renewal, and we look at all of our sports portfolio in the same way and on all new rights, opportunities are for new rights in the same way. We -- on the base of analyst -- analysis sorry. We on both an advertising point of view, we were not hitting the advertising numbers due to the audience of the WWE to make return for our return on investment to be above the levels that we would accept. But also, we didn't attribute enough significant retransmission revenue to WWE either so it made sense for us to move on from them. They've been a great partner for many years. But just quite simply we're very disciplined and the RR didn't meet our pretty disciplined parameters. So we wish them luck and we've moved on from them. We're currently in I think the final status of a very constructive negotiation for our NASCAR renewal. We look forward to continuing that partnership with NASCAR. It's been a great partnership for many years. And obviously, NASCAR exceeds our expectations from an ROI point of view. In terms of Disney and Charter and how that affects our view going forward. I think it's a net positive for us. I think that we want our distributors to do well. We want them to continue to invest in high-quality programming and high-quality brands. And obviously, between FOX News and Fox Sports our station group and our network we have a very focused very valuable set of core brands that distributors such as Charter value. So net-net the Disney Charter deal has been positive for us and positive for our strategy.\nOperator: The next question is from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. My one question is on sort of unlocking value although it does immediately have to spend two pieces that might be connected I guess first -- it's a confession. I wanted to ask about sports and Tubi. So arguably, the popularity of sports particularly football and even more particularly college football has probably never been higher. I mean, your college rights are probably more valuable today than ever. I'm just wondering, if you guys have ideas on capitalizing and maximizing the return on those rights. Beyond the kind of stuff, we always think about was advertising on the live rights and retrans fees. And then kind of related maybe is leveraging, Tubi both in terms of sports, but also just broadly like your stock doesn't have I think probably objectively credit for what Tubi is worth, and it continues to grow. Are you guys thinking about ways to try to highlight that value more or scale it up maybe through for some strategic activity? And any thoughts on helping to unlock some value around an asset that's obviously doing quite well, and probably it will be worth a lot more in the public company than what it is currently priced at inside of Fox. So I know that's a lot but would love your thoughts.\nLachlan Murdoch: No, that's fine. Hi. Good morning. So I think the best way I can answer both questions sort of with one answer, I suppose which is the value -- you're 1000% right college football has never been more popular. It's rating extremely well. And one of the things we haven't talked about is frankly advertisers have found it. Advertisers are pouring in to call triple with tremendous rates and with tremendous appetite for volume, because they can see the value in this audience. And perhaps, it's been underpriced in past years, I'm not sure. But certainly, advertisers are recognizing the opportunity in college football and obviously, we're the leader. But ultimately, we build value through our brands and through the Fox Sports brand and Fox Sports and station distribution. And so we'll continue to build value through college football through, the Fox Sports brand and monetizing it that way. The same thing with Tubi. First of all, we don't envisage any kind of significant live sports on Tubi in the near or frankly median perhaps even long-term future. But Tubi is very focused on primarily entertainment and particularly in video-on-demand entertainment, which makes that content and then engagement with their users all the more valuable. And I think, it will be a long time before we see significant live sports on Tubi. In terms of how we unlock the value in Tubi. Tubi will be the way our audiences engage primarily engage with entertainment in the future. It's a core part of our business and a core part of our strategy and so we're building value there organically through driving its growth. I couldn't be more pleased with the arrival of our new CEO Anjali Sud. She's doing a tremendous job and has very clear and strategic sort of retention and view for how we continue to drive Tubi's success. So, thank you Ben.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we will take the next question.\nOperator: And that's from Jessica Reif Ehrlich from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. First of all I want to say, I really appreciate your introductory comments regarding news reporting and of course about your father who was is definitely one of a kind. But my question, I guess, two-part two as usual from all of us. First on advertising. Can you give us your outlook for political advertising and what the current tone of sports advertising is. We know the general marketing still seems pretty tepid? And then maybe, kind of, a nuance on what Ben just asked but the longer-term vision for Tubi like it's clear there's tremendous growth near-term but is this the vehicle as you think about possibly transitioning to streaming given the decline in the universe? Or how are you thinking about it?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks, Jessica. And then thanks for – thanks for – my comments. So let me start with advertising. So the -- we also hear and understand that the advertising market appears to be I use the word mixed right or sort of unsettled. However, we are not seeing that to the same extent due to our focus on sports and news. So let me start with sports where we're seeing high demand around our NFL and we just discussed our cost football schedule particularly in the national, sort of, market pharmaceuticals, auto, quick service restaurants and CPG categories have all been quite active and I think importantly our pricing has been added premium to our modest premium, but we are pricing above our upfronts, which certainly in a sports category the market remains healthy. This will be somewhat tampered by post season baseball including their conclusion of their world series last night. I think sometimes you get lucky and you get seven series -- 7-game series with a matchups that are in sight the imagination of a national audience and sometimes you're less lucky. So that's how that could be combos. And so, I think, we would like to have seen more games and we'd like to have seen a bit more, sort of, national excitement around these games, but it is what it is. Having said that we should congratulate the Texas Rangers for a great season and winning the world series. At FOX News Media, our national advertising is solid with growing pricing. And it's important to note that we have over 80 new national advertisers in Primetime, specifically, in our 8 P.M. hour in the first quarter. So the refreshing of our schedule and our lineup has worked from both a ratings perspective, but also from an advertising perspective really, really very well. Direct Response continues to face some headwinds really from last year from the previous upfront where there was which technically created sort of an oversupply in the market for direct response and put downward pressure on pricing. So we would expect as we go forward for that pressure to be relieved. There will be some -- and we've got increased audiences due to the new cycle which is a positive from a ratings point of view, but that's partially offset by an increased level of preemptions due to our kind of really in-depth and incredible reported. So overall, I should just overall sports and news we are very happy with the overall performance of both of those verticals in our business. We're also very happy with Tubi. We announced we had 30% revenue gains, which is well-driven off the 65% growth in total view time. I think going forward, we'll see continued growth in view time. Anjali is very focused on that. And what there is softness in the entertainment advertising market and Tubi is not immune from that softness. But Anjali is focused on how we better monetize. We've written this incredible growth in audience and viewership and now it's time we really focus on how we more effectively and efficiently monetize that huge audience. We've earned the right because of the audience growth to really start to take a greater share of wallet from our advertising partners. Finally, the local stations. We are pacing slightly ahead of last year in the base market if you exclude political. You have to remember this quarter last year of October particularly I think it had over $125 million worth of political revenue in the month of October alone. So, it's a huge year-on-year comparison. But ex-political we're very pleased with the base market is strong. And that's really led by the auto and recently the retail categories are very strong also financial services. That's offset with bedding wager and also entertainment right? It's -- there's not a lot of opportunity, the strike in Hollywood. There's no movie launches. So that's offsetting some of the growth in auto retail and financial services. Now, I should go on to some of your -- the other part of your question in the -- sort of taking too long Jessica. That's what happens when you ask three questions in one. But so the longer-term strategy for Tubi. Look I think we have a multipronged strategy. I think Tubi is in an enviable position. It's the leading AVOD player. It's free. It's focused. It's entirely advertising-driven. That's appreciated by all of our clients and obviously by our audiences. And I couldn't be happier with our transition from Farid who is an incredible entrepreneur who deserves all the credit for founding and building and driving Tubi to-date. It's always a difficult transition when you move to -- from a founder to new leadership. So far it's early days but Anjali's very focused on all the issues and all the opportunities that Tubi has in front of it to continue it to grow at impressive levels. But Tubi is our free AVOD streaming service that does not -- it's not our only strategy in the streaming space. Direct-to-consumer is obviously something that we look at closely. We have a small direct-to-consumer SVOD service in Fox Nation and we have optionality of expanding those services further into news and potentially sports. I hope I answered most of your questions Jessica.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, next question please.\nOperator: The next question is from John Hodulik from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Hodulik: Great. Morning everyone. First can we just get an update on the affiliate renewal process? I think you guys had said that it would be more weighted on the TV side but I think a lot of the new agreements kick in in January. So, just any color on the trends we should see there. And then getting back to the Charter Disney renewal, you guys seem to be somewhat unique in that you don't really have any long-tail networks or I would say a major SVOD platform. Lockwood you talked about Fox Nation but it's obviously very different than what we're seeing in the rest of the industry. Just any thoughts on the implications for Fox is this model that we've seen out of this renewal and it would be broadly adopted over time for the industry?\nLachlan Murdoch: Thanks John. On affiliate renewal, let me start with the big picture and Steve can talk to any of the numbers going forward or not depending on -- but look the main thing on affiliate renewal is we -- really due to our focus strategy our focus on our core brands. Also I think our focus on being good partners with our distributors and wanting their businesses to succeed because frankly from a FOX perspective the Cable bundle Cable distribution or Pay TV distribution remains our largest and really the most important revenue stream. And that we believe that it will remain our largest for years to come. So, we are -- we feel the success of our distribution partners is our success as well. We want them to succeed and we want them to do well which is one reason why we've kept our premium content within the cable bundle. We are not interested in at this stage moving premium content away from our cable distribution partners. That would be I think a mistake for us and for them. And so due to that, since our last call a quarter ago, we have renewed a number of distribution contracts. And in every case, we've been rewarded by that focus, rewarded by our partnerships, with our affiliate partners, our distribution partners, with our rate increases and distribution agreements that are -- that fit absolutely in line with our plan. And that's because they value our brands. They value Fox News. They value Fox Sports. And obviously our local stations and networks. So we are very pleased with our pace of renewals. And we haven't seen any changes to the way we're able to work constructively with our partners. And that goes to the second part of your question with Charter and Disney. It's hard for me to say how -- I don't want to talk about other people -- a lot of people are -- have their earnings calls next week. I think we're early in the media cycle. They can talk about how that renewal affects them and particularly the entertainment channels for us, because we're not in that space. I think it's a net positive. We like to see our partners focus on the core brands the core brands where all the audiences and frankly where the leverage is in terms of retransmission and less so on channels that might not be as popular. So Steve, do you want to...\nSteve Tomsic: Yeah. So John just to reinforce Lachlan's point, we had -- just over third of our distribution renewals due this fiscal year and we're virtually through all of that. So that's -- and as Lachlan mentioned, we've achieved our pricing objectives against those renewals which goes to a, the fact that we haven't gone back with any distributors and the fact that we've been able to achieve objectives. And assuming the distributors are also happy those renewals. It goes to a constructive relationship. We have with those distributors. And so listen, we negotiate our full portfolio as a bundle. And I think you should expect to see that coming into the new calendar year you'll see the impact of those renewals and I suspect that the benefit of those will be skewed towards the Television segment but you should also expect to see some progress on the cable side in the new calendar year, I should say.\nGabrielle Brown: Operator, we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhil Cusick: Hi. Thanks. A lot has been asked, but Lachlan, thinking about your comments on DR and recognizing that some of those upfront issues hopefully fade. But it makes me curious about your view on the future of the linear video ad landscape you have Tubi which allows you to benefit from the shift to digital. But do you think we've reached a tipping point where linear video advertising is it secular not just cyclical decline? Thank you.\nSteve Tomsic: Thank you, Phil. The short answer is we got to you have to I think break it up by category, right? And so if we look at Sports and News there's no sign of a slowdown in sort of demand for the really incredible and unique reach that those platforms deliver our advertising clients. I think on the DR issue is a specific issue that really relates to upfront before last we're -- there was a -- due to the negotiating strategy of some of our competitors there was an oversupply of direct response in the market and that's driven pricing down. And we see -- we didn't see the same activity in this past upfront. And so we expect the pricing pressure on DR to ameliorate or wash out in the coming quarters. So we do see that as a shorter-term problem and not a structural problem at all. And so it comes back to particularly in News and Sports, there is no other content or platform that offers the reach that those categories offer. And so we are optimistic is not a strong enough word. We are very confident in the future of linear advertising when you can deliver and the audiences that we deliver with the brands and the brand safety that we also can offer our clients.\nGabrielle Brown: At this point, we are out of time. But if you have any further questions, please give me or Dan Carey a call. Thank you once again for joining today.\nSteve Tomsic: Thank you everyone. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for using AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."
