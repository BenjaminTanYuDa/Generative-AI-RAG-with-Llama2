With respect to such forward-looking statements, the company seeks protections afforded by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These risks include a variety of factors, including competitive developments and risk factors listed from time to time in the company's SEC reports and public releases. Those lists are intended to identify certain principal factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements, but are not intended to represent a complete list of all risks and uncertainties inherent to the company's business. I would now like to introduce Mr. Raju Vegesna, Chairman of Sify Technologies. Chairman?\nRaju Vegesna: Thank you, Praveen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call. A combination of pro-industry regulatory initiatives in India and encouraging investment climate and a lot of skilled human capital are the factors that continues to dominate enterprise business strategies for India. Business leaders are united in their view that India is central to their growth plans and are aggressively ramping up their local investments. Let me bring in Kamal, our CEO, to expand our -- some of the business highlights for the last past quarter. Kamal?\nKamal Nath: Yes. Thank you, Raju. As enterprises pursue their digital transformation and digitalization objectives, they are also recalibrating their digital infrastructure across hybrid cloud, network, security and edge infrastructures. Customer experience, business continuity, cybersecurity, application modernization and overall adoption of AI models are the prime drivers for this recalibration. Our infrastructure investments and services portfolio are fundamentally aligned to meet the customer goals. Simultaneously, we are continuously engaged with our customers to identify their specific needs and selectively recalibrating our propositions to support the same. Let me now expand on the business highlights for the quarter. The revenue split between the businesses for the quarter was: Data Center Colocation Services at 32%, Digital Services at 28% and Network Services at 40%. As on 31st December 2023, Sify has deployed 6,920 contracted SD-WAN service points across the country. Sify provides services via 974 fiber nodes across the country, a 15% increase, respectively, over the same quarter last year. This quarter, Sify invested USD 0.15 million in startups in the Silicon Valley area as part of our corporate venture capital initiative. To date, the cumulative investment stands at USD 7.22 million. A detailed list of our key wins is recorded in our press release, now live on our website. Let me bring in Vijay, our Executive Director and Group CFO, to elaborate on the financial highlights for the quarter. Vijay?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Thank you, Kamal. Wish you all a very happy 2024. Let me briefly present to you the financial performance for the third quarter of financial year 2023-'24. Revenue was INR 8,659 million, a decrease of 3% over the same quarter last year. EBITDA was INR 1,689 million, an increase of 4% over the same quarter last year. Loss before tax was INR 20 million and after tax was INR 14 million. These are compared to a net profit in the same quarter last year with a substantially higher depreciation on account of ongoing infrastructure expansion projects and interest cost. Capital expenditure during the quarter was INR 1,087 million. We continue to invest in adding more data center capacity, extending our network footprint and skilling our people on new tools. These investments are being made ahead of the curve and will reflect on our net profit for the near future. The interest on compulsory convertible debentures raised in our data center subsidiary for data center expansion has been accounted partly as equity in accordance with the GAAP and is recognized as expense in the statement of income. The cash balance at the end of quarter was INR 6,037 million. I will now hand over to our Chairman for his closing remarks. Chairman?\nRaju Vegesna: Thank you, Vijay Kumar. As you can see, our investments, both in capital and resources are backed by our belief that the market is just warming up to our services. There is still a lot of runway, and we have the right portfolio of services. We just have to accelerate our engagements. Thank you for joining us on this call. I will now hand over to the operator for any questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Greg Burns with Sidoti & Company.\nGreg Burns: Could you just give us an update on your current data center capacity? How much -- how many maybe megawatts of capacity you might have added in the quarter and what your road map is for the rest of 2024?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Yes. We have data center operational capacity across 6 cities and 11 facilities of about 100 megawatt. And this quarter, that is January 2024, we will be making another 38-megawatt facility operational. Apart from this, there are 2 other greenfield data center projects at Delhi and Chennai, which will go live in quarter 1 of fiscal '24-'25. In Phase 1, both of them will have a design capacity of about 26 megawatt each.\nGreg Burns: So the 38 megawatts in -- is that in Mumbai? I think that's going to go -- that will go online in this fiscal fourth quarter?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Yes, it's going live January 2024 this month.\nGreg Burns: And I guess with this capacity coming live, do you expect to see a little bit better operating or earnings leverage next year now that you're going to start generating some revenue off of some of these investments you've been making?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Yes, you're right. It should happen.\nGreg Burns: And then the decline in digital services this quarter, was that mainly driven by the technology integration services? Was it just timing of projects? Is there anything else going on there that we should take note of?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Two things. One is, it is timing of the existing projects in terms of effective handover to the customer. And second is a change in -- a conscious change in the profile of the technology integration services project, where the focus is largely on projects where there is services component, which is significant.\nGreg Burns: So given that change is -- are you just becoming more selective? Should we -- how will that, I guess, translate into the P&L? Just lower growth, more selective higher-margin projects, is that what you're looking for now?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Yes. So it would basically mean less of pass-through projects and more of services projects, which should be higher-margin projects.\nGreg Burns: And then with the Kotak investment, how much have you drawn down on that? And how much remains available to you?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: We have drawn down a total of INR 1,000 crores, out of which INR 400 crores has been deployed for projects we have executed in the last couple of years. INR 600 crores is meant for new projects, which we are picking up. And as per the arrangement, we are entitled to draw another INR 600 crores anytime up to October 2026.\nGreg Burns: And then you mentioned some industry regulations, positive industry regulations for you. I think one of those was the data security or data privacy regulation. Could you give us an update on that and maybe some other -- any other pro industry regulations that you might have been referencing in your prepared remarks?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Yes. So it is essentially the Data Protection Act, which is a material development. Apart from that, all the regulators have been encouraging enterprises to host their data within the country. And there is also an encouragement towards hosting these in clouds which are set up outside of their premises. So most of the banks or insurance companies are developing their digital transformation strategies to host in clouds, which are largely private clouds, hosted with data center providers like us.\nGreg Burns: The -- what is the status of the Data Protection Act? Is it near the point of getting passed? Or is it -- I guess -- sorry. Where is it in the process of being passed?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: The law is live. The law is live as we speak. What is pending is the regulations relating to implementation of the law, which should hopefully come in the coming months.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no questions in queue.\nRaju Vegesna: Thank you for your time on this call. We look forward to interacting with you through the year. Thank you very much.\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Thank you, Olly.\nKamal Nath: Thank you.\nRaju Vegesna: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

I would now like to introduce my Chairman, Mr. Raju Vegesna. Chairman?\nRaju Vegesna: Thank you, Praveen. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on the call. India's data policy is entering into the final phase of being adopted into the law. This will give a shape and clarity of our data localization and formalization regulations around the data security, which will help accelerate investments in India's data center land. This will also lead to India being viewed as a more viable interconnect point between Asia and Middle East by international connectivity players. Enterprise is continuously exploring digital transformation and government entities looking into automate the scale. Social welfare system will be important target audience for Sify's digital transformation tools [technical difficulty]. Let me now bring Kamal, our CEO, to expand some of the business highlights in the past quarter. Kamal?\nKamal Nath: Yes. Thank you, Raju. As enterprises pursue their digital transformation and digitalization objectives, they are also recalibrating their digital infrastructure across the cloud network security and EDGE infrastructures. Our customer experience, business continuity, cybersecurity, application modernization and overall adoption of AI models are the prime drivers for this recalibration. Our infrastructure investments and services portfolio are fundamentally aligned to meet the customer goals.

Let me now expand on the business highlights for the quarter. The revenue split between the businesses for the quarter was data center colocation services at 31%, digital services at 28% and network services at 41%. During the quarter, Sify added 1.2 megawatt of new data center capacity. As on September 30, 2023, Sify has deployed 6531 SDWAN service points across the country. Sify now provide services via 952 fiber nodes across the country, a 14% increase over the same quarter last year. During the quarter, Sify invested USD 1.5 million in startups in the Silicon Valley area as part of our corporate venture capital initiative. To date, the cumulative investment stands at USD 7.07 million. A detailed list of our key wins is recorded in our press release, now live on our website. Let me bring in Vijay, our Executive Director and Group CFO to elaborate on the financial highlights for the quarter. Vijay?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Thank you, Kamal. Good morning, everyone. Let me briefly print the financial performance for the second quarter of financial year 2023-2024. Revenue was INR 8,791 million, an increase of 11% over the same quarter last year. EBITDA was INR 1,519 million, a nominal increase of 1% over the same quarter last year. Profit before tax was INR 52 million, a decrease of 76% versus the same quarter last year. Profit after tax was INR 15 million, a decrease of 87% versus the same quarter last year. Capital expenditure during the quarter was INR 1,797 million. We continue to make substantial investment in capacity creation across data centers and network expansion and people to build skill sets for IT services opportunities we foresee given the digital transformation engagements that India Inc. is actively pursuing. This has led to the accompanying depreciation and interest cost reflecting on our net profit. We are also actively scaling up on our sustainable measures across all businesses, especially our data centers. The cash balance at the end of the quarter was INR 7,570 million. I will now hand over to our Chairman for his closing remarks. Chairman?\nRaju Vegesna: Thank you, Vijay. Enterprises in India are aggressively pursuing digital transformation model for their businesses. In their search for partners, they'll look for service providers who will bring a value proposition to the table. Our converged ecosystem and our digitally enabled services are evolving to be the answer to most of their business needs. So we have a great opportunity across India. And now that's the way we are looking at Thank you joining us on this call. I will now hand over to operator for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Jon Atkin at RBC Capital Markets.\nJonathan Atkin: Thanks very much. I wondered if you could talk a little bit about AI demand in India? And anything that you're seeing differently than three months ago, six months ago in terms of overall demand into the market? And then what implications it has for maybe your capital deployment going forward and your strategy for taking advantage of that demand? Thank you.\nRaju Vegesna: Hi John, this is Raju. So to answer, I'll make it into two sections. One, if you look at AI/ML adoption in India, it is every discussions we are having with any enterprises or even in the government, there is a talk about AI/ML adoption in their businesses, enterprises. So that is given. Either you look at it how they want to run their network operation, how they want to run their digital services, how they want to run the data centers? So every discussion has AI/ML opportunities are there and that is the way that customers are looking at how do you adapt AI/ML will be useful for their business. Second, the AI/ML, what we are seeing is the - because the growth of the AI/ML, what we see the capacity required for the data centers also, we are seeing the uptick in the market. So I think it's good for Sify for both our Digital Services and even network infrastructure point of view, and then also our data center expansion. So overall, in India that AI/ML is an important topic. And every customer is interested how they can adapt AI/ML tools and technology across the board.\nJonathan Atkin: To the extent that you are going to directly try to meet that demand by providing capacity for large language models and so forth, I wondered what implications that might have for your capital budget and even your design given in times the higher density - the higher rack density requirements that one off and associates with these requirements?\nRaju Vegesna: All over data centers, especially the new ones are acute to support higher density racks. And also, we also have a lot of the data center capacity is going to be available. So we are in a very good position to take the AI ML uptick either coming from a hyperscaler or even in Indian enterprises market. So we - that is one of the considerations outlook. And we invested across our data center and our network infrastructure.\nJonathan Atkin: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next is coming from Greg Burns at Sidoti & Company.\nGregory Burns: Good morning. Could you just update us on your road map for the new data centers, how much capacity you plan to bring online over the next year and the timing of that?\nRaju Vegesna: One is - Greg, is we will not forecast a lot of the things. But as we expanded before, we are bringing substantial capacity in Mumbai market, and we are bringing substantial capacity in our North India Noida market. And also, we are bringing in our Chennai market. And we are also expanding - this is - it is going to be available in the next six months in the market, all these capacity. And the remaining things we are investing in our Hyderabad and Bangalore [plans also]. So we are investing in all the five markets in India.\nGregory Burns: Okay. How much capacity is in the next six months, the Mumbai, Noida, Chennai, how much extra capacity does that bring online?\nRaju Vegesna: See the capacity, there are two phases, right? One is physical location, other is availability of the non-IT infrastructure. So we have - we will have probably a capacity a lot of 10 to 12 megawatts within the next six months. And - but we are capable of expanding to --we have - our facilities are capable of expanding between these three locations more than 100 megawatts.\nGregory Burns: Okay. Okay. So more than 100 megawatts total, but the 10 to 12 you mentioned is what?\nRaju Vegesna: So you build it by demand.\nGregory Burns: Okay. Got it. Okay.\nRaju Vegesna: You build it in phases. Campuses are and then you build it what is required by demand, right?\nGregory Burns: Okay. So you have demand or you've sold 10 to 12 megawatts of that 100-megawatt capacity. Is that...\nRaju Vegesna: Yes, that either it's sold or being sold. Some of the things we've build ahead of schedule and so that's the way we look at it.\nGregory Burns: Okay. All right. EBITDA was a little bit lower, and I was looking for this quarter, I guess SG&A rose a little bit more than expected. So could you just talk about what's driving that growth in SG&A? Is that a good level to model off of going forward? And I guess the EBITDA margin was down because of it this quarter. So is that - is this a good level to think about for the business? Or do you expect that to increase as maybe some of the revenue on these new investments?\nRaju Vegesna: One is we are doing the new investment. And also, our Digital Services, we are substantially getting that thing under the track. So we are investing in our manpower and other activities. So to make it all three independent businesses especially can grow, growing fast. So we are making some forward costs and investments in these areas. That's the reason why our SG&A is high. And probably you are seeing this bump substantially reinvested, but I think it will be - over the time, it will be proportional to our revenues.\nGregory Burns: Okay. Okay. And then the debt level, does that include all of the Kotak investment? Or has any part of that been reclassified as equity?\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Till date. And we have to draw additional money anytime April [technical difficulty] and before 2026 October.\nGregory Burns: Okay. And lastly, the Digital Services was up 25% in the quarter. What was the primary driver of that growth?\nRaju Vegesna: Like I said, we - once we separated our Digital Services, and we are putting a lot of focus, and we have - the way I'll describe the Digital Services, if you take our two infrastructure investments, network and Data Center Colo, our network managed services, our cloud, our application, digital managed services, all three, we are seeing a growth. So we are investing continuously on that all the areas. There is no one major deals can say separated. Overall, we see the growth, and we are putting a lot of effort to make that business to grow enough.\nGregory Burns: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Raju Vegesna for any closing remarks.\nRaju Vegesna: [Thank you] for your time on this call, and we look forward to interacting with you through the year. Thank you.\nM. P. Vijay Kumar: Thank you, Holly.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
