        "content": "Nate Melihercik: Good morning and good afternoon. Welcome to Logitech’s Video Call to discuss our Financial Results for the Third Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. Joining us today are Hanneke Faber, our CEO; and Chuck Boynton, our CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including with respect to future operating results under the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We are making these statements based on our views only as of today, and our actual results could differ materially. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. We will also discuss our non-GAAP financial results, and you can find a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results and information about our use of non-GAAP measures and factors that could impact our financial results and forward-looking statements in our press release and in our filings with the SEC. These materials, as well as the shareholder letter and a webcast of this call, are all available at the Investor Relations page of our website. We encourage you to review these materials carefully. Unless noted otherwise, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency and net sales. This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay on our website. I’ll now turn the call over to Hanneke. Hanneke?\nHanneke Faber: Thank you, Nate, and welcome everyone. I'm very excited to be here today for my first earnings call at Logitech. Now, you've probably noticed that this quarter we introduced a new document as part of our earnings material, a shareholder letter. This letter is intended to be a comprehensive review of our quarterly results and includes commentary that previously would've been covered at the beginning of the call. So today, after brief opening remarks, we will move directly into Q&A. Now, let's move on to this quarter. Our team delivered really solid results in the third quarter, and I am proud of the products innovation, the share gains, the operational discipline, and a prudent financial management throughout the quarter, resulting in really healthy gross margins and exceptional cash flow generation. Our disciplined execution, tightly managing costs and promotional spend drove a 22% increase in our operating margin. That is tremendous work by all of our teams, but we will not be satisfied, of course, until we return to top line growth, which will be a gradual process. As we look forward, I am delighted with Logitech's positioning. Our portfolio is designed to take advantage of indisputable trends in hybrid work, video conferencing, gaming, and content creation and disruptive technologies like AI will provide additional opportunities for us. As we work our way back to growth, we have demonstrated consistent disciplined operational excellence that builds a highly cash generative P&L, and a very strong balance sheet. This discipline, coupled with an innovation engine that introduces new products at a global scale, drives our market leadership across multiple categories. I've spent the last two months visiting with our employees, partners, customers, and shareholders. It's been a really exciting time for me, and I am as optimistic about Logitech's future as when I joined on day one. We will be hosting an Analyst and Investor Day later this spring, and I'll provide you with a more detailed perspective on our strategy and our approach to capital allocation then. Additionally, we will then provide our outlook for fiscal year 2025. I really look forward to seeing you all at that event. Thank you, again, and let me turn it to Chuck to discuss the numbers. Chuck?\nChuck Boynton: Thank you, Hanneke. Thank you all for joining us on the call today. You've seen our detailed financial results in the press release and shareholder letter, but I'd like to highlight three metrics this quarter that really stand out. First, our gross margins of 42.3% were better-than-expected year-over-year due to lower product and logistics costs, reduced promotional activities specifically in North America. Second, we've spoken for several quarters about our focus on driving lean operations. For the seventh consecutive quarter, we reduced on-hand inventory, and this quarter it was down 44% year-over-year with our inventory turns hitting 6.5. And finally, in Q3, we delivered $443 million of operating cash flow, one of our best ever. This was driven by an improvement in the cash conversion cycle and strong operating margins. We are updating our outlook for the full year. We are now expecting revenues of $4.2 billion to $4.25 billion, up from $4 billion to $4.15 billion. Our operating income is expected to be between $610 million and $660 million, up from $525 million to $575 million. One final note regarding fiscal year 2025. If you look at our last four quarters, as well as the midpoint of our fiscal ‘24 outlook, you will see the declines in our net sales have moderated. Looking ahead to fiscal ‘25, we do not anticipate an inflection point in the slope of this curve, while the rate of our net sales declines has improved, there are a number of headwinds and uncertainties that may impact our net sales throughout fiscal ‘25. Thank you to all of our employees for the hard work and impressive execution. With that, Nate, let's move on to Q&A.\nA - Nate Melihercik : [Operator Instructions] And with that, we'll start with Samik Chatterjee at J.P Morgan.\nSamik Chatterjee : Congrats on the robust results here. Maybe just to -- Chuck, just to start with your ending comment there about the headwinds you're thinking of for fiscal ‘25, maybe just fresh that out a bit more for us in terms of, I mean, obviously, there's been improvement in the pace of declines or moderate those declines, but why shouldn't the slope sort of carry you back into growth? What are the headwinds you're thinking of? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nChuck Boynton : Yes, that's a really good question. We thought very hard about what next year's going to look like. And if you look at the fundamentals of our business, they're very strong right now. We feel really good about the execution. If you look at this last quarter in Q3, a lot of it was driven by really strong discipline on pricing and promotional activity. The baseline business in Q3 outside of the promotional windows was a little softer than what we would've thought. The promotional windows were incredibly strong with great pricing discipline, but the overall pace of the run rate business was a little soft. And if you look forward into Q4, the midpoint of our outlook for the year would indicate a 1% decline in Q4. Now, the high-end of our outlook would imply a little bit of growth in Q4. If you look into next year, there's just so much uncertainty around will there be rate cuts in the U.S., the macro situation globally, whether it's in China or Middle East or Europe. And so, we're taking a cautious approach to next year. And as we look out, we're confident this is a great business, profitable, strong margins. As Hanneke said in her comment, it makes sense. It's if not when. But if you just look at the overall market, we just think that we don't want to be have people get too optimistic about what next year's going to look like given these overall headwinds in the geopolitical situation.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hanneke, if I can, I know it's early days in your role, but as you sort of looked at across the customer base, particularly if you look at them as enterprise versus consumer, and you think about the sort of next couple of years, where do you see the bigger opportunities? Where are we more likely to return to growth in which customer segment faster than the other? Just share your thoughts on that, please.\nHanneke Faber : I see opportunities everywhere when it comes to our customer base. So, we're really, really strong in retail, and you saw that over the holiday period. Just great execution in store after store whether it was here in the U.S. or in Europe or in Asia. We also have grown online a lot with our e-retail customers. And then of course, there's B2B and we're newer to the B2B business. But the opportunity there is gargantuan. So many meeting rooms that are not yet enabled with video. And as that corporate spending comes back, I think we're really well positioned with products that are fantastic, easy to use, great value for that B2B segment. Opportunity everywhere. B2B is a little newer to us, but I'm quite bullish on that.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from George Wang at Barclays.\nGeorge Wang : Just two quick ones. Firstly, can you talk about kind of gross margin, the December quarter was super strong and any thoughts on kind of outlook going forward 4Q and FY ’25? And that kind as it relates to sort of the long-term model of 39% to 44%, just curious kind of any thoughts on kind of modeling for the margin going forward?\nChuck Boynton : No change to our long-term model. We believe the 39% to 44% is the right range. This past quarter was stronger than we'd expected. 42.3% gross margins. We'd expected somewhere in the 38% to 39%. So, we were really pleasantly surprised at the results for the quarter. The real drivers, if you look overall kind of year-over-year, it was roughly in line. If you look at it -- or sorry, quarter-over-quarter is roughly in line. Year-over-year, we saw pretty good margin expansion. That's really driven by a couple of factors. One, we did a great job on the operations side, getting product costs down. Logistics costs certainly benefited all the industry participants with lower shipping and freight costs. And that was the big primary driver. And then, of course, the great execution, primarily in Americas on pricing and promotions led to about 100 basis point improvement. So I'd call it overall about 400 basis points benefit on product and shipping costs, lower promotional spend led to higher margins and offset a little bit by mix that we had forecasted.\nGeorge Wang: Got it. Just a quick follow-up, if I can. I just want to double-click on the gaming seems very strong, kind of being better-than-expected for the last couple of quarters. Just maybe you can give more color just on the gaming peripherals. And kind of maybe if you can pass out within gaming kind of for any particular areas are doing a little bit better, mice keyboards, gaming headsets, no one now. Just because the gaming traditionally kind of short is the refresh cycle versus other PC-related peripherals. So maybe you are seeing kind of the COVID cohorts that started refreshing maybe could potentially drive the results higher. Just curious if you can kind of double-click on the gaming category.\nChuck Boynton: Yes, certainly. I can go first, Hanneke. So the gaming, as you know, covers many different categories. We saw particular strength in simulation in our steering wheels, a really, really good quarter. Overall go-to-market was impressive, how we promoted and discounted. If you contrast that to a year ago, the teams were very disciplined in what products they promoted and which channels. As Hanneke mentioned, retail was really, really strong. That led to better margins and better revenue. The PC segment, we have a really, really strong position with mice and keyboards in that PC segment, we gained some share. Console was a little bit off that we have a new product out that's really, really exciting. The A50 that was released kind of just at the end of the holiday. So we didn't quite see the sales on the console side. It's a very, very competitive category. But we feel like the future looks bright in console, although it is very competitive. But the areas that we generate higher margins, mice and simulation, incredibly strong. Other parts, maybe not quite as strong, but will help on the way with new products. Anything you want to add, Hanneke?\nHanneke Faber : Now I think long-term, again, I'm super optimistic about gaming as a big growing category. It used to be focused on pretty narrow audiences, younger male but that continues to explode with more females gaming, with older people gaming, with gaming as a way to connect socially. So, a category where all the macros are in favor. And then with our strong execution and our strong innovation, I think we look really good in that space.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Asiya Merchant at Citi.\nAsiya Merchant: If you could just dial into a little bit on the growth stuff. I understand there are macro headwinds, but it seems like on the PC side, things have turned around a little bit. We're starting to see some recovery. Maybe you can talk us on the -- maybe you feel a little bit better about the PC peripherals. And what would it take to kind of get back into your kind of target model that was laid out at the analyst event last time, both in terms of gross margins as well as the top-line growth?\nChuck Boynton: So if you think about the long-term model, I'll talk long-term first. So, we have a target long-term financial model of 8% to 10% growth. One key tenet in there is M&A. We've been light on M&A the last couple of years. And I would expect us to do more over the next couple of years, not right away, but I would expect us to do more over the next couple of years. And that will be an important part of getting back to that 8% to 10% growth. Another key tenet of our ability to return to growth and get to higher levels of growth is rationalization of the corporate office footprint. If you look at what's happened in the headlines this past quarter, North American vacancies have approached 20%. And so corporates are still looking at their overall real estate footprint and how they want to outfit rooms. The TAM is enormous, the installed base is relatively small. There will be an upgrade cycle of that installed base to new modern tech like ours, and there will be greenfield deployments that will grow. So, if you look out 10 years, it makes perfect sense that every conference room will be video enabled. It's just hard to say what's going to happen over one year or two years. So I think this is another thing like Hanneke mentioned, if not when, it's unclear what that deployment cycle will look like. And then lastly, on the B2B side, companies like ours are looking at their IT budgets, carefully controlling things like CapEx and spend, they're prioritizing things like AI and cybersecurity absolutely employee productivity and office room fit-outs are going to happen, but they're more discretionary IT spend versus mandatory and so I think the economy needs to improve a little bit potential rate cuts maybe more confidence in the future on the corporate side. The consumer right now is quite strong. And so I think overall, I feel really good about our positioning. But overall, enterprise, B2B office rationalization and then to hit the longer-term rates, a little bit of M&A sprinkled in there as well.\nAsiya Merchant: And then when you think about gross margins also in that target range, I know you guys are obviously at 40%, feel really good about that. Just if you could talk a little bit about getting to kind of even the midpoint of your gross margins of the 39% to 44%.\nChuck Boynton: Well, we were really close to that midpoint this past quarter at 42.3%. So, I feel really good about this quarter and last quarter. We did have a couple of one-timers this quarter. So, if you look overall at the impressive inventory reductions that we achieved. We drove down inventory more than $80 million decrease quarter-over-quarter in inventory. When inventories come down, good things happen. And we saw that again this quarter with things like E&O releases because effectively, as you reduce inventory, you have to reserve less inventory. And so, we saw benefits there that will not recur. We don't expect inventories to come down. They could actually grow a little bit in Q4 with the Suez Canal challenges. But overall, if you look at where we think margins will be in Q4, it's our trough quarter, so there's less overhead absorption. So it's a little bit of a headwind on a quarter-over-quarter compare. And then we also have this additional freight challenges. So, I think overall, we'll have maybe the low-end of that target range in Q4. And I would expect it to be in that overall operating model on average over next year. Will it be at the high-end? It's possible, low-end is possible. So I think a lot of it will just depend on how next year unfolds from a consumer sentiment standpoint and enterprise demand standpoint.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Erik Woodring at Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: Maybe if we start, Chuck, I'm going to pick on gross margins again, just because they were so impressive. And I guess maybe my question is, last quarter, we had talked about them being in the 38% to 39% range. You obviously did more than 42%. So, I guess where -- was there something that outperformed your expectations that you didn't necessarily foresee 90 days ago? I'm just trying to pick up on that because as I would think that generally, when it comes to component costs, you kind of have a lock on that 90-days ahead of the quarter. And so I'm just trying to understand where the biggest delta was between your expectations and how you actually materially outperformed? And if I could weave in, as we look to the fiscal fourth quarter, we have historically generally seen gross margin expansion despite the loss of revenue leverage, less promotions, a little bit more B2B mix than consumer mix. And so why should we think about gross margins coming down so much sequentially? Maybe I'll start with that and then I have a follow-up.\nChuck Boynton: Yes, Erik, really, really good question. And so first of all, this past -- in the last few quarters, we brought our inventory down significantly. When you bring this inventory number down, you release reserves. So there are some benefits that we've seen quarter-over-quarter, the last couple of quarters, quite frankly, on bringing inventory levels down. Those are kind of more one-time in nature. What is durable, the great work that our operations team has done to reduce product costs. That has been a real, real benefit overall to the company and that is durable. That we'll see those benefits throughout next year. So, I thank our team, Prakash and his team did such a great job on product costs. Shipping and logistics, that was a real tailwind, better than we had expected. Now that's reversing. So if you look at what's happening now with shipping rates, they're going back up again, fairly material on the ocean. We also expect because of these disruptions to have to do more air. And while we don't want to, we don't want stock outs, we have a customer-first mentality. The first thing is take care of the customer. So we will eat some margin to take care of customer satisfaction. So, air shipping, higher ocean rates, that's just a reality of where things are right now from a shipping standpoint. Is that transitory? Is that going to last throughout the year? I can't predict. But that is a headwind going into Q4. And then the overall leverage that you mentioned, that's just straight math. And if you have a peak quarter to trough quarter, there is an impact. If you look at the impact, you said last year, you saw margin expansion. That was primarily because of a fairly poor Q3 last year. So that was a I think that we over discounted and drove less volume in Q3 a year ago. And our global commercial teams just really executed so well this past quarter in pricing discipline. And Erik, we had talked about that on the last few calls, we were set up with our retailers and e-tailers. We had really gone through the promotional plans and the account planning and our teams on the ground just landed such a great quarter from a promotional standpoint. So I think that 38% to 40% gross margin, if you do the math and you deduct what is the range for Q4, it's roughly 38% to 40%. Mid-point to high-end is doable. At the low-end, it'd be more air shipping. So I think we're set up for a really strong fiscal Q4. But these uncertainties on the freight and logistics side are what gives us kind of pause at this point in time.\nErik Woodring: Okay. Very fair. And then I don't know if this is properly posed to you or to Hanneke, but you bought back more stock this quarter than I think any quarter over the last 10 years. You also reduced CapEx relative to your prior expectations. So are you guys maybe signaling a change in your capital allocation priorities? And why not as you're kind of striving to get back to growth, realize the macro is a big factor here. But maybe why not utilize the excess cash you generated to lean into CapEx and whether that's more product launches or better expansion or whatever it might be. But why not kind of lean into that CapEx to maybe help get you back to that kind of target growth range a little easier, faster, however you might think about it? And that's it for me.\nChuck Boynton: That’s a really good question there. I'll talk in a little more detail, Hanneke, and maybe you want to talk about our capital allocation strategy at a higher level. First of all, on CapEx, I would not read into that. CapEx itself at this point is down, but don't read into that. That's just operating discipline. We are very, very focused on driving efficiency and spend. We will invest for growth. Growth is our top priority. It's how we invest in our capital allocation model. And then overall, if you think of the buybacks, we set -- in the beginning of the quarter, we saw the cash numbers improving, getting better and better and better. And so what we did is we decided to increase the buyback given how great of a cash quarter we had. We generated $443 million of operating cash flow, one of our best quarters ever. And when we saw that data coming in, we decided to increase the buybacks to return more capital to shareholders. But don't read into the CapEx spending because it will go back up next year. We’ve done very little M&A. We have invested heavily in the business. We will definitely invest and prioritize investments in technology to drive long-term growth. So don't read into the CapEx reduction as being a -- we're pulling back. We are focused on driving growth. It's really more operational discipline. Hanneke, do you want to talk about the high-level capital allocation strategy?\nHanneke Faber : Yes, sure. And let me first just confirm what you just said. I mean, we will make the right CapEx investments into the future. And we're looking at those for next year right now. So don't take this as we're pulling back on CapEx. In terms of our long-term capital allocation strategy, that really hasn't changed at the top of the list, paying a good dividend. Number two, M&A when the right thing comes along, we are definitely always looking, and then only number three, returning cash to shareholders in the form of buybacks.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Juergen Wagner at Stifel.\nJuergen Wagner : Hanneke, my first question would be to you. Now that you are 60 days at Logitech, can you say or can you share already some thoughts, what needs to be addressed or what you need to do differently? And as a follow-up, you mentioned M&A as the second priority. When would you be in a position to become more active again?\nHanneke Faber : Juergen, thank you. Very nice to meet you. I'm 60 days in. So it's a little early to say anything about anything. And so I'll say upfront, we have an Investor Day planned for May, where we'll come out with much more detail. But I'll give you a few first impressions. This is a really good company would be my top line impression. We're really well positioned for future growth with the spaces that the portfolio is in. So hybrid work, gaming and video conferencing, all are good places, good neighborhoods to play in. Then we have fantastic and I've been so impressed as I've onboarded with our product, our engineering and our design capabilities. That allows us to innovate, and that will allow us to win going forward. Another few things that I've been impressed with is the brand, a really solid global brand. But that also brings me to an opportunity. We probably have a opportunity to make that brand truly iconic, take it from good to great, if you will. And then finally, a nice mix of B2B and B2C. We touched on that earlier. And the last thing would be this company really is a sustainability pioneer in tech, which is great to see and something we'll definitely -- we'll want to continue to be. So I would say, all of those things we’ll want to keep and cherish and leverage to drive growth going forward. There probably are a few things I would change as well, but it may be too early to talk about those right now. And when it comes to M&A, again, details much too early, but an important part of our capital allocation strategy.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Ananda Baruah at Loop.\nAnanda Baruah: So, I guess just real quick on the -- Chuck, on the long-term growth model, you mentioned, I think you said high-single digits. I guess the question is and you mentioned M&A as being a meaningful contributor to that. So, I guess the question is, is that high-single digits organic? Can you talk to that yet over time? Or is that high-single digits with the M&A and sort of in the organic TBD? And then I have a quick follow-up.\nChuck Boynton: Yes, thank you. That -- the 8% to 10% is -- basically that number is derived from the historical growth rates pre-pandemic. Obviously, the pandemic if you -- it's 70-ish percent growth. So you got to kind of take those years out. But that's really the average growth rate for the 10 years pre-pandemic. Some years, it was 4%, some years it was 14%, but it averaged in that 8% to 10% range. That included, importantly, many key acquisitions. We're very good at M&A. We find the right companies. We exploit that technology. And if you look at what we're great at, we have these global distribution channels at scale. So we can go buy companies, plug them into our work and exploit that technology. We have an operations team that can drive product costs down and do a really good job. And as Hanneke mentioned, this iconic brand. So, I think we have this great machine that can plug companies in. So the 8% to 10% is accounts M&A, that's part of the formula for sure. But there's nothing planned in the short-term horizon. Hanneke is brand new. We're working on the strategy. So I wouldn't expect any big announcements anytime soon. But it's an important part of the long-term growth rate, nor are we predicting to get back to that rate anytime soon. This is a long-term financial model. The part that we are executing on today is the gross margins of 39% to 44%, keeping OpEx at roughly 25% and generating a very healthy operating income. That is right now, that's today, we feel very good about that. A couple of quarters ago, we said that was six or eight quarters out, we're very excited about executing on that part of the long-term financial model today. But overall, growth is the focus. We just want to be cautious going into next year, and then we'll talk at Analyst Day more about the model and our thoughts on M&A and whatnot. But yes, 8% to 10% is not organic. It's organic plus M&A and M&A is a key part of that.\nAnanda Baruah: Got it. That sounds super helpful. And I have just a clarification quickly, and then I have a quick follow-up question. When you say next year, we're talking fiscal '25 or calendar '24?\nChuck Boynton: Yes, fiscal '25 starting April 1 of next year, that's right -- this year, yes.\nAnanda Baruah: Got it. And you guys had mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think it may have been Hanneke who mentioned this AI as an opportunity for the company. Any context you can give there? And I guess really what I'm wondering is, are there things that sort of you would consider to be incrementally new to the company in terms of value-add for market share opportunities, new categories, which you could go in that you're thinking about that sort of behind the close doors it classically fit into the ecosystem of products that the company has historically offered?\nHanneke Faber : Yes, I'm happy to take that because it's one of the other areas where I see a lot of opportunity. Really two ways that we're leveraging AI at Logitech today. One, of course, is internally on productivity, like every other company and that's table stakes, but it's well underway here, whether that's in supply chain and marketing, using Copilot, ChatGPT and our own large language models. So that's well underway. The area I'm more excited about is in our products and in our innovation. And again, there's -- I'll mention three things that I'm excited about and that are already out there, but they're -- they can tell you a little bit about what's to come as well. So, on the video conferencing side of the business, we have a new product out called Sight, which is a panoramic video conferencing camera that you sit right in the middle of your conferencing table. That one is like having a TV producer in your meeting and you get perfectly framed, your audio is perfect, your video is perfect. So I love that. And that leverage is AI to get that done. So that's on the video conferencing. Then on headsets, the zone to wireless headsets just out again, also leverages AI technology. And here, the consumer insight is, and I hate this myself. You're talking to someone, you have a headset on that other person is at an airport or is outside and there's a ton of ambient noise on the other side. Leveraging AI, this new headset cancels ambient noise on both sides, which is super cool. So really great product. So those are two product examples. The last one is on our software. So, if you have any of our products whether it’s Samsara keyboard, you can download a software that goes with that. One of the features is called Smart Actions where you automate some of your repetitive tasks. What we've seen in the last four or five months is that, by far, the number 1 repetitive tasks that our users are simplifying is something called reply with ChatGPT, 9x as much as any other smart action. So again, it shows how we can help both through our hardware and our software, delight consumers more with AI. Sorry, it's a bit of a lengthy answer, but I'm excited about the opportunities for innovation that we can leverage in our products and the growth we could get from that.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes. No, that's helpful. And so that taking the three you just mentioned right there, like to me, that would be more suggestive of potential market share gain opportunities or product stickiness opportunities, something along those lines.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Joern Iffert at UBS.\nJoern Iffert: And the first one would be, please, to you, Hanneke. May I quickly ask you, when you look over the next three to five years, do you think the categories and the segments Logitech has right now is the right base to be to drive your growth vision? Or are you also willing to go into new end markets like, for example, health care, which could be necessary to maintain the growth model going forward?\nHanneke Faber : I think we're playing in some really great spaces. So, the big space of work and play, that's what people do in life. So we play in some gargantuan spaces, and they give us good growth. Within that, are there verticals we could step on a little harder? Possibly, and that's what we're exploring in our strategy work right now. So a bit early for me to say yes or no, but we'll be back on the May.\nJoern Iffert: Yes, sure. I appreciate this. And then the second question, a little more technical one on the quarter, please. You were mentioning that outside the promotion season, which was Black Friday, Cyber Monday, volumes were a little bit short of your expectations. Is this linked to macro end market weakness? Or is this linked to the market share losses? I think you also mentioned a couple of market share losses, also gains, of course, but also some share losses that gaming keyboards, for example, in China and then some other stuff? So is it also linked to share and losses or many macro?\nChuck Boynton: I think generally, I would characterize the quarter from a share standpoint as a strength and a weakness. So on balance, we executed well. And I think when the dust settles and the final reporting comes in, it's not all finally in yet, we need to see all the final data coming in. I think it will show on balance. We gain share across key categories. The categories where we may had some challenges where we had older products and NPIs or new product introductions are on the way. So I feel on the share side, pretty good. I think, overall, the consumer as it was a year ago, was looking to buy on promotion. And the run rate business globally was more challenged outside of the promotional windows. And we're seeing that so far in the first few weeks of this quarter. So I don't --it's hard to say is that interest rates, is that -- consumer confidence is okay right now? Was it the enterprise spending? I think it's kind of the all of the above. I think there's just a little bit of uncertainty out there. And that gives us a little bit of caution going into Q4 and into next year on when will that return? I think there's news about sticky inflation and maybe rates won't get cut. There's a lot of macro factors that we read in the news every day. And I think that translates into our customers buying our products and other companies' products. But I don't -- I would not say it's a share issue. I think our share is strong and it's doing quite well across the board outside of some key pockets that we're addressing. Anything, Hanneke, you'd like to add there?\nHanneke Faber : I think you said it well.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Andreas Mueller at ZKB.\nAndreas Mueller : Can you discuss maybe the gap between sell-in and sell-through, particularly in the Americas? Is this seasonal? Or do you see your clients already increasing inventories sustainably there?\nChuck Boynton: Thanks, Andreas. The chart you're referring to in our earnings deck shows sell-through and sell-in. And I'll just say, I don't like that chart in general. We've agreed to keep it through this year, and we'll revise it to make it more meaningful at Analyst Day. That data shows that America’s sell-through was down 4%, yet we saw fairly strong revenue growth actually. And so you look at that and say, \"Gee, how can sell-through be down but sell-in go up. You must have built channel inventory. We did not actually. America’s channel inventory was roughly flat. What's driving that is less promotional activity or selling at a higher price and prompting less. So the sell-through is in gross dollars and the revenue is in net dollars, and that's just that delta of 700 basis points is the margin expansion based on less promotional activity and efficient promo activity. So we're going to revise that chart to give you a little more view into kind of the changes in channel inventory, which is, I think, the better metric. So I wouldn't read into that too much. It's kind of comparing apples and oranges a little bit. But we didn't want to pull it. I started just less than a year ago. I didn't want to pull that chart without replacing it with something to give you better visibility. So there will be an update to that coming in May, I -- but I would not read into that overall other than saying we did a great job on driving North American promo activity during the holiday period.\nAndreas Mueller: And then my next question on the gross margin progress, the lower product costs were mentioned. Can you give here some more details? I mean you mentioned production efficiency, but also, I mean, what was the impact of raw materials, for example, Asian currency were weak, which might have helped. Can you say something here?\nChuck Boynton: Certainly. I missed the very first part. Was it gross margin in Q4?\nAndreas Mueller: Yes. And on the production side or products.\nChuck Boynton: So, we had about 200 basis points of benefit year-over-year on our product costs. Quarter-over-quarter, it was roughly in line, but a year ago to this year, about 200 basis points of expansion. That should be durable and should translate into future quarters as well. 200 basis points year-over-year was logistics, ocean, air, freight. And then there were some other kind of noise between lower promo and mix. But overall, the freight side is going to come back. We're going to have more freight headwinds in Q4. That will be a challenge. And then on the FX side, year-over-year to Q3, it was about 100 basis point benefit. As you look into Q4 to Q4 and Q3 to Q4, currently, FX is roughly flat. So there will be -- there should be no currency impact. Of course, rates can change. But as we sit here today and you look at the euro and the pound and the various currencies around the world, on balance year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, were roughly in line from Q3 to Q4.\nAndreas Mueller: Okay. Then my last question, can you say something about the OpEx items, R&D and G&A here? And do you expect the progression going forward? In G&A, how much was the impact or was the increase actually one-time in nature?\nChuck Boynton: Certainly. So, our OpEx model is fairly straightforward. We want to spend roughly 25% of our revenue on OpEx. Of course, in OpEx, we want to prioritize things like engineering, product development, go-to market, those are things that build health and build value long term. Then you have things like G&A and other costs that are necessary but you want to be efficient on the spend. So that's the overall model as a whole. Now if you look overall, the details of what happened in the quarter, we had CEO transition costs that basically were one-time in nature. And then we have really overperformed this year financially. And a year ago, we were underperforming. So as a result, things like sales commissions and then variable compensation a year ago were unfunded or funded at a much lower level. This year, we're funding above plan given the above-plan performance. And so I wouldn't expect the overperformance on variable comp to continue so much. So there are some one-timers. But overall, if you look at where OpEx as a percent of revenue, obviously, in our peak quarter, it looks very impressive. But our model really is 25% approximately of revenue, and it will be a little higher likely in Q4 because it's our trough revenue quarter. So we're saying, on average, it's that 25% range. But we -- I feel really good about where this year is shaping up from an investment standpoint. And again, prioritize investments on those things that grow shareholder value.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Torsten Sauter at Kepler.\nTorsten Sauter: Well, congratulations to another strong quarter. In fact, it feels like in the good old days, right, just with a few new faces. Very glad to meet you, Hanneke, and very happy to work with you. Actually, I have two little questions, if I may. Firstly, a more technical one. I see you have again cut the tax guidance to a very, very low level. Can you please shed some light on that? And also, maybe try to give an outlook there.\nChuck Boynton: Certainly. Yes.\nTorsten Sauter: And yes, if I may, just to have it said already, we've seen the departure of your design head, Alastair Curtis. I think I had considered him a key person, right? So maybe can you guide us to the strategy with respect to running the design, operation to design team at Logitech going forward?\nChuck Boynton: Certainly, I'll take the first one and you can take the second one. On the tax side, we had reached agreement with the Canton Vaud, where we're headquartered this past quarter to increase the basis of the business overall, that allows for a larger amortization and a tax deduction. And this is because we have significantly grown our footprint in Switzerland. We're very proud of the incredible talent that we have in LASA. So with our increased investment and having a much larger employee base, we reached agreement with the government, and they were really great to work with, and they're proud of our -- the work we've done there. And because of that, there's kind of a one-time benefit that you saw this quarter. There's a couple of other smaller items as well on the U.S. tax side, we have a one-time larger deduction in the U.S. for our foreign operations that basically is a standard kind of practice that we've gone through analyzed this. And our tax teams did a phenomenal job in this past quarter. Those are one-time in nature. So if you look at the results this quarter, those will not repeat. If you think structurally, where is the company next year on a tax standpoint? The GAAP tax rate is going to be in the low 20% range. So low 20s on the GAAP side. And of course, that can change. The share price has a fairly big impact on the overall GAAP tax rate. But I think low 20s from a GAAP standpoint. And the non-GAAP side for next year is going to be low teens, and that's sort of the cash tax rate that we pay plus accruals. So the non-GAAP tax rate is cash taxes paid plus accruals, low teens GAAP, low 20s. This quarter was really a one-time based on the really hard work that our team did and based on our investment in Switzerland, et cetera. So we did provide guidance in the materials for this year, non-GAAP, 9% to 11%. So overall, though, I would -- in the models for next year count on the low teens, non-GAAP, low 20s GAAP. Hanneke, do you want to talk about design?\nHanneke Faber : Yes. Thanks for asking the question. Design plays a really, really special role at Logitech, and it's a real point of difference for us. Now Alastair over the last decade, built a fantastic design organization. That's one of the other things I learned in my first six weeks. We have more than 200 internal designers at Logitech. And they're fantastic. So actually, in the last quarter, they as a team won the Global Red Dot Design Team Award, which is again, in this industry and beyond, a really prestigious award. So I'm thankful for the organization and the culture, the design culture that's been created at Logitech. And I think with the team that we have of designers, I have no doubt we're going to continue to excel in design. So thanks for asking.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Martin Jungfleisch at BNP.\nMartin Jungfleisch: I hope you can hear me. And also, congrats on the strong set of numbers. So maybe two questions. First one is coming back on the cost side. I think at the webinar in early December last year, you mentioned that R&D will remain a key focus area for you, and you also just pointed out a few innovations. Now in Q3, R&D costs are up 9%. Should we expect this cost line to keep increasing in that magnitude in the coming quarters as well? And then the second question is on the China gaming curves. These routes have been taken off the website this morning. But just wondering if you have seen any negative impacts so far or if you would expect any negative impacts? And also, if you could just remind us on the rough exposure that you have in China in gaming.\nChuck Boynton: Yes, I didn't understand the comment that the China comment from this morning. In general, China gaming is a really important market for us. We have an iconic brand and the consumers in China preferentially pick our brand at the high end. There's lots of low-end competition. It's a big market. Overall, China's results were roughly flat. So, we had Asia was down in general, so more challenging across Asia. But China, actually, we performed quite well relative to our expectations. Clearly, it's a big market and it's very competitive. But preferentially, they choose better technology and a better brand at the high end. Do you want to add anything on China before we talk about OpEx?\nHanneke Faber : Very important, and I like what I'm seeing in terms of our premium offering there, so to pro-life mice for especially. And it's in any business, China is super competitive. That keeps us honest, so we'll be all over that market.\nChuck Boynton: Great. And then on the OpEx question, I would expect engineering quarter-over-quarter to be roughly in line with the prior quarter. And I would expect G&A and sales and marketing to come down. And the reason I believe that is because sales and marketing has variable commissions tied to sales, and with peak quarter, trough quarter, you have less commissions that you pay based on the sales change, just due to normal seasonality and then, of course, the one-time transition costs that you see in the G&A line. So overall, R&D quarter-over-quarter should be roughly in line. And then, of course, next year, we'll have to talk about that at Analyst Day. But again, in total, I would be estimating roughly 25% of revenue in your models.\nNate Melihercik: Hanneke, Chuck, our last question for today is from Michael Foeth at Vontobel.\nMichael Foeth : Just two last questions for me. The first one is on inventories. You obviously made a great job in reducing the inventory levels. My question is, where sort of is the limitation to that inventory reduction? And if you can give a bit more specifics on the whole Red Sea situation, any disruptions there in terms of your supply chains or delivery shipments and the related inventory that you would need to build up to counter that? And then my second question would be and I'll ask it straight away. You mentioned, obviously, in terms of growth for 2025, the trajectory that you depicted in your shareholder letter. It leaves a little bit room for interpretation in terms of where the trajectory goes. It looks like it would go slightly into the positive but maybe not to that high-single digit growth. Is it correct that you're expecting it to turn slightly positive, but maybe not as fast as your long-term will suggest?\nChuck Boynton: Certainly. On the inventory side, again, it was such an impressive quarter on inventory. We 've stated now for the last few quarters that we want to drive down on-hand inventory and channel inventory. And I just want to thank our employees and our teams for executing on this plan because it's really, really paid massive dividends, improving linearity, improving return on invested capital. Again, if you have less inventory, you have higher return invested capital or ROACE, as you say, in Europe or ROACE. That is such an important metric. And we have driven down inventory levels 6.5 turns in the quarter is a really great number. We said our operating model is between 5% and 6%. That would be on an annualized basis. So again, we're going to go in now into our trough quarter. So the turns will probably come down. I don't think inventory will come down in Q4 with the Red Sea challenges. Is there more room? There is more room. We can do better, but we're getting to that point of diminishing returns because importantly, we don't want stock outs. We want to carry inventory on in our distribution centers to meet our customers' demands. Customer sat is number one, but we want to do that the right way. So I think we're approaching that point of the efficient frontier on inventory levels, and we're targeting 5% to 6% precautious so good, maybe he can get to 7% occasionally. But I would say 6 is kind of hitting that best-in-class or upper quartile. As it relates to the Red Sea, it adds about four weeks of lead time. So it's not that material. There will be an impact to air, as I mentioned earlier, and a little higher cost. So I would expect a little bit of inventory increase, maybe we can keep it flat, but I would expect a little bit of an inventory increase as we get into Q4. And then the -- what was the last part, Hanneke?\nHanneke Faber : The gradual growth and does it leave room for interpretation?\nChuck Boynton: I'll let you answer that one.\nHanneke Faber : I'll go back to where we started. I think growth is really a question of when, not if. We will get back to growth. But there are so many uncertainties out there that we're just a little cautious on giving you exact numbers of when and how much.\nChuck Boynton: We will at Analyst Day. So stay tuned. And in middle of May, we'll have an Analyst Day and talk about our view and our outlook. I think the idea now is just like be cautious going into next year. People are getting excited. And I think overall, it's a great business, a great operating model, but we need to be cautious looking out into next year given the uncertainties.\nNate Melihercik: And with that, Hanneke, that's our last question today.\nHanneke Faber : Great. Well, thank you, Nate. Thanks, everyone. It's been really nice to meet you guys. Thanks for joining us for your interest in Logitech. And of course, a huge thank you to all the Logitech teams around the world for everything they continue to do. I look forward to speaking with you guys next quarter. Take care.\nChuck Boynton: Thank you."

        "content": "Nate Melihercik: Good morning and good afternoon. Welcome to Logitech’s Video Call to discuss our Financial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. Joining us today are Guy Gecht, our Interim CEO, and Chuck Boynton, our CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including with respect to future operating results under the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We are making these statements based on our views only as of today, and our actual results could differ materially. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial results, and you can find a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP results and information about our use of non-GAAP measures and factors that could impact our financial results and forward-looking statements in our press release and in our filings with the SEC. These materials, as well as the slides and a webcast of this call, are all available at the Investor Relations page of our website. We encourage you to review these materials carefully. Unless noted otherwise, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency and net sales. This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay on our website.  One brief note before we move on to the quarterly results. Next quarter, we will plan to update and modernize our earnings materials. The totality of the information we provide today will not change. I’ll now turn the call over to Guy. Guy?\nGuy Gecht: Thank you, Nate, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm very proud of the Logitech’s team performance and execution this quarter, driving better than expected results despite continued challenges, especially in Asia. Our new products, combined with sales execution, led to a significant progress toward the return to growth, and we did it while delivering record operating and growth margins exceeding any time in our history outside of the peak pandemic periods, along with OpEx control coming in slightly better than our 25% target. While we pause to congratulate the team and indeed, they deserve a huge thank you for the results, you will not find here any complacency, especially not before we return to healthy growth. That may take time as we work through pandemic pull-forward demand, but we are actively working toward it. Looking longer-term, I'm confident about Logitech’s positioning. Our portfolio aligns with doable secular trends in hybrid work, video conferencing, gaming and content creation that will continue playing out, and we see no reason to why we will not maintain the number one positioning Logitech currently holds in the majority of our growth categories. Now, let me briefly comment about the state of the business in these growth categories, and then Chuck will give you a lot more color on our performance in the quarter. I'm going to jump right into the video collaboration where our results are sequentially improving, but still far from where we wanted them to be. We're still facing market-related challenges, where some customers are taking a measured approach to equipping conference rooms, focusing first on hybrid work enablement by getting their workflow back into the office. But the need for equitable video and audio is only increasing, and our new site tabletop camera shipped this quarter, uniquely provides the best experience for hybrid meeting. We expect to continue to see gradual improvement in this business, and we'll be back in growth mode. Our solution for personal workspaces like keyboard and mice are on the verge of growth again. Mobile accessories and our sales into the enterprise are areas of specific strengths this quarter. Between business interest and new consumer products, we see this category well positioned for the holidays season. PC gaming improved sequentially, and the year-over-year declines are moderating. Simulation and console gaming remain challenged as we work through unfavorable comps that should ease in FY’25. Current and upcoming products refreshers, and of course, our gaming portfolio in the next several quarters, will further boost us in this industry that’s improving, but still not back to growth. Our design-led innovation was on full display this quarter, with 16 new products. We expanded the PRO series gaming portfolio with the Lightspeed keyboard and Superlight 2 mouse. We launched the Logitech G Litra Beam Light, and two Yeti microphones. We also launched the first product in a new category for Logitech, the Casa pop-up desk, which is a all-in-one ergonomic desk setup. We also continued to introduce new AI-powered products like our Zone Wireless 2 headsets. This headset uses AI for far-end noise suppression, resulting in a unique two-way noise-free canceling experience. Products like this demonstrate how AI can improve the user experience. More broadly, Logitech sees AI as a major strategic opportunity. Just as we have enabled people to be productive by accessing PC and cloud capabilities, we envision Logitech providing the interface tools people need to access and benefit from AI. As artificial intelligence transforms how people work and leave, we plan for Logitech to be at the forefront, delivering the solutions that seamlessly bridge human and machines. This is an exciting new frontier for us that you will hear more about in coming quarters. This quarter, it wasn't just our innovation on full display, but also our commitment to climate action and equity within a recent impact report. We aligned with two major private sector initiatives for the UN sustainable development goals. We firmly believe businesses play a critical role driving progress on these goals, and we are proud to foster alignment across companies. As our Chief Operating Officer, Prakash said during Climate Week in New York City, when it's come to the environment, we need progress, not just pledges.  Let me close with an update on our CEO search. Over the last four months, the board has been conducting a global CEO search, including internal and external candidates across industries and geographies. From the first days of the search, there was a tremendous interest in the opportunity that afforded the board the chance to meet with incredibly strong, diverse, and experienced candidates. Our board, masterfully led by chairperson, Wendy Becker, deserves real credit for the work. You might sense from my update that we are getting closer to finalizing a decision, and indeed we are. Until then, I hope you understand I will not be able to add more color to this topic. In summary, this quarter, we have made real progress, but aren't satisfied. We want consistent growth and consistent financial performance, and we are very focused on delivering that.  Thank you, again, and let me turn it to Chuck to discuss the numbers. Chuck?\nChuck Boynton: Thank you, Guy. Thank you all for joining us in the call today. I'd like to echo Guy’s comments about the great focus and execution of our employees throughout the quarter. Their commitment to the customer is certainly reflective in our 16 product launches ahead of the holiday season, while also demonstrating the discipline to operate the business in a responsible way and generating strong operating cash flows. Tremendous work by everyone.  Now, moving on to the business results of the second quarter. Net sales and constant currency declined by 9% to $1.06 billion. Overall, our Europe team had a very strong quarter, with both sequential and year-over-year topline growth in US dollars. In constant currency, we were down mildly from the prior year. Both Americas and Asia Pacific were down year-over-year, but showed sequential growth. Our personal workplace solutions had a really great quarter while gaining market share in keyboards and combos, pointing devices, and webcams. Our video and Logi G business still had pressure versus more difficult comps last year. We've been talking on our earnings calls and our Investor Day about the benefits of lean on-hand and channel inventory. This quarter, we continued our progress in leaning out the supply chain. In fact, our sales out was stronger than expected, which not only led us to overperforming in the topline, but also reducing channel inventory. We are currently shipping at a fast pace, getting ready for the peak holiday season. We expect to reduce channel inventory in the March quarter to align with the seasonally lower revenue we see in Q4, as well as Q1 and Q2. Please note, this will create a negative year-over-year comparison for Q4. For the sixth consecutive quarter, we reduced on-hand inventory significantly with our inventory turns improving from 3.2 to 4.6 year-over-year. We are getting close to our target operating model of five turns or better. Lastly, it's important to know that similar to last quarter, the reduction in channel inventory and on-hand inventory had a one-time positive impact on gross margins. And Q2 gross margins expanded quarter-over-quarter to 42%, better than anticipated, and in the upper range of our long-term financial model. Year-over-year increases were driven by cost improvement, including less reliance and expedited shipping, along with lower promotions, partially offset by unfavorable product mix. Comparing sequentially, increases were driven by cost improvements, favorable mix, as well as leverage and scale. Though we are encouraged by the gross margin improvement, Q3 gross margins are typically pressured by promotions and mix, and discounting typically increases during the holiday season, and our sales are more consumer-led than enterprise. We expect these headwinds to be partially offset by overhead absorption. In the back half of the year, we expect gross margins to be approximately 38% or 39% based on the previously mentioned one-time benefits in Q2 and sequential headwinds. Looking further ahead, with our slightly larger scale cost reduction and lower promotions, we believe the business is positioned to structurally attain the 39% to 44% gross margin target on average, although there will be quarters where we'll be below our long-term target due to various factors such as seasonality, mix, or promotions. Operating expenses were $261 million in the quarter, in line with revenue declines down 9% year-over-year. I continue to be pleased with the team's cost focus and ability to quickly dial up or dial down OpEx based on business performance. Our long-term model is to maintain operating expenses at around 25% or less of revenue. Note that we expect OpEx to rise mildly in Q3 due to seasonality and certain one-time costs. Operating income was $183 million in Q2 and better than our expectations due to improved demand, strong gross margins, and cost discipline. Following up on our record Q1 for cash generation, the team delivered strong Q2 cash flow from operations at $223 million, leading to a cash balance of approximately $1.2 billion. Q2 is also reflective of our consistent capital allocation strategy, particularly our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, which totaled approximately $276 million in Q2. In September, our shareholders approved and increased to our dividend, and we returned $182 million to shareholders, and we started our new $1 billion three-year share repurchase program that was approved in June. In the second quarter, we repurchased nearly $1.9 million shares for a total consideration of $124 million. Actual cash outflow is $94 million in the quarter, with the remaining balance to be paid in Q3. Please note the shares repurchased were under both the 2020 and 2023 program.  Moving on to our outlook, we exceeded our first half outlook on both the top and bottom lines, driven by stronger than anticipated demand, lower promotional intensity, and more aggressive cost reductions. Although uncertainty still exists, we remain cautiously optimistic that our business will continue to slow our rate of decline and eventually get back to growth. Therefore, we're raising the full-year outlook for fiscal year 2024. We are now expecting revenue of $4 billion to $4.15 billion. Our corresponding operating income is expected to be between $525 million and $575 million.  Before we start Q&A, we're going to show a short video highlighting our PRO line gaming products. Nate, roll the video and then we can take Q&A. [Video Presentation]\nNate Melihercik: Our first question today comes from George Wang at Barclays.\nGeorge Wang: Oh, hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick ones. So, firstly, just to kind of see if you can reconcile the fiscal 2H just based on the implied guide is still kind of below seasonal, and then kind of from 2H to H kind of flat versus the historical survey trends kind of - up kind of 15% to 20% sequentially from 2H to H. Just curious how much visibility you have and kind of try to reconcile, you talk about improving demand sequentially, yet you are guiding kind of below seasonal for the back half. Just curious if - any color on that.\nChuck Boynton: Certainly, George. Thank you for the question. So, if you think about the math, we are in the rate - the rate of change, the negative is slowing down. So, the rate of change in Q1 versus year ago was worse than Q2, and we're projecting Q3 and Q4 to be slightly better than Q2. And so, if you look at absolute dollars, because it's - the rate of change is slowing, the halves might look somewhat comparable, but we’re sort of cautiously optimistic that the back half of the year will be - it's still probably going to be negative, still down year-over-year, but should be down a little bit in line with Q2, a little bit better than Q1, and that rate of change, we're sort of confident that or optimistic that we're in an improving state.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, great. If I can squeeze in a second question quickly. Just any color on the kind of refresh cycle, kind of the upgrade cycle across gaming, especially because intuitively, gaming has much faster refresh cycle versus kind of traditional PC-related kind of peripherals and B2B side. So, just curious whether you are already seeing a kind of rebounding the reverse cycle kind of after last cycle kind of including the COVID.\nChuck Boynton: Certainly. I can take this, and Guy can jump in. we have a handful of new NPIs that we've launched this quarter just in time for our peak December quarter in the gaming area. We're really excited about the PRO line. You saw a commercial there, the PRO line mice and keyboards, two new Yeti microphones, the new lighting system. So, I think we're in a really good place with the category. We do have a couple of NPIs coming right after the December quarter to address console gaming headsets, but the line is being updated and refreshed. The product teams are working very hard to accelerate the time to market for new products. Guy, do you want to?\nGuy Gecht: So, first of all, exactly that. We need to give people the reason to refresh and buy new things, and we’re working on this, continue to release new products. Our roadmap is pretty exciting. In gaming, as I mentioned, there's three categories. The PC gaming, it's the biggest part. I think we're starting to see people moving and upgrading what they have. There's another category of console and simulation. Those are two categories where people heavily pull forward during COVID, and I think that might take a little longer than the PC gaming, but definitely at some point people would like to upgrade and we give them pretty good reason to upgrade.\nGeorge Wang: Okay, great. Congrats, again. I'll go back to the queue.\nNate Melihercik: Thank you, George. As a reminder for those in queue, please feel free to turn your video on when you ask questions. And our next question is from Asiya Merchant at Citi.\nAsiya Merchant: Hey, good morning. I'm trying to turn on my video, but I think Nate's disabled me. But anyway, good to see you guys, Guy, and Chuck. There I am.\nChuck Boynton: Hello, Asiya.\nAsiya Merchant: A question on margin.\nChuck Boynton: Oh, there you are.\nAsiya Merchant: Yes. Nate enabled me finally. All right. Just on margins, if I may. You mentioned there were some one-time benefits that certainly resulted in margins which were better than what you think had guided, which was down sequentially for the September quarter. Can you walk us through some of those margin benefits that impacted this quarter, and why we shouldn't expect that to continue in the second half? I understand there's new products that takes a little bit off just given the new product launches, but what's there that shouldn't help you in the second half of this year?\nChuck Boynton: Certainly, Asiya, and yes, great question. So, first, we overdelivered revenue in Q2, and when you overdeliver revenue, you get more fixed cost absorption. So, there was leverage and scale that helped in the quarter versus expectations. We also had communicated that we expected channel inventory to be flat quarter-over-quarter, and it came down. And when channel inventory comes down, then gross to net tends to improve. We also decreased on-hand inventory again, which had a corresponding benefit as well, one-time benefit to inventory reserves. So, those were the - those two are probably not going to repeat in the third quarter. Maybe in the fourth quarter they will. And then structurally, we did a really good job on cost reduction. We drove down product costs. That had a meaningful impact both year-over-year and a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Certainly, freight and logistics costs year-over-year were a huge improvement, not so much quarter-over-quarter, and then there were some mixed benefits quarter-over-quarter, but tailwinds year-over-year. So, a lot in there. But I do think overall, we're in a better place now than we were. Primarily, our operations team has driven lower product costs and our commercial organization has improved linearity and has reduced discounting, which has been helpful to gross margins. Now, a word of caution though for Q3. It is our biggest quarter. It's more consumer-oriented, and therefore it tends to be more promoted. So, we do see margin pressure in Q3. And then, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, in Q4, we intend to bring down channel inventory. So, you'll have less leverage in scale in Q4, given it's typically seasonally our lowest quarter.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay. Is this the guiding slide that the December quarter should be more in line with seasonal?\nChuck Boynton: Yes, December quarter will be more in line with seasonal, and then I think Q4 will be a little lower because of the year-over-year reduction in channel inventory.\nAsiya Merchant: Okay, great. And just gaming, if I may one more. I think some of your - I think specifically in the prepared remarks, you mentioned share gains across your three other products. You didn't mention gaming. Is that still a function of the fact that - are you losing share in PC gaming, or is it just because you're seeing tough comps in console and simulation that the gaming looks a little bit maybe optically weaker than some of your other competitors have talked about gaming getting some growth by the quarter - by the year-end, calendar year-end?\nChuck Boynton: There's been some share shifts in different categories, gains and losses in gaming. The important thing in gaming, console gaming is a really important category to us. One, the margins are higher. It's the heritage of Logitech. We have number one market share in mice, a really important category for us. In the keyboard space, we have number two market share. In both those categories, I think the NPIs will help gain some share back. \nGuy Gecht: Yep. I would say, when I track to where we’re gaining and losing, it's normally where we have a product that’s been in the market for too long, the competitors make, again, little improvement. When we have new products, normally we have big fans. Our products are great, and our job is just to make sure we accelerate and get to the market. The new chair, the executive that oversee gaming is definitely on it. So, a lot more good products to come.\nAsiya Merchant: Great, thank you. I'll jump back in the queue. Thank you.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Erik Woodring at Morgan Stanley. Morning, Erik.\nErik Woodring: Hey, good morning, guys. Morning. Sorry, Nate, you're going to have to unvideo me, but I'll start my questions anyway. There we go. So, maybe to start, just one clarification question on the topline, Chuck, for you. And historically, again, we see revenue grow about 25% sequentially in the December quarter, and then decline about 25% sequentially in the March quarter. If we assume that, we do get to call it $4.3-ish billion of revenue for the year. So, clearly above the high end of your guidance range. I would love if you could maybe just double click on the comment that you just made to Asiya about December being more in line with seasonal, but 4Q being below seasonal. Is that how we should be thinking about seasonality and kind of why the guide would imply something below normal seasonality? And why would that be after such a strong for second quarter? If you could just tease that out a little bit, that'd be helpful. And then I have a follow up. Thanks.\nChuck Boynton: Yes, Erik, yes, good question. I think ultimately, because we're still in a year-over-year declining environment, that the seasonality needs to be adjusted for that slope of decline. And therefore, if you compare historical Q1 and Q2 to Q3 and Q4, if you adjust for that slope of decline, I think you'll get back into the outlook that that we see. The other issue that we mentioned in the prepared remarks is that we intend to reduce channel inventory in Q4. And so, year-over-year, that will be down more than it was historically to bring channel inventory to the appropriate levels for Q4 and Q1 and Q2. Right now, we're building channel inventory, obviously for the prime selling season. So, I think you're a little high on the revenue numbers based on our outlook. Historical seasonality, we did this at Analyst Day. We talked about it. If you looked at the last five years and you take out the peak COVID I years, it generally was -and sales in and sales out can be a little different, but demand typically was 24%, 24%, 30% in Q3, and 22% in Q4. That was kind of three out of the four or four out of the five years had been the kind of the average pacing. And if you layer on top of that the rate of decline, of course it's slowing. We're getting not quite back to neutral. We're still in a declining environment, then it'll bring down that back half of the year relative to the first half of the year. So, we're kind of seeing the back half being somewhat similar to the first half of the year, maybe slightly better, but roughly in line with the first half of the year in total revenue.\nErik Woodring: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for that. And then, follow up again on a question that was kind of previously asked, because gross margins were so strong this quarter, really nice improvement. And Chuck, again, you talked about kind of sustainability to a degree and structurally you think you can attain this 39% to 44% range. Can you just tease that comment out a little bit, because I feel like it's a bit of a shift from what we heard last quarter, which was, it'll take four to six quarters before we get back to that 40% level. So, it took you less than one quarter to get back to that level. So, has something changed in your view structurally where you have a lower cost profile such that you're more comfortable being kind of up towards that 40% range? I realize not for the second half, but overall, is that 40% plus level now more attainable in your view than it was three months ago? Thanks.\nChuck Boynton: It is a little bit. Now, there's two key factors that give us a little more confidence now than a quarter ago. The first is scale and leverage. We overdelivered in the topline, and that was a positive surprise for us. That gives you leverage and scale. That was a real positive. The other two, maybe it's combined, but better margins driven by lower cost and less promotion. And I think the - I'll give credit to our teams. Quinn, our head of GCO, the Global Commercial Organization, and Prakash, our COO, have done a really, really good job driving lower promotions and lower material costs that have helped us. Now, we can't really predict mix, and we know in Q3 we're going to have more promotions, more consumer, and we know in Q4, we're going to have a reduction in channel inventory, and that's our low watermark quarter typically for the year. So, I think there's a little bit of headwind in Q3 and Q4 on the margin side, but structurally, I think we're in that zone of 39% to 44%. Of course, a lot of things can happen, but as we sit here today, Guy and I are just really pleased with how the team has executed and where we sit and the read-through to the future is, I think, better now than it was a quarter ago. Guy, do you want to add to that? \nGuy Gecht: I think perfectly said. I think the team kind of accelerate the arrival of the future business model, and they deserve tons of credit, and obviously, we'll continue to work out to maintain and push harder on profitability.\nErik Woodring: Awesome. Thank you, guys. Congrats.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question will be from Juergen Wagner at Stifel. \nJuergen Wagner: Yes. Good afternoon or good morning. Thank you for letting on. Question on your market positioning in your PC peripheral business. You mentioned you're gaining share now. Dell had recently at CMD, they showed a slide that they want to go back into the peripheral business. Is that now a new trend or - so do you see that as a threat or maybe do you consider going back into the OEM business at some point? And then question video from today's perspective, when would you see that reversing or turning into growth? Again, thank you.\nGuy Gecht: Thank you. I would say what we’re finding it's really reassuring is the strengths of the brand, and we’re seeing indication of pricing power. And you can see that - some of it in our P&L. We like to sell product with a larger brand that has definitely a promise of quality of innovation. People like that. We're seeing - I mentioned the Logitech for business. We're seeing more and more enterprise saying, you know what, we are going to buy that. We're going to just - we know that that will work for our users both at home and in the office. Our IT tools will manage that as well, not just the video conferencing, but the peripherals. We are very comfortable where we are. We always had competition. We just need to continue on our game and what we did in the last many years. We need to continue to do faster, better, and I think we have great opportunity there.\nJuergen Wagner: So, you wouldn't see OEM business as an opportunity again for you?\nGuy Gecht: Yes, we never say never. Again, we love partnerships. If something would make financial sense, obviously it would be up to the next CEO to decide, but I think we’re very comfortable with people picking a premium product with the Logitech brand and getting great return for it.\nJuergen Wagner: Okay.\nChuck Boynton: And Dell can be a partner as well? I think …\nGuy Gecht: Yes. Oh, they are a partner.\nChuck Boynton: We do sell some of our products on their website and they are a good partner and they'll be a formable competitor, but I think with our quality engineering, design, brand, and number one market share, I like the position that we sit in.\nJuergen Wagner: Okay. And on video, any thought when you - when this could turn again or any best guess or?\nGuy Gecht: That's like question of when, not whether. Talking to customer, the people that are dealing with the video conference in the enterprise, are often the same people that get the mandate, let's bring the team back to the office. And right now, they have two conflicting kind of topic, not completely conflicting, but they try to get people to come back and then they try to arrange for them great environment, productive environment to work with the people who work from home or the customers and video conferencing. So, I have no doubt that we're going to see more rooms being equipped with video conferencing. That's what people tell me. They do their homework toward that. I see customers making a decision to essentially standardize on Logitech. I know they are going to place POs this quarter, next quarter and more and more in the future, but at the same time, they take a pause. They want to get their workforce back to the office so that it will be used for those conference rooms. \nChuck Boynton: And I would say generally, video grew this quarter sequentially. The year-over-year comps are still a little bit difficult, but we saw video growth this quarter. And so, I think we’re feeling that our products are great and the market is there. It's just a matter of when, not if.\nGuy Gecht: Exactly. \nChuck Boynton: And we can't predict that, but I like our position there.\nGuy Gecht: Absolutely. \nJuergen Wagner: Okay, good. Thank you.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Ananda Baruah at Loop Capital.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes. Hey, thanks guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Guy, Epi printer, Epi printer \nGuy Gecht: Thank you.  Just saying.\nGuy Gecht: Appreciate that.\nAnanda Baruah: Yep. There's the shout-out. So, I guess better demand you guys saw. Any view on what the drivers of the stronger demand were throughout the quarter?\nChuck Boynton: A couple of key things. The consumer is still quite strong. The consumer has really held us through the soft part on the enterprise, but we are seeing the enterprise come back. We just mentioned on the last question, we saw video grow quarter-over-quarter and the enterprise selling of mice, keyboards, webcams, has been quite strong. So, the enterprise maybe has some signs of life, but the consumer has really been incredible. Year-over-year growth in pointing devices, primarily mice, I mean, that is - it's one of the few categories that we've seen year-over-year growth. Overall, 9% decline topline, but growth in mice. And if you look at Europe, Europe has been quite strong. The European market has really - that team and that market has been a really important point of strength for us this quarter. US market, so-so. Asia is still lagging behind. But I would say, a couple of categories and a couple of regions have really delivered a great quarter for us.\nAnanda Baruah: And Europe, has Europe been both consumer and enterprise?\nChuck Boynton: Yes.\nAnanda Baruah: Interesting. What, like, I guess as you guys think through the rest of the fiscal year, I mean, and look, even more broadly, kind of calendar 2024, if you're willing, what do you see as the most important kind of, I don't know, like tension points in either direction for your business that could swing things - well, actually, let me just ask it that way, okay? Like, what do you see as the most important tension points for your business? Sounds like kind of inventory, channel inventory, you're going to lean on a little bit more, but maybe in addition to that, we should be thinking of.\nChuck Boynton: Well, I think the two I would say is how Q3 ends, both from a promo and volume standpoint. It's our biggest quarter of the year. This will really be a telltale sign for the company. And the second would be the return of video in a more meaningful way. And I just can't tell if that's one quarter or five quarters or when that inflection point will be. But overall, those are the two things I would point to as inflection points.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes, that's super helpful. Chuck. I'm sorry, go ahead. Sorry, Guy.\nGuy Gecht: No, I’d just add to the - just geographically, I think Europe is essentially on the verge of growth. We want to see that, and we have high hopes for the Americas to come back to this. We like to see stabilization in Asia. China is our second largest market. So, hopefully, that will start to bottom and go back. So, if we start to get all of that, definitely things that are playing well for us.\nAnanda Baruah: And Chuck - well, and Guy as well, to the dynamic with video conferencing, Guy, you had talked to this, and Chuck just mentioned it, is really the decision - like everybody's sort of - it sounds like everybody is - not everybody, sounds like folks are largely on board that there's going to be some hybrid work model, but it also seems like it's unclear still what that will look like. And so, is that really kind of the sticking point for folks deciding which rooms they want to video-enable in enterprise? Is that really what we're waiting for? Is it something other than that?\nGuy Gecht: Say the people I meet, and I meet quite a few customers in the last 90 days. They know where they want the video enabled, and in most of the rooms, they want it. I would say here in Logitech, kind of living large, we have almost every room video-enabled and it's often coming to play. Two, three people go to a meeting and says, okay, let's ping this person working from home today, and let's call this customer and let's see if they have a few minutes and get them on a video. What you used to do on the cellphone now becoming a quick video conference. So, that is happening and people are planning for this. You just see the same people also at the same time saying, hey, I need to get my workforce. Yes, we announced the policy of two, three days in the office, whatever the policy. Now we need to see people do that and use those rooms. We are not standing still, by the way. We are going to expand our portfolio. You're going to hear more about actually enabling those companies to do a great job in attracting, making this very attractive place for people to come and collaborate inside the corporate and outside the corporate. So, stay tuned on that. And I think it's just a matter of time when they come back and says, okay, now the priority is back. Let's get video enabled, modernize all those video conferencing.\nChuck Boynton: And then, Ananda, I would add to that. I think that's super well said, Guy. The backdrop is quite interesting. We sold this past quarter $152 million worth of video conferencing solutions. That's not a small number. We have number one market share there. It's not - none of the players are really doing better or a lot worse than we are. The market is just kind of sideways. The backdrop and the why is, companies are being cautious. Global conditions are unsettled. Interest rates are high. Ours are somewhat discretionary spending. And so, I think companies are prioritizing other areas right now. As the things Guy mentioned, when those settle out, I think we're going to see this become a priority again, once they have their model of back to work and hybrid settled out. I think this is a - to me, this is a - again, it’s a when, not an if. But I think the backdrop is cautious corporate spending on these categories broadly. We have number one market share. We have great solutions, and I think the pendulum will swing back, but it's still a great business today. High margins, $150 million a quarter. I mean, I feel good about the fundamentals. It's just, we're not seeing the growth rates that we'd like to see.\nAnanda Baruah: That's really helpful, guys. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Michael Foeth at Vontobel.\nMichael Foeth: Yes. Hi, guys. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question. Starting with a clarification on the gross margin. You talked about lower costs driving the margin, and I was wondering, is that only lower input cost, lower material cost inflation, or is it something in the design of the products as well that is more structural that allows you to have lower product costs that will be … \nChuck Boynton: It's both. Yes, Michael, it’s both. And it depends on the comparison year-over-year versus quarter-over-quarter. We have structural material cost reduction that our COO, Prakash, and his team have driven. It's both designed for manufacturing, designed for cost, as well as procurement, negotiated cost reductions. And then certainly, everyone has been benefiting year-over-year from lower freight costs, inbound, outbound, air, water modal. All companies have benefited from - where we've done an especially good job as material cost reduction. Year-over-year, it's about 50-50 cost reduction and expedite/logistics. And then quarter-over-quarter, it's primarily material cost reductions, because freight has not changed a lot quarter-over-quarter.\nMichael Foeth: Sure. A second one on the strength in the workplace solutions business, mice and keyboards, can you be a bit more granular? Does it - is it - you talked about strong consumer, but is it equally strong in enterprise? Is it - where does it come from? Is it a segmentation of your lineup? Is it more in the high end or the low end of the products? What's driving the strengths there?\nGuy Gecht: I would say across the board. Geography, we talked about Europe much better, leading Asia, China, a little trailing, selling to the enterprise and influencing enterprise. It's something that’s relatively new to Logitech, but it's working really well with partnering with enterprise, saying, hey, you want to expand. Would you do with Logitech? in general, companies like to do - to work with fewer vendors. So, that's really worked well with that for us. The mobile type of solution is actually doing quite well too for us. And so, we're seeing strength. We expect to be seeing strengths, but we're seeing strength in all those personal workspace. I think now that some of the pull forward is starting to go away, we're seeing it back to normal demand and normal growth. We see the path to normal growth.\nMichael Foeth: Okay. Thank you. Then maybe just a very quick last one on financials. You have a pretty big cash pile and interest rates are up. So, I guess, you're starting to earn some good money on that cash. I was just wondering, where is the cash parked and what sort of return are you expecting on the cash?\nChuck Boynton: We have a very conservative investment philosophy, so primarily in bank deposits and treasuries yields. It's different in different countries, but the highest yields we're earning are kind of just sub 5%-ish. So, we have an incredibly conservative model when it comes to managing our cash. We're really pleased, this quarter we returned more cash to our shareholders than we generated. That gives us the confidence and strength in our business. We paid our annual dividend, executed buybacks, opened up a new $1 billion line for additional buybacks. And so, we feel like we're - our capital allocation model is working. It's executing. It's consistent and the excess cash that we have is earning a decent return.\nMichael Foeth: Thanks a lot. Well done.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Joern Iffert at UBS.\nJoern Iffert: Thanks gentlemen, and good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I would take them one by one if it's okay. Just the first question. When you get all the pre-orders already for the Christmas season or a good chunk of the pre-order for the Christmas season, and if you exclude the B2B business, can we already assume that at least so far the revenues are trending flattish year-to-date for the quarter, considering this pre-order for the consumer business?\nChuck Boynton: So, the way we look at this Joern, is, our global business is different around the world, and the - many accounts plan very far in advance, and many accounts order every two weeks. We don't disclose the level of detail of kind of book-to-bill or ordering. I will tell you that our operations team is working fast and furious, delivering amazing amounts of product right now, getting ready for the big holiday promo. We're just super proud of the engagement with our key customers and partners, e-tail, retail, and we're optimistic for a strong holiday season. B2B is trending nicely. There can be a budget flush. We don't know what that's going to look like at year-end. That's kind of a wait-and-see. It tends to happen the last couple of weeks of the quarter. So, B2B and the business is trending as we would expect this time in the quarter. Of course, it's week three, so it's early.\nJoern Iffert: Okay, thanks. So, the second question would be, please, on gaming. Can you remind us how much of the gaming sales is linked to consoles via the headsets and game controllers, for example? And it seems that some console sales are doubling these days and that you get a feeling to - yes, to what extent gaming was benefiting from the strong console exposure.\nChuck Boynton: We don't break out gaming in that level of detail. Console has been a little more difficult for us because our product portfolio is aged. Our product team is launching, we believe, a revolutionary new product. It's going to come out just at the tail end of the holiday buying season. So, we're not going to get a huge amount of lift from it. It's called the A50 and it is a killer, killer new product, but this will primarily be a benefit more into next year. PC gaming, as you know, is our hallmark. We have number one market share in gaming mice, and we just launched New NPIs to further build our lead from a technological advantage standpoint on the gaming side.\nJoern Iffert: So, just to double check this, when we saw all the good console gaming data, and you said your product portfolio was with age, so you're not yet fully benefiting from this strong growth which is happening on the street for console sales.\nChuck Boynton: That's right.\nGuy Gecht: We have more to benefit. There's also - this is an area that had a significant pull forward during COVID from our perspective. So, people bought our accessories and still use it. So, the upgrade - the refresh upgrade is a little further than maybe the rest of the gaming categories. But as Chuck said, we are going to give - our team is very innovative. We're going to give the user really good reasons to upgrade.\nJoern Iffert: Thanks. And the last question, if I may, on Europe. Pretty good performance, absolutely, in the quarter. Can you give us some more color? Which regions and which products in particular, if you must name the top three reasons why Europe was so good, would be helpful if you can share it with us.\nGuy Gecht: The number one reason is our team, and then I'll let Chuck maybe take the next two reasons. \nChuck Boynton: Yes, we don't break out that level of detail, but I would say our team in Europe led by Yalcin, is a really, really good team. We are unlocking value by reducing promotions, improving linearity, driving engagement with the end customers, with the tier two resellers, doing a masterful job with our e-tail partners there. And so, I think honestly, this is an execution story in Europe for us. It truly is. The market is good. We're gaining share, but our team on the ground is just really executing across the board.\nJoern Iffert: But just maybe to name one or two products that did in particular well or regions.\nChuck Boynton: Gaming, crushed it in Europe, had a phenomenal quarter. Mice, keyboards did well. Video is up. I mean, it's really across the board. And what's amazing, in US dollars, it's up 5% year-over-year, while the whole business is down 9%. I mean - so Europe did incredibly well. In constant currency, it was down 2%. So, and that's maybe the more relevant metrics. So, I'd call it flat-ish to slightly down. But Europe had a really good quarter, and now we'll just have to see how the December quarter holds in there because it's our single biggest quarter in Europe. So, hopefully, it's a read through that Q3 will look just like Q2 did, but it's kind of a wait and see. But we feel great about the progress and the execution.\nJoern Iffert: Thank you very much.\nNate Melihercik: And our final question today is from Andreas Müller at ZKB.\nAndreas Müller: Yes. Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. Well done for the quarter. Congratulations. Can you be a bit more explicit on promotions for the December quarter? What were the learnings from last year's promotion? And in the gross margining guidance, it seems implied that the promotions are far more broadly broad-based. Is that right? Can you elaborate here a bit?\nChuck Boynton: Certainly. Last year, I think the promos came in more than we'd expected. This year, we've allocated budgets to the team, and we expect promo to be less than last year, but the mix will be a little negative because it's going to be more consumer, a little less enterprise. And so, the mix shift will be a bit of a headwind overall as we see gross margins for the quarter. So, I think it'll be less promo, but it's still our peak promo period. But the mix shift is going to be more to the consumer-led items.\nAndreas Müller: Okay. And then in VC, what has been the market adoption of the new site product? Was that already a driver in the quarter or do we see here something?\nChuck Boynton: Early days, single digit millions of orders. We're still not at the full-scale launch of site yet. That'll likely happen this quarter or next, knock-on wood this quarter. But it's still very, very early, early days. But the reception so far has been strong. Guy's been with a lot of customers. \nGuy Gecht: Yes. I have to say, I don't think I met a customer that didn't like it and wanted to use it. Normally, in an enterprise, the IT want to test the solution, a new type of solution before they deploy it, and then they have few rooms and then they have conclusion, and then they come to us. So, this take a little longer for people to deploy it, but feedback is tremendous. It's a gamechanger as far as being able from a remote location to come in and feel part of the room, not just the video, also the audio. And so, we feel really good about that. There's a lineup behind that. Obviously, it's not the last product that we'll have multiple cameras. That's big part of our roadmap. We feel really good about the initial response.\nAndreas Müller: Okay, thanks. And my last question, what is, in your opinion, a perfect time horizon for year-on-year growth overall? Obviously, it's beyond March 2024, but can you give some color when that could happen and say yes, with the most likelihood?\nChuck Boynton: I think with the rate of change that we're seeing, it's mid to end of next year would be my - the current thinking based on the slope and rate of change.\nAndreas Müller: Okay. Thanks. Thank you very much.\nChuck Boynton: Thanks, Andreas. And Guy, that's our last question for today. \nGuy Gecht: So, thank you Nate. And thank you all for joining us today. I want to really extend my sincere thank you to the Logitech team. The fruit of their dedication and execution, I think we're seeing in the numbers and give us a lot of confidence for the future. So, thank you, Logitech, and thank you all for joining us today. Looking forward for talking to you in the future."

        "content": "Nate Melihercik: Good morning and good afternoon. Welcome to Logitech’s Video Call to discuss our Financial Results for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. Joining us today are Guy Gecht, our Interim CEO; and Chuck Boynton, our CFO. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including with respect to future operating results under the Safe Harbor of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We are making these statements based on our views only as of today. Our actual results could differ materially. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. We will also discuss non-GAAP financial results and you can find a reconciliation between non-GAAP and GAAP results and information about our use of non-GAAP measures and factors that could impact our financial results and forward-looking statements in our press release and our filings with the SEC.

Unless noted otherwise, comparisons between periods are year-over-year and in constant currency and net sales. This call is being recorded and will be available for a replay on our website. I will now turn the call over to Guy.\nGuy Gecht: Thanks, Nate, and thank you all for joining us. It is a pleasure to speak with you today. Before we jump into our first quarter achievements, let me provide some context regarding my role and the Board’s search process for Logitech’s next CEO. I am both honored and excited to guide this iconic brand company in the near-term. During my four years on the Board of Logitech, I have gotten very familiar with the company as I had the opportunity to serve as the Chair of Logitech Technology and Innovation Committee of the Board and to serve as a member of the Audit Committee. I view my role as an Interim CEO is to provide the consistent and steady hand to the many wonderful experienced teams working hard across Logitech. I am singularly focused on making progress and ensuring we do not lose any time in our ongoing execution. Our strategy remains unchanged as do the business plans that are in place. All teams are focused on executing their proven playbook and my focus is to remove obstacles, facilitate decision-making and ensure we lose no time. Now a few words on the search. As we previously announced, the Board is in conducting a global CEO search, including internal and external candidates. It is progressing well. There has been a lot of interest in the opportunity and we are pleased with the strong caliber of the candidates we are seeing. Needless to say, the Board views this decision with the utmost seriousness it deserves and it’s working diligently reviewing and interviewing candidates. Given the confidential nature of the search, I will not be able to add more color today, but rest assured that we will update you when we have news to show. Before I turn it over to Chuck to review the team’s progress on many important points, let me provide a few of the nonfinancial highlights of this quarter. Assuming Logitech is a global leader in design and innovation, we were awarded the industry’s most prestigious Red Dot Design Team of the Year Award previously awarded to companies such as Apple, Ferrari and others renowned for their design. We introduced four new products in the quarter, including Rally Bar Huddle, the newest addition to Logitech’s family of conference cameras that turn small meeting rooms into collaboration spaces. And design for Esport athletes, our newest Logitech G PRO X gaming headset feature GRAPHENE drivers for those that require precision audio technology. And in addition to the products launched last quarter, we are just about to start shipping Logitech Sight, a table top camera with 315 degrees view capabilities, delivers a truly unique Video Conferencing experience. At the heart of this new system is an AI director like technology that decides which participants should be highlighted on the screen and from which angle close or far. This benefits both people in the conference room and especially remote participants who otherwise may feel they are not fully involved in the meeting because they are not seated around the table. Our sales teams closed a number of meaningful customer deals in Q1, including Honda, Kroger, TD Synnex and the Proximus Group, as well as the European Commission. These wins represent multiple industries in both the public and private sectors. And finally, last week, we announced the acquisition of Loupedeck, a small tuck-in deal that is adding a differentiated technology initially in Gaming and screaming -- and streaming and later in other areas. We will continue to screen for more deals that will help us accelerate the execution of our strategy, as well as bringing our unique technology to new sets of users. These were just some of the recent highlights, although most importantly for today, is that we started our fiscal year with an encouraging set of results and an updated outlook. As we move through the remainder of the fiscal year and read toward our expected return to growth, you should expect to see unwavering commitment to the principles and capabilities that have become the hallmark of Logitech, innovation to capitalize on the growth trends that fuel our business, which is video everywhere, hybrid work, Gaming and digital content creation, design led engineering and product innovation. A maniacal focus on lean manufacturing and operations, and a capital allocation strategy that is focused on M&A, paying a dividend and share buyback. And we do all of that with continued commitment to our values. As an example, this week, we released our Annual Impact Report where you can read about the progress our teams have been making in the areas of sustainability and social impact. With that, I will turn it to Chuck to provide the financial details of our first quarter and to review the outlook for the remainder of the year. Chuck?\nChuck Boynton: Thank you, Guy. I also appreciate everyone joining us on the call today. First and foremost, I want to thank all of our employees for the strong execution and teamwork in the quarter. It really shows in our results, especially our strong operating cash flows. Before we get into the details on our financial performance, let me spend a minute on some reporting changes we have made to our product category classifications. Our slide presentation and quarterly fact sheet provide additional information, as well as a five-year set of comparables. Many of you have asked for these updates over the last several quarters, so we hope that changes provide a simpler and clearer view of our business. These reclassifications do not impact our previously reported financial statements. Moving on to the business results for the first quarter. Net sales in constant currency declined by 15% to $974 million. Sales out was quite strong, particularly for Headsets, Tablet Accessories and Gaming. As we discussed at the Analyst Day and on the last earnings call, we believe in the benefits of lean on-hand and channel inventory. For the fifth consecutive quarter, we reduced on-hand inventory significantly with our inventory turns improving to 4.2. We remain committed to our goal of improving to 5 turns or better over the next year or two. Likewise, channel inventory was also reduced in the quarter and I am proud of the team for hitting the targets that we set. This has improved linearity and predictability. We plan to keep reducing channel inventory during the seasonally soft months of July and August, and then replenish the channel in September, October and November as part of a normal build for the December quarter. Net-net, we expect channel inventory to be roughly the same at the end of Q2 as it was at the beginning. In Q1, gross margins expanded quarter-over-quarter to 39% and slightly better than anticipated as significant reductions in our on-hand inventory drove down or drove some one-time benefits in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, margins were pressured by FX and mix, but partially offset by cost improvement and less reliance on expedited shipping. Again, thank you to our operations team for such amazing execution. Sequentially in Q2, we anticipate gross margins to be pressured, and as a reminder, gross margins in our December quarter have both headwinds and tailwinds. We have the seasonally higher consumer sales and holiday promotions, but those are somewhat offset by overhead absorption. While there will be quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, we feel our business is structurally positioned to generate 40% gross margins in the next four quarter to six quarters. Operating expenses were $271 million in the quarter, up slightly versus our internal expectations. A portion of our operating expenses were attributable to some onetime administrative expenses and the weakening U.S. dollar in the quarter. I continue to be pleased with the team’s cost focus and ability to quickly dial up or dial down OpEx based on business performance. Our long-term model is to maintain operating expenses at around 25% or less of revenue. Operating income was $109 million in Q1 and better than our internal expectations due to improved demand and strong gross margins. One big highlight for the quarter was our working capital execution. Cash flow from operations was $240 million, a first quarter record for the company, leading to a cash balance of $1.25 billion. Our capital allocation strategy remains consistent, evaluate M&A opportunities, pay an increasing annual dividend and return excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchases. We are making progress on all three fronts. As Guy mentioned, we announced the acquisition of Loupedeck. They provide valuable technology for Logitech G and while modest an acquisition price reflects our consistent and disciplined approach to M&A. In May, we announced a 0.10 euro-frank [ph] increase in our dividend, which will be voted on by our shareholders at our September Annual General Meeting. And just last month, our Board of Directors approved a new $1 billion three-year share repurchase program. Our existing buyback program expires at the end of July and in total, we will have returned more than $1.1 billion to our shareholders as part of this program. Our new program will replace the expiring program upon its approval by the Swiss Takeover Board. Moving on to our outlook. We are raising the first half outlook we confirmed in May expecting first half 2024 revenue of $1.875 billion to $1.975 billion. Our corresponding operating income is expected to be between $180 million and $220 million. In our last earnings call, we said we plan to revert to full year estimates either this quarter or next quarter. Today, we are updating the first half and have provided full year estimates based on the progress we made in Q1. There is uncertainty with many factors like FX inflation, the state of the consumer and then in the December quarter, which is typically our largest quarter and so forth. However, now with one quarter behind us, we are providing a full fiscal year 2024 outlook. We are expecting revenue of $3.8 billion to $4 billion. Our corresponding operating income is expected to be between $400 million and $500 million. I will close with where I started. Thank you. Thank you to all of our employees for driving such strong execution this quarter, and with strong market share and some great new products launching, we are cautiously optimistic. We are going to show a short video on one of our new products, Sight. Nate roll the video and then we will take Q&A. [Video Presentation]\nA - Nate Melihercik: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining. [Operator Instructions]. I will start today with Asiya Merchant from Citi. Hey, Asiya.\nAsiya Merchant: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Hopefully, you can hear me.\nNate Melihercik: We can hear you well.\nAsiya Merchant: Thank you for the color, Chuck and Guy. Great view on video, Guy. Chuck, if you think and Chuck and Guy, actually this is for both of you. Can you all talk a little bit about seasonality. It seems like at least in the implied guide the September quarter or the calendar third quarter was typically up at least in the low double-digit seems to be kind of guided flattish, maybe slightly higher. Maybe you could talk about that and as you kind of look into the December quarter, if you can kind of talk to us about the visibility that you are seeing and which product segment we feel very strongly about. And then on gross margins, I think, Chuck, you mentioned there were some one-time benefits. Clearly, gross margins came in better than what we are expecting and in terms of hitting your 40% target, you can talk about some puts and takes to get there as the year progresses pretty fast? Thank you.\nChuck Boynton: Yeah. Sounds great, Asiya. Thank you so much for the question. So first, on seasonality, we outlined last quarter as you will recall, that if you looked at the last kind of four years on average, the quarters were roughly 24% Q1, 24% Q2, 30% Q3, 22% Q4. And I am not sure that that’s going to be this year, our Q1 was better than we had expected. We performed better than our internal expectations. It was a strong quarter compared to where we expected, both topline and bottomline and we are cautiously optimistic on the back half of the year, but there are still uncertainties, foreign exchange, the various uncertainties in the environment. Last year, the December quarter had some margin pressure because of promotions. We don’t know what’s going to yet happen with our December quarter this year, a single biggest quarter. The read-through though, the June 18 holiday in China was quite strong. We don’t have the final results back from Prime Day, but it looks like it performed reasonably well. So I’d say, we are cautiously optimistic, but we don’t want the first quarter here providing estimates for the full year. We want to make sure that we are appropriately providing an outlook that is manageable. The second question on margins. It was a great quarter, 39% is the low end of our long-term operating model. We feel good about that. However, there were some benefits, specifically when we brought our on-hand inventory levels down by over $100 million, that had a benefit to the overall inventory reserves that provided really a strong uplift for the quarter and we see a little bit of pressure going into Q2 on margins. For the back half of the year, we are again cautiously optimistic that we will be in that kind of that range that’s probably a little below 39% or in that range, but we are optimistic there are tailwinds. Freight costs have come down significantly, cost pressures on components, our operations team has done a great job doing cost reduction and improvement. What we don’t know is how the mix will impact. Now we have a couple of new products that are coming out that are going to provide we think a nice tailwind and could help on the margin side, but there is still uncertainty in the back half of the year.\nAsiya Merchant: Thank you. I appreciate the color.\nChuck Boynton: Thank you so much.\nNate Melihercik: Great. Next up we will go to Adam Angelov at Bank of America. He, Adam.\nAdam Angelov: Thanks for taking the question. Just -- so, firstly, on the inventory decline, sounded like that was a bit of a surprise. Maybe you could dig into that and why?\nChuck Boynton: Inventory, I would say it was not a surprise. Our operations team, we have targets. Our operating model, our goal is to operate with on an inventory at about 5 turns. We hit 4.2, which is great progress considering where we have been. But it was not a surprise. It was strong execution. It was deliberate. And the great news is that not only was on-hand inventory reduced, but channel inventory came down as well, significantly high single-digit decline in channel inventory. So if you couple that on inventory and channel inventory are down, we have leaned out the supply chain and that is great news for us and our channel partners. With lower inventory levels, we make more money, our channel makes more money and it’s good for everyone.\nAdam Angelov: Okay. Got it. That makes sense. Thanks. And then just a quick one on Video Collaboration. So I think declined again in the quarter. Maybe you could just touch on how you are feeling about that market in H2. Are you seeing sort of some stabilization from the enterprise customers or is it still a lot of uncertainty?\nGuy Gecht: Yeah. First of all, not the numbers we want to see on the business side, but business -- B2B Video Conferencing side. I would say in the last 30 days, I talk to customers and every region met face-to-face in Asia and North America going to Europe this afternoon. Our brand is strong and the wins are significant. What we are seeing is actually big companies decided to standardize on Logitech and they just deploy at some pace where budget get opened, they deploy as a conference room. So that should play definitely better for the future. The second thing is if you look at the market, there is the high- to the mid-range. We are actually doing quite well. We grew double-digit at that category. Where we have some pressure is kind of the lower mid-range to the bottom to the lower end, where we didn’t have a product for some time and we are about to launch a product the Rally Bar Huddle. That’s a great product. It will play really well in this category, energize ourselves supposed to go in. So between this and the Sight that I talked about, this is going to be a really good way for us to come back to customers, try to push deployment, win some more big accounts, I feel very positive about the future of this business after talking to channel, after talking to customers. I think the opportunity there is significant and it’s, of course, the -- talking to the margin, this is the best margin category we have, so that will help a lot.\nChuck Boynton: I would just add, we gained a couple of points of share in the quarter. So we feel good about our -- the strength of our position. Sequentially, the video category was down $5 million, so relatively modest quarter-over-quarter. And then with these new products that Guy just mentioned, being launched, we are again cautiously optimistic about our execution in the back half of the year.\nAdam Angelov: Got it. That’s right. Thank you.\nGuy Gecht: Thank you.\nChuck Boynton: Thanks, Adam.\nNate Melihercik: Next question will be from George Wang at Barclays. Hey, George.\nGeorge Wang: Hey, guys. Thanks again for the question. So, firstly, can you talk about Gaming in terms of our checks, we picked up some incremental improvement, especially kind of on the downstream, just not sure whether necessarily flow into the gaming peripherals. Just based on your guide for below seasonal sort of imply the Gaming to be down again on a year-over-year basis for the 4Q. Just curious whether you think that’s conservative or how much visibility you have on the Gaming side?\nChuck Boynton: Well, we haven’t provided specific estimates for Gaming for the back half of the year, but clearly, the December quarter is the biggest quarter Gaming. Our Gaming team has been operating incredibly well. We have got some new products coming out that we think will help. Overall, it was a really good quarter for Gaming. The China team executed flawlessly for the June 18 promo, which is a really important event for us in that market, and overall, we have got strength in Japan and elsewhere. But I’d say, the real test will be the December quarter for us. That’s the biggest quarter for Gaming.\nGeorge Wang: Great. Great. Thank you. Just if I can squeeze in a follow-up. I guess, you guys are always looking to expand the new categories, right, just the adjacencies, that’s one of the kind of growth pillars. So in a high level thought on, if largely to -- entering into any sort of brand new category, which area or which vertical do you think will be most likely in the next few years?\nGuy Gecht: George, great question. I found great plans in the company to expand the TAM, expand into new use cases where we are going after a higher value application and use cases. It is too early for us to talk about it, but you will see in the coming quarters more discussion about this expansion.\nGeorge Wang: Okay. Great. Thank you. I will go back to the queue.\nGuy Gecht: Thank you, George.\nNate Melihercik: Thanks, George. Our next question will be from Alexander Duval at Goldman Sachs.\nAlexander Duval: Yes. Hi, everyone. Many thanks for the question. Just a couple. Firstly, on OpEx, it looks like you have made some good strides on cost control in the quarter. I wonder if you could talk a bit about how much further headroom there is for cost control going forward in the remaining quarters? And then I have a quick follow-up on FX, can you just remind us how much support we should expect to be seeing from FX in coming quarters? Many thanks.\nChuck Boynton: Certainly. First, on the FX side, this quarter, we still have headwinds in the year-over-year comps, that starts to change. Next quarter, it’s more balanced with where rates currently are. So I think we should be back into kind of a year-over-year balance starting in Q2 and beyond. First question was the -- can you remind us -- it’s early here, sorry.\nAlexander Duval: Cost control.\nChuck Boynton: Cost control…\nGuy Gecht: Cost control.\nChuck Boynton: Thank you. My favorite topic. So we have done a phenomenal job lowering cost. OpEx for Q1 was a little higher than our internal targets. There was a couple of one-time administrative charges. So I think you will see sequential improvement on OpEx. Our long-term operating model is to have OpEx below 25% of revenue. We may or may not get to that level this year, but we will have to wait and see. But we are on that trajectory and we believe that by the end of the year, roughly, we should be kind of at a $1 billion run rate approximately, but the real long-term target is to be below 25% of revenue.\nAlexander Duval: Thank you very much.\nChuck Boynton: Thank you.\nNate Melihercik: Thanks, Alex. Our next question is from Ananda at Loop Capital. Good morning, Ananda.\nAnanda Baruah: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking, sorry. No video, got it, Nate. Cool. Thanks for taking the question. Yes. So just two quick ones, if I could. Guy and Chuck as well, the decision to give the second half guide today and -- as opposed to 90 days from now. Can you tell us just -- I mean just give some context around sort of visibility that gives you guys confidence in the ability to do that in the thought process around doing it? And then I just have a quick follow-up as well.\nChuck Boynton: Well, on the guide, we deliberated it in what we had outlined last quarter that we would either provide it this quarter or next quarter and given the strong first quarter we had relative to expectations with one quarter behind us, we felt now was the right time. And is visibility better, in some areas, yes, inflation in the U.S. has come down a little bit. It’s higher in the U.K. and other markets, but the U.S. inflation has come down a little bit. FX is starting to stabilize a bit. But we just felt that with one quarter behind us that it was the right time to update our estimates for the full year and we are pleased to have done that one quarter kind of ahead of expectations.\nAnanda Baruah: Okay. That’s helpful context, Chuck. And I guess, just bigger picture question, any thoughts and maybe you guys haven’t sort of reached this conclusion yet, but would love any context thoughts on sort of when you kind of renormalize the revenue base. I have just done some quick analysis. It seems like exiting fiscal 2024, you could be there, but just would love your thoughts on that, that would be helpful.\nChuck Boynton: Well, I will start, Guy and you can add color. But as we look at the year-over-year and sequential change, things are starting to stabilize. Like we are -- the year-over-year comps are getting -- they are still not where we want them to be, we are not happy, they are still declining, but the rate of change is getting more favorable. Now I can’t tell you when we are going to hit bottom for an [inaudible], but it feels like things are starting to stabilize and that’s reflective in our cautiously optimistic estimates for the year.\nGuy Gecht: I would say the last 42 days here as an Interim CEO, just reaffirm my conviction this is a growth company in a growth market with a growth trajectory, this will come. But let me tell you another thing, we are not just wait for the market to improve. The team here is working really hard to push whatever we can, new products, obviously, going to help, win some share and get to this point where we start to be plus in front of our number again. And just a matter of time, there is a clock in our head, we want to get there, obviously, it will take some time, but we will get there.\nAnanda Baruah: And Guy, is the right way to think about -- I mean, I guess, like, sort of as we sit currently, does the company want sort of the financial community to think about normalized growth go forward the same as we have kind of pre-COVID or different, whether positive or negative?\nGuy Gecht: Look, we -- and you know me from prior life, we always want more, we always want to be a higher growth and we will continue to plan, look at the right acquisition that can accelerate that, look at the right product. There’s a lot of potential here. And a lot to build on, this company is super strong, the muscles and innovation in design super strong. The leadership team is super strong. We have a lot to build on. So you know how ambitious are and as we go forward, you will hear more, but we certainly like to do better.\nAnanda Baruah: Awesome. Thanks a lot, guys. Appreciate it.\nGuy Gecht: Thank you, Ananda.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question will be from Erik Woodring at Morgan Stanley. Good morning, Erik.\nErik Woodring: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question and Guy good to see you again.\nGuy Gecht: Thanks.\nErik Woodring: I just wanted to kind of double click on Asiya’s seasonality question, because I understand there are uncertainties today, but you are guiding to the worst seasonality in at least a decade, but also telling us the channel is normalized. And so that would -- I guess, would imply demand would be worsening, but I don’t really hear that from your comments actually. So I was just wondering if you could kind of help me square that circle and understand really why we were expecting such a below seasonal September quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\nChuck Boynton: Well, I think, overall, we have provided updated seasonality or targets for December or the March quarter. I would say if the December quarter is really strong, then we would be above the estimates. If the December quarter and the state of the consumer is difficult because of rising interest rates and inflation and global conflicts, et cetera, then that’s a different situation. But I feel like we feel coming into the year, we started off strong relative to expectations in Q1, we feel like we have got a plan that we can manage to and that we are in a pretty good place and we will have to just wait and see how the December quarter happens and what happens in the March quarter. March is typically our seasonally worst quarter of the year. So if you look at the outline what I mentioned earlier, generally, March is -- March quarter is 22% of the year, could be lower, we don’t know. But so we are -- I think, I’d say, we are balanced and that would be my view. Guy, do you have a different point of view?\nGuy Gecht: I agree with you. Chuck and I were part of a very extensive review -- operational review that we have done last week and informed us and decision to issue the guidance for the full year. I would say, Erik, you are spot on, we are not anticipating demand to be worsening. That’s definitely not what we are seeing or hearing or planning on.\nErik Woodring: Awesome. Thank you for that color then. Maybe, Chuck, just a question for you to follow-up on one of your comments there. In terms of OpEx below 25% of revenue. I think last quarter we kind of talked about Logitech exiting the year at maybe like a $250 million quarterly run rate for OpEx. If you did do below 25%, you would get, call it, $8 million to $10 million below that. So just wondering if you are thinking you can cut OpEx beyond your prior expectations? And then secondarily, if you are growing next year, would you expect to keep cutting OpEx or would you kind of then lean into reinvestment and try to grow OpEx base alongside your revenue base? And that’s it for me. Thank you so much.\nChuck Boynton: Yeah. Yeah. Good questions and maybe I wasn’t super clear. So our target by the end of the year is to have OpEx at a run rate of roughly $1 billion, which should imply an approximate $250 million Q4, maybe a little higher, maybe a little lower, but in that range. We have taken a lot of costs out of the company. We do not have a cost reduction plan in place right now to reduce headcount or OpEx further, that’s not our plan. We are focused on the topline and getting back to a year that has a $4 billion in front of it. And so if you -- if we are at $4 billion in revenue, $1 billion OpEx run rate is 25%. So we are -- if we are below the $4 billion, we are still going to stay at approximately $1 billion in OpEx a run rate. So the Q4 plan is, think of that as approximately $250 million if we are below $4 billion. And as we start to grow again, then we would have OpEx be below that 25% of total revenue number. That is the long-term operating model.\nGuy Gecht: Right. So just to be [indiscernible] Erik, when we come back to growth we like the 25% and we take the extra investment in growth areas. There’s plenty opportunities to invest in. But 25% is we like it as a long-term focus for us.\nErik Woodring: Super. Thank you so much, guys.\nGuy Gecht: Thank you, Erik.\nNate Melihercik: Our next question is from Joern Iffert at UBS. Hello, Joern.\nJoern Iffert: Thank you. Good morning, everybody. And two to three questions please from my side. I will take them one by one, if it’s okay. The first one is, can you please be kind and clarify again on gross profit margins? What exactly was the one-off benefit in Q1 and where you see gross profit margins trending to in Q2?\nChuck Boynton: Okay. So if you look year-over-year, gross margins were 39%, down from 40% a year ago. The primary difference there is going to be FX. There’s other puts and takes. But if you broadly -- it says, roughly 100 basis points. The quarter though was quite strong, because of significantly reduced on-hand inventory. So as we look forward into Q2, there will be some pressure, because we don’t think we can reduce inventory by another $110 million. So, of course, there’s a lot of dynamics with mix and FX and all those things, but generally, all things being equal, we see a strong gross margin trend here, but there’s a bit of a one-time benefit in Q1 that will put a little bit of pressure on the results for Q1 and in four quarters to six quarters, we see that trend improving structurally to a 40%-ish gross margin as a company. Our long-term model for gross margins, 39% to 44%. Now to get to the high end, mix shift, more video things that can happen, but in four quarters to six quarters, we see structurally 40%-ish gross margins. Next question there. You said you had three. That’s the of first of three.\nJoern Iffert: Yes. Exactly. So it means in four quarters to six quarters, you will reach the 40% gross profit margin run rate, not in the next four quarters to six quarters, just to be clear.\nChuck Boynton: Well, we may have quarters where it’s above 40%. We may have quarters where it’s below. But I think structurally in four quarters to six quarters, we see the business on average being 40% and growing, because we said the long-term model is 39% to 44%, but there’s a lot of puts and takes that can happen with gross margins, primarily mix being one of the biggest impacts. Now Guy mentioned earlier, we have got some new products coming out, those could be really helpful and be a tailwind. But there’s -- that’s uncertain as to what’s going to happen in the short-term. We are just -- we have got more conviction in the intermediate term that we can hit our long-term operating model.\nJoern Iffert: Okay. Thanks. The second question would be please on Q2 on the revenue guide. I mean, usually, Q2 is significantly higher versus Q1 due to normal seasonality. What have you seen in July so far, I mean in the first weeks of July. Do you see a stable flattish development year-over-year, we actually started with some growth quarter-on-quarter, sorry, I was speaking about quarter-on-quarter not year-over-year, just to double check is what you see in the first weeks of July?\nChuck Boynton: Yeah. The data that we have so far is the first couple of weeks, and I would say, we are cautiously optimistic about the results so far. We don’t have the final analysis in yet from Prime Day. So we still have a lot of wood to chop for the quarter and I think we feel like we are in a good position for the second quarter.\nJoern Iffert: Okay. Thanks. And the last question then please on Video Conferencing, you said it’s around $5 million down. So we can assume it’s bottoming out here that Q2 in Video Conferencing and also Gaming should be up quarter-on-quarter, is this a fair assumption?\nChuck Boynton: We haven’t provided that level of specificity. Has video bottomed out, I hope so. But I can’t guarantee that. It was fairly in line with last quarter, down a little bit, and with new products coming, I think, we have got tailwinds in Video.\nJoern Iffert: All right. thank you.\nGuy Gecht: Thank you.\nNate Melihercik: Thanks, Joern. Our next question is from Andreas Müller at ZKB.\nAndreas Müller: Yes. Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. I have got a question about the difference of growth rate between Keyboards & Combos and my standalone, what was there the reason?\nChuck Boynton: So Keyboards & Combos was down a bit, but better than our expectations. It was quite a strong quarter relative to our internal expectations. Pointing Devices also performed quite well with share gains. I don’t have a lot more to offer in terms of color. But generally, I would say, both categories were a little better than expectations and Pointing Devices being a hallmark of our company. We are just thrilled to see additional share gains.\nAndreas Müller: Okay. And then the cash on the balance sheet, this is now really high, would you accelerate the buyback. I think it’s running a bit lower than $100 million, is there room to improve that?\nChuck Boynton: Well, there is room to improve. First of all, in Q1, we pay our annual dividend, so that’s being paid this quarter and that will reduce the cash balance. We have put in place a new buyback plan, the old buyback plan of $1.5 billion. We were able to execute $1.1 billion of buybacks on the old plan that’s now expiring. The new plan will go to -- for shareholder approval with the AGM and we have announced an acquisition. So we are -- I would say we are executing on our capital allocation strategy of targeting M&A for growth. Now Loupedeck is a modest purchase price, but we are targeting M&A for growth. paying the dividend and growing the dividend and then excess cash returning back to shareholders. So I think we are following our playbook right down the middle.\nAndreas Müller: Okay. Understood. Then last question on the administrative cost is one-timer. What was that exactly?\nChuck Boynton: We don’t disclose the individual details, but it was a kind of millions of dollars. So it’s not a huge number either, but that was sort of a one-timer, so you -- we should see a benefit in Q2.\nAndreas Müller: Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot.\nNate Melihercik: Thanks, Andreas. Our next question is from Michael Foeth at Vontobel.\nChuck Boynton: Michael, I think you are still on mute.\nNate Melihercik: Michael, we will circle back. Let’s go to Samik Chatterjee at J.P. Morgan. Hi, Samik\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Can you hear me very well?\nChuck Boynton: Good morning, Samik.\nNate Melihercik: Yeah.\nChuck Boynton: Yes.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yeah. Okay. Great. So I jumped on a bit late. So I apologize if you have gone through this already. But in some of the PC companies we track, there are expectations for a second half seasonal improvement in PC volumes related to the first half. I am just wondering, as you look at your sort of momentum into the back half of the year, are you associating any improvement given the attach rate that you would typically expect to see with PC volumes into your model or are you largely sort of keeping that as more potential upside that comes -- if that comes through or otherwise you are sort of going to more track flattish half-over-half? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nGuy Gecht: Yeah. We -- part of analysis and reviews, we are closely tracking PC ship and attach rate with that. So, obviously, those are good news from our perspective, the outlook we are seeing with some of the big PC providers. As Chuck said, we are trying to be cautious here. It’s just the first quarter. We are very pleased with the other achievement. Don’t get me wrong. But we are not going to build on other companies talking a little bit more bullish on the second half.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Okay. And for my follow-up, it was an interesting acquisition, Loupedeck to see sort of what you are doing there. But maybe if you can sort of highlight how you are thinking about what addressable market does that have, and as you look at your portfolio, what are the other sort of niche opportunities that you are thinking of in relation to M&A?\nGuy Gecht: Yeah. So on the Loupedeck, it’s a small -- relatively small team but very important IP that will allow us to add very sophisticated capabilities to Keyboard and Mice in the future. And we will use it first in for gamers and creators, but we are seeing the potential beyond that and I will leave it at that. We will talk about it when we get to this. As far as M&A, we review you the M&A funnel. We encourage the team to replenish it, look at that. We have the optionality. We are not desperate for M&A organically. I like our chances and the growth trajectory. But I think we can accelerate in certain areas, whether by small tuck-in or by something larger than that and we want to see -- we, obviously, have to bring it to the Board for approval. If we have targets, we want to see what else is out there that can allow us to accelerate the -- coming back to growth and growth beyond that.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Thank you.\nGuy Gecht: Thank you, Samik.\nNate Melihercik: Thank you. Michael, I believe you are back.\nMichael Foeth: Yeah.\nNate Melihercik: Michael Foeth from Vontobel. Hey, Michael.\nMichael Foeth: Can you hear me now?\nNate Melihercik: Yes.\nChuck Boynton: Yes.\nMichael Foeth: Perfect. Thank you. So just one, you changed your reporting structure for the some of the categories and I was wondering if the -- what’s another now, so the speakers, if you are planning to phase any of these products out and if that has any impact on your rather cautious guidance for the full year as well?\nChuck Boynton: No. We are not phasing those products out. The challenge I gave to the General Manager of that group was grow it on its own standalone category. So we are just trying it for housekeeping. We don’t want a bunch of small cats and dog categories. And so the idea is, put those together, so it’s -- we are focused and then if they can outgrow, then we will create a separate line for them. And that’s the challenge to the General Manager and he’s accepted that challenge.\nMichael Foeth: Okay. So if you can talk maybe just a few words about UE BOOM and if there is any plan to reposition that for growth going forward?\nGuy Gecht: It’s a great question. We actually -- the company invested not much in this, but invested. We are actually expecting a couple of new products in the coming months to do, and I will remind you, we are here to ship, and hopefully, we will energize the category there, but it’s too early to say. And as Chuck just said, he told the GM wants to go out of other, we want to see good growth and we will get you out of other category. But this point, to give you the best transparency on our product categories, we feel like it’s better suited than the others.\nMichael Foeth: Okay. Perfect. Good to hear. Thank you.\nGuy Gecht: Thank you very much.\nNate Melihercik: Our final question for today is from Serge Rotzer at Credit Suisse. Hey, Serge.\nSerge Rotzer: Yes. Good morning, everybody. And basically, I had some of the question like Michael because of this other. I am wondering that you want to see growing these product categories. As in the past, you always said that you take out research and development costs and that you squeeze them down and we know that this product group has the lowest margin. So it gives no sense for me that you want to grow now again in these product groups as it will dilute your margins. So for me, it sounds more that you want to close these product categories at least on your old strategy?\nChuck Boynton: Well, so clearly, we -- our goal is to grow the company profitably and there’s a margin threshold. So the challenge for the team is to build great products and grow those with attractive margins that make sense for the company and if they don’t meet our thresholds, then we will not seek to grow those. What we have been doing historically in those categories is kind of profit max, not investing necessarily, but harvesting the profits and I believe there’s a strategy that they can execute to do both. Now we will see. That’s why it’s in the other category. It’s small. It’s not worth you focusing on as an investor today, but the challenge for the internal team is to build great products with attractive margins, and if they can get to the level that it’s worthy, then it will create some standalone category.\nGuy Gecht: Rest assured, there is no product development here that is targeted at a lower margin category. We are -- our dollars -- R&D dollars are going after higher margin, higher growth products.\nSerge Rotzer: And that’s…\nChuck Boynton: Guy and I are aligned. It’s really portfolio management.\nGuy Gecht: Right.\nChuck Boynton: How do you manage the portfolio for growth and profit, not either or?\nSerge Rotzer: Probably a follow-up here, is there a significant goodwill position linked to these products? So Speakers, Cable [ph], UE BOOM, can you give me any information here?\nChuck Boynton: I don’t believe so. I think that any goodwill associated with those acquisitions would be fairly immaterial.\nSerge Rotzer: Okay. Good. And then the last one, you have increased slightly the CapEx from $90 million to $100 million. Is there any reason or do you start to capitalize some of the OpEx, although it’s a very small position I know?\nChuck Boynton: Yeah. It’s tied to our new building here in Silicon Valley and we hope to have you all visit us here and host you, if you are in town, the Silicon Valley, we have got a really our -- a new office that we are just opening and that we are calling in from today using our great technology. So come visit us here and we will give you a tour of our new facility.\nSerge Rotzer: But still $10 million for a new building change quarter sequential change only three months, so?\nChuck Boynton: Well, it’s -- the accounting rules for leases has changed now. You capitalize operating leases. So I wouldn’t read into it too much.\nSerge Rotzer: Okay. Got it. Many thanks. Move on Chuck for the next quarter.\nChuck Boynton: Thank you.\nGuy Gecht: Thank you.\nNate Melihercik: Thanks, Serge. Guy, Chuck, that wraps up our Q&A for today.\nGuy Gecht: Thank you, Nate. Thank you everybody for joining us. Pleasure to be on the call with everybody and I also want to extend many thanks to the very hardworking Logitech team that allow us to deliver this over achievement and build for a great future. Thank you.\nChuck Boynton: Thanks all.\nNate Melihercik: Thank you."
