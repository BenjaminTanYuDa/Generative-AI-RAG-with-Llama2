Separately, we will be participating in the Barclays and KeyBanc Healthcare conferences during the next three months. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events. I will now turn the call over to Chuck.\nCharles Kummeth: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter conference call. As many of my official tenure as Bio-Techne's Chief Executive Officer ended yesterday, and Kim Kelderman is now in this leadership role. He's taking over a company that is incredibly well-positioned in several of the highest growth life science and diagnostic end markets. I heard Kim to lead a diagnostic and genomic segment in 2018. In November of 2023, he was appointed Chief Operating Officer, as soon as all operational responsibilities for the company. Prior to Bio-Techne, I worked with Kim for four years at Dental Fisher Scientific. I'm excited for the future of Bio-Techne as it continues to flourish under Kim's leadership. When I joined Bio-Techne in 2013, we were a much smaller organization. With approximately $300 million in revenue at the time, the business was a leader in its legacy $3 billion, total addressable market. But growth had largely styled out at the company. This legacy business of research reagents, immune-supply, and diagnostic controls and calibrators, which we refer to as our core, accounted for almost $650 million in revenue in fiscal 2023, and grew at a 7% figure over that period. Through a combination of 19 acquisitions, prioritized organic investments, and execution from our top-notch leadership team, we leveraged these core products and capabilities and grew the business to over $1.1 billion in fiscal 2023, while expanding our cam to an estimated $27 billion. Under the Bio-Techne umbrella, we now augment this core with high-growth market-leading franchises and proteomic annulment instruments, well-engineered therapy, spatial biology, and their leprosy-gnostics. Our team of over 3,000 global employees has accomplished its magnificent growth while maintaining one of the most attractive profitability profiles in our industry. It's been a pleasure getting to know many of you on this call today and leading this talented team over the last 11 years. I have never been more confident in the long-term growth potential of this business and look forward to its continued evolution in the cam leadership. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim.\nKim Kelderman: Thank you for your kind words, Chuck. And please know that all of us here at Bio-Techne wish you the very best going forward. Now to our Q2 results, the Bio-Techne team continued to execute well in a dynamic and constrained market environment. Our industry has faced several headwinds for over a year now, and those also impacted our second quarter, which resulted in an organic revenue decline of about 2%. The sources of these headwinds continue to be a very soft biotech funding environment, destocking by our large OEM and pharma customers, as well as a broad economic challenge in China, which happens to be historically our high-growth geography. Despite the negative impact from these headwinds, the long-term growth potential of our company remains intact. Our strategic growth pillars, such as the protein simple branded portfolio of analytical tools for protein, our spatial biology franchise, as well as our ExoDx liquid biopsy business, all delivered solid growth during the past quarter. In the years ahead, we will continue to bolster these high-growth businesses with market-leading, high-quality content from our core portfolio of research reagents. By the way, our core portfolio with over 6,000 proteins and more than 400,000 antibodies has been a solid growth business by itself, by delivering an average growth rate of about 7% over the past decade. We will continue to drive growth in this core portfolio and leverage a unique follow-catalog, as well as our expertise to enable industry discoveries, fortifier existing growth pillars, and ultimately improve global healthcare. During my transition period to become CEO, I also spent time understanding the efficiencies of our global operational footprint. We evaluated resource needs across all the businesses. We analyzed relatively strategic importance, as well as profitability of various product categories across our overall portfolio. As our operating margins show, Bio-Techne is already a very efficient organization, but with that said, we have been able to identify opportunities to increase efficiencies throughout the global Bio-Techne operating model. In the face of the current environment, we will remain focused on driving our growth pillars, while executing on those aforementioned efficiency increase opportunities. Before I proceed with the specifics of the quarter, I'd like to officially welcome Matt McMannis to Bio-Techne as the president of Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Matt might be familiar name to several of you as he was formerly Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Azenta. Prior to that role, he was leading Bio-Techne's molecular diagnostics business, following our acquisition of Asuragen, where he was the CEO. We are excited to have Matt back at the Bio-Techne family, given his existing knowledge of the business, strong cultural fit and breath of life science leadership experience. He is the ideal leader to take our diagnostics and genomics business to the next stage of growth. Matt runs out the Bio-Techne leadership team that has deep experience and a proven track record of driving growth through market cycles, and I'm excited to lead this talented team going forward. Now let's start with a discussion on our end markets and geographies, biopharma. Biopharma are growth-declined low single digits in the quarter. As we noted at last call, the trajectory for the global biotech sales stepped down at the end of our first quarter and into the early part of our second quarter. This trajectory continued throughout the remainder of that second quarter. The biopharma customers remained very engaged with their sales force, but given the overall funding environment, they took a much more cautious stance on spending in front of their 2024 budget cycles. Onto the academic market -- on the academic side, demand remains very consistent and healthier across the geographies. We drove up a single digit growth in the quarter, and even though we saw a challenging biopharma market, the team has done an excellent job pursuing and converting opportunities in the academic market. From a geographic perspective, you have grew mid single digits. Our strengthened European leadership team continues the positive momentum which we have experienced over the last four quarters. The team executed well, despite the aforementioned spending behavior from our former customers. In North America, we experienced a flatish year-over-year performance. It's worth noting that this is the region where we continue to experience the most significant impact from the soft biotech funding environment. Now moving on to China, you might recall that while accessing our first quarter of the fiscal year, China was highlighted as a geography where we experienced deceleration and spend mostly impacting our portfolio within the protein science segment. These headwinds led to a year-over-year decrease of over 20% in the geography for the quarter. The good news is that following a particularly challenging October and November, the run rate stabilized as we closed the calendar year, and this trend has continued at the start of calendar 2024. While it's difficult to pull the bottom based on two months of performance, we are encouraged with the current trend stabilized. Access to improved healthcare remains the top priority for the China government, and we remain very bullish on the long-term prospects of our product portfolio serving researchers in this region. Now let's discuss our growth pillars, starting with those within our protein science segment. A protein-simple branded portfolio of novel, productivity-driven, analytical tools had a challenging quarter when it comes to new instrument placement. This is related to the budget constraints across biopharma having in China. However, there were a number of green shoots within that portfolio, namely the consumables used specifically on the protein-simple platforms. For the fourth quarter in a row, these consumables have grown by at least 20%, which means that our customers are utilizing our instruments at record levels even when budgets are constrained. Another green shoot has been our Simple Plex platform, an automated multiplexing ELISA instrument, branded Ella. Overall, the platform experienced double-digit growth in Q2 as Ella is becoming the go-to platform in the high-volume accounts, such as CROs and Cell Therapy QC Lab. These accounts perform large translational studies that increasingly rely on the high sensitivity and ease of use of the platform for their multiplexing ELISA needs. As a reminder, we recently received ISO 13485 certification of our Wallingford Connecticut facility. With this important certification in hand, we are now ready to pursue clinical diagnostic opportunities on this instrumentation platform. This will open up a large potential end market for this fast, highly sensitive and easy to use multiplexing immuno-essay instrument. We are encouraged by the number of discussions we are having with potential diagnostic partners and we are taking steps to further position Ella as the platform of choice for high-value diagnostic application. The third green shoot, the narrow protein simple growth pillar has been our biologics platform, branded Maurice. Excluding China, this platform grew over 20% in Q2. We see significant traction of the recent launch of Maurice's flex, specifically in biological drug development and drug production. This makes a lot of sense because in addition to protein charge, protein size and identity capabilities, this next generation platform is also an easy to use replacement for the legacy mass spectrometry fractionation methods including Ion Exchange Chromatography. Following the Maurice's flex launch in March of last year, we are seeing a growing number of publications which is driving awareness and demand for this instrument. I'll shift now to our other major growth pillars within the protein science segment, cell and gene therapy. This business vertical includes our portfolio of proteomic reagents as well as scalable workflow solutions that enable our customers to accelerate progress towards the commercialization of their next generation cell and gene therapies. The customers for these solutions are mainly biotech companies and our Q2 results were therefore equally impacted by the same funding constraints that I talked about earlier. However, short-term funding constraints have not changed our conviction that cell and gene therapy is here to stay. In fact, we believe that these technologies will play a significant role in treating and curing terrible diseases and therefore we will continue to invest in the strategic growth pillar. During the quarter, we filed the first Drug Master File or DMF for an animal free accelerate GMP expansion medium. This filing joins a growing list of almost three filings that span our GMP product portfolio. These DMFs enable our cell therapy customers to cross-reference that filing when submitting to the FDA making their IMD process much easier. This way, our products effectively can expect into our customers workflow. We're also expanding our market leading GMP portfolio to include additional media formulation, gene engineering capabilities and GMP antibodies. These activities will further solidify Bio-Technes market position in this rapidly growing industry. In addition, we are finalizing the closed-to-air-out immune cell therapy manufacturing solution which pairs our GMP proteins and our GMP media with the Wilson-Wolves G-REX. Overall, the protein science segment experienced a full percent organic revenue decrease in the quarter. It's been impacted by the current biotech funding landscape, the order timing among a handful of large biopharma customers, as well as the constrained macro environment in China. But as the green shoots that I discussed already indicate, this segment is positioned for accelerated growth than the macro funding challenges abate. Now let's discuss the growth pillars within our diagnostics and genomics segment starting with our spatial biology franchise. This division includes our ACD-branded products, as well as the Lunaphore branded spatial biology automated solution. ACD's RNA scope continues to play an important role in advancing gene therapy, neurosciences and cancer research. Despite the challenging macro environment, this portfolio remains in high demand, growing mid-teens globally for the quarter. We're also excited about the traction we are experiencing with the recently acquired Lunaphore platform. As a reminder, we are currently commercializing the Comet instrument, a fully automated, high-throughput, high-perplex platform that does not require use of conjugated primary antibody. Comet's high-value proposition is resonating with the translational research community, which is driving significant interest and rapid growth in our installed base. In fact, demand for the Comet instrument exceeded our manufacturing capacity, which created a backlog during this quarter. We are currently scaling our Comet production capacity to meet this strong demand. A final note around our spatial biology business is that we recently announced the upcoming lounge of fully automated spatial multiomics workflow with detection of RNA and protein markers on the same tissue section. This workflow pairs ACDs, RNA-scoped technologies of Lunaphore's fully automated Comet platform, and we will be showcasing this complete solution at the upcoming HBT next week in Orlando. Now, let's discuss our other growth pillar within DGS, the Molecular Diagnostics business. Our ExoDx prostate test provides valuable information on whether a man with a gray-zone PSA score should proceed with an invasive and potentially dangerous prostate biopsy or not. With 30% volume growth in our second quarter, the value of this test continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. Our Exosome-based development pipeline includes single gene mutation tests for monitoring various cancer markers, as well as a colorectal cancer screening test designed for early detection of both colorectal cancer and pre-cancerous pellets. We look forward to sharing additional data on this exciting pipeline in the coming quarters. Overall, the diagnostics and genomic segments grew by 5% organically in the quarter, but was muted by the de-stocking and strict inventory management from our core diagnostics OEM customers. As these OEM customers return to normalized buying patterns, the results from our spatial biology and molecular diagnostic growth pillars will become more visible at the segment level. In summary, I'm extremely proud of the team's ability to navigate the transitory challenges that are impacting both biotechne and the broader life sciences tool industry. Our portfolio of coorley agents, our growth pillars in proteomic analytical tools, in cell and gene therapies, in spatial biology, and in molecular diagnostics are well positioned to improve the quality of life by catalyzing advances in sciences and medicine. Thank you very much, and with that, I'll turn it over to Jim. Jim?\nJames Hippel: Thank you, Kim. I'll start with some additional detail on our Q2 financial performance, then give some thoughts on the financial outlook. Starting with the overall second quarter financial performance, adjusted EPS was $0.40, compared to $0.47 in the prior year quarter. Foreign exchange benefit EPS by $0.02. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.17, compared to $0.31 in the prior year. Q2 revenue was $272.6 million, a decrease of 2% year-over-year on an organic basis, and was flat on a reported basis. Foreign exchange translation had a favorable 1% impact, while acquisitions also contributed 1% to reported growth. Looking at our organic growth by region and end market in Q2, North America declined slightly year-over-year. Europe increased mid-single digits, and China declined over 20% in the quarter. As Kim mentioned, the soft biotech funding environment combined with overall conservatism from our biopharmic customers, were both a drag on our North American business, and to a lesser extent also represented a headwind to our European performance relative to more recent quarters. APAC, outside of China, increased low single digits overall, with government funding constraints in South Korea, partially offset by growth in Japan and India. For China, the soft government funding environment continue to impact the region. Following many months of decelerating run rates in China, we experienced a stabilization in our run rate business in December. Encouragingly, the stabilization has continued as we began calendar 2024. It is challenging to call the bottom in this dynamic geography, that we are optimistic that headwinds going forward will be less severe. It'll likely be a while before we return to the kind of growth rates that we historically achieved in China. But we remain confident that China will still be the fastest growing major region in the world for life science tools over the long term. By end market and Q2, excluding China, biopharmic declined low single digits, while academia grew upper single digits. U.S. revenue on the P&L total company adjusted gross margin was 69.7% in the quarter compared to 71.7% in the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower volume leverage, unfavorable product mix, and the impact of the Luma-4 acquisition. Adjusted SG&A and Q2 was 31.2% of revenue compared to 27.9% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q2 was 8.4% of revenue compared to 8.3% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by the Luma-4 acquisition, partially offset by diligent cost management across the business. The price increases implemented during fiscal year '23 continue to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income, with pricing also largely offsetting the inflationary impact on our operating margin in Q2. Adjusted operating margin for Q2 was 30.1%, a decrease of 540 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the Luma-4 acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q1, adjusted operating margin was 300 basis points lower than the prior year, due to the impact of unfavorable volume leverage and product mix. Looking at our numbers below operating income, net interest expense in Q2 was $3.4 million, increasing $1.2 million compared to the prior year period due to higher debt levels. Our bank debt and the balance sheet as we ended Q2 stood at $447 million, an increase of $7 million compared to last quarter. Other adjusted non-operating income was $3.1 million a quarter, an increase of $3.1 million compared to prior year, primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson-Wilson Adjustment Income and the foreign exchange impacts related to our cash pooling arrangement. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 22%. Flat sequentially, but up 100 basis points compared to the prior year due to geographic mix. Turning to cash flow and return of capital, $83.1 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $14.9 million. Also during Q2, we returned capital to shareholders by a way of $12.5 million in dividend and completed an $80 million buyback of 1.4 million shares. We finished the quarter with 160.1 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q2 in a strong position with $135.6 million in cash, and our total leverage stood below one time due to that. Going forward, M&A remained the top priority for capital allocation. Now I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segment starting with the protein science assignment. Q2 reported sales were $107.7 million, which reported revenue decreasing 3% compared to the prior year period. Organic revenue decreased 4%, but foreign exchange having a 1% favorable impact. As a reminder, is our protein science assignment that has the most exposure to the China geographic region as well as to the biotech and market. Operating margin for the protein science assignment was 40.3%, a decrease of 350 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, as unfavorable volume and product mix were partially offset by cost management initiatives. Turning to the diagnostic syndrome segment, Q2 reported sales were $75.4 million, with reported growth increasing 11% compared to the same quarter last year. Organic revenue growth for the assignment was 5%, with acquisitions having a 5% impact and foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 1%. As Kim previously mentioned, organic growth was driven by our spatial biology and molecular diagnostic growth pillars, partially muted by the de-stocking and older timing of our core diagnostic region-only customers. Moving on to the diagnostics and genomic segment operating margin, at 6%, the segment operating margin decrease compared to the prior year's 12.2% due primarily to the impact of room for acquisition. However, Q2 operating margin improved 530 basis points sequentially from Q1, due to improving volume leverage and favorable mix. As we turn the page on Q2 and look ahead to the back half of our fiscal year, there are still reasons to remain cautious, but there are also some reasons or green shoots, as Kim called them, for optimism in the near term. On the macro front, biotech funding has not dramatically started flooding back, nor has the Chinese economy and funding of life science research returned to its pre-COVID strength. But inflation and interest rates are period of stabilize. And according to some analysts reports, biotech funding has already been reduced to a level not seen since 2016. Having recently bended China and Q2, Kim, Chuck and I all witnessed the local economy on the move with crowded streets and restaurants and busy regional airports. And for several years of COVID shutdown, the local economy is starting to bustle once again and likely generating tax revenue for their government. As for biotech, our growth pillars are continuing to shine even these typical macro conditions. We are closely monitoring sequential run rates in our reagents business to help determine where we are at in this bottoming process. It's early in the new quarter, but thus far we are encouraged that the worst may be behind us. This does not mean we expect a quick acceleration of growth. But we do expect that the trend of decelerating growth that has been pervasive throughout this macroeconomic cycle may have subsided. Down cycles like we experienced over the past 18 months or so are never fun. But the resiliency of our growth pillars throughout this cycle has given us even greater confidence that our company will grow at a double digit growth rate when markets normalize in the long-term. As our markets start to normalize and prepare for the inevitable return to growth, we will continue to diligently manage our cost structure and invest in the business for the future. As Kim mentioned in his opening comments, we continue to identify opportunities for efficiencies and by executing on these opportunities. We'll protect and even grow our adjusting operating margins sequentially for the remainder of the fiscal year. That concludes my prepared comments. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator instructions]. Our first questions come from the line of Puneet Soda with Learink Partners. Please proceed with your questions.\nPuneet Soda: Yeah, hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And Chuck, it was really great working with you and good luck ahead. Kim, welcome on board again. It's good to have you in the role leading the company. And Matt, really glad to have you back at Biotech.net as well. So maybe let me ask my question. It's really around the headwinds that have existed for the last few quarters. You have known them. We have seen that across the industry, China, Biopharma. I think the question really here is what changed in the quarter within your assumptions? You were expecting a flat result in this quarter. You ended up down 2%. So maybe just walk us through, is there something in the portfolio? Is it specific to customer orders? Or is there something in the forecasting process that's not working well that yielded this result versus what you were expecting? And then I have a follow-up.\nCharles Kummeth: Thank you, Puneet. Good morning. And thanks for your kind words towards our team. A great question. I, of course, have an opinion on which of these headwinds are going to be most significant going forward. But in that area of view, we certainly have a good understanding of which ones are most significant. So I'll let Jim talk about that.\nJames Hippel: Yeah, I got Puneet. Good morning. I was the one that called that forecast, so I speak. So I need to speak to it. As we ended the last quarter, we were pretty transparent on the call that in the last couple of weeks, as we closed Q1 in the first few weeks, as we opened Q2, that we've seen a step down in deceleration in our biotech especially, but even a bit in pharma. And so the reality is, and we've talked about this in various conferences throughout, that that trend had continued. And the time of the call, a few weeks doesn't necessarily make a trend. So we took a view on our growth rates decelerating from where they were in Q1. But obviously that trend ended up being longer and deeper than we anticipated. So that's kind of how and why we ended up where we did. That being said, as we look forward, and again, more optimistic view coming out of last quarter and going into this quarter than we did prior quarter in that run rates as we talked about it stabilized in China. And we're just seeing overall stabilization in our business as we enter this quarter relative to how we entered Q2. But I will temper that a bit by saying just like last quarter, a few weeks or even a month doesn't necessarily make a trend either. But we definitely have seen a bit of a momentum shift or at least stabilization from where we are at this point going into this quarter versus last quarter.\nPuneet Soda: Okay, that's helpful. Maybe on the guide, Jim, I just wanted to clarify that you expect this quarter to be a low point based on the comments you mentioned about China early signs and stabilization there and Biopharma remaining status quo. Maybe just help us think about the next two quarters or for the full year just in terms of where models are? If you could walk us through your assumptions on how you're thinking about the growth rate here. I appreciate any context on that.\nJames Hippel: Sure. Well, I would say this. I mean, I talk about that we have a sense that the deceleration is slowing and perhaps stopping. And so what I mean by that is, and I think you've heard this many of our peers already, that kind of expect our Q3 to be somewhat similar to our Q2 in terms of organic growth. Beyond that, it's difficult to call. The whole bottoming process has been difficult to call. But I pretty much agree with what's being set out there by our larger companies who have even greater overall market access that it feels like the first half of the year, '24 will be more difficult than the second half. But we'll obviously get into our planning process here in about three or four months and have more to talk about our fiscal year, '25 following that. But that's pretty much, our view is pretty much consistent with what you're hearing from our peer companies.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your questions.\nJacob Johnson: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Maybe just first to unpack the biopharma commentary. The release suggests those kind of headwinds increased in December. Can you just talk to kind of what you saw then? What caused that or what you think caused that? Maybe the evil CFOs, Jim. And then just as we look ahead, kind of what are you seeing from that end market to start the year? Have you seen any kind of change in customer behaviors, the calendar's turned?\nJames Hippel: I'll start off and I like to comment perhaps, since you mentioned the evil CFO comment. I think that's partly what it was in a sense that I talked about in some prior conferences that in talking to our customers, the interest is as high, it's not highest it's ever been in our products, but getting purchases through, particularly large, any larger purchases through their internal purchasing departments or their finance departments was difficult and there was a sense of hold off until the next calendar year and calendar year budgets are set. And so we'll see if that actually materializes this quarter but there was definitely that conversation, those conversations going on with our customers. But I think, quantitatively, there's been a number of reports put out there by analysts who file very closely the biotech funding and they all basically say that biotech funding was down over 20% in the December quarter and I think down sequentially, like in the mid-teens even. So there was definitely a drop off in biotech funding and that's a decent chunk of our business. So I think that goes without saying that was a clear driver for what occurred within the quarter. \nKim Kelderman: Yeah, let me add to that. You know, obviously, biopharma market has been constrained by lower funding than usual. If not mistaken, we've probably hit the lowest point since 2016. However, our portfolio is well positioned, right? So we have in the quarter the highest quality products that will produce and give you the best results. So you don't have to repeat your experiments, which of course is important in a constrained environment like this. And secondly, our implementation portfolio is to optimize efficiency. So to have fewer people in the laboratory to automate clunky processes, that will give you the efficiencies you need and the reproducibility in your results that you need. So overall, a portfolio is tailored to a constrained environment like this one and I think therefore that we will come out strong once funding normalized.\nJames Hippel: Now I'll just reiterate what Kim talked about in his opening comments to reinforce that, is that our consumables on our instrument platforms were up again this quarter nearly 20% and they'd been up 20% or more every quarter for the past four quarters in this has been a declining market overall the past year. So I think that's a clear sign of how our tools provide the productivity that our customers need in an environment like this. Not to mention the potential pent-up demand for new instruments once funding becomes more prevalent.\nJacob Johnson: Got it. Thanks for all that. And then my follow-up. Kim, you mentioned earlier this year and then on this call again that given the current environment you can look more internally at your footprint and efficiencies. I think there was a restructuring charge in the quarter as well. Can you just elaborate on that statement and kind of what efforts are you taking right now and maybe for Jim how we should think about the impact of those on margins?\nKim Kelderman: Yeah, thanks Jacob. As I think about the constraint environment you always got to make sure that you tailor your organization to be most efficient in such environments. Not only to protect the bottom line but also to make sure that you're most efficient coming out of such constraint period. So yes, we've looked at level loading the capacity of our employees over certain businesses in certain pockets, volumes and revenues are more down in others. So we of course want to make sure that we do the right things there from a worse power point of view. And then secondly, it's a good time to look at which businesses are core and strategic to you. And in our case we found some businesses where there's either a growth profile and or a bottom line profile that doesn't fit our long-term financial strategies and expectations and or businesses that take this proportional amount of management attention and that do not have synergies with our current channels or products. So those are businesses that we will evaluate and over time we'll divest.\nJacob Johnson: Got it. Thanks for taking the questions. Oh, sorry, go ahead Jim.\nJames Hippel: I was going to say with regards to the impact to margins. So what this does is some of the actions we're taking gives us a much higher level of confidence that the margins reported this quarter will be the low point for the year and we'll progress sequentially going forward. And I know you're going to ask me how much and I think we're targeting to get back into the mid-30% range by the end of the year for Q4.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nDan Arias: Good morning guys. Thanks for the questions. Kim or Chuck can you just maybe talk a little bit about the antibodies business and the antibodies market just given that there are a decent number of moving parts in the mix when it comes to the environment and environment, It would just be great to get some color on what you think is relevant when it comes to the portfolio, pricing, share changes, etc.?\nCharles Kummeth: Yeah Dan, thank you so much for your question. Our antibody business has done quite well. I think it's been running at the low single digits even in this environment. So with the Headwins in Biopharma, we certainly have to make sure that some of our sales force focuses on academic markets and make sure they close deals over there and we get better in that space. Our quality of our antibodies is world renowned and we know that we can compete even at higher prices with other antibody companies and we are really confident that we will be able to continue to do so. Of course, we have had some head-wins in addition from de-stocking where people would have fewer or less antibodies on the shelf. However, we feel confident that that symptom is now towards the end of its face so that we feel that HAT win will abate.\nDan Arias: Okay, helpful. And then Jim, I hate to ask about 2025 since the second half of this year is tough to call, but if I go back to the analyst's day and I think about the growth platforms that you guys highlighted, four or five of them had double digit market growth rates attached to them. So does it feel like six to 12 months from now your growth verticals are ramped up enough and the comps are favorable enough to where a two-digit growth number that's more typical of what you've done in the past comes back into the picture?\nJames Hippel: Yeah, what I'd say is this, Dan, is that we have a high level of confidence given our relative performance of our growth pillars even in this environment that once the market gets back to its long-term four or six, let's call it mid-single-digit growth trajectory, that we will be well into the double-digit growth once our core is back up there and then, of course, the growth pillar is on top of that. So, asking how long it takes to get there is also asking how long it takes for the market, overall market to normalize, and I don't have a crystal ball on that, but assuming it does normalize as we get into the end of calendar year '25 and, hopefully by then, then the answer would be yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question has come from the lawn of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your questions. \nPatrick Donnelly: Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question and Chuck, a second. My congrats there. You know, maybe Jim, on the near-term, just to recue a piece, we're getting a good amount of questions just in terms of how to think about it. You know, is it flat? Is that the right organic, kind of near over-near number to think about 3C? If you could just help us kind of frame up the near-term, it would be helpful on the organic roadside.\nCharles Kummeth: Yeah, I mean, specifically, right now, our base case is that the growth rate we experience in Q3 will be similar to the growth rate we saw in Q2. So the deceleration of our growth rate that we've seen, the deceleration of our growth rate that we've seen in the past three or four quarters we think is behind us.\nPatrick Donnelly: Yes, I understand. Okay. And then maybe in China, it sounds like, obviously, Jim, we chatted and you were over there. Maybe just talk about your expectations for the recovery in that region?\nJames Hippel: I know in the past, whether it was government or whatever it may be, you guys saw some real snapbacks quarter to quarter. Last time we chatted, it sounded like that was a little less likely, maybe a little more of a stability into a gradual recovery. But maybe just talk to us about what you saw over there and again, the expectations over the next few quarters relative to some of the past cycles that we've seen. Thank you, Patrick. I'm going to hand this over to Kim. I know we feel exactly the same way about this, but he was there actually more recently than I even was. So go ahead, Kim.\nKim Kelderman: Yeah, Patrick. Well, thanks for the question. What we feel is that, obviously, China is an important country to us, right? Ten percent of our revenues come from there. We have been able to outgrow most of our peers over the last half decade. But that also made it tough over the last couple of quarters where China truly came to a standstill. And we feel that the activity in China is stabilizing. We do not see a clear light at the end of the funnel. Our comparables are going to be a little bit better in the coming quarters, but not for instruments, right? So it's not that we are over that hump. We do think, though, that China is going to be a fast growing market in the future. We do expect that China will have a kind of a bias towards China for China. Therefore, we are building a local GMP facility to serve the local market. And then at the end of the day, we feel that our products with the high quality and the automation aspects will increase efficiency and will continue to find a real good spot in China. And I think that the current pull-through of our consumables shows that the instruments are getting used at a record pace at the moment. As I mentioned, we are long-term believers in China, and we believe that China will get back to normalized funding and use the funds to prioritize health care. So we are very optimistic over time. But if you ask when or what will trigger a V-shaped recovery that I won't be able to answer, we think it will be a slower recovery than usually.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Dan Leonard with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nDan Leonard: Hi, thank you. I just want to make sure I understand the decline in the protein sciences business. You commented on the antibody trends to Dan Arias, low single-digit growth. But can you speak to the growth rate of core reagents and aggregate, so your antibodies, proteins, ELISA? And how steep was the decline in instrument revenue?\nKim Kelderman: Yeah, I'll jump on this one and then can comment further. Dan, thanks for the question. We're not going to give specifics at that level of detail, but what I would say is that in general, our overall, our reagents were down year over year, even though antibodies were slightly up. And our instruments were down as well, given the capital constraints in particular from our customers. However, again, as I mentioned again, the cartridges and consumables that are used specifically on those instruments were up nearly 20%. Cell and gene therapy is a big user of our reagents and also a high concentration of our biotech customers. And so that also impacted, we think, temporarily our reagent sales within the quarter.\nDan Leonard: Understood. And Jim, possibly you could comment on the growth rate for the cell and gene therapy portfolio specifically, either just GMP proteins or more holistically as you measure all the touch points you have in that market?\nJames Hippel: Yeah. Well, it was down year over year. I'm not going to give specifics to how much it was down, but I think an encouraging point is that the actual number of orders, invoices, et cetera, that we sold was still at an all-time record level. So what that tells us is that the customers were being more conservative in their purchases in terms of quantities, but still very active in their research within cell and gene therapy.\nKim Kelderman: Okay. Thank you. I can add some information there. I think that, as Jim mentioned, the volume of orders was higher than usual, but we did have a couple of larger orders push out. The thing that we can do as a company is make sure that we have new product introductions and the team is set to add five new GMP proteins to be released in the coming quarters so that we have a broader portfolio that serves more customers, and we'll also increase share of wallets. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Matthew Larew with William Blair. Please proceed with your questions.\nMatthew Larew: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the biopharmic comments because obviously you referenced sort of a further deterioration in the quarter, which you had set up on the last call, but on the press release mentioned conservatism from a subset of biotech customers. So I guess if I just think about sources of the Edwin being funding-related versus being perhaps budget-related at biopharma companies that may have commercial assets, but again, we're just going through the budget process. What do you view as more of the gain factor? Are you waiting for turnaround and funding, or is it more just budgets had to get put in place and now there might be more constructive conversations?\nJames Hippel: Yeah, I think for us, given our waiting of customer base, the biotech funding was the biggest driver. I think the conservatism from pharma was secondary and hopefully much more transitory. So I think that's our view. Kim?\nKim Kelderman: No, I would agree. Okay, fair enough. And then obviously you referenced M&A continuing to be a high priority and looks like some deals are starting to get done.\nMatthew Larew: Just curious, obviously you had the Lunaphore acquisition here recently, either from a size portfolio perspective. What are you seeing out there that's interesting and are you starting to see evaluations move more in line with public markets?\nKim Kelderman: Yeah, thanks for the question. To quickly jump on to the Lunaphore acquisition, it's obviously, we are very, very happy with the acquisition itself. The assets, the team is amazing. Integration is going well. And of course, it will give us a fantastic position in the lucrative and fast-growing spatial biology market. As this instrument, the Comet, will give us fully automated capabilities and multi-alcoholic aspects where we can look at proteins and RNA in the same slide and then combining that with the ACD portfolio and our antibodies here in our systems. It's an unbelievable value proposition. We would love to do more of those. So we are always on the lookout. We have interest in looking at filling out our sub-engine therapy portfolios. We would like, if there's opportunities, to strengthen our core. We've talked about the four growth verticals and if we can bolt something on to make those even stronger and get our positions more differentiated, that'd be fantastic. And any opportunity that pulls through our core reagents is really on our list. And as we always maintain the long list, but we will be disciplined in picking opportunities that would meet or exceed our financial expectations over time, which is basically contributing to the financial expectations that we've all set to by technique overall. And whether this would be a small or large or public or private company, we really don't select between that. We are open to any target that fits the mold that I just described.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your questions.\nCatherine Schulte: Hey guys, thanks for the questions and congrats Chuck on the retirement. Maybe first in pharma and biotech, I think you said down low single digits outside of China. You just talk a little about what you're seeing from emerging biotech versus kind of mid-sized and large customers and how you see those two groups playing out going forward?\nJames Hippel: Yeah. Hi Catherine. Thanks for the question. It's difficult to ascertain exactly small, sometimes smaller and larger biotechs, as many of these are private companies and hopefully they are, isn't always easy to determine. But I would just say, in generally speaking, the smaller the biotech, usually the more difficult the funding situation is. That being said, we haven't been at the JPMorgan conference, called another green shoot perhaps, but the level of activity that we saw around VC firms, private equity firms in general, out sniffing around for all kinds of investment opportunities, whether it was in tools or whether it was in biotech, et cetera, was some of the highest levels that I've seen in many years there. So, again, encouraging that perhaps the drought and funding has hit its low point and might come back this calendar year and that will obviously benefit our smaller biotech customers.  Yeah, I never can add to that. I think that the smaller and newer biopharmac companies obviously are in a different life cycle. So they typically still have to build out their labs and define their processes and validate the way they measure things. So that's where we see, our automation platforms, of course, being placed. And then the midsize ones are often running and they might have repositioned a number of projects to run in parallel, but certainly they typically already have our instrumentation. They're a little bit more consumable-oriented because they are pulling through these consumables. And then large pharma has gone through a phase where they repositioned the portfolios just as well. And there we see a mix, right? So there's a capacity expansion by buying more instruments and there's, of course, the pull-through and consumable. So that's how I look at the influence versus size.\nCatherine Schulte: Okay, got it. And then you talked about these decelerating trends, hopefully being behind you here and three-q organic growth, both looking similar to the second quarter. Do you think we could see a return to positive organic growth in 4Q, or is that more likely going to be a fiscal 25 event?\nJames Hippel: Anything's possible, Catherine. Sure. I mean, is that within the wiggle room of possibilities? Yes, in fact, the tide is turning some momentum and China truly stabilizes. I think there's a potential for it. I'm not, I would say, I'd mute it by saying it would be flight growth probably, but I think there's a potential for it. We're seeing sequential improvement in our businesses, so that's encouraging.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question has come from the line of Alex Nowak with Craig Hallam. Please proceed with your questions.\nAlex Nowak: All right. Good morning, everyone. How is Wilson Wolf progressing since you made that investment there? Just curious where they deployed the cash, the cash infusion, and just how they're handling the biotech funding environment?\nJames Hippel: Yeah, thank you for the question. So Wilson Wolf has tremendous progress behind them now in this last year. Overall, the year was hard because the, some of the early stage activities and clinical projects have been canceled. So overall, they're down mid-single digits, but the last quarter and last has been much, much better back in the black, and we do see a progress in the pipeline. We see that there are various clinical studies rolling into next phases, and we even see an approval upcoming where the G-REX is packed in. So overall, we believe that Wilson Wolf will be doing great again, and we know that John Wilson has invested in activities that bolster the adoption of our G-REX and the Wilson Wolf franchise. As we have a very genius deal structure around the Wilson Wolf, and at the latest, it's the end of calendar year 2027 that Wilson Wolf will be fully part of the biotech new family. I'll just add too, with regards to their financial performance, they had a tough calendar year '23 like we all have, but they actually did see significant sequential improvement in their December quarter and are expecting continued sequential improvement from there. So that's encouraging also. Given their, they have even much wider visibility into the cell and gene therapy market than we do.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Kim Kellehrman for any closing remarks.\nKim Kelderman: Yeah, thank you, and thanks everyone for joining the call. Of course, one last time, thank you Chuck for your leadership over the last decade plus. As you can hear, I'm excited about the long-term position and our prospects as a company. We have a great strategy in place. I'm also very proud of the biotech need team for executing so well in this constrained environment. And I'm absolutely looking forward to navigating these constraints and I'm looking forward to speaking again at our next earnings release.\nOperator: Thank you. That does include today's telecom. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Bio-Techne Earnings Conference Call for the First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to David Clair, Bio-Techne's Vice President, Investor Relations.\nDavid Clair: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me this morning are Chuck Kummeth, Bio-Techne's Chief Executive Officer; Jim Hippel, Chief Financial Officer; and Kim Kelderman, Chief Operating Officer. Before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement. Some of the comments made during this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements, including beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. The company's 10-K for fiscal year 2023 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements made during this call. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements because of any new information or future events or developments. The 10-K as well as the company's other SEC filings, are available on the company's website within its Investor Relations section. During the call, non-GAAP financial measures may be used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business performance. Tables reconciling these measures to most comparable GAAP measures are available in the company's press release issued earlier this morning on the Bio-Techne Corporation website at www.bio-techne.com. Separately, we'll be participating in the Stifel, Stephens, Evercore and JPMorgan health care conferences in the coming months. We look forward to connecting with many of you at these upcoming events. I will now turn the call over to Chuck.\nCharles Kummeth: Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter conference call. The Bio-Techne team continues to execute in a challenging environment as we delivered 2% organic growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 despite several headwinds that are impacting the broader industry as well as Bio-Techne.  The sources of these headwinds have remained relatively consistent during recent quarters, including a soft biotech funding environment, inventory destocking from a handful of our OEM customers, as well as broad economic challenges in one of our historically highest growing geographies, China. While the primary culprits remain the same, the impact of the biopharma funding challenges in the U.S. as well as the evolving macroeconomic environment in China were higher than our original expectations for the quarter, albeit not as onerous as we saw with many of our peers. Despite these transitory challenges, our growth pillars remain intact and continue to perform well.  Specifically, our GMP proteins business, ExoDx prostate and our Protein Simple franchise all delivered impressive growth in the quarter. Our portfolio remains incredibly well positioned in several high-growth and unpenetrated end markets, and our team will continue to leverage our strategic playbook and strong financial position to gain share, enter adjacent markets, introduce innovative products and solutions and capitalize on the tremendous opportunity in front of the company. Before we dig deeper into the performance of the quarter, I'd like to personally congratulate Kim Kelderman on his recent appointment as Bio-Techne's incoming Chief Executive Officer effective February 1, 2024. In the meantime, I will continue to lead Bio-Techne's CEO, and work closely with Kim in his new role as Chief Operating Officer until Kim takes the reins as Bio-Techne's CEO in February. I will continue to support Kim in a senior advisory capacity prior to my retirement from the company and the Board on July 1, 2024. Kim has successfully led the Diagnostics and Genomics segment since joining the company in 2018. During Kim's leadership of this segment, the team gained significant market acceptance and traction with the ExoDx prostate test, the revenue of our ASV business totaled the segment portfolio was strengthened through the Asuragen and Lunaphore acquisitions and multiple new product introductions and partnerships position the business for future growth.  Prior to joining Bio-Techne, Kim ran multiple large businesses at ThermoFisher Scientific including most recently leading its genetic analysis business unit. Kim will be taking over an incredibly strong and talented team as well as a novel portfolio with leadership positions in some of the fastest-growing life science tools and diagnostic markets.  Kim has been working with me since 2009, so I can assure everyone that I know he is more than ready for this tremendous opportunity, and he is the right person to take Bio-Techne on our 10-year forward journey to $5-plus billion revenue as a target as outlined recently at our Investor Day in New York. I'd like to also thank both Roll Gus and Jim Hippel, who created an incredibly difficult decision for the Board. Jim and extra thanks, as he, too, has been with me since 2009 and is the best financial partner I've ever worked with. Separately, I'd like to highlight Bio-Techne's latest Corporate Sustainability Report, which showcases the continued progress the company is making in its environmental, social and governance or ESG initiatives. The report is available in the corporate and social responsibility section of Bio-Techne's website. As you will see in the report, Biotech remains committed to our employees and the communities where we live and work. We are proud of the innovative culture we have built as well as our commitment to corporate governance and operational integrity. Driving durable, sustainable and responsible growth remains a cornerstone of our forward strategy. Now let's get into the details of the quarter, starting with an overview of our performance by geography and end market. Europe had a very strong quarter as the region grew mid-teens overall, including particularly strong performance from our biopharma end market. As a reminder, Europe was the region that was first experienced the effects of the post COVID slowdown, which contributed to a high single-digit decline in the comparable quarter of our last fiscal year.  That said, the European biopharma and academic end markets remain stable, and the new leadership team has maintained the positive momentum we experienced in the region over the last three quarters. In North America, we delivered as expected mid-single-digit growth with the performance in the region nearing the growth rate we experienced in the region last quarter and last fiscal year. It's worth noting that this is the region where we are noticing the most impact from the soft biotech funding environment as a subset of these customers continue to exhibit a disciplined approach to managing the businesses in the current environment. Now let's discuss the geography remains at the top of everyone's mind, China. This region declined low teens during the quarter and underperformed our original expectations with the business climate deteriorating as the quarter progressed. The funding challenges we highlighted in the last earnings call persisted in the quarter, as Chinese government funding for life sciences R&D at hospitals and academic institutions is significantly lower than last year. Given the challenging macroeconomic conditions in China, it remains very difficult to ascertain when R&D funding will stabilize and step back up again. Additionally, private equity and VC funding activity has slowed in the geography, which is creating more cautious near-term spending patterns for cash-dependent biopharma companies in the region. We view the temporary pause in China's growth trajectory as transitory as the government remains focused on modernizing health care in both large metropolitan areas and rural communities. Our portfolio remains extremely well positioned in this geography as our proteomics research reagents and analytical tools and increasingly our spatial biology solutions are the tools researchers rely on to advance scientific discoveries and improve health care. We are as bullish as we have ever been on our long-term opportunities in China, but acknowledge that these headwinds will likely linger in the near term before improving. Now I'll highlight the growth pillars that will propel our future, starting with those within the Protein Sciences segment, where organic growth was 2% in the current quarter. During the quarter, we continued to advance our portfolio of cell and gene therapy initiatives as our portfolio of proteomics reagents and workflow solutions continue to enable our customers to further their therapeutic development work and make continued progress towards the commercialization of these next-generation therapies. Collectively, our portfolio of cell and gene therapy products and services increased over 25% in the quarter. GMP proteins remains the cornerstone of our cell therapy offering and Bio-Techne continues to benefit from having the broadest menu available, including several proteins that are unique to Bio-Techne. This broad offering is a critical selling point for customers working across the cell therapy spectrum especially in regenerative medicine cell therapies as these tend to require not only several different proteins in the workflow, but also require complex proteins that are very difficult to manufacture, playing right into one of biotech strong suits. Overall, our portfolio of GMP proteins grew nearly 40% in the quarter. We also continue to gain traction with our portfolio of GMP small molecules. Recall that these small molecules are key components in the route programming, self-renewal, storage and differentiation processes that are key to regenerative medicine workflows. This business grew almost 20% in the quarter and is on its way to becoming a significant contributor to our overall cell and gene therapy business. We are in the process of expanding our G&P portfolio to include additional media formulations, gene edit engineering capabilities and antibodies, positioning Bio-Techne to remain a leader in this rapidly growing industry. Additionally, work continues to finalize our aseptic immune cell therapy manufacturing solution, which pairs our GMP proteins, GMP Media and Wilson Wolf G-Rex in a closed sterile manufacturing solution. Moving on to our ProteinSimple branded portfolio or proteomic analytical tools. Here, the team delivered 9% organic growth. It's worth noting that excluding China, the portfolio grew an even more impressive 18%, including over 35% growth in Europe. Consumable pull-through from our growing installed base remains very strong and continues to grow on a per instrument basis, reflecting the high value and productivity gains that these instruments deliver to our biopharma and academic customers.  The ProteinSimple performance was led by our Simple Plex automated multiplexing ELISA instrument branded as Ella, who is expanding menu of validated assays, including 7 launches in Q1 and a growing installed base is driving consumable pull-through on the platform. We've recently received ISO 1345 certification of our Wallingford, Connecticut facility quality management system, demonstrating our commitment to producing products for clinical applications. With this important certification in hand, we are now ready to pursue clinical diagnostic opportunities on Ella, opening up a large potential market for this fast, highly sensitive and easy-to-use multiplexing immunoassay instruments. Momentum continued in our Biologics business as we experienced continued uptake of our Maurice Flex instrument and strong demand for consumables. As a reminder, Maurice Flex's protein charge variant fractionation capabilities position this next-gen instrument is an easy-to-use replacement for legacy mass spectrometry fractionation, methods, including ion exchange chromatography.  This new application enters Maurice into a new $300 million market approximately doubling the addressable market opportunity for the instrument. The capabilities of our legacy Maurice instrument as well as the next-gen Maurice Flex were recently highlighted by scientists from top pharmaceutical companies at the recent CE Farm conference, including a presentation from Pfizer scientists on Maurice Flex's capabilities for peak identification of AAV capsid proteins through fractionation. I would note that there are several other Maurice Flex collaborations in progress with additional top-tier life science companies. Our fully automated Western blot solution branded as Simple Western also continued to increase its market share this quarter. The platform's ability to reduce the 2-day long manual and messy western blotting process into a 3-hour push button, highly reproducible solution continues to drive demand within our biopharma and academic customer bases.  We are also seeing robust adoption of Simple Western in cell and gene therapy applications, with the system increasingly being utilized to measure protein expression potency, empty versus full capsid ratio, and for process impurity detection. Revenue from cell and gene therapy applications in Simple Western increased over 25% in the quarter and now account for almost a quarter of the associated product right of revenue. Next, I'll highlight the growth pillars within our Diagnostics and Genomics segment, where organic revenue growth was flat in the current quarter compared to prior year. Mostly due to the timing of large OEM orders within our diagnostics reagents business as well as large lab orders for genetic tests within our molecular diagnostic business.  I'll start with our ExoDx prostate test, where we once again drove significant growth in test volume as the valuable information on whether a man with an indeterminate PSA score should proceed with an invasive and potentially dangerous prostate biopsy continues to resonate with both patients and physicians. ExoDx prostate volume increased nearly 50% compared to prior quarter, while year quarter, while revenue increased in the upper teens. Adjusting for our prior year cash to accrual adjustment, year-over-year revenue growth was approximately in line with our test volume growth. As we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, applications for our exosome-based diagnostic platform are much broader than our current ExoDx prostate test. Our pipeline includes single gene mutation test for monitoring several different cancers, a saliva-based test for the diagnosis of children syndrome a next-generation prostate cancer rule in test as well as a colorectal cancer screening test designed for early detection of both colorectal cancer and precancerous polyps. We look forward to sharing additional data on this exciting pipeline in coming quarters. Now let's discuss our spatial biology business, which includes our ACD-branded catalog of over 47,000 unique probes as well as the Luna for branded spatial biology instrument assay and software portfolio. Our spatial biology business increased upper single digits organically for the quarter as our broad portfolio of multi-omic assays continue to play an important role in advancing gene therapy, neuroscience and cancer research.  Within the portfolio, we are experiencing continued momentum in base scope, which enables the detection of target sequences down to one nucleotide differences and microRNA scope for the visualization of microRNA and other nucleic acid targets. BaseScope and micro RNA scope increased almost 20% and 50%, respectively, and are experiencing increasing acceptance and traction in gene therapy applications. Integration efforts of our latest acquisition, Lunaphore, are off to a great start and the team is embracing their new home under the biotech umbrella. As a reminder, Lunaphore for is currently commercializing its common instrument, a fully automated, high-throughput Hyperflex platform that does not require the use of conjugated primary antibodies. [indiscernible] high value proposition is resonating with the translational research community, which is driving significant interest and rapid growth in its installed base.  We continue to make progress developing the first fully automated spatial and multiomic workflow that will leverage Lunaphore's common instruments, Inspire antibody panels as well as ACD's RNAscope Hipple technology to enable protein and RNA detection and visualization on a single slide. In summary, the Bio-Techne team continues to execute our strategic growth plan in this challenging environment. As we look at our relative performance to many of the life science companies that have reported so far this quarter, I'm especially proud of our team's execution and have even more confidence in the perseverance of our growth platforms.  As we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, our portfolio of proteomic research reagents, cell and gene therapy workflow solutions, analytical tools, spatial biology products and liquid biopsy diagnostics are aimed squarely at a $27 billion vessel market with amazing long-term growth prospects. Initiatives to cure cancer, neurodegenerative and other diseases, along with understanding how these diseases develop and evolve, we remain a social priority for the foreseeable future, and Bio-Techne's portfolio will continue to play a critical role in these efforts. I am looking forward to when the transitory headwinds facing our industry subside, allowing the growth of our high-value tools to once again shine through. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim.\nJames Hippel : Thanks, Chuck. I'll start with some additional detail on our Q1 financial performance, then give some thoughts on the financial outlook. Starting with the overall first quarter financial performance. Adjusted EPS was $0.41 compared to $0.45 in the prior year quarter, a decrease of 9% over last year. Foreign exchange had a had an immaterial impact on EPS in the quarter. GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.31 compared to $0.55 in the prior year. Q1 revenue was $276.9 million, an increase of 2% year-over-year on an organic basis and 3% on a reported basis. Foreign exchange translation had an immaterial impact, while acquisitions contributed 1% to reported growth. Moving on to our organic growth by region and end market in Q1. North America grew mid-single digits. Europe increased mid-teens, and China declined low teens in the quarter. As Chuck previously mentioned, the soft biotech funding environment remained a drag on our North American business, while Europe saw strong growth but also had a less difficult comp as the region declined high single digits in the comparable quarter last year. For China, the funding environment continued to impact the region. Our long-term enthusiasm on China remains fully intact. Health care remains a top priority for the government and our proteomic reagents, analytical tools and spatial biology solutions will play a critical role advancing health care in this country.  That said, the timing of this recovery remains incrementally more challenging to call at this point. Meanwhile, APAC outside of China increased low single digits overall, with government funding constraints in Japan and South Korea. By end market in Q1, both biopharma and academia excluding China, grew upper single digits. However, the biopharma growth was much larger in Europe given the less difficult comps. Below revenue on the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 71.3% in the quarter compared to 70.9% in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by productivity gains and foreign exchange partially offset by the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition.  Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 31.3% of revenue compared to 27.3% in the prior year, while R&D expense in Q1 was 8.7% of revenue compared to 8.9% in the prior year. The increase in SG&A was driven primarily by the Lunaphore acquisition and, to a lesser extent, strategic investments to position the business for future growth. The price increases implemented during the first half of fiscal year '23 continue to offset the dollar impact of inflation to operating income with pricing also largely offsetting the inflationary impact in our operating margin in Q1. Adjusted operating margin for Q1 was 31.4%, a decrease of 340 basis points from the prior year period. Excluding the Lunaphore acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q1, adjusted operating margin was 100 basis points lower than the prior year due to strategic investments, which was partially offset by diligent cost management. Looking at our numbers below operating income. Net interest expense in Q1 was $3.9 million, increasing $1 million compared to the prior year period due to higher debt levels, partially offset by higher interest income and cash deposits. Our bank debt on the balance sheet as of the end of Q1 stood at $440 million, an increase of $90 million compared to last quarter, reflecting the Lunaphore acquisition, which was partially funded by debt and cash on hand. Other adjusted nonoperating income was $1.6 million in the quarter, an increase of $0.4 million compared to prior year, primarily reflecting our 20% share of Wilson Wolf's adjusted net income partially offset by the foreign exchange impact related to our cash pooling arrangements. Moving further down the P&L, our adjusted effective tax rate in Q1 was 22%, a sequential increase from our Q4 tax rate due to international mix. Turning to cash flow and return of capital. $59.4 million of cash was generated from operations in the quarter, and our net investment in capital expenditures was $13.6 million. Also during Q1, we returned capital to shareholders by way of $12.7 million in dividends. We finished the quarter with 161.9 million average diluted shares outstanding. Our balance sheet finished Q1 in a strong position with $148.7 million in cash, and our total leverage ratio remained below 1x EBITDA. Going forward, M&A remains a top priority for capital allocation. Before we get into the segment results, I'd like to quantify some of the impacts from headwinds we experienced in the quarter compared to our initial expectations for organic growth. A more challenging China funding and macro environment than expected represented an additional approximately 200 basis points headwind, while order timing in our Diagnostics and Genomics segment was another unanticipated headwind of approximately 100 basis points. The more cautious spending from our biotech customers, which we primarily experienced in the U.S. is more difficult to quantify that impacted the business none the less, especially in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. Now I'll discuss the performance of our reporting segments, starting with Protein Sciences. Q1 reported sales were $204.7 million, with both reported and organic revenue increasing 2% compared to the same period last year. As a reminder, it is our Protein Sciences segment that has the most exposure to the China geographic region as well as to the biotech end market. Operating margin for the Protein Sciences segment was 43.2%, and an increase of 20 basis points compared to the prior year quarter as productivity gains and cost management more than offset the impact from strategic investments. Turning to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Q1 reported sales were $72.8 million, with reported growth increasing 4% compared to the same quarter last year. Organic revenue growth for the segment was flat with acquisitions having a 3% impact and foreign exchange having a favorable impact of 1%. As Chuck previously mentioned, organic growth was negatively impacted by the timing of certain OEM and lab orders for our diagnostic controls and genetic testing products.  However, our Exosome Diagnostics business remained very strong in the quarter as our fortified marketing message, strong clinical data and the updated Medicare LCD drove both test volume and revenue growth. Also, our spatial biology business delivered upper single-digit growth in the quarter with continued growth in RNA scope and strong performances in our BaseScope and microRNA product lines. We are very pleased with the traction Lunaphore is having with its comment launch, as Chuck highlighted initial integration efforts are progressing well. While Lunaphore will not be in our organic growth rates for the year, they are executing well on their plan to grow more than 100% for the fiscal year. We continue to expect Lunaphore to contribute at least 1.5% to our overall company's reported growth for fiscal '24. Moving on to the Diagnostics and Genomics segment operating margin at 0.7%, the segment's operating margin decreased compared to prior year's 12.4%, due primarily to the impact of the Lunaphore acquisition, and to a lesser extent, strategic growth investments as well as unfavorable product mix. Before we get to Q&A, I'd like to provide some color on our current thoughts regarding the near-term outlook. As many of our life science tools peers have already mentioned, the macro environment in China continues to weaken, and the biopharma end market is softening, especially in the U.S. While we expect these headwinds to negatively impact our growth in the protein scientist segment relative to Q1, we also anticipate the timing of OEM and lab orders within our Diagnostics and Genomics segment to be accretive to growth relative to Q1. Net-net, we are forecasting overall company organic growth to be about flat in Q2. Beyond Q2, the macro environment is dynamic to provide guidance with any sort of results. While the headwinds of OEM destocking should be behind us in the second half of fiscal year '24, it appears right now that a China and biopharma recovery will not be tailwind as we once believed.  Whatever the macro environment throws at us in the near term, our excellent management team and dedicated employees will continue to drive productivity to protect the bottom line, all while selectively investing in the growth pillars that will accelerate our overall company's growth rate when the market headwinds decide and turn back into tailwinds, and the winds will turn.  As Chuck said, society's priority to cure disease is inevitable and endless. Bio-Techne is ready now and will be even more so in the future to help our customers fulfill the societal need. That concludes my prepared comments and with that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator to open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Puneet Souda with SVB Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nPuneet Souda: Yeah, hey guys, Puneet here from Leerink. So just, Chuck, could you maybe just help us clarify, I know a lot of uncertainties right now with China funding and just overall macro. But should we expect a sequential recovery and growth in the second half of this fiscal year?  I know you said flat for the next quarter. but should we expect that to continue to step up from that? And what does that mean in terms of the overall growth for the full fiscal year, if Jim could elaborate on that, that would be super helpful?\nCharles Kummeth: Sure, Puneet. So we just came back from China, and we are pretty much saying what everyone else is saying on their call this past week or -- this quarter was disappointing. China definitely is created, they're out of money. We did talk about funding returning starting next quarter -- last quarter -- and there are some glimmers of that, but not enough to be material. So this next quarter is more of the same. The second half, we're hopeful, but there isn't anything -- any real evidence right now that there's that there's going to be any kind of a V recovery or a recovery at all, to be honest. But the team is very hopeful. There's energy there. Streets are full. The economy looks great at a consumer commercial level. But I think in terms of government funding for this segment, I think, is right now, we're kind of a wait and see.  Now with a bunch of very important KOLs, and they all say the same thing that there's a lot of hope and there's a lot of expectations they don't doubt it's coming, but the government is not roll forward on their planning, obviously. So we're all kind of wait and see. But other segments there look better. It's just a downtime for biotech, and we're going to we've got to grind through it, I guess.\nJames Hippel: And Puneet, I'll just add, I mean, as Chuck alluded to, there's no sign right now any kind of V or even new shape recovery in this fiscal year. So we're just playing it fairly conservative. The China situation is, as Chuck outlined, the other thing dynamic we saw was the U.S. market starts to soften in the last couple of weeks of the quarter and that has continued into October. So that's reflected in our kind of flattish guidance here for Q2, but what's unknown is whether that trend continues beyond that or whether it stabilizes. So hence, we're not commenting on the back half of fiscal year '24 at this point.\nCharles Kummeth: I do want to also emphasize that you take out China, we had a not too bad a quarter, mid- to high single-digit growth, near 20% growth or instruments. All our growth platform is growing -- actually right on plan more or less. They just aren't big enough to cover the company right now. But -- so it won't be too much longer. This kind of stuff won't matter that much. And I do believe in a couple of quarters, China will be -- start becoming a better story. But right now, for 1 more quarter, at least, we're all in a wait and see. So.\nPuneet Souda: Okay. That's helpful. Then could you elaborate a bit more on sort of what you're seeing on the Wilson Wolf side of the business, the contribution you were expecting here for us cell and gene therapy? And how much, if any, that could contribute to sort of the second half growth here in the fiscal second half? And then I mean it seems like a number of unexpected pressures showed up in Diagnostics and Genomics segment. Maybe just talk to us a little bit about sort of the timing and recovery in that as well?\nCharles Kummeth: Okay. I'll mention Wilson Wolf, and I'll let Kim discuss TGS. Wilson Wolf is kind of more of the same, very flattish. We've not lost any customers. We're kind of grinding forward with them, too. They've got 800-plus customers. We've got 400 overall with our protein side, but they are kind of the de facto standard out there in bioreactors. And John has been focusing a lot on scale ready, the sister business that will also carry our workflow through.  That's going extremely well. We have just launched or new versions of our protein to be working towards a sterile type of a bioreactor module, I guess, a bundle. So everything is kind of going okay there. We're just kind of waiting for the overall uptick, but we're not losing ground. It's just kind of treading water right now. And which means they're still making lots of revenue, a meager 75% operating income and pushing forward.  So they're using all that income to keep investing and driving faster. So -- and then Kim wants to follow up.\nKim Kelderman: Yes, Puneet, thanks for the question. So obviously, larger companies have been optimizing their inventories and for us, that mainly impacted the DRD organization as they mainly sell into the large IVD companies. It also affected MDD a little bit, specifically in the genetic testing portfolio, which is the legacy surgeon.  They sell into the laboratory space and the larger laboratory space and of course, these laboratories also want to optimize their inventories, specifically going into the end of the calendar year. But we see those as temporal, and we think that we're at the back end of the destocking phase.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Arias: Hi guys, thanks for the question. Chuck, Simple Western growth stepped up nicely this quarter, particularly given the issue environment that we're in. What do you think drove that? And do you see that as sustainable what do you think a reasonable growth rate for that portion of the portfolio might be this year?\nCharles Kummeth: No, that's a great question. I think we're kind of back to original type thinking on Simple Western. I think we had roughly 9% growth or something like that with it. Consumables was even higher, much higher we're knocking on the door of 3,000 instruments out there, which is still under 20% penetration just for the Western blot application alone.  And there's a bunch of new applications coming using the instruments, including the diagnostic-related applications. So we're super bullish on our Simple Western platform. It's -- we're in early innings yet. So I still think the long-term growth rate for this talk like a decade is like a 15% CAGR for a decade. It's going to go up and down. I think last year, we're still fighting comps. And last year, we had 50% type growth last couple of years. So we're still kind of working through that. And we're still showing growth right now, strong growth and double-digit growth in consumables.  So long term, I think it's going to bounce around 10% to 30%, but it's going to be an average of 15%, I think. And this is the only game in town where this type of technology. We've got strong IP. No one's ever been able to get close to it. It's automated Westerns, which is a nightmare for people. So it's nothing but a great future.\nJames Hippel: Yes, Dan, I'll just add to that. As Chuck just ended with, I think it speaks to the productivity nature of the instrument. We've been saying all along, it's an amazing productivity tool. And in this time, as tightening budgets and concerns about funding should help. That's what's driving the consumable growth there. So it truly is the productivity tool. We've been saying it all along.\nDaniel Arias: Yes. Okay. And then maybe just on ACD, 9% growth, I think you said during the quarter. Do you think that can get back up into the double-digit range? And then along those lines, can you just touch on where you are now just in terms of the need for additional commercial scale up there?  And then whether you think usage in the clinical translational setting is a reasonable expectation in one of the things that you need in order to get back up into that 2-digit number?\nKim Kelderman: Hey Dan, it's Kim. Thanks for the question. Absolutely. I think it was mainly Apex slowing us down a little bit this quarter. By fixing just that or normalizing, we will be back in the double digits. That's the entitlement for not only the end markets but also our unique solution with the RNA scope portfolio of products.  Think about Lunaphore is going to keep this business a boost as well, right? And we will definitely have more pull-through on the Lunaphore boxes, to COMET specifically. And then last but not least, our clinical business has been outpacing the overall product portfolio already and it's becoming more than 10% of our revenues portion. So I think the undoubtedly answer is, yes, it will be back in double digits.\nDaniel Arias: Okay. Just really quickly, Kim, is the percentage of revenues from -- in China for your spatial business similar to the overall corporate average?\nKim Kelderman: No, it's much lower.\nDaniel Arias: Okay, thank you.\nKim Kelderman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Johnson with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. This is Hannah on for Jacob. Thanks for taking my questions. If the macro remains a headwind well into 2024, how does this impact your view on organic investment? Will you try to manage profitability? Or does this change your approach to organic investment?\nCharles Kummeth: Yes. Jim can cover this.\nJames Hippel: Yes. The short answer is no. I mean we are putting in productivity measures in place. We have been anticipating this throughout the quarter, and we continue to do that. We are, of course, pacing our investments accordingly. But our intention is to hold the margin guidance that we gave out earlier in the year. and manage our productivity to that while still investing in our growth platforms.  So we're -- that's what we're paid to do is manage the support of the business given the current environment while still investing for the future, and that's what we intend to do.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. And then can you talk about the outlook in proteins and antibodies for the remainder of the year? Do you expect to end the bulk orders to be coming back?\nCharles Kummeth: Yes, I'll cover that. I just had a meeting yesterday with the team and bulks are on the rise. So that's a very good early indicator that OEM business be returning. Destocking, as Jim said, it's kind of largely behind us. We're starting to see discussion on orders now in some very large orders. So I think we're turning the corner on that. I think our run rate business is hopefully kind of bottomed here.  We'll start positioning that out. I mean we had probably the worst quarter and 10 years of Fisher this last quarter, and we see that kind of flattening as well. I mean they talked about it on their call as well, and where that -- the segment that lives and it couldn't have been very great. But these labs are running out of stuff. They've got to start buying again, and we're starting to see the first inklings of that.  So we think run rate will start improving some. And I think our retail overall will start improving. Remember now, our that's not a majority of our revenue. So it takes all these things together to give us in the double-digit growth. But they all matter. And this part here, I'm kind of bullish looking forward finally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Donnelly with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Donnelly: Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first just on the biopharma performance in the quarter. Can you just talk about what you saw across the customer set and how things progress throughout the quarter, kind of the linear performance?  And then maybe just disaggregate between the trends, smaller biotech versus mid and large pharma, a few peers suggest that things may be deteriorated as the quarter went? So curious what you guys saw?\nCharles Kummeth: Yeah. Well, overall for the company, our academic versus biopharma is largely even about the same, but it was lopsided. So it was much stronger for biopharma in Europe okay, than it was in U.S., U.S. was low almost mid-single-digit growth. So that's a much poorer performance than usual for us in the U.S. As Jim said, most of our pain was in the U.S. and then China and it was on the biopharma side.  All in, without China, we actually didn't do too bad because academic was not too bad. I mean, probably better than many quarters in the past quarter, to be honest. So we're waiting on that biopharma to come back. And of course, as you mentioned, biotech is part of that biopharma and biotech is still soft out there. The funding environment for biotech, small to medium companies going after their second or third round or trying to get that next way the clinical is going or rejuvenate the clinicals they're in, it's just softer. They're all being very careful because money is tight. It's going to change, but it's going to be a quarter or 2, I think on that part of biopharma. Pharma is just being conservative because they're just being conservative because they just see the wins, the way they're looking, and that can turn on a dime. I'll give you some evidence why that can be very, very quick to move. We actually had a very good quarter on our immunoassay, ELISA, dual sets, high single-digit growth. and that was not the case a quarter or 2 ago.  So that could be early evidence of things starting to flip because that's mostly farmer driving most of that business. So ELISA is still more or less a standard for driving testing and clinicals. So.\nPatrick Donnelly: Okay. That's helpful, Chuck. Thanks. And then maybe just a follow-up on China. I guess what do you guys need to see to get a little more constructive in that market? Obviously, the prior guide, you're talking maybe a little bit about a second half recovery curious what you're baking in at this point in terms of the year for China and if there's any visibility into a level of improvement? Thank you, guys.\nCharles Kummeth: Yeah. We went how many -- how many quarters in a row a 25% growth or so. So we're definitely in a lull right now. This is a negative teens quarter coming off of a high teens quarter growth last quarter. But going forward, it's going to be more of the same. I think flattish would be hopeful the next quarter or 2, to be honest. So the second half, our Q4, who knows? I mean it wouldn't take -- we're not that big in China, right, overall.  So it wouldn't take that much or that many orders or rejuvenation in any area to actually get back into some growth. But we'll just have to wait and see. We're just going to be cautious and not overpromise. There's not a lot of evidence, but the attitude is very high. Our team is at full strength. We have 0 attrition. Talked to a lot of customers personally here a couple of weeks ago, and actually, they're fairly bullish as well. We're just waiting for the government to start loosening up here with what they usually do in April, and they still haven't done it. But once they do, people start talking favorably again about China. And you got to believe, and we've talked to a lot of people, health care is still number 1 is a priority for China. It looks great. You're in the middle of Shanghai. You don't have to go too far outside the city and you start seeing why the government is still concerned about health care.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nThomas Peterson: Yeah, hi everyone. This is Tom on for Catherine. Wanted to maybe dig into Europe a little bit. Obviously, had a really strong quarter from an organic growth standpoint. I understand that there are some comp dynamics within that number, but kind of flag the region as perhaps a leading indicator of some of the softness. So curious to the kind of what were the drivers here? And if you have anything to flag from a leading indicator standpoint within Europe?\nCharles Kummeth: Sure. Well, first, as you mentioned, the comps were quite easy. So that helped a lot. But 15% organic growth is 15% organic growth. It's a great quarter to have that. We're not talking about a negative Europe right now. So we're 2 or three quarters into a real recovery for us in Europe. That's also part of the story.  We have a new management team in place. They have done some reorganization a couple of quarters ago. And quite frankly, it's working. We're getting more synergies. We're getting more cross-selling. We're nearly at full strength. We've invested more salespeople as an example, in the Nordic regions.  The new leader is German. Germany should be our biggest subsidiary in Europe and if not, and be correcting that. There's already been great evidence that we're going to have a strong future, I think, in Germany with him at the helm. And I guess wait and see. But I'm -- right now, I'm not focused too much on Europe for a change. Things are going pretty well.\nThomas Peterson: Great. That's helpful. And then clearly, we talked about a number of headwinds throughout the space that are popping up throughout your reports. But with that in mind, I was wondering if you had any comments on sort of your thoughts around the M&A landscape? I mean what does the funnel look like here? Is there any more willingness among private maybe enter those conversations kind of given where we are from a macro perspective?\nCharles Kummeth: Yeah. Well, it's -- we've never been busier to be honest. It's -- I said all year, it's going to be a great year in M&A, we've landed Lunaphore. I just came back from Aldo where I'm on the Board, and I never received more confidence about a deal in my entire tenure here is this Lunaphore deal. It seems like everybody wanted to.  So it's going to be a marvelous platform and it has lots of applications and did we mention the growth year-on-year, 170%. This thing is it's exploding. It's going to be a wonderful asset and Kim personally close that deal. We've been involved in others. I mean we just saw Link. We were there. We know a lot about Olink. We sell them a lot of products. And they're a good partner, and we look forward to continuing our partnership on many fronts with Thermo Fisher with Olink as well.  So it's been a great relationship with Thermo and we don't see any problems there, but we'd sure like to pick up a few more assets like that. There are lots of them out there. You mentioned private. This is definitely the year to be looking at smaller deals, private deals, deals in the core even that funding is tight, and we're seeing multiples kind of picking up. The price takes these latest deals have been pretty good, and that gives hope for owners and they pick up the phone. So I'm still expecting a pretty good coming year here for M&A. We have lots of purchasing power for our size, and we'll try to use it and I mean I'll be gone soon, but I'm sure Jim and Kim and the team here will continue the mission on that.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Matt Larew with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Larew: Chuck, something you -- as Jim called it out in his comments was the headwind around biotech funding. And I think you said that hurt especially in the last couple of weeks of the quarter. And so given that Bio-Techne has been under pressure for some time. Just curious if there was anything that you picked up on in the last couple of weeks or I've noticed a sense on that front?\nJames Hippel: Yes. I mean, we've been saying how biotech was relatively stable for us after its initial kind of drop in the first part of fiscal year '23. And stabilization was pretty consistent up until like I said the last couple of weeks. We saw the run rates drop off. We saw some larger deals not close, and that kind of continued here in October.  I don't have a good answer as to why that's the case, except to say that all of our peers are pretty much saying the same thing. So it appears like as we get into the year-end here, there's another round of belt tightening going on across biopharma, especially in biotech. There's some optimism that it's an end of the year belt piping exercise and once we get into calendar year '24, but new budgets get approved at the business level that we'll start to see the pickup in activity. But again, we're a little bit too early to tell at this point.\nMatthew Larew: Okay. And then sort of aggregating your comments, it sounds like we should be thinking about China continuing down in this low teens as we're modeling out, but obviously, growth in the business ex China, and that's fair to say, even though you're not providing guidance?\nJames Hippel: That is fair to say, and that's consistent with Q1. I think one of the biggest drivers, too, in terms of the about the second half and so forth in diagnostics and genomics. So our growth would have been better this quarter if there weren't for those timing issues that Kim talked about and so we do see a nice snapback in the diagnostics genomics submit going forward.  And to reiterate what I said earlier, in the near term, Protein Sciences can still be very challenged by China. China is going to get worse before it gets better. The view from our teams out in China, we just visited is that Q2 is hopefully the bottom. The question is does it -- is it a dead count bounce for a while? Or is the funding come back in the early part of calendar year '24. That remains to be seen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Nowak with Craig-Hallum. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexander Nowak: Okay. Great, good morning, everyone. Kim, I think we're all very excited to work with you in the CEO position. But maybe just expand maybe the whole team here because you expand on the internal search process in that the board considered Will and Jim as well what ultimately led to the decision here?\nCharles Kummeth: Well, I can't speak for the Board, but we did announce it's very early. I went through that quite carefully. I mean it's going on 1.5 years ago. I think it was very clear why we announced. One, which is uncommon was to give enough time to be very thoughtful in the process, look at leading executives that might have non-competes to work through. I think the Board went through an extensive exhaustive list doing their fiduciary duty, I do know that there was more than a half a dozen external on the list at 1 point.  And -- but I think to say more or less what Bob had said at a meeting recently was there just didn't seem to be that big a difference in what they thought the experience levels and the abilities of the externals versus our three top notch internal candidates, which I spent the last decade and, in some cases, longer from 2 different companies. And so why take the risk externally with their point of view.  And I do think it was a tough decision, as I mentioned, and Kim's thrilled. Jim and Will, I'm sure, are happy for Kim, but they're still here, and we're -- we've been a good team with very low politics for many years together. And both here and Thermo Fisher, where we all came from, and I see no reason why it won't continue. We've got a lot of work to do. Our stock is down like everybody else's in the industry, and so there's a lot of potential upside. We see a path to a $5 billion revenue company in 10 years. And my guess is the stock will be much higher than. So they'll probably stick around.\nAlexander Nowak: Makes total sense. And Kim, there's always been a biotech news that this is a unique combination of biotech products and then call it Diagnostics and Genomics. Would you anticipate with this move here that Bio-Techne is a little bit more diagnostics focus after the transition? Or are you very focused on keeping this truly well-defined high-growth areas?\nKim Kelderman: Absolutely. So the latter, there's no internal bias to either one. I think we have defined our core growth platforms, our true growth platforms, our vertical markets that we're focused on, and I'm going to love all of them equally. And on top of that, some of them have higher potential than others, and we're going to invest in the true growth platforms, and that's going to be the best way for the company as well as for the shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.\nPaul Knight: Yeah. Thanks very much. Chuck, you're a long-time China expert. When you look at the funding, do you -- what portion is the government funding and what portion is this biotech private sector demand that, I guess, developed in the last 5 years? So what's kind of the proportion of this kind of funding discussion you're seeing or your perspective would be super interesting?\nCharles Kummeth: It's a great question, and it's probably a very difficult answer to really answer definitively. You're absolutely right in the last 5 years or so, it's been definitely a drift away from solely relying on government funding and the government plans and the biotech sector has definitely grown in China. And there have been some companies that have come and become real companies like BGI to come to mind that have been very successful.  I think private equity, VC money has grown. I think you've got a lot of Chinese American people that are Chinese and decent have gone home and taken with them business principles and business models from America, and it's gone quite well. We have some great friends there. We know some -- there have been some great track records of some Chinese firms that have been doing venture and done quite well. The percentage, I think, though, is hard to difficult at. I think we still -- we're going more and more direct all the time, all of us there, but we still mainly fulfill through just master distributors in China. And so it's a little bit hard to understand where it already is coming from. There's a run rate component as well and I think that is largely driven by institutions, which are largely government funded.  We have some growing OEM opportunities as well, especially in our DRD segment and there are companies like mine Array and others that have been around a long time and very successful in growing double digit that have taken a bigger and bigger piece of our business and going direct with us. But -- so the government portion is definitely shrinking, but it's still such a major portion of that is going to drive the overall size of the business and the overall, call it, the pulse of the economy over there.\nJames Hippel: Paul, I would add, if I could, that perhaps unlike the U.S., the government funding in China has more indirect impact on VC funding than it does in the U.S. I think VC fund in the U.S. is irrespective of what NIH funding does. But in China, the VC funding often will follow or accentuate what the government does. So that's why following the government money really the lead, we believe on -- with the direction of where our space is going there.\nPaul Knight: Yes. That follow-up on that then to me would be it does appear that the government clearly is behind hospitals and core health care, some numbers across the industry show improvement there. But -- do you think the government still is behind fundamentally picking up R&D to create that biotech sector? So yes, that would be my last follow-up. Thanks.\nCharles Kummeth: I think they're very bullish on that. I think that's something they definitely want. They -- China wants to be in a leadership position as best they can in biotech in life sciences and not being a predicament like they are in semiconductor, for sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Justin Bowers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nJustin Bowers: Hi, good morning, everyone. So just sticking with the topic du jour, where -- you talked about next quarter being potentially the trough for China. And somewhat of a philosophical question. But if we exclude Hope and return to government funding and just think about the infrastructure that's in place now and what's needed to sustain the business. Is 2Q sort of like a good reflection of the run rate?  And just taking a step back, I mean, you guys are outperforming peers a little bit in that market. Some are down 30%, 40%, 50%, right? And there's only so many quarters you can have those sorts of drawdowns before you start cutting into the bone. So just any thoughts on that would...\nCharles Kummeth: Yes, it's a good question. the institutions there, a good comment from our leader in APAC this week, and he said, \"Well, -- they're not really in the cutting people. They're just sitting around playing Mahjong waiting for money to come in.\" So -- but the teams are there. And -- but you're right, they've got to get work done, and they are labs and they've got run rate we need. And I think the -- it's about growth, it's about future growth, it's about money for new programs, but there is a certain level of keep the lights on funding happening. So it's shrinking, but it's not gone away.  So I mean got to put it in perspective there, I think. I think other companies talked with that, too. There's -- we had 17% growth last quarter. In this quarter, we were down mid-teens. Maybe it will be end up being flat, but it isn't like there's no money, no funding. I mean people aren't working or going to work, they're going to work, and they're doing work, but there isn't funding for new programs right now. So everything is kind of at a standstill waiting on that. So that's really the tone going forward. Don't know of any real layoffs. We have our full team right now, and there isn't much attrition. I don't think they're that kind of an economy anyway, but they are playing a lot of Mahjong waiting for the checks to come in. So it's pretty happy team, too. I mean it's -- if you've gone to China as many times as I have, I'm just always come back pretty energized because they're just such hard-working people, and they're just really enjoy seeing you and they really are authentic and you'll never get more honest questions and honest answers from than you will from the teams in China, your teams or customers or anyone for that matter. So just love it.\nJustin Bowers: Got it. And then just one follow-up and sort of ending on a more positive note. Within the ProteinSimple franchise, you talk about a lot of runway left. where have you had the most success, which sort of accounts or which end markets and penetrating and where do you think there's more sort of education that needs to happen around adoption of the platform? And so 15% growth going forward is highly attractive in the comps that you put up this quarter as well. So.\nCharles Kummeth: Yes. Well, we do -- we've got a stable of nice businesses here, a good dozen or so platforms, but three of them are three most important. We put most of our energy and our funding, all had great quarters with 50% growth in Exosome, we had double-digit growth nearly in spatial. We had solid growth in cell and gene therapy, 40% in GMP proteins. We're going to more than double the number of proteins that come out of the factory this coming year. We're building a new factory in China for GMP proteins because the demand there is actually accelerating as well.  So yeah, I think now is the time to be thinking ahead and not be short-term thinking and -- it isn't just our company stock. It's a lot of in our industry. A year from now, this is all, could be all behind us, and there's going to be a fast flight back to quality earnings, and that's us. We make money, and we operate well. But we are definitely can say that we're in a -- we're definitely in a recession. In fact, the whole world is waiting and talking about rates and interest rates are a big issue, obviously, and waiting for a pivot and whether or not we can hit a soft landing and for the economy.  And I'm going to pull out there. I would say, in life sciences, we missed the pit. So in terms of life sciences. It was a hard landing. So we're going to -- but we'll get through it. Disease, neuroscience, cancer. They're not going away on their own. And the big macro trends out there, aging, obesity, things like that are just getting worse, not better. So our time will come again, and the smart investors will be there early. So.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. Mr. Kummeth, I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments.\nCharles Kummeth: Well, again, thanks for the quarter. Probably my last full earnings call. This is like number 42 or something like that. Kim will probably take more of a lead next quarter, and I'll be around for a couple more or so. But we're all pretty energized here and still having a good time, and we love what we do, and we love the science. And anyway, we'll see you next quarter. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."
