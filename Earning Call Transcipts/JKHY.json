I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nVance Sherard: Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; and Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his comments on our business and industry outlook. After Dave concludes his comments, Greg will discuss his transition to CEO, provide commentary on our operations, including updates on our technology modernization strategy and other key initiatives at Jack Henry. Mimi will then provide commentary around the financial results and updated guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements, including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations, events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave.\nDavid Foss: Thank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth. As always, I'd like to begin today by thanking our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue increased by 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Operating income increased 11% for the quarter and increased 14% on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the segments. We again had a solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue was up by 8% for the quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment also performed well, posting a 6% increase in revenue this quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses, with a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 9% increase on a non-GAAP basis.  As I mentioned in the press release, our sales teams again had an outstanding quarter with a number of notable wins. In fact, this was the best second quarter ever for sales bookings and second highest sales quarter in our history, trailing only our June quarter last year. In the second quarter, we inked 14 competitive core takeaways with four of them being multibillion-dollar institutions. Additionally, we signed 12 deals to move existing in-house core clients to our private cloud environment. We continue to see success with our card processing solutions, signing 12 new card processing clients this quarter. We also continue to see strong success signing clients to our Banno digital suite with 135 new contracts in Q2, including 56 contracts for our new Banno business offering. We also surpassed 11 million registered users on the Banno platform, which is a 25% increase over a year ago. I mentioned last quarter that our sales pipeline was at the highest level ever. It's logical to assume that it would be depleted after such a strong sales quarter in Q2. And However, we continue to add to our pipeline, and we ended the quarter on par with Q1, which projects very well for us for the remainder of the sales year. In late January, Cornerstone Advisors published the results of its annual survey of bank and credit union executives. According to that study, nearly 65% of banks and 75% of credit unions expect to increase their technology spending in 2024. This correlates with information we've seen from other sources, including bank director's technology survey last fall, in which a large majority of survey respondents said their bank's technology budget increased over the past year at a median rate of 10%. We are in the midst of conducting our annual Jack Henry strategic benchmark study and we'll share those results on our earnings call in May. We were pleased to have recently received two national workplace awards Newsweek's greatest Workplaces for Diversity and Computer World's Best Places to Work in IT. We also were named as one of America's most responsible companies by Newsweek for our corporate sustainability efforts. We are very proud of that recognition because we view corporate sustainability as a strategic investment for our stakeholders. I encourage you to read our 2024 sustainability report which will be published on March 29 on the Investor page at jackhenry.com. As you all know by now, a couple of weeks ago, I will retire from my current role on June 30 of this year. Greg Adelson will become CEO and President beginning July 1, and I will serve as Executive Board Chair effective on that same day. This transition plan has been carefully considered for some time and we are fortunate to have someone like Greg ready to step into the CEO role. As I said in the press release, it has been my immense pleasure to serve as CEO of this wonderful company for so many years. When I came into this role almost eight years ago, I had a number of large projects I wanted to address, and I'm happy that all of them have now been completed or are well on their way. I'm confident that Greg and the outstanding team we have in place today can continue our trajectory of strong growth, and I'm looking forward to working with them in my new role as Executive Board Chair. Of course, I'll be on the May earnings call, and I have a number of investor meetings scheduled between now and the end of our fiscal year. So, I look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming months. As we focus on the second half of this fiscal year, our sales pipeline is very robust, and we continue to be optimistic about the strength of our technology solutions, our ability to deliver outstanding service to our clients, our ability to expand client relationships, the spending environment and our long-term prospects for success. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg for an operational update.\nGreg Adelson : Thank you, Dave. I'm honored and humbled to become the next CEO of this great company in July. I do want to take a moment to acknowledge the outstanding job that Dave has done as CEO the past eight years. Since Dave became CEO at the start of fiscal year 2017, and Jack Henry has experienced outstanding growth with revenue and net income both up approximately 50%. In addition to driving organic growth, Dave has led 26 acquisitions during his 25 years with the company. The legacy Dave is leaving will be remembered for many years to come. On a personal level, I want to thank Dave for his mentorship and guidance for the past 13 years. He has prepared me well for this role, and I will continue to lead this company with an unwavering focus on our employees, clients and shareholders. As the next CEO, I will continue the strategic journey that we are on today and we'll execute our strategic priorities, which include continuing to enhance our exceptional culture continuing to advance our tradition of customer service excellence, cultivate a one Jack Henry mindset in all we do, drive technology innovation and execution at the speed and scale foster an open ecosystem, evaluate strategic acquisitions that will provide additional value to our clients and shareholders. Jack Henry has maintained a philosophy for over 47 years that starts with treating our associates as our first priority. Happy associates are more invested in ensuring we have happy clients and happy clients ensure we reward our shareholders. In short, you can expect continued focus on growing our company and delivering outstanding value to all of our stakeholders. Dave and I will continue to work closely to ensure a smooth transition in July, and I look forward to collaborating with him in his new role as Executive Board Chair. I'm also excited about continuing to work with the other great leaders at Jack Henry and specifically more closely with Mimi and Vance. Mimi has done an outstanding job since becoming CFO in September of 2022, and Vance provides tremendous perspective for all things Jack Henry. Before I speak to our operational performance, I want to go back to Dave's comments regarding our continued strong sales performance. Dave shared our strong success in winning competitive core takeaways as well as our robust sales pipeline. Additionally, we are beginning to see an increase in what has been historic low merger activity among our financial institutions, specifically with our core clients as the acquirers. Due to this increased demand, we are currently adding resources to both our banking and credit union core conversion teams. On the November earnings call, I promised an update on our technology modernization strategy. As a reminder, this strategy is changing how we deliver our solutions through a cloud-native API-first environment, utilizing several key benefits embedded in the Google Cloud platform, including cutting-edge security and business continuity advancements. The premise of this strategy is rebuilding traditional core and noncore functions into a flexible, cloud-native portfolio of services and solutions. Each component will integrate with other Jack Henry solutions and also with third-party fintech’s via the Jack Henry platform. Our clients will be able to access everything they need to run their financial institution in a single platform with all the advantages that the cloud offers, including extremely high system availability, real-time processing, streamlined operations, rapid update, deployment, modern security standards and extensive scalability. As we have indicated previously, our approach to technology modernization has created more pipeline activity in the larger community bank segment as well as a couple of introductory calls with regional institutions. Another benefit we will realize over time is the shared services model that is at the forefront of our technology modernization strategy. Features or solutions that were once built several times throughout the organization are now developed once and use in multiple solutions. Our ability to develop and deliver more rapidly to our clients is an important benefit that will reduce development costs for each new or enhanced solution. The technology will allow us to share the same services with outside partners and competitors to create a better overall experience for all community and regional financial institutions. At Jack Henry, we are focused on execution and doing what we say we're going to do. So, everything I'm about to discuss is share with our clients through six-month road map visibility. Road maps are updated for all products, including the technology modernization strategy and published every February and August for our clients to view. We hold our teams accountable for road map execution as well. As a reminder, our technology modernization strategy already includes recently launched cloud-native solutions like PayCenter, Banno Business and Financial Crimes Defender. We now have over 250 clients using the real-time payments network and almost 150 using FedNow in our pay center application. For additional context, Jack Henry has approximately 60% of the live real-time payment clients and 35% of the live FedNow clients. We recently announced general availability for Banno business and continue to add both banking and credit union clients. We now have more than 90 clients live and over 70 clients in various stages of implementation. Financial Crimes Defender is also generally available, and we have seven clients live in more than 150 in the implementation queue. One new offering we haven't spoken about yet is our open banking solution that provides turnkey API access to the largest integrated banking data aggregators across the industry is an immediate answer to the industry and regulatory pressure to remove screen scraping and share credentials. By creating direct API connections with clients, Jack Henry is making it easier for consumers to connect financial accounts securely and reliably without the need to share user names and passwords. This offering is generally available today and has received a great deal of interest from both Jack Henry core and noncore clients. I also want to update you on some of the key functions we are building on the Jack Henry platform that are already in beta or planned to go in beta in calendar year 2024. I'll start with the incoming and outgoing wires, which we have talked about on previous calls. We plan to be generally available with our domestic wire solution over the next few months and move into beta with international wires by the end of this fiscal year. We are building a general ledger component that will support the common base functions of a financial institution's back office and enable deeper insights on transactions and advanced fraud detection. We plan to be in beta by the end of the calendar year. A key advantage of the Jack Henry platform is our clients being able to easily access their data. Our new data broker solution, which is currently in beta, will enable clients to access all of their Jack Henry data in a single repository with innovative AI intelligence capabilities. To complement the data broker solution, we are creating an executive dashboard with real-time event monitoring to help our C-suite clients make informed dynamic decisions throughout the day based on metrics they customize and update. I will now provide some context to the pricing philosophy will be used to deploy these components. Our go-to-market strategy centers around bundling key components that complement each other and provide enhanced financial and operational benefits like time to deploy new feature enhancements, enhanced security, improved uptime, et cetera. For example, a bundle may include wires, general ledger and data broker. Our pricing model strategy will incorporate elements from our industry-accepted pricing models such as license and/or per seat fees, consumption-based and per account pricing. We will encourage engagement with any combination of our solutions and further reward those who consume more components. Ultimately, the value proposition becomes evident as clients recognize the benefits of additional modules as well as the compelling features of the Google Cloud Platform. One last topic from our November call is our plan to offer several key solutions outside of the Jack Henry core base by the end of calendar year 2024. We remain on track to begin selling Banno Business, Financial Crimes Defender, various payment solutions and available components from the Jack Henry platform in our fiscal year '25 sales year. We have targeted several competing cores that we believe bring the best mutual value and have a need for premier digital fraud and real-time payment solutions. I will continue to keep you updated on this strategy. In closing, I am passionate about accomplishing our strategic priorities and moving our company forward through innovation and execution. I am grateful for the opportunity to lead this finest group of talented and dedicated professionals in the industry. I want to thank all of them for their tireless effort and commitment. I will now turn things over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers.\nMimi Carsley : Thank you, Greg, and good morning. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients, investing in our joint future and delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I'll begin with the details driving our as expected strong second quarter and year-to-date results, then conclude with our full-year guidance update. Second quarter GAAP and non-GAAP revenue increased 8%, a continuation of the strong start to our year and keeping us on track for a tremendous fiscal 2024 as year-to-date growth was 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Deconversion revenue of $4.9 million, which we pre-released last week, was down approximately $1.5 million, reflecting minimal financial institution consolidation. Year-to-date, deconversion revenue is $9 million, $1.9 million less than the prior period. As a reminder, effective September 1 onward, Payroll's results are included in both GAAP and non-GAAP figures. Now let's look more closely the details. Cap services and support revenue increased a healthy 7%, while non-GAAP increased a more robust 8%. The first half increased 7% for GAAP and 8% for non-GAAP basis. Services and support growth during the quarter was the result of increases in data processing and hosting and the timing of user group revenues. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which again increased 10% in the quarter and for year-to-date. This reoccurring revenue contributor has long been a double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue. We saw consistently positive performance with 9% growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter and first half from this reoccurring revenue source. Similar to recent results, drivers included a combination of higher card and other payment processing with strong digital demand. Next, moving to expenses. Beginning with cost of revenue, which increased 5% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis during the quarter, 7% for GAAP versus 6% non-GAAP year-to-date. Drivers for the quarter included higher direct costs consistent with increases in related revenue and internal license and fees. Growth in cost of revenue was limited to 5% due to active cost control and the timing of merit increases. Next, R&D expense decreased 3% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis for the quarter. The decrease was due to lower personnel expense, net of capitalization and inclusive of benefits. For the first half, R&D expense increased 4% on a GAAP basis and 3% for non-GAAP. And lastly, on a GAAP basis, SG&A rose 24% for the quarter, 21% on a non-GAAP basis, primarily due to the shift in our customer conference from Q1 to Q2 and was higher personnel and related costs. Year-to-date, SG&A expense increased 31% on a GAAP basis and 9% non-GAAP. The primary difference is the $16.4 million in one-time costs related to the voluntary early departure incentive program need in Q1. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion and the quarter delivered 111 basis points in non-GAAP margin at 21.3%. Non-GAAP margin benefited from operational performance, and a one-time shift in our merit increases from Q2 to Q3, offset slightly by the timing of our customer conference. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.26 and up 14%. Breaking down the results into the three operating segments, we're pleased by the consistent solid performance achieved. Our core segment revenue increased 8% on a non-GAAP basis, with non-GAAP operating margins increasing 166 basis points, benefiting from private cloud trends and strong cost controls. Year-to-date, non-GAAP revenue growth was 8% and the associated margin increased 80 basis points. Payments segment revenue increased 6% on a non-GAAP basis. This segment had impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 128 basis points. This was due to the strong growth in our EPS business, moderate card growth coupled with our scalable operating model and disciplined cost control. Year-to-date, non-GAAP revenue growth matched the quarter at 6% with 94 basis points of margin expansion. It should be noted that card revenue growth has been negatively impacted by lower card production among other non-processing revenue items. Excluding these impacts, processing-related revenue increased 8% for the quarter and 9% year-to-date. Finally, complementary segment non-GAAP revenue increased 9% with flat margin. Year-to-date non-GAAP revenue also increased 9% with 25 basis points of margin expansion. Growth year-to-date was driven primarily by digital, recently released solutions and overall product mix. Quarterly margins faced headwinds from direct support costs, amortization of new products and licenses and fees. Now let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Year-to-date operating cash flow was $239 million, a $48 million increase over the prior period, producing free cash flow of $129 million, slightly more than the $119 million last year. Excluding asset sale impacts of $1 million and $28 million from the current year-to-date and prior period, respectively, free cash flow was $37 million higher through the first half of our current fiscal year. Additionally, the timing of tax payments this year represented a $15 million headwind to free cash flow. Our consistent dedication to value creation resulted in a trailing 12-month return on invested capital of 20%. Additionally, I would highlight other notable return of capital metrics for the first half of our fiscal year, including $20 million in share repurchases offsetting annual dilution, $20 million in debt reduction and $76 million in dividends. As we head into the second half of fiscal 2024, I will conclude with guidance highlights. As you are aware, yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2021 full-year GAAP guidance along with a reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance metrics. As a reminder, we filed an 8-K on August 3. It describes how starting in the current fiscal year, we are using a revised approach for deconversion revenue, guidance. Based on current trends, we expect to see similar acquisition levels of our core customers for the second half of the fiscal year. As such, we're reiterating our full-year deconversion revenue guidance of $16 million. Based on positive year-to-date results from strong execution and near-term visibility, we are tightening our revenue growth outlook around the current midpoint. We now expect to generate full-year non-GAAP revenue growth of 7.4% to 8.0% compared to the 7.2% to 8.2% provided on the November call. This corresponds to an increased full-year GAAP revenue guidance of 6.6% to 7.2% for fiscal '24. In tandem with our revenue outlook, we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 35 basis points to 40 basis points compared to the 30 basis points to 35 basis points previously provided. The full year tax rate is now approximately 23.5% with potential bias slightly higher. Incorporating the noted positive updates Full year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upwards to $5.09 to $5.13 per share from previous guidance of $4.98 to $5.04 per share. As a reminder, the guidance for deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue, VIP severance-related costs, and nonrecurring gain on asset sales resulted in an approximate $0.37 headwind for fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS. Lastly, some additional modeling commentary. We are comfortable with the current level of huge consensus for revenue growth, operating margin and GAAP EPS. Our full year guidance of 60% free cash flow conversion is reiterated. However, the legislation that passed the house last week would have a material beneficial impact on fiscal 2024 free cash flow and beyond. We are monitoring legislative progress and are hopeful for a swift and positive outcome. Based on the current bill language, it past our free cash flow conversion would rebound to historical normal levels either in fiscal '24 or fiscal year '25, depending on the timing of certain items. In conclusion, Q2 reflects the strong performance we've seen consistently in the first half and expect the remainder of our fiscal year. We are exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovative and in-demand solutions, the resilience of our clients and our focus on execution and shareholder value creation. We appreciate all the contributions of our hardworking and dedicated associates that drove these strong results. We thank all Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. Laura, will you please open the call for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from John Davis of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJohn Davis : Maybe just wanted to follow up on the free cash flow comments that you just made. Getting back to historical levels, I'm assuming you mean kind of right around 100%. So that would imply kind of 40 points of headwinds that will get reversed. I thought before it was maybe 25 points or 30 points. So just, a, I just want to make sure when you say historical levels, you're talking in and around 100%. And is it kind of 40 points of headwind this year?\nMimi Carsley : Great question. I think premature to see the timing and the impact as to when to whether that hits 2024 or 2025. that I would say certainly, our historical norm range of 80% to 100% is where we believe we would revert back to. It just depends on the timing.\nJohn Davis : Okay. No, that's helpful. And then just on second half margins, I think the guide implies margins will be down year-over-year after being up over 100% in the first half of the year. So maybe just talk a little bit about some of the headwinds that you do face kind of in the back half of fiscal '24.\nMimi Carsley : Yes. So, we manage the business on a full year basis, JD. And so, as we think about it, we're pleased to have the additional margin expansion in the guide that we provided yesterday and today. Just in terms of the actual timing and seasonality of it, it just depends on when certain events like personnel-related costs, licensing costs in any particular quarter from a climb over perspective. As you know, our first quarter is usually the highest margin of our year. And then typically, the endpoints are less or so. So, I wouldn't say read anything more into the seasonality, and we're just basing it on a full year guide.\nJohn Davis : Okay. Great. And then, Dave, one for you, but also congrats on your retirement, your move to Executive Chair. And Greg, congrats on the CEO role. But Dave, you talked a lot about the competitive environment being fairly favorable. We continue to break records on the sales front, pipeline is robust. Maybe you can talk a little bit about what specific products or is there a segment of the market that you're having outside of success the top line results and the sales have been very, very good over the last 12 months. And just maybe a little bit more color on what exactly is driving that.\nDavid Foss : Sure. Thanks, JD. So, as I've said previously, it's amazing. We're 47 years into our run as a core provider and yet core continues to be a really strong driver. I just quoted to you 14 wins in the quarter. four of them, multibillion-dollar banks. That definitely leads the industry by far as compared to anybody else in the industry. So, core is still a key driver for us. But then oftentimes tied to the core, but sometimes not, and we have these other best-of-breed solutions, and we talked about many of them on the call before Banno. The retail Banno solution has been a key driver for us. Well, now we have Banno business in the equation. And you heard me quote the 56 contracts that were just signed in this quarter for Banno business, there is a real demand for a solution like that modern digital brand-new digital banking solution like that for small and leading business clients. I've talked in the past about our treasury solution. Again, a modern digital treasury solution for large commercial clients. So of course, it's not the bank that uses that. They're a large commercial customer that uses that hasn't been a brand-new ground-up treasury solution and certainly no digital-first treasury solution written in many, many years. So that continues to be a driver for us. Fraud, Financial Crimes Defender, Greg just quoted the numbers to you as far as Financial Crimes Defender. We have seven live, but we have a whole bunch of them now in the backlog because it's a brand-new ground-up developed fraud solution to deal with fraud in today's environment. And so, it's many of those things. And the thing -- the correlation, I think you need to make is every one of those that I just talked about has been written brand new in the last two years, five years by Jack Henry. So, these are not things that we acquired that we had to try and figure out how to make them modern. These are things that Jack Henry has innovated we paid a lot to do the development work. But when you get done with that, you have something that is a best-of-breed solution centered around digital, many of them centered around a public cloud, and there is a huge demand today for those types of offerings. And so, I don't see this slowing down at all. We're really well positioned today, and we're continuing to innovate as a key technology provider in our space.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Nik Cremo of UBS.\nNik Cremo : Thank you for taking my question. Congrats, Greg and Dave. First, I just wanted to follow up on the Payment segment. When can this segment get back into the 8% to 9% growth range? I know there was a few puts and takes called out, which is lower card production, but we also have Payrailz, which supposed to double this year. I'm not sure if that is still on the table, but just be curious to hear your thoughts there.\nMimi Carsley : Thanks, Nick, for the question. So, I would really point to you on the card within card within payments, the processing related. So that's the reoccurring nature of within that segment, and that grew strongly at 8%. And so that is an indicator of the overall success of that segment and our ability to get back to what we view from the growth algorithm, the prospects for that segment. So, I would say some of the non-processing related, the pass-through of the card production is more temporary and expect that the processing engine will continue to drive the strong growth\nNik Cremo: Thank you. And then for my follow-up, maybe a more medium-term question, but you just discussed the opportunity you see for generative AI on the revenue side, but also, more importantly, on the cost side, just relating to any of the benefits that you could see from increased software engineer productivity with these AI tools and call center automation.\nDavid Foss : So, do you want me to start with that one or do you want to? So, I'll start and then Greg will chime in here because this has been a -- as I'm sure you can imagine, a big topic of conversation for months around Jack Henry and lots of opportunities for us -- so on the per site. So. One thing I should be clear about. So traditional AI, it's a machine learning and robotic cross automation, Jack Henry has been in that business for years. So traditionally, we've been doing that for a long time. Generative AI, which is specific to your question, Nick, lots of opportunities there on the development side. The trick on the development side is our primary value is through our IP, right, our intellectual property. And so, when you're using generative AI to write code, you have to be really, really careful that nothing that you're doing becomes part of the public domain. And so, we're being very careful about what are we doing and how are we doing it, but we are active today with our development teams using generative AI, you pointed out customer service offering. So that is an area that we're focused on internally, and I'll let Greg touch on that. But we also rolled out at our client conference in October, a generative AI offering for our customers to serve their customers and that was well received at our client conference here in the fall. And then if you think about all the processes that we do within Jack Henry that have are not customer service and are not software development, just automating things we do within the company is another big area of focus.  And I'll let Greg add his thoughts.\nGreg Adelson : Yes. No, I think -- I mean, I think the other thing I would add is that we're also making sure we have strong governance around what we do. And so, we're taking a lot of time to make sure that we're evaluating. We're partnering with Google and a couple of other folks that we have some solutions with to kind of test some models. We're using opportunities here, not only in the contact center, as David mentioned, but also in a couple of other products. I did mention the AI assist kind of module that we would use in some of our data analysis that we call executive dashboard for the C-suite folks. And so, there are several opportunities that we're still evaluating. But again, we want to make sure that we get this right and that we're building it with the right guardrails and things along that line. But you'll continue to hear more about where we're going with that in the coming months.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nJason Kupferberg : I wanted to come back to some of the pipeline comments, certainly seems encouraging that you've got some real solid stability in the pipeline despite having a really strong quarter of bookings. So, can you talk about how the composition of the pipeline has changed in recent quarters in terms of, say, customer size, product mix and if there's any numbers you want to share around that, just in terms of helping us understand the composition of the pipeline, that would be great.\nDavid Foss : Sure, Jason. I wouldn't say that there's a significant notable change in the composition of the pipeline. It's -- we have a number of core deals. So again, we just signed 14 -- or announced 14 deals here. That is not slowing down. I would say that the size of those core opportunities, meaning the size of the institution, has gone up and is continuing to go up. So, we're being recognized among the larger community and regional bank space as being a real player. And so, I think the overall size of the institutions bank and credit union has gone up. But then if you look at the rest of the mix, most of it are the things that I highlighted when I was kind of going through with JD, the hot topics today, what's driving that success. It's this all this brand-new technology that we have -- that we're offering today. So, two years ago, almost nothing of those except Banno was on the list. But now all these things have been rolled out in the last couple of years, and they are dominating the sales process today because they're brand-new technology, people have been hungry for these things, a Banno fraud solution that uses AI, I mean everybody is dying for that type of technology. And so here we are, we've just gone live with Financial Crimes Defender. And so much of it is because of these brand-new things that have been rolled out in the last year or two or three that's what's dominating a lot of the sales conversations today, and that's what's driving a lot of the strength in the pipeline because you look at what's happening with our competitors in the space, there's really nothing innovative that's been coming out in the last couple of years. And here, Jack Henry has a long list of brand-new innovative solutions.\nJason Kupferberg: And then on competitive landscape in core, are you guys seeing a broader range of competitors as you continue to move a little bit further up market? Maybe others are trying to move a little bit more down market? Just how are competitive dynamics in core evolving?\nDavid Foss : Yes, I'd say no change at all. There's we compete against the traditional players. We've competed against the traditional players forever. There have been upstarts, trying to either come into the U.S. internationally or start from scratch, and none of those are really even showing up in RFPs with the exception of once or twice a year. So, I wouldn't say there's any change of any kind on the core side as far as the competitive landscape.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Just a housekeeping one for Mimi on free cash flow. I know you're maintaining the guide. I'm assuming no changes in legislation. But fair to say that Q3 would be fairly subdued and then followed by a stronger Q4 just based on typical seasonality.\nMimi Carsley : Yes, I think that's fair to say. And I think if anything, we're reiterating the guide, but there's probably a little bit of upside there, even without legislative change.\nOperator: And next, we have a question from David Togut of Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut : Thank you. Good morning, and congratulations to you both, Dave and Greg. Dave, I know when you initially became CEO eight years ago, one of your major priorities was the card migration platform, moving your kind of back-office processing of debit cards over to the back office of what was then First Data now Fiserv First Data and then obviously, adding the capability to do credit card processing on top of that. Where do we stand overall in this initiative in terms of the cost savings that's delivered to Jack Henry? And then where are you in terms of the uptake of the credit card processing offering?\nDavid Foss : Yes. So, I'll start, but I'll ask Greg is a lot closer to the details as far as where we are today. So, from my perspective, this has been a wildly successful initiative for Jack Henry. And at the time, I've been in this business a long time. And the idea of bringing three companies together to deliver a solution that's going to replace two different platforms all to one platform was a very, very big daunting project. But now looking back on it, it's been incredibly successful for our company as far as hitting the targets that we expected to hit financially for Jack Henry as far as the sales opportunities that it's created, which have been very significant over the past few years. So, I look back on that project as a really significant success. Now the thing I will emphasize before I ask Greg to chime in here, I said all along, you are not going to see the credit card side of this business become anywhere close to what the debit cards had side is we were doing. We were focused on the credit card side because we had certain customers who said, we want to process both debit and credit with the same provider, and we want to make sure that we have that option for them. And so, I'll ask Greg just kind of talk about where we are today.\nGreg Adelson: Yes, specifically on the credit card. So, we -- roughly between full-service card, agent card in-house card. We have roughly over institutions. And so -- and I think part of the challenge is some of the smaller institutions which is why we came out with an agent program was they really didn't want to go in with the full service just based on resources and some of the risk and things like that. So, I think we have done -- the team continues to sell it. We continue to have the number of deals come in just not to the same level as debit continues to grow. But also, we're continuing to add feature functionality to the services. As Dave mentioned, it is a tri-party relationship, and we continue to work with the other two parties to make sure that we stay innovative and ahead of the game. So, the relationship has actually gone well, which has actually contributed to the fact that the growth has been significant as well. So, both from a service side and a transaction processing side.\nDavid Togut: And just as a follow-up, Jack Henry outperformed on gross margin versus our model. And I know you initiated a media program a few quarters ago, which Mimi, I think you described. To what extent did VEDIP uptake actually helped gross margin in the quarter? So, like stripping out any onetime charge benefit focusing more on like sustainable reductions in cost of labor.\nMimi Carsley : Yes. I wanted to say that it had a significant impact. That was a one-time charge related to kind of severance and the program. As we said, we didn't do it for kind of in-year savings. This wasn't a sneaky kind of design risk plan. This was a very talent-focused plan to ensure that we had the type of talent for the future needs of the organization. And in fact, the majority of those roles have been backfilled with rising talent in the organization, some at lower levels in the organization as we zero-base budget every position the majority of those roles have been filled. So, I wouldn't say it was a significant reason for the margin expansion or the expense savings this quarter.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Vasu Govil of KBW.\nVasu Govil : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I want to add my congratulations to Dave and Greg. My first question is on Banno. It seems to have had an outstanding quarter in a number of new wins. And I caught that Banno business was a contributor there. But even without that, it seems like the number of wins were significantly higher than the quarterly average. Any call-outs on that? And apologies if I missed it, but did you give us the number of customers in millions that you usually give every quarter?\nDavid Foss : The number of customers that we signed. Is that what you're asking, Vasu?\nVasu Govil: Within Banno, I would just [indiscernible].\nDavid Foss : Yes, 11 million. Yes, we surpassed 11 million at the end of the quarter, so I quoted that 11 million. And so no, there's nothing -- I think part of what happened here is I quoted the number for the Banno business wins. And then beyond Banno business with the regular Banno platform, that number was up. I think the reason for that is because there were people out there waiting for Banno business before they would also sign to go at the regular Banno platform, which includes retail. And so that's the significant point now that Banno business is in market generally available, we had customers who said, \"Okay, I've been holding off because I want to do both at the same time, both Banno business and regular Banno.\" That would be the only callout that I would have as far as the size of the wins.\nVasu Govil: And just in terms of relative revenue opportunity, if you're just selling Banno regular versus Banno business? Is it a 2x opportunity? Is it greater on the Banno business side?\nGreg Adelson: Yes. So, I think one thing that just to make sure that we clarify. So, you have to have Banno Retail to have Banno business. So, one of the things that Dave was just alluding to is that some of the folks who are waiting to get Banno business -- or Banno retail is because they're waiting on Banno business and they wanted them at the same time. You can buy Banno retail without buying Banno business, but you have to have retail to get the business side. So back to the 2x comment, I don't think it's a 2x component. It is an additive component to ensuring that, one, that we get the retail and we continue to add fee structures to that based on how we model that. But I wouldn't call it a 2x.\nVasu Govil: Understood. That's helpful. And then a quick one for you, Mimi. I appreciate that the midpoint of the revenue guide didn't change, but it does look like you took off the top end just a little bit. And I know you called out the card production slow down. Was that the bigger driver or any sort of other callouts on how you see that evolving?\nMimi Carsley : Good question, Vasu. I think generally, the tightening was more so based on our confidence as we're now halfway through the year with strong results in already banked in the ability to really center around that guide. So, I think it's more that than thinking about the top end coming down, just feeling more and more confident about that midpoint. We still have a second half to do here and a decent amount of growth that we have anticipated in our plans, especially in Q3 and Q4 around processing around card, around our payments business. So too early yet to say it's going to be higher than that, but very confident in our ability to deliver.\nOperator: The next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta : Steve, you've commented a lot on core and obviously, Jack Henry is doing well. But as you look at the market, what would you anticipate in terms of a number of core deals? I know when COVID happened, it’s kind of flipped and then we went back to kind of normal. So, as you look at 2024, what would you anticipate the number of deals that might show up in the marketplace?\nDavid Foss : Well, it's a pretty predictable number. Every year, it's somewhere around 100 deals in total that happened per year as far as somebody leaving whoever is their current provider and going to a different provider. That's not, hey, I'm staying with my same provider and switching to another system. It is going to a different provider. Normally, about 100 deals a year is a good number to use on average.\nKartik Mehta : Perfect. And you've talked about, obviously, the sales pipeline being very strong. I think Greg talked about maybe hiring more people. And as you look at your sales pipeline kind of look out forward, how much confidence can you look at that revenue that's going to come up in terms of the number of quarters you feel good that as that revenue converts that you'll be able to put up kind of this high single-digit revenue growth?\nDavid Foss : Yes. On the core side, we have very accurate predictability. We have -- we go through this monthly the chart as far as the core conversions that are slotted, whether it's a new core customer coming in, it's a customer moving from in-house to our private cloud environment. Or if it's a customer who's acquiring another institution, and we're merging them in. We have all those things. We have great dashboard tools that we use at Jack Henry. So, it's very predictable for us.\nMimi Carsley : Kartik, if I can add on. The only add-on I would say, is we look at that on an annual basis. So, in any one quarter, depending on prior year, the comp of the size of the organization that was being implemented or migrated versus this year, the size of an organization still feels confident in that number, but it can vary quarter-to-quarter depending on just the roster of slots and the profile of those customers. So that's the only color I would add.\nKartik Mehta : Just one last question, maybe for you. You talked a little bit about free cash flow and let's assume that the legislation doesn't pass, but you still seem confident that maybe there's upside to the original guide on free cash flow conversion. And I'm wondering maybe what's behind that or what's changed since the original guide to give you confidence that maybe it will be better.\nMimi Carsley : Yes. I think a couple of things that are coming in. One is just the certainty of the results that we have year-to-date. The other is, as we lowered the tax rate as part of the guide, that helps from a cash flow as well. So, there's just a couple of small components as we fine-tune the free cash flow forecast for the remainder of the year that makes me feel comfortable about there being upside there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Cris Kennedy of William Blair.\nCris Kennedy: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Congratulations to Greg and David. Regarding the technology initiatives, is there a way to think about the revenue opportunity associated with that? And if you could maybe frame it against the private cloud transition that you guys have been going through for the last 10 years or so.\nGreg Adelson: Yes, I think it's -- you have to think about it differently than the private cloud transition because that was truly pulling, as Dave has alluded to many times, pulling a customer out and it was typically a 2x kind of thing. I don't think that when you look at the tech modernization because depending on the number of components that are purchased and really the advent of the timing of some of that, it isn't a take everything we have today and move it over. So, it isn't that same level of, I think, revenue growth. But the part that is exciting for us is the ability to take these components drive again, an additional wedge into the relationship and create that opportunity for larger customers or smaller customers to dip their toe into the public cloud. And as Dave has said many, many times, I mean, there's a lot of our customers that aren't ready to do this. There are some that are already and part of our beta process today. So that's going to be a constant evaluation of the timing of when that big hit comes. But we do know that it's coming based on the feedback that we're getting from some of the larger institutions that we've been speaking to because they're more apt to do this sooner than later. And so just continued growth in that path. But there's still some time to be taken before we can give much certainty or what I would say, certainty on some of the revenue parts of this.\nDavid Foss : The other thing I'll add to this, Cris, it's important to keep in mind, there are components that will be offered now. This is not an apples-to-apples comparison of the old core versus new core. The way we used to think of core and now it's just the same thing, it's not a different platform. There are components that we'll be offering with this that nobody has ever offered before. And Greg alluded earlier to Data Broker. That has not been an offering. That has not been a thing as far as the industry is concerned. That's brand-new opportunity, brand-new revenue. It's part of the core offering, if you will, in the future, but there are several other examples like that, that create revenue upside opportunity, but it's not -- you just have to think about it differently than the way we've thought previously about converting a core from one platform to another.\nGreg Adelson: Yes. And I think 1 thing I do want to add is that we'll get to a point where we talk about platform as really the driver of what sits on that platform. So, data broker or executive dashboard or open banking solutions, other things, like we already mentioned, Defender, Banno, all those components are all going to sit on the platform and will drive additional revenue.\nCris Kennedy: Understood. And then just following up on -- in the press release, you talked about 28.5% growth of digital revenue in the first half of the year. Is there a way to think about the contribution from digital within the services and support revenue?\nMimi Carsley : Yes. Let me get back with you on that detail.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Schmidt of Citi.\nAndrew Schmidt : Dave, Greg, Mimi, thanks for having me on the call. So, a quick question on just the core win side of things. You mentioned the funnel, the number of RFPs being relatively consistent. But I'm curious if there's been any changes in win rates just given what you're seeing in the competitive environment? It seems clearly advantageous from a competitive perspective. So, I'm curious if there's any changes on the win rate front.\nDavid Foss : Yes, Andrew, I don't think there's anything notable. Again, with only 100 deals happening per year, we're in the 50 to 55 or have been down for a while, 50 to 55. So, we're winning more than half of those opportunities per year. I don't know that there's anything -- getting to 60 is a big deal for us. But from a percentage basis, that doesn't look real huge. So, I don't think I would call out anything as being significant. Our challenge and our job is to make sure we maintain that rate because, as I said before, we are by far leading the industry. And as long as we maintain that rate, that bodes well for us as far as our algorithm -- forward-looking algorithm of revenue growth and so on. So, nothing significantly notable there.\nAndrew Schmidt: Got it. Makes a ton of sense. And then if you talk about just the views on acceptance of the public cloud, you're hearing that it's slow, but obviously, attitudes are changing towards more comfort with having things like the general ledger in the cloud. Maybe you could just talk through the process that FIs have to work through for themselves to be comfortable with hosting things like general ledger in broader core components in the cloud, that would be great.\nDavid Foss : Yes. It's an interesting question, an interesting topic, frankly. I've been doing this for a long time and kind of listening to and talking to all the financial institutions that we talk to, they all want to get there. They're all trying to figure out how do we get there. They just -- many of them are not quite sure how to get there. And with the regulatory environment that we live in, regulators are not saying, \"Hey, we think you should go do this.\" So, there's a lot of walk before you run happening where people -- and that's part of where our Jack Henry platform strategy really, really positions us well because our strategy allows people to do is adopt a modularized approach. I'm going to do wires in the public cloud and kind of see how that goes and make sure I don't have a regulator knock on my door and say, \"What are you guys doing?\" So, they can kind of ease into the public cloud environment. But we have several of our noncore solutions today, fully public cloud. Savanna was there, Financial Crimes Defender, some that we've talked about today. But as far as the core functionality, this whole strategy allows people to walk before they run, and that is appealing to a lot of folks that we're talking to. And so, we think that's going to help with the question that you're asking.\nOperator: And our next question comes from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette : Great. Greg and Dave extend my congratulations to both of you. I want to ask just in terms of the implementation resources. I think you've talked about 150-plus clients in implementation for Financial Crimes Defender and another 70 for Banno business. I'm just wondering if there's any benefit or should we think about potentially increasing committee increasing resources to accelerate those implementations a bit? Or do you feel pretty comfortable with the pacing that you've got right now?\nDavid Foss : No, that's a great insightful question. So, we do that on a regular basis. So, we meet with the team on a monthly basis based on installation queues. So, we do look at what the time is to do an implementation for a particular product. Can we add resources that will add value in getting those -- that revenue on the -- into the company faster? So, to your point, we do that on a regular basis for all of our products.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Got it.\nGreg Adelson: Some of it, James, is also tied to just the timing of the -- like Dave just mentioned a lot of sales. So, some of it is the timing of that as well.\nJames Faucette: Okay. Got it. Got it. But for now, we should think about you feeling like that you're in pretty good shape from what you're spending off from an implementation standpoint, et cetera.\nDavid Foss : That's correct.\nJames Faucette: Okay. And then just thinking about -- I know this topic that's been talked about for a long time, but any change in the overall environment around M&A? And it seems like there continues to be at least pull down of private valuations, et cetera. But I'm just wondering what you're seeing in that market and if their potential assets that are particularly attractive, especially from a technology perspective. Just taking your temperature on potential for M&A?\nDavid Foss : So, you know well, you followed us for a long time, James. You know well, how much we love to love to be involved in deals and we love to do deals. I will just tell you, we don't have a single deal sitting for review right now at Jack Henry. It's there's still a slow, slow time. There are certainly companies out there that we'd be interested in, but not a single deal on the table right now.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dave Koning of Baird.\nDave Koning : Just a couple of quick ones. First of all, EPS guide, at the midpoint, it was raised by about $0.10. And it looks like maybe $0.01 to $0.02 on EBIT is higher, a few cents on tax, but it seems like there's about $0.05 I can't reconcile, where might that be?\nMimi Carsley : So, on the EPS, I would say it's about $0.01 or $0.02 for operational. And then the remaining split is about 50-50 is the difference in the tax rate plus interest -- net interest income that we're earning based on higher interest rates.\nDave Koning: Got you. I'm sure you know of many banks that will pay good rates. So -- and then I guess, secondly, just on January payments volumes, many kinds of competitors and the industry participants called out the first two or three weeks being pretty slow. It sounds like maybe the back part of January got better, but what have you seen kind of through January and maybe even into early February, just in payments volumes.\nMimi Carsley : Yes. I would say, overall, our volume transaction nears Visa and Mastercard domestic, pretty similarly, we did see the same experiences that they have talked about publicly about January weather and who knows right now is all the rains in California of that. But what we saw typically by the end of January with some rebounding from those very temporary lows.\nOperator: The next question is from Dominick Gabriele of Oppenheimer.\nDominick Gabriele : Thanks for everything, Dave, and looking forward to working with you, Greg. I guess we've been talking to investors in your quarter since the management team change announcement. And Greg, talk about what you've learned under Dave and being a part of the Jack Henry team over the years that should give investors’ confidence that the new management team, including Mimi, who's done a great job, obviously, since her start, we'll continue executing with the same consistency in the years to come.\nGreg Adelson: And I think it just starts with a culture that we've built for 47 years here, and it's a very collaborative approach. We work very tightly together. And between my time with Dave, I've done a lot of -- I was heavily involved in the card work that happened years ago. Obviously, if some of the M&A that we've done in the Payments group when I led the payments group. And just I think from a philosophy standpoint, Dave and I are very much aligned on how we look at things, how we evaluate what we do for our three pillars of success that we always talk about our associates, clients and shareholders. And so, I don't think you're going to see very much change at all. A lot of the same level of consistency on how we think and operate there'll be some nuances and opportunities where some things that I have in my background and what Dave had in his background, so I'm hoping that those will all be things that we can add to. But the reality is that I spent 13 years at this company, and all 13 have been working for Dave directly. So, I would say there's a lot of consistency that you should look forward to.\nDavid Foss : Greg is a snappier dresser than I am.\nDominick Gabriele: And then if maybe if we could just dive in a little bit deeper on the guidance, I was just looking at the slides from this quarter to last quarter. And it looked like there was a rise in the non-GAAP revenue expectation, but a lowering of the high end of GAAP revenue. I was just curious on what would cause that debt deviation since the deconversion fees are versus stable?\nMimi Carsley : So, I just want to make sure I understand your question, Dom. You're saying you're seeing a greater change in non-GAAP? Or you're saying you're seeing a greater change in GAAP?\nDominick Gabriele: It looks like from what I saw that the range was a little higher in -- on the growth in non-GAAP revenue, but then you took down the high end of the GAAP revenue, maybe I don't have that right, but I.\nMimi Carsley : Yes. Let me look further into it, but I have nothing that comes to mind. It should be more of a flow-through because we're keeping the deconversion guide for the full year at 16%. So, there's not much that's changing there. So, you should see a similar pattern non-GAAP and GAAP.\nDominick Gabriele: Excellent. That's what I would have thought. Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just one last one. If you guys could just talk to us about your business investment strategy in terms of expense dollar allocation as you look forward. We've obviously -- at least versus my model, the expenses were much better than what I was expecting for the quarter. And I know there's some seasonality, but talk about the expense investment versus accelerating revenue strategy.\nMimi Carsley : So, Dom, I would say a couple of things this quarter and that will also impact the full year and therefore, the guide. 2 things. One is the -- not just the timing of the Connect conference, but the Connect conference was even more successful than last year. So, from a profitability perspective, that helped for margins and expenses being lower. The other is the decision we made around a onetime change in the change in timing of our merit for our associate population. And so that also helps from a straight through to the bottom line from an expense perspective. But as always, and with consistency, we not only zero-based budget, but we look and think about the investments, the amount of spend going to our top projects and top products, the amount from a capitalization in R&D. You saw the consistency of the 14% of R&D spend. So, we're always thinking about how to invest for our future, thinking about what those business plans look like and what that ROI looks like and the bandwidth of the organization. So, I think there'll be more consistency from a spending towards future that you've seen in the past. And I think some of the margin expansion was just due to a heightened focus on cost control, and that some of the changes that we've made from the merit timing.\nOperator: And next, we have a question from Ben Varga of Autonomous Research.\nBen Varga : I just wanted to echo everyone else's congratulations on the leadership transition. My first question is about Banno business. It's great to see the initial client interest, I guess. In terms of the implementations that you have in the Q, how long does it typically take until those opportunities start contributing to revenue?\nDavid Foss : Yes, it's really a timing thing based on the client themselves. Honestly, an implementation of Banno business is less than 60 days. So, some of those are tied to core deals. Some of those are tied to other product implementations. So really, it's dependent more on the client than it is on Jack Henry. And kind of back to the question earlier, that James had related to that. So, some of that is really -- we try to push the clients along, but it's not necessarily a Jack Henry lag as it is waiting for the client. So -- but it's 60 days or less if they're ready to go.\nBen Varga: Got it. That makes perfect sense. And then as we think about the growth opportunity for Banno Retail, are these wins coming from greenfield opportunities for the most part? Or are you also kind of bumping up against some of the other digital banking providers?\nDavid Foss : Yes, absolutely. No. We have a lot of competitive takeaways from the other providers. There are some opportunities within both the core base. We've talked about taking it outside of the Jack Henry core base and where we're going with that. But right now, there's probably an equal mix of opportunities from a handful of the larger digital banking providers today that we're winning some deals from and as well as our existing core base.\nGreg Adelson: And I think it's fair to say there is no such thing as a greenfield opportunity at any point. So, everybody has something. We're displacing something every single time.\nDavid Foss : Yes. That's a fair point.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vance Gerard for any closing remarks.\nVance Sherard : Thank you, Laura. We look forward to speaking further with many of you at investor events in the coming weeks. On behalf of the management team, I would like to express our appreciation to all the Jack Henry associates whose efforts produce these outstanding financial results. Thank you for joining us today. And Laura, will you please provide the replay number?\nOperator: The replay number for today's call is (877) 344-7529 and the access code is 9025867. The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vance Sherard, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nVance Sherard: Good morning, and thank you for joining us for the Jack Henry First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on the call today is: David Foss, Board Chair and CEO; Mimi Carsley, CFO and Treasurer; and Greg Adelson, President and COO. After my opening remarks, I will turn the call over to Dave for his thoughts about the state of our business and some industry comments. After Dave concludes his comments, Greg will provide additional insight on our new solutions, Payrailz and other key initiatives at Jack Henry. Mimi will then provide insight regarding the financial results and updated guidance included in the press release issued yesterday that is available from the Investor Relations section of the Jack Henry website. We will then open the lines for Q&A. As a reminder, this call includes certain forward-looking statements including remarks or responses to questions concerning future expectations events, objectives, strategies, trends or results. Like any statement about the future, these are subject to multiple factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those which we anticipate due to multiple risks and uncertainties. The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise these statements. For a summary of these risk factors and additional information, please refer to yesterday's press release and the sections in our 10-K entitled Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements. On this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures including non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP operating income. The reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures are in yesterday's press release. I will now turn the call over to Dave.\nDavid Foss: Thank you, Vance. Good morning, everyone. As Vance mentioned, Greg is joining me this morning to provide an update on several innovative new solutions we've recently launched followed by Mimi who will take a deeper dive into our financial performance. I'm pleased to report another strong quarter of revenue and operating income growth for our company. As always, I'd like to thank our associates for all the hard work and commitment that went into producing those results for the quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, total revenue increased 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. At the same time, deconversion fees were down 8% as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to the segments. We had another solid quarter in the core segment of our business. Revenue increased by 8% for the quarter on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Our payments segment again performed very well posting a 7% increase in revenue this quarter and a 6% increase on a non-GAAP basis. We also had another strong quarter in our complementary solutions businesses with a 9% increase in both GAAP and non-GAAP revenue. As I have discussed previously, the first quarter is normally our lightest sales bookings quarter because our fourth quarter tends to be extremely strong and the sales pipeline is depleted as a result. As you may recall, the June quarter was the strongest sales quarter in the history of the company, so we certainly expected that historical trend to hold true. This year however, our sales pipeline was the largest ever entering a new fiscal year. In the first quarter, we booked 10 competitive core takeaways and another 10 deals to move existing in-house customers to our private cloud environment. This strong start leaves us confident that we are well positioned to achieve approximately 50 to 55 competitive takeaways this fiscal year. We continue to see success with our card processing solution signing seven new debit processing clients this quarter and two new credit clients. We also continue to see success signing clients to our Banno digital suite with 44 new contracts in Q1 including 21 contracts for our new Banno Business offering. Speaking of our digital suite, at the end of Q1, we had more than 10.5 million registered users on the platform. That number is now growing at approximately 200,000 users per month. At the end of Q1 last year, we had about 8.3 million registered users on the platform, so we've experienced a 27% increase over the past 12 months. The continued success we've seen with sales and the adoption of our digital suite is consistent with results in the Bank Director Technology Survey published in September. As they do every year, Bank Director surveyed their subscribers during June and July, regarding a variety of technology prioritization and spending topics. More than 50% of the responses they received were from bank CEOs and Board members. And more than 80% of the respondent banks have greater than $500 million in assets. Most respondents said their bank's technology budgets grew over the prior year with a median increase of 10%. That level of spending is consistent with our own Strategic Priorities Benchmark Study published last spring. Responders to the Bank Director survey named digital business account opening, payments capabilities and digital business lending as their top three planned investments. One of the interesting items from this year's Bank Director Survey was the analysis of technology and use by respondent banks, as it relates to their ability to serve different generational groups. Fully 96% of the respondents said, they have the technology in place to serve baby boomers, but only 18% said they have the necessary technology in place to effectively serve Gen Zers. Of course, it's primarily the younger generations that expect to conduct all banking services without ever entering a branch. Clearly, the innovative the initiative for all banks to get to digital presentation layer has a long way to go. All of this bodes well for the future of our digital suite, as well as the other innovative solutions offered by Jack Henry that help financial institutions facilitate an improved customer experience through a digital front door. Digital banking was one of the many topics discussed at our annual client conference held last month in Indianapolis. This is our largest conference of the year. And this year, we hosted more than 160 prospect attendees an all-time record. Of the financial institution prospects, over 30 have more than $1 billion in assets with a couple in the $10 billion to $30 billion range. Additionally, more than 250 third-party fintechs participated in the trade show, which underscores our approach to accessibility and open banking. Of course, events like this not only present a wonderful opportunity for relationship building and education, but they also generate a substantial number of new sales leads. We saw strong interest in our technology modernization strategy and our ongoing development of a single public cloud-native platform that can run the entire financial institution. We've now branded that solution as simply the Jack Henry Platform. And we were able to demonstrate some of the current functionality at the conference. In one of the most talked about main stage sessions, our Chief Technology Officer hosted an executive from Google and one of our bank CEOs to highlight the use of generative AI on the platform as well. As we normally do at Jack Henry Connect, I hosted our annual CEO forum, attended this year by nearly 150 client CEOs. Although, we didn't conduct a formal survey during the meeting, the general feedback was that while attendees are concerned about the overall economy, they continue to invest in technology to enhance their digital capabilities, improve efficiencies and position their businesses for the future. During the quarter, we were proud to be included in several national workplace rankings. We placed 11th in Newsweek's list of Top 100 Most Loved Workplaces, up six spots from last year. We also made Newsweek's Greatest Workplaces list earning five stars which is the highest possible rating. Additionally, we were named a top company in our sector by US News & World Report, based on work/life balance, stability and professional development. We are honored to be recognized in these national rankings because they reflect our people-first culture and the engagement energy collaboration and client focus that our employees bring to work each day. Next week, we'll conduct our Annual Shareholder Meeting in person in Monett. We're excited to be able to meet with our shareholders. And once again, we'll offer an option for people to observe remotely. As we move forward, I remain extremely optimistic regarding our robust sales pipeline, the demand environment, a strong interest in the solutions we're delivering and the strategies we're executing. We remain committed to our disciplined approach to running the company. And we expect that focus to continue to provide stability and solid performance for our employees, customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg.\nGreg Adelson: Thank you, Dave. As we continue to execute on both our operational and technological strategic priorities, we're pleased to announce the general availability of a few new solutions in the first quarter. In addition, we continue to make outstanding progress on our technology modernization strategy and the development of our cloud-native API-first Jack Henry Platform. We will provide an update on those platform components currently in beta or going into beta on our February call. As we mentioned during the August call, our cloud-native Banno Business solution developed for small- and medium-sized businesses is now generally available for our SilverLake banking clients. And the response has been outstanding. At the end of September we had approximately 60 banks live and more than 70 additional clients in various stages of implementation. We are currently in beta with several credit union clients and plan to be generally available for that base of Jack Henry customers by the end of the calendar year. We delivered Financial Crimes Defender, our real-time fraud and anti-money laundering compliance platform, into general availability for our SilverLake banking clients in September. We also released our real-time faster payment Financial Crimes Defender fraud module for Zelle in September. The faster payment module uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect fraud and money laundering in real time. We plan to release additional Defender modules in late 2023 and early 2024 for both the FedNow and RTP networks. We currently have more than 120 clients in our implementation queue for Financial Crimes Defender, of which more than 50 include utilizing the real-time payments module. In addition, we remain on track to launch Financial Crimes Defender to our credit union clients in late December. As we also mentioned on our August call, we were among the first service providers to support live transactions on the Federal Reserve's, new FedNow instant payment network when it launched on July 20. We now have all four Jack Henry cores connected to FedNow through our PayCenter offering and continue to provide the most comprehensive implementation process requiring almost no effort from our clients to go live on the network. We currently have more than 40 clients live on FedNow with over 150 contracts in the implementation queue. We expect to have approximately 150 live customers on the network by the beginning of 2024. Today, every client is set up for receive-only. But we expect to see more clients wanting to add send capabilities in early to mid-2024 as use cases become more defined. As a matter of comparison, we have over 210 clients live on The Clearing House's RTP network and another 100 in the implementation queue. We continue to see tremendous transaction growth from our RTP clients over the past year. When comparing September 2022 to September 2023, we have realized a 66% transaction growth with the majority of these transactions stemming from digital wallet transfers to bank accounts, A2A transfers from Tier 1 institutions and payroll or gig worker payments. Speaking of payments, it's been a little more than a year since we acquired Payrailz. We have successfully integrated the team and large portions of the technology stack into our culture and technology modernization strategy. We continue to find, develop and execute additional back-office synergies while building a premier payment acceptance platform, capable of handling bill payment, P2P, A2A, B2B and much more. As part of our planned strategy, we have created one Jack Henry bill payment group that provides product and operational support for both our legacy solution iPay and for Payrailz as well. Over the next 18 months, we will finalize the build-out of a single cloud-native API-first payment platform that will include all the key features of both iPay and Payrailz as well as additional new features not offered in either solution today. Specific to Payrailz, we now have more than 100 clients live, another close to 50 clients in various stages of implementation and additional 20 that were recently signed. A question that is regularly asked, when are all these new innovative solutions going to be sold outside of the Jack Henry core base? I'm pleased to report that we have finalized our strategy to sell each of these solutions as well as components from the Jack Henry Platform to several targeted competitive cores. We have aligned our strategy with the competitive cores we believe will bring the best mutual value and have a need for premier digital fraud and real-time payment solutions. Each of our components is being developed to go outside of the Jack Henry core base and will be available to do so as they move to general availability. We expect to start selling some of these solutions early next fiscal year. On the operational side, we've been highly focused on ensuring that Jack Henry is the easiest core provider to work with in the industry. We operate with full transparency while collaborating across business units to deliver our consistent enterprise experience. We call this program One Jack Henry. And you've heard me talk about it in detail at our annual Investor Day event in the past few years. We continue to receive tremendous validation of our efforts through meetings with industry consultants, prospects, clients and our associates. Our industry-leading survey and service scores continue to move up and to the right at a time where that is not happening across our industry. Furthermore, the work we are doing around One Jack Henry is aligned with the objectives outlined by the American Bankers Association Core Platforms Committee. Those objectives include fair and transparent contracts, exceptional customer service responsive and open communication open banking and the highest standard of data protection and privacy. In closing, we all came back from our Jack Henry Connect client conference in mid-October with a little extra pep in our step after hearing from our clients and our prospects that our technology modernization strategy coupled with the work we are doing to focus on road map execution and service excellence is truly a differentiator in our industry. I want to thank all of our talented and dedicated associates for helping us move this strategy forward. We wouldn't be where we are today without them. I will now turn things over to Mimi for some detail on the numbers.\nMimi Carsley: Thank you, Greg, and good morning everyone. Our continued focus on serving our community and regional financial institution clients, growing our business, investing in our future and delivering shareholder value led to another quarter of solid revenue and earnings growth. I'll begin with the details driving our positive first quarter and then conclude with our full year guidance update. We're encouraged by Q1 GAAP revenue and non-GAAP revenue increasing 8%, establishing a healthy start to our year and setting us up for a fantastic fiscal 2024. Deconversion revenue of $4.1 million, which we pre-released last week was down approximately $400,000 reflecting continued temperate financial institutional consolidation. As a reminder, given the September 1, 2022 close of Payrailz acquisition the first two months of Q1 2024 results are excluded from non-GAAP financials, but that September one onwards Payrailz results are included in both GAAP and non-GAAP. Now let's look more closely at the details. First on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis services and support revenue increased a healthy 7%. Services and support growth was the result of increases in data processing and hosting software usage and subscription and hardware. We continue to experience robust growth in our private and public cloud offerings which increased 10% in the quarter. This revenue contributor has long been a double-digit growth engine. Shifting to processing revenue. We saw vigorous performance with 10% growth on a GAAP basis and 9% growth on a non-GAAP basis for the quarter. Consistent with prior period results drivers include a combination of higher card volumes and services plus strong digital demand. Next moving to expenses. I'll begin with cost of revenue which increased 8% on a GAAP basis and 7% on non-GAAP. Drivers include higher direct costs, personnel and benefit costs and internal licenses and fees. Next, R&D expense increased 12% on a GAAP basis and 10% on a non-GAAP basis, reflecting higher personnel and benefits costs net of capitalization. This is in support of our continued solution innovation maintaining competitiveness and our technology modernization strategy including the Jack Henry Platform. Finally, on a GAAP basis SG&A rose 38% for the quarter primarily due to the $16.4 million one-time cost related to the voluntary early departure incentive program VEDIP. This cost was lower than the $17 million to $18 million estimate based on the final participation in the program. As a reminder, all VEDIP costs are in this quarter. And there will be no additional P&L impact as we move through the year. When these one-time VEDIP costs and last year's $6.2 million gain from real estate divestures are adjusted to non-GAAP SG&A decreased 2% during the quarter. These adjusted figures reflect our ongoing commitment to cost control. We remain focused on generating compounding margin expansion. And the quarter results delivered 121 basis points increase in non-GAAP margin, which was 26.1%. This increase was partially driven by the timing shift of our Connect customer conference into Q2 compared to Q1 last year. These strong quarterly results produced a fully diluted GAAP earnings per share of $1.39. Breaking down non-GAAP results we're pleased by the consistent solid performance achieved by the three operating segments. Our core segment revenue increased 8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with non-GAAP operating margin increasing five basis points to 59%. We benefit from positive tailwinds from winning share, continued migration from on-premise to private cloud and customer growth. The payments segment revenue increased 7% on a GAAP basis and 6% for non-GAAP. This segment had an impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth of 59, basis to 46%. This was due to increase in card transaction and related revenues plus growth in our EPS business. The Fed recently announced its considered change -- a change to the debit card interchange that would translate to an approximate 28% decrease, in interchange for issuers. It should be noted that our revenue model for card processing is transactional and not reliant on interchange. Finally, our complementary segment, revenue increased 9% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis with strong non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 47 basis points to 61%. Our diverse mix of solutions, including key headliners like Banno, LoanVantage, Treasury Management in addition to the numerous additional solutions contribute to this strong growth trend. And our new fraud Financial Crimes Defender solution will soon contribute to the growth in this segment as well. Now let's turn to a review of cash flow and capital allocation. Quarterly operating cash flow was $157 million a $20 million increase over prior year producing free cash flow of $107 million, slightly less than the $116 million last year. Last year included $26 million contribution from asset sales that was non-reoccurring in nature. Our consistent dedication to value creation resulted in an annual return on invested capital of 20%. Additionally, I'd like to highlight notable return of capital including $20 million in share repurchases offsetting annual dilution, $30 million in debt reduction and $38 million in dividends during the quarter. With Q1 in our rear view we shift our focus to the remainder of 2024. And I will conclude with guidance change highlights. As you're aware yesterday's press release included updated fiscal 2024 full year guidance along with the reconciliation to non-GAAP guidance metrics. As a reminder, we filed an 8-K on August third that described how starting in the current fiscal year we're using a revised approach for deconversion guidance. Based on current trends we expect to see minimal financial institution consolidations in the first half of fiscal 2024 with possible acceleration in the second half. As such, we're maintaining and reiterating full year deconversion revenue guidance of $16 million. Based on a positive Q1 result from strong execution and near-term visibility we see upside over our prior guidance. We now expect to generate full year non-GAAP revenue growth of 7.2% to 8.2%, compared to the 7.0% to 8.0% provided on the August call. This corresponds to an increased full year GAAP revenue guidance of 6.4% to 7.4% for fiscal 2024. In tandem with our increased revenue outlook and continued focus on cost efficiencies, we now expect an increase in annual non-GAAP margin expansion of 30 to 35 basis points, compared to the 20 to 25 basis points previously provided. The full year tax rate remains unchanged at approximately 24%. Incorporating the noted positive updates, full year guidance for GAAP EPS is revised upward to $4.98 to $5.04 per share from previous guidance of $4.92 to $4.99 per share. As a reminder, the conservative guidance for deconversion revenue compared to actual fiscal 2023 deconversion revenue, the slightly lower VEDIP severance-related costs and the non-reoccurring gain on asset sales results in an approximate $0.37 headwind for fiscal 2024 GAAP EPS. And lastly some additional modeling commentary. As previously highlighted we recently hosted our customer conference JH Connect. The associated revenue and expenses will be reflected next quarter. Please recall in FY 2023 the related financial impact was in Q1. We believe this timing shift has led to an approximate $0.01 to $0.02 higher consensus Q2 EPS estimate. Our full year guidance of 60% free cash flow conversion remains consistent given the continued impact of tax deductibility timing on development expenses, resulting in higher cash taxes. In the relative near-term, we expect to return to historical norms of conversion. We appreciate the contributions of our hardworking and dedicated associates that drove these strong quarterly results. In conclusion, Q1 was a strong start to our fiscal year. And we remain exceptionally positive about our ability to deliver innovation and valued solutions the resiliency of our clients our focus on execution, growth accelerators, and shareholder value creation. We thank all Jack Henry investors for their continued confidence. MJ could you please open the call for questions?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nTyler DuPont: Hi, good morning everyone. This is Tyler DuPont on for Jason. Thank you for taking the question. So, I wanted to start on the growth side of things looks like growth is pretty solid across dimensions particularly on the corporate side and complementary. So I was just wondering if you can speak to kind of specifically what drove that outperformance during the quarter? And then on the other side it looks like the payments growth was healthy but a little bit lower than what's expected on the \"normalized\" growth rate of 8% to 9%. So, I just wanted to ask what dynamics you're seeing there and any expectations going forward? Thanks.\nDavid Foss: I'll take the first half and I'll let Greg respond on the payments portion. This is Dave Foss by the way. So, I think the growth when it comes to the other areas other than payments is primarily driven by the success that we're seeing now in the Banno area in the complementary product groups of the Banno product line. I highlighted some of the performance metrics there the addition of new customers and all the new registered users on that platform so the Banno platform success. Financial Crimes Defender we signed a whole bunch of contracts in the quarter. But you really won't see the P&L impact of Financial Crimes Defender until next quarter and then the following quarters after that. But then it's just a variety of other solutions again primarily in that complementary solutions area. So, we're continuing to see great success with things like treasury and some of the other complementary solutions that we didn't specifically call out. But all of them have become real nice drivers of revenue. Many of them new solutions in the past couple three years. We've highlighted them on these calls in the past as new solutions. They're not new anymore and they're a year old. But they're continuing to drive great demand and nice revenue improvement for Jack Henry. And I'll let Greg comment on what's happening in the payments side.\nGreg Adelson: Yes, I would say there's probably two components. So, one we're kind of dealing with the aftermath of excessive growth in our remote deposit capture business during the pandemic. And so we're seeing a little bit of lessening of that growth. And then the card volume growth I think is kind of indicative to what you've heard both card associations talk about as well. So, again, the majority of our card business is on the debit side. That business isn't growing as fast as it would just during some of the things that are going on with the economy right now. But those are the two biggest drivers I think on the payments side. Everything else is fairly in sync.\nTyler DuPont: Okay, great. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then just a follow-up. I want to shift gears to margins and just the dynamics you're seeing there across the business. It looks like during the quarter margins came in ahead or at least what we were anticipating on an adjusted basis full year as well was raised. I'd be curious to hear more about what you're seeing that drove that uplift during the quarter and thus the full year raise. And tangentially to that as well but sort of on a separate line given where we're sitting now when do you anticipate Payrailz will become margin neutral to the business?\nMimi Carsley: Yes, I can take the first part of that. So, you're correct in terms of the great margin expansion we saw in Q1. Now, typically, Q1 is our largest-performing quarter from a margin basis because you have the subscription-related revenue there from a renewals perspective. But we saw higher revenue across the board which just then flowed through. I would have as a reminder though, the impact from Connect conference. The timing of that did have a pretty significant impact from the margin improvement, on a year-over-year basis. But I would say, the most part it was just the revenue flow-through and good expense control.\nGreg Adelson: And then Payrailz, so on the Payrailz side, so I think we are tracking to the guidance that we gave back in August. So I think everything is on track based on what we provided back in August.\nTyler DuPont: Okay. Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nQ – David Togut: Thank you. Good morning, Dave and Mimi. I'd just like to start with a question about, the pace of core competitive takeaways in the quarter. It looks like it fell from 16 in the June quarter which was well above trend to 10 in the current quarter. Any call-outs on the competitive environment any changes? Or was this more of a timing-related issue?\nDavid Foss: Hi. Good morning, David. It's interesting that you called that out as a negative that we went from 16 to 10. I'm thrilled with 10, because normally the first quarter is a very light quarter. Last year as a comparative, we had six in the first quarter. We tend to see a real push in the fourth quarter every year. So for us to produce 10 in the quarter was great news, as far as I was concerned. And that's what led me to say, I think 50 to 55 new wins, for this year. Based on what we saw in the first quarter and what I'm seeing in the pipeline, gives me great confidence that we're going to have a really, really strong year. Now with that said, talking about what's happening in our environment, I think all of you know pretty well what's happening in our environment with all of our competitors and some of the disruption that's happened and so on. Those types of events create opportunity for us. These are still very long sales cycles. You don't have a banker, who suddenly wakes up one day and says \"Hey, I think I'll go through a core conversion.\" They're very long. It's a very disruptive process to go through a core conversion. And so, nobody takes it lightly. But we definitely are seeing some impacts in our sales pipeline that are being produced by some of the disruption that's happening in our space around the topic of core.\nQ – David Togut: Got it. And then moving upmarket to the bigger banks has long been a focus area of yours. And you called out the success of treasury management, which is part of that effort to move upmarket. Can you update us on broader initiatives to move up into the bigger bank space? You started talking about this a couple of years ago, with tech modernization. Where are you in this process? And where do you expect to be within 12 18 months?\nDavid Foss: Sure. So in my prepared remarks, I pointed out that we had a couple of banks in the $15 billion to $30 billion range that were at our prospects -- I should say, that were at our client conference. I don't recall -- I've been doing this for a long time, I may have forgotten one. But I don't recall us ever having a brand-new prospect over $10 billion come to our client conference to talk to us about core. So, to have two in that range, I think is pretty indicative of the success that we're having now. And it's really being driven by tech modernization. The story that we have now and our ability to actually demonstrate things that we're doing with this new platform, is getting a lot of attention among larger institutions, because they're trying to figure out how to get to the public cloud environment and they can't see a path forward with their current provider. They see that path with Jack Henry. So, I can't predict when we'll sign one of these larger institutions, as a new client. But I think the activity right now, gives me great confidence that you'll see some announcements in the future that are of significant wins in that regional banking space.\nQ – David Togut: Understood. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Vasu Govil with KBW. Please go ahead. \nQ – Vasu Govil: Hi. Thank you. for taking my questions. I guess first I just wanted to follow up on the previous question about the payments segment. Just wondering, when some of the grow-over issues from the remote deposit capture will be kind of behind us? And what should we expect for growth there for the remainder of the year?\nMimi Carsley: Let me start with that. So Vasu, I would say, that the Q1 trends for the payments segment were pretty much in line with what we saw for the full year last year. And we continue to see strength in that business. So I think we're very positive and optimistic about it. It's not just transactional, there's also ancillary revenues in there in services that we continue to expand upon from a portfolio perspective. So that in itself is derisking just the exposure to transactional.\nQ – Vasu Govil: Thank you. So, basically, it seems like we should expect this rate 1Q rate to continue through the remainder of the year. Any puts and takes there?\nMimi Carsley: I think that's a good assumption.\nVasu Govil: Got it. And then a quick one for you Dave. Banno it seems has been a clear success story for you. It's been a growth driver for several years now. I'm wondering if it's big enough where you might be willing to give us more visibility on how big it is and how fast it's growing. And as you think about your total addressable market within your client base how penetrated are we there today with Banno?\nDavid Foss: Within the existing client base yes we're becoming well penetrated we're over 50%. But we still have a lot of opportunity particularly on the credit union side of our business. It's no secret we started with Banno on the banking side and really started to push hard on the banking side. We have not been as forceful maybe. We didn't have it ready on the credit union side. And we haven't been as forceful on the credit union side. But that certainly is an area of focus for us. So you'll continue to see penetration. I mean, when you have the leading digital banking solution in the industry we expect almost all of our core customers will want to consume that at one point or another because they see the differences between that and anything else in the market. As to the first part of your question, Vasu, we don't tend to try to size individual products. It's part of a segment. We provide guidance per segment. But as with everything else we do at Jack Henry, we don't try to size as far as revenue is concerned on products. I don't expect us to change that. My real goal in giving you the user counts like we have has been to try and give you as much ammunition to model effectively and kind of create your own view of what we're doing at Jack Henry. But I don't expect that we're going to start to provide revenue visibility guidance on a specific product like Banno.\nVasu Govil: All right. appreciate the color. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.\nKartik Mehta: Good morning. Maybe just on free cash flow. I know you said still anticipate about 60% for the year. I'm wondering is it just timing that it's in the first quarter was this good? Or do you think now maybe that 60% might be a little conservative as we go throughout the year?\nMimi Carsley: Good morning, Karthik. I would say that the quarterly cadence can sometimes be choppy. Our Q1 is always a very strong cash flow quarter. We have the annual maintenance and other strong cash flows coming in Q1. So I would say this year might be more of a U shape than anticipated maybe a little bit more steep than last year. But we're still on track and optimistic about that 60%.\nKartik Mehta: And then Dave, just I'm sure banks are talking about AI just like every other business. And I'm wondering at JHA Connect if that was a topic that was discussed. And if so if there are ways where Jack Henry could help banks that want to maybe use AI.\nDavid Foss: Yes. So definitely a topic. Everybody who's anybody seems to be talking about AI these days and trying to figure out what they're talking about as they're talking about it. So, two things to keep in mind here. There's two flavors of AI. There's the kind of traditional artificial intelligence/machine learning version of AI. And then there's generative AI the new kind of hot topic ChatGPT if you will. So we've been deploying traditional AI for many years. So we've had artificial intelligence and machine learning baked into our Banno solution that's baked into our call center solution. And we do a lot with that and have for quite some time. And especially in our fraud area, we use that technology. So we've been demoing that and been able to talk about it effectively for quite some time. The new twist is with generative AI. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we show generative AI working on the Google platform with our platform solution at the Connect conference. So we had one main stage session. Our Chief Technology Officer was onstage with an executive from Google and a bank CEO, who by the way is a beta customer for us. He specifically made the trip to Connect so he could be onstage and talk about what our generative AI solution -- what he thinks it's going to do to change the operating environment for their bank. We're not in production with that yet. This is beta. But we definitely expect that we'll be a player in that space and we'll be able to help our customers using generative AI. And of course the good news is with the Jack Henry Platform it's all written on the Google Cloud. And Google has we believe the best gen AI solution in the market, partly because they have guaranteed they'll protect PII so private information, as we roll this out. And so we're very bullish on the opportunity for the future to use that technology to help our customers.\nKartik Mehta: Okay. Thanks, Dave. I appreciate it.\nDavid Foss: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from John Davis with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nJohn Davis: Hi. Good morning, guys. Mimi, I just wanted to follow-up on free cash flow. I believe you made a comment that you expect to return to normal historical levels from a free cash flow conversion perspective. And I was just curious, is it still kind of in the three to four years once we lap the non-deductibility of R&D expense? Just want to clarify that comment about returning to historical levels.\nMimi Carsley: Great question JD. If I had a crystal ball for Washington, I'd probably be in a little bit of a different role. But we're hopeful that there might be a consideration of changing the legislative nature of that tax deductibility of development expenses. You're starting to hear more and more technology companies, talk about the negative impact to them. If that -- and we're not banking on that happening. If that does not occur, I would agree with you at this point I would say a couple of years out, hopefully more than four so -- but for right now we feel pretty comfortable for this year sticking with the 60% guidance.\nDavid Foss: And JD, if I can tack on this is Dave. So I just want to add a little clarity to everybody out there. One of the things Jack Henry is getting great recognition for right now is all these innovative solutions that were rolling out. We've been spending a lot on new development, new R&D, brand-new products. The Jack Henry Platform is just one of them. And Greg highlighted Banno Business and Financial Crimes Defender. And we have all these new things that we've been rolling out, that's great for the company, that's great for the success or the future success of the company. And it's really created this reputation for Jack Henry as being the innovation leader in our space. The bad news is because of what's happening on the tax side, it's hitting our free cash numbers. And so we have concerns about free cash, which it's all being driven by the fact that we are leading the industry when it comes to innovating and really delivering great solutions for the to sustain the future growth of this company.\nJohn Davis: Okay. No. Thanks. That's helpful. And then Greg, a quick one for you on Payrailz. I heard you earlier say you're kind of on track. It looks like at least for the first two months revenue was a little bit lighter than last year. I think you talked about some implementation delays with partners. So just curious kind of an update there you guys seem really excited about the long term. But how is that going from an integration perspective? Are there still implementation delays? Just any sort of update there would be helpful.\nGreg Adelson: Yeah. Great question. Yeah. Short answer is, we've worked through the integration delays. So we've been able to get through that component. Some of it is just rebuilding up the pipeline with that group. But the reality is we've gotten through the challenges there. The other thing that's important is that the -- some of the additional synergies that we've been able to build as we build out the product has helped us as well. So we're kind of -- we're working through some of the sales delays with lot more of the operational synergies that we've been able to find on things. So everything -- that's why everything continues to be on track.\nDavid Foss: Let's reemphasize JD, the numbers Greg shared in his prepared remarks. So 100 clients live now 50 that are in process of implementation so they're not paying us yet but they're in process and then 20 more new contracts that have just been signed.\nJohn Davis: Okay, great. And then Dave, just if I could squeeze in one more quick one just on capital allocation. You paid down a little bit of debt. You bought back a little bit of stock in the quarter. How do you think about debt paydown versus buybacks with the stock here? And then any update on from an M&A perspective whether valuations have rationalized yet? Just any color there would be helpful.\nDavid Foss: Yeah. So I'll answer the last part first. Not a lot happening when it comes to M&A in the industry. And I've had some interesting conversations with some investment bankers about what they're seeing as far as opportunities in that space. Just nothing really intriguing, right now when it comes to M&A. So that leaves share buyback debt paydown. Of course, we're committed to our dividend policy. And so, the other two topics balancing share buyback with debt paydown, that is definitely going to be a topic at our Board meeting on Monday. Because in this time that needs to be something that we analyze fully. So we're very focused on those two topics and trying to prioritize appropriately. But that will require Board discussion.\nJohn Davis: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nDominick Gabriele: Hey, good morning everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. Dave, should the move to sell products outside the core that you mentioned indicate that you have found a way to stop competitors' sales dynamics of core upgrades? I mean, I think on one of the previous calls you mentioned that your products are so good that the competing sales force would basically say \"Keep our core just upgrade with Jack Henry.\" Is this an indication that you've found a way to stop some of that? And I just have a follow-up. Thanks so much.\nDavid Foss: Yes, you are characterizing my previous comments correctly Dominick. That's exactly what I said. It was a shocker to us. And so we stepped back and made sure that we didn't kind of mess ourselves up in this process. But the answer is yes, we're very confident that we have by targeting a few specific cores with a few specific messages and an approach that leverages the Jack Henry Platform. So one of the good news one of the good things is and Greg highlighted it in his prepared comments these new solutions we're talking about Banno and Financial Crimes Defender and so on they are living on the Jack Henry Platform today, the platform we've talked about for core modernization, those are already on that platform. And so we've created a strategy that takes advantage of the fact that those are on the platform. We believe it will create an opportunity for us in these targeted cores. And so yes, we believe we have an answer now. And as Greg pointed out, we're talking about beginning of – or next summer that we'll really be active in sales. Do you want to add something to that?\nGreg Adelson: Yes, just two things to add. So one, the other component of this is our ability to bundle. We found some pretty good bundles that we think we can sell into that. So we think that will also help with the success rate and using what Dave said kind of leveraging the technology platform and some of the modules that we have coming out. The other part is the integration work that it does take. So it does take some while to get some of that integration work done before you can actually go out and close a deal. So we're working on all that in the background as well.\nDominick Gabriele: Great. Thank you so much for the color. And I guess now that we have a modest deconversion expectation going forward and the way you've structured your guidance, the ROIC of the quarter was 20%. I was wondering if – and I know you don't set a target for this. But do you believe that the company has kind of hit the floor ROIC level now? And maybe you could help provide some dynamics of why that might move around given some of the investments you're making. Thanks so much.\nMimi Carsley: Sure, Dom. So first let me say that I think 20% ROIC is quite attractive and would be the envy of a lot of companies. So it's a commitment to us. We believe that our thoughtful and conservative approach both from a fortress balance sheet, how we think about capital allocation has led to attractive ROICs historically. And it's something that we know as a metric we're following. We know you're following it quite closely from a sustainability of that shareholder value creation. I would say there's a little bit of a math challenge just from the metric itself. So because our net income is growing and because right now we are focused on debt paydown, we did some share repurchase our 35 years of – fiscal years of dividend growth, those take cash. So while the net income increases the shareholder equity therefore, it reduces. Unless we continue to grow that dividend and do large buybacks or debt paydown by their nature mathematically that ROIC is going to dip a touch. And so I think it's just more of the hangover effect from the debt we had from the Payrailz acquisition. And as we pay down that debt as we do more share repurchases and return that net income back to investors, you'll see that rebound number. So it's just for the trailing 12-month impact of that and the growing net income into equity that has that impact on that.\nDominick Gabriele: That's super helpful. And 20% is very attractive. Thanks so much for the help.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Please go ahead.\nDave Koning: Yes, hey, guys. Thanks so much. Nice job. I guess you've mentioned a bunch of stuff on Payrailz already but just a couple just questions around there. How fast year-over-year is that just growing just as a standalone entity? And then it looks like you lost a couple million in the quarter, which is pretty similar I think from a pace standpoint as what you've been losing recently. Is that getting better? And then it looked like you changed the revenue guidance just a touch not much. But just kind of all of those things it seems a few moving parts there right now.\nMimi Carsley: Good morning, Dave. Let me start by taking it and then I'll let Greg add in from a strategic perspective. I would say the acquisition remains on track. As Greg mentioned, we feel confident in our ability to hit the previous guidance. Revenue is growing at a nice clip. So I would say the visibility, because you're only looking at two months if not, I wouldn't annualize that to take it more of a trend than it is. So we still feel very confident in terms of that growth and the journey to profitability.\nGreg Adelson: Yeah. And I would say as I mentioned earlier, we've kind of unhitched some of the barriers that we've had where a lot of the Payrailz solutions in the past were sold through resellers. So now that we brought in and have a lot of our direct sales folks focus on that and working through the issues that we have with the resellers, we feel very strongly that we're back on track. And the technology itself again is even stronger than we anticipated as we've gotten in and have been able to work through some of the challenges there.\nDave Koning: Okay. Got you. Thank you. And then the one other thing just between the GAAP operating income guidance and GAAP EPS, the two items would be interest income it seems like you're almost guiding for that to be net zero. And then tax rate would be the other. Is that like 24.5% just those two numbers to get us to GAAP EPS?\nMimi Carsley: Yeah, Dave, I would say continue to use 24% from a tax rate. At this point it's too early in the year to see anything materially changing off of that. So I would still recommend using the 24%. The one positive from higher interest rates is you're starting to see a little bit of interest income as well as it helps as an offset to interest expense. And I would just say those are probably -- share count a little bit we did some buyback in Q1. But I would look at the totality of that. But most of the change in EPS is really coming from the operational impact the flow-through from revenue growth. I would highlight just that last year as a reminder the gains last year from the asset sale and the impact from VEDIP this year.\nDave Koning: Got you. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Cris Kennedy with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nCris Kennedy: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. David, you talked about innovation. Can you just talk about how the module progression for origin or the Jack Henry Platform is going?\nDavid Foss: Actually I'll defer to Greg for that one. He's more in the day-to-day with the team on what we're doing there. So go ahead Greg.\nGreg Adelson: Yeah, sure. And as I mentioned we have a couple of modules that are out in beta right now. So we're tracking exactly to the time frames that we have. We do have a public road map that we share with our customers. We do not share it outside of our customer base. But we have a road map. We're executing actually to the T of that particular road map. And as I mentioned earlier we're going to be pretty excited to be able to share where some of those modules are in their evolution and other modules that we've created back to a full monetization strategy that we have going for the rest of this year and into next.\nDavid Foss: And Greg is going to give you that detail Cris on the February call.\nGreg Adelson: Correct.\nCris Kennedy: Okay, looking forward to that. And then just a quick update Banno for business, is that attracting customers that are outside of your core base? Thank you.\nDavid Foss: Yeah. So we're not selling outside the core base yet as I mentioned earlier. But it definitely has got attention from people outside the core base. And we're lapping because it's one of those, you want to go and sell it right away but you've got to make sure that everything is lined up and ready to be effective. And it's part of a larger strategy than simply selling Banno business outside the base. So yes we definitely are getting attention. We definitely are preparing to get sales out there actively selling outside the base. But it's part of that broader strategy that we talked about earlier because it goes with retail Banno as well.\nGreg Adelson: And a lot of that sales will not happen until next fiscal year.\nDavid Foss: Yeah.\nCris Kennedy: Understood. Thanks for taking the questions.\nDavid Foss: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you so much. I know we talked a little bit about Payrailz and implementation, et cetera. But can you help us think about the time to revenue and how that scales? Like when does -- when do we start to see contribution from implementations? And then how long does it take to get that fully implemented and scaled within the P&L?\nGreg Adelson: Yeah. Well as far as implementations, I mean typically as we have with any of those type of bill pay and payment-providing products it really is somewhat dependent on the customer. We can actually install within 90 days typically. So some of it is dependent on the customer. Some of it is dependent on a core deal where an actual Payrailz may be part of that core deal so they're waiting to implement that. So some of those contracts could have longer tail before they're actually implemented. But as I mentioned earlier with the 100 that are actually on the platform now the 50 that we have in the implementation queue and the 20 that were just sold we have the ability to start moving the needle. As I mentioned earlier we are on track for the guidance that we gave in August for the revenue numbers which is again I think a substantial amount of drive. But again even those percentages obviously we started with a small number. So we're driving the ability to get the technology in place to get all the things that we wanted to do from a tech modernization strategy and driving that as part of -- while we're waiting for some of these contracts to go. But the technology itself is going to drive the longer-term part of this strategy not just the immediate parts that we're doing with the current Payrailz offering.\nMimi Carsley: And let me just layer on there. James, good morning. Just as a reminder the payment sector which is 36% roughly of our total revenue of that bill pay let's call it about 15%. So this is really a reinvigoration of that iPay business that was pretty mature. And as so we won't be able to see Payrailz in and of itself but that together that combined business plus the added innovation of new features that neither existing platform has on their own you'll start to see over the upcoming quarters a reinvigoration that will help that total segment.\nJames Faucette: Got it. Got it. Appreciate that. And then I want to ask on the competitive landscape. One of your competitors in at least an adjacent market announced a new product initiative targeting banks and credit unions that enables them to have more of a lightweight core for digital deposit products. And I think they're trying to go at it with a low price point. I know you don't compete on price. But just curious how you're thinking about the competitive environment generally for Banno especially as you kind of work to get that into the installed base and think about opportunities outside the installed base.\nDavid Foss: We refer to that as a side core. We've been doing that for years. So that's not a requirement of the digital banking application necessarily it's a requirement of having core functionality where you can actually process those accounts. We've been doing that for a long time. Certainly, we have that integrated with our Banno solution. But the nice thing about our offering is that if the customer simply wants to do it for deposit gathering we can do that. If they want to host a complete digital bank as they continue to grow it's the same platform it's the exact same solution. We can offer loans and GL and everything else through that offering. So that's not something new to Jack Henry. We've been doing that for quite some time.\nJames Faucette: Appreciate that Dave. Thanks.\nJames Faucette: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Vance Sherard for any closing remarks.\nVance Sherard: Thank you, MJ. As Dave mentioned next week on Tuesday the 14th, we hope you will join us either in person or virtually as we host our Annual Shareholder Meeting. Additionally we look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor events during November and December. In conclusion, we thank all Jack Henry associates whose efforts produce these strong financial results. Thank you for joining us today. And MJ will you please provide the replay number?\nOperator: Of course. Thank you, Vance. The replay number for today's call is 877-344-7529 and the access code is 2951710. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."
