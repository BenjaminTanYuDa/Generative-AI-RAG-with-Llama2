[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Jeffrey Mathews.\nJeffrey Mathews: Welcome everyone to Scholastic’s fiscal 2024 third quarter earnings call. Today on the call, I am joined by Peter Warwick, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Haji Glover, our new Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, who I am excited to welcome. As usual, we posted the accompanying investor presentation on our IR website at investor.scholastic.com, which you may download now if you’ve not already done so. We would like to point out that certain statements made today will be forward-looking. These forward-looking statements, by their nature, are subject to various risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated. In addition, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures as defined in Regulation G. The reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures may be found in the company’s earnings release and accompanying financial tables filed this afternoon on our Form 8-K. This earnings release has also been posted to our Investor Relations website. I encourage you to review the disclaimers in the release and investor presentation and to review the risk factors disclosed in the company’s annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC. Should you have any questions after today’s call, please send them directly to our IR e-mail address, investors_relations@scholastic.com. And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Peter Warwick to begin this afternoon’s presentation.\nPeter Warwick: So, thanks Jeff and good afternoon everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. During the third quarter, Scholastic executed our long-term strategy for growth and impact while delivering value for our shareholders. In particular, we continue to prove our leadership in children’s publishing and media through a consistent and growing presence on bestsellers lists and advanced our 360-degree content creation strategy including with our recently announced agreement to acquire 100% of the economic interest in 9 Story Media Group, which I’ll discuss in a moment. In quarter three, we also continued to execute solidly in School Reading Events and Education Solutions, while navigating the currently complex environment in U.S. schools and positioned ourselves for an important quarter four season and long-term growth. We demonstrated our confidence in the long-term outlook for our business with continued share buybacks, returning over $60 million to shareholders during the quarter through a combination of open market share repurchases and our regular dividend. As expected, in quarter three, Scholastic recorded modest revenue declines and higher losses, largely reflecting external factors and the shifting seasonality of our business. Going into quarter four, typically our biggest and most profitable quarter, we are confident in achieving our previously provided revised fiscal 2024 guidance for adjusted EBITDA of between $165 million to $175 million, with full year revenue approximately level with or slightly below the prior year. I am thrilled to be joined on today’s call by our new CFO, Haji Glover, who rejoined Scholastic in January. Haji is a forward-looking, growth-oriented finance leader, who already knows Scholastic well. He is well positioned to drive change and focus our business on the future, using his experience and perspective to build on the work of his predecessor, Ken Cleary, who led the finance organization to dramatically increase efficiencies across our operations. Haji is another key addition to the Scholastic leadership team bringing new perspectives, new skills and a shared commitment to helping Scholastic build and execute our plans for long-term growth and value creation. As announced this morning, we’ve appointed two new directors to our board, Kaya Henderson and Alix Guerrier. They are both accomplished leaders in K-12 education and education technology with extensive experience serving kids, families and schools as well as expertise driving excellence in complex organizations. Kaya’s career spans over three decades of work in schools, policy and the not-for-profit sector, earning her a reputation as one of the most admired school leaders in America. Alix contributes over 20 years of experience in the education sector, including as a teacher and successful EdTech entrepreneur. They are joining the company at an exciting moment when their skills, experience and market knowledge are especially relevant to us, and we’re very happy to welcome them. Turning now to the highlights across our business segments. In the Children’s Book Publishing and Distribution segment, revenues declined 5% as last quarter reflected the planned resizing of Book Clubs as well as lower expected production revenue from Scholastic Entertainment. Scholastic Trade Publishing continued to outperform with consolidated trade sales up 15%, excluding Scholastic Entertainment. This strong performance contrasts positively with the juvenile and young adult retail book selling market, which was down a slight 1% during the quarter as overall sales levels continue to revert to pre-pandemic growth trends. Scholastic’s exceptional showing in retail was driven by a strong performance over the holiday season and multiple new releases, including Heroes by Alan Gratz, and the latest titles in our popular graphic novel series, Heartstopper, Wings of Fire, Amulet and The Baby-Sitters Club. Scholastic’s new frontlist titles top best seller lists, and we continue to expand our market share of middle-grade graphic novels. At one point last quarter, in fact, Scholastic titles filled every spot on BookScan’s top 20 list of best-selling juvenile graphic novels. In 2024, we’ve increased our already dominant presence on the New York Times middle grade and graphic books and Manga best seller lists compared to the same period last year. This includes Waverider, the long-waited finale in the Amulet series, which landed at #1 on the New York Times graphic novel bestseller list and was the #1 juvenile title the week of on sale with over 30,000 copies sold. We’re also excited about multiple upcoming releases, which we expect to drive further momentum in our Children’s publishing and spotlight are incredible authors. This includes 2 more releases this calendar year in Dav Pilkey’s Dog Man series, including Dog Man, The Scarlet Shedder, which went on sale earlier this week. In August, we released Unico, a new kid-friendly Manga series, which is already generating a lot of buzz. Highlights of our full calendar include the illustrated edition of Suzanne Collins’ worldwide bestseller, The Hunger Games; the new illustrated Christmas at Hogwarts and the latest novel from best-selling and award-winning author Alice Hoffman, When We Flew Away, a novel of Anne Frank before The Diary. In Scholastic Entertainment, revenues were down in quarter 3 relative to the prior year period when we recorded revenue for delivery of episodes of Eva the Owlet. However, building for the future, we continue to execute on our 360-degree strategy, bringing Scholastic brands and franchises to the screen. Disney announced another season of the live action Goosebumps TV series on Disney+ after a highly successful first season this past fall. We expect the second season to drive significant incremental exposure and upside for our global best-selling book series and brand. As the President of Disney-branded television has said, \"audiences everywhere, fell in love with Goosebumps’ chills, thrills, heart and humor, making it one of Disney-branded television’s most watched shows of last year.” In addition to the Goosebumps franchise, we continue to partner with top-tier platforms, producers, screenwriters and actors to meet strong demand for newstalgia. As I’ve discussed on previous calls, we have multiple exciting projects in our pipeline, building on best-selling Scholastic franchises like Magic School Bus, 39 clues, Animorphs, Fly Guy and more as we continue to create new media moments to complete the virtuous circle of children’s brands on page and screen. Turning to our School Reading Events division, the fiscal first and third quarters are typically a quieter time given the timing of school holidays. In Book Fairs, sales declined slightly in quarter 3. Revenue per fair, or RPF, remains close to record levels. However, this school year, we have seen RPF decline slightly. This largely reflects the addition of smaller fairs to the full schedule as we increase fair count as well as headwinds in the school environment, including high rates of absenteeism, which impacts student participation, and teacher shortages. That said, fair count remains strong and on track to meet our goal of returning to 90% of pre-pandemic levels, while strengthening the profitability of our fairs. Thanks to our customer-centric approach, from improved tools for Book Fair hosts and new payment options for kids and families, to kid’s favorite, merchandising and assortments, we continue to deliver the unique, joyful celebration of reading that only Scholastic Book Fairs can provide. As a result, we remain optimistic about a strong spring season. Last quarter, we also further refined our plan to strategically resize Book Clubs to a more profitable core as part of our plan to achieve long-term profit growth in School Reading Events over time. We’re already seeing cost savings as a result. That said, lower teacher participation and spending from earlier this school year is carrying over into Club’s spring results as expected. Moving to Education Solutions. Quarter 3 sales were down very modestly as we operationalized our growth strategy and realigned key product lines in the market to deliver blended, literacy-focused solutions. We see significant opportunities ahead and are advancing plans to reinvent our classroom magazines business to combine digital content and instruction. As we work to broaden and deepen our print and digital offerings, we’re focused on meeting the needs of educators, the increasing need for literacy products and schools’ and districts’ ability to tap multiple funding streams, including federal asset funding, which school districts must commit to use by September 2024. Turning to our International segment. Revenues and profits were up strongly as a result of the ongoing recovery in book sales, particularly in Canada, the UK and Asia. Our international team is focused on helping to drive the recovery in target markets and ensuring our titles are optimally positioned, while further driving efficiencies and leveraging corporate resources as appropriate. Since its 2017 reboot, Scholastic Entertainment has proven that there’s significant demand for Scholastic’s brand and publishing IP on screens as well as the page and that we can effectively and profitably meet this demand. Further, as it opens more channels and opportunities to reach kids where they are, we’ve seen this strategy boost book sales and increase the value of our IP and brand. This is the virtuous circle that I’ve spoken about. Last week’s announcement to invest in 9 Story Media Group was a timely opportunity to cement our relationship with a long time, mission-aligned partner and team. 9 Story is an industry-leading creator, producer and distributor of premium animated and live-action children’s content. Scholastic has been working with the company and its founder for over 20 years. By acquiring 100% of the economic interest and a minority of voting rights in 9 Story Media Group, we achieved two things. First, we’ll significantly expand the scope and scale of our media business, adding 9 Story’s production distribution and licensing revenue and profit lines to Scholastic. Second, through greater strategic coordination and integration, we will substantially increase our ability and speed in building and monetizing Scholastic’s global multimedia children’s brands, which underpin and will broaden our 360-degree content creation strategy. These two rationales are complementary and additive, which is why we’re so excited about this transformative opportunity for Scholastic. With 9 Story, in addition to the talent of their team and their exciting pipeline, we’re acquiring turnkey global production studios in Toronto, Dublin and Bali, with state-of-the-art animation and live action production capabilities. The quality of their work speaks for itself with 21 Emmy award wins. 9 Story controls an extensive content library, distributing over 5,000 half-hour episodes of 2D and 3D animation together with a live action catalog as well as over 10,000 half-hour programs distributed across major advertising video on demand, or AVOD, platforms. 9 Story also has the ability to tap into significant Canadian and Irish tax subsidies and to pre-sell and monetize productions through their global sales, distribution and licensing teams. This substantially derisks new projects and improves the long-term economics of media franchises far beyond what’s possible under our current arm’s length relationship. As I previously mentioned, we believe this investment to acquire 100% of the economic interest in 9 Story will significantly deepen our capabilities across the entire IP life cycle, in turn, bolstering our 360-degree content creation strategy. Scholastic and 9 Story share the same mission, to engage children and families with inspiring stories and content. In today’s world, it’s important that we meet kids where they are and bring them back to reading. We see tremendous opportunity to leverage the deeper capabilities we gain from the deal to support the growth of Scholastic’s children’s franchises, drive book sales, create additional opportunity for Scholastic authors and partners and introduce millions of new kids and families to Scholastic books and stories. We’ll also expand long-term monetization opportunities as we bring 9 Story’s in-house distribution, merchandising and licensing teams and global sales network onto the Scholastic platform. So to sum up, we believe this deal is both additive and synergistic. It adds 9 Story’s industry-leading capabilities and revenue streams, their compelling economic model and a highly talented team. Leveraging Scholastic’s trusted brand and proven ability to create iconic children’s series and franchises, the new capabilities will allow us to build deeper connections with young people through our stories as the pages of our books come to life on screens and through merchandising. In short, this opportunity positions Scholastic to meet the continued strong demand for high-quality kids and family entertainment, expanding the footprint of Scholastic’s authors and illustrators, building global franchises on every platform and of course, creating more value for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing more once the deal is closed. And with that, I’ll now hand the call over to Haji.\nHaji Glover: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I turn to our financial results, I would like to say how happy I am to be back at Scholastic, a company whose mission and people are very dear to me. As the new CFO, I have the privilege and the opportunity to lead a strong, mission-driven financial organization at Scholastic at a very exciting moment in the company’s history. The work that Ken and the finance team achieved to drive efficiencies over the past few years has created a solid foundation that we can now use strategically to accelerate opportunities for growth and value creation. Our outlook is also strengthened by the progress we have made over the past 1.5 years, allocating capital against our priorities, which include investing it in growth opportunities, maintaining a strong and efficient balance sheet and returning excess cash to the shareholders to enhance their returns. Our recent agreement to invest in 9 Story and the over $60 million we’ve returned to shareholders last quarter will speak to that progress. I look forward to supporting Peter, my talented colleagues and the Board and continuing to rigorously allocate capital to support Scholastic’s long-term growth. With that, I will now walk through our consolidated financial results. I will refer to our adjusted results for the third quarter, excluding one-time items unless otherwise indicated. In fiscal 2023, the company did not report one-time items. Please refer to our press release tables and SEC filings for a complete disclosure of one-time items. As Peter described in our seasonally smaller third quarter, revenues were $323.7 million, just slightly below the prior year period. Adjusted operating loss in the quarter grew to $30.6 million, as expected, reflecting increasing seasonality and spending in preparation for anticipated significant Q4 compared to $27.7 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $7.2 million from $5.4 million a year ago, in-line with adjusted operating income. Adjusted net loss, excluding one-time items, was $23.3 million compared to $19.2 million in the prior year period. Adjusted loss per diluted share was $0.80 compared to $0.57 in fiscal 2023. Turning to our segment results. In Children’s Book Publishing and Distribution, revenues for the third quarter decreased 5% to $193.6 million, primarily driven by strategic resizing of Book Clubs. Adjusted segment operating income was $2.7 million, up from $1.9 million in the prior year period, reflecting improved efficiencies on modestly lower revenues. Within the segment, consolidated trade revenues were $77.6 million in the quarter compared to the prior period revenues of $72.8 million, driven by strong frontlist sales and multiple bestsellers in the quarter. This was partially offset by lower timing-related revenues in Scholastic Entertainment relative to the prior year when the company completed the delivery of episodes of the animated series, Eva The Owlet based on Scholastic’s Owl Diaries series. Book Fair revenues decreased 1% to $102.7 million in the quarter, driven by a slightly lower average revenue per fair, partly offset by higher fair count. Fair count remains on track to reach nearly 90% of prepandemic levels this year, up from 85% in fiscal 2023. Book Club revenues of $13.3 million were down versus prior year period revenues of $27.7 million. As the company has previously discussed, we eliminated unprofitable offerings during the back-to-school season as part of our strategy to shrink this business to a more profitable core. These actions impacted third quarter revenues as expected and will continue to have an impact for the remainder of the school year. Turning to the Education Solutions segment. Revenues were down 2% to $68.5 million in the third quarter, reflecting lower sales of supplemental and structural materials, partially offset by higher state sponsored program revenues. Segment operating loss was $800,000 compared to profit of $700,000 in the prior period, largely reflecting lower revenues and continued investments to realign key product lines to deliver blended, literacy-focused solutions. International segment revenues increased 16% to $59.1 million in the quarter, reflecting continued recovery in our major markets, particularly in Canada and the UK, as well as in Asia. The net foreign exchange impact was negligible in the quarter. Segment operating loss improved to $5.9 million compared to a loss of $9 million a year ago, primarily driven by improved results in Canada, which benefited from the reorganization of Book Clubs in the first quarter. Adjusted unallocated overhead costs of $26.6 million increased from $21.3 million in the prior period, primarily reflecting favorable litigation settlements in the prior year. This was partially offset by higher rental revenue recorded in corporate overhead in the current period. As a reminder, this was previously recorded as a benefit in SG&A in the prior year period. On approximately 27,000 square feet lease as of today, we expect annualized straight-line rental revenue to total approximately $9.9 million in the fiscal 2024. Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $13.1 million in the current quarter compared to $7.6 million in the prior period. Lower inventory spend in the quarter, driven by lower freight and manufacturing costs compared to a year ago, improved working capital. We continue to manage inventory purchases substantially closer to our demand, resulting in sufficient inventory on hand and lower spend. Free cash flow use in the third quarter was $7.1 million, compared to $11.9 million in the prior year period, reflecting lower working capital, partially offset by one-time severance costs. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents, net of total debt, was $78.9 million compared to $218.5 million at the end of the fiscal 2023. In addition to investments in content and capabilities to drive growth, we continue to return capital to shareholders in the third quarter through our regular dividend and open market share repurchases. We repurchased 1.4 million shares in the third quarter for $54.2 million. Together with our regular dividend, we returned over $60 million in the third quarter and $161 million so far this fiscal year. In fiscal 2024, thus far, we have repurchased 3.6 million shares, which net of 523,000 shares issued related to stock compensation, represents 11% of the company’s shares outstanding. The company’s shares outstanding are now below 28 million. We do not anticipate our share repurchase program or regular dividend to be impacted by the investment in 9 Story, which we intend to initially fund from our available cash and revolving credit facility. Based on year-to-date results, we now are forecasting full year free cash flow of $55 million to $65 million, given strong working capital management in the third quarter. Total CapEx and prepublication spending for the full year is still forecast to be $100 million to $110 million. Turning to the financial details of our investment in 9 Story, upon closing the transaction, 9 Story will contribute significantly to Scholastic’s financial results and be fully consolidated with Scholastic Entertainment in a new reporting segment. 9 Story recorded revenue of approximately $104 million in its most recent fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. 9 Story is comprised of four business units that provide capabilities across the entire IP life cycle, with the majority of its revenues currently coming from its production work, both the creative service production work it does for other IP owners, including Scholastic, and productions for IP that it controls. On the basis of its compelling standalone business model, we expect 9 Story to contribute top and bottom line growth through its existing content library, best-in-class production studios and global distribution and licensing capabilities. Adding in the synergy potential was Scholastic’s own IP and development work, we expect the deal to reduce the capital intensity of Scholastic’s own productions, allowing us to expand development of Scholastic’s IP and to drive long-term earnings accretion. As Peter noted earlier, we acquired a 100% economic interest with minority voting rights in 9 Story for approximately $186 million. This is a common deal structure in the Canadian media industry to ensure that 9 Story remains Canadian controlled and as such, remains eligible for production tax credits there, subject to approval by the Minister of Canadian Heritage, which is a condition of closing the transaction. Typical of these deals, voting control lies in a different class of shares, the majority of which will be held by the current Canadian management of 9 Story. Scholastic will have rights to approve certain key decisions related to the company’s business affairs and overall strategy, including changing the nature of the company’s business, the setting of annual budgets and major investment and transactions. 9 Story also has assets to tax credits in Ireland for productions that are based there. As Peter mentioned, 9 Story’s access to tax subsidies is a key advantage, enabling the company to achieve significantly higher margins on production, which otherwise Scholastic could not achieve. In addition to favorable margins, 9 Story’s ability to pre-sell productions through their global sales and distribution team also de-risk project financing, which should enable Scholastic to pursue more production of its IP. I would also like to reemphasize how this investment, in addition to our actions to return capital to shareholders, aligns with our capital allocation strategy, which prioritize growth investments, as I outlined earlier. We expect to initially fund the investment from our available cash and revolving credit facility. We are also maintaining our current dividend and have re-upped our share repurchase program, as I have just described. This deal is expected to close in Scholastic’s fiscal 2025 first quarter, which begins June 1, 2024. Turning to our outlook, as Peter noted, we are affirming our previously revised guidance for the fiscal year. As we head into our fourth quarter, which is typically our most profitable, we continue to target adjusted EBITDA of $165 million to $175 million. This excludes the impact of one-time charges of $10.6 million related to restructuring and acquisition activity incurred so far this year. We continue to expect full year revenue to be approximately level with or slightly below the prior year. Thank you for your time today, and I will now hand the call back to Peter for his final remarks.\nPeter Warwick: Thank you, Haji. As you have heard on the call today, there is an enormous amount of activity underway across the business. We are driving momentum behind the trusted Scholastic brand in our children’s publishing and media franchises, helping to reach more kids and families with high-quality engaging content that inspires learning on the page and screen, and driving long-term growth and shareholder value creation. I am excited about the potential of our strategy and the strength of execution underway across the businesses to reach our goal for long-term growth. Let me now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Mathews: Thank you, Peter. We appreciate our investors’ time today and continuing support. With that, we will open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brendan McCarthy with Sidoti. You may proceed.\nBrendan McCarthy: Hey. Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to start off in the consolidated trade area, it looks like, the sales were up 7%, solid growth there. Can you talk about the frontlist and backlist I mean which contributed more to that growth?\nPeter Warwick: We were particularly – it’s Peter here. We were particularly pleased with the performance over the holiday season. And on top of that, we did particularly well with a number of frontlist titles, particularly new graphics novels, which is a category that we are very much the market leader. So, it was – I mean it was really a question of the titles and authors, which we have published on a regular basis over a number of years, but also some good new titles as well. So, it was really a combination of – it was both new and continuity in that respect.\nBrendan McCarthy: Understood. Got it. And then looking quickly at gross margins, they were up nicely year-over-year. How do you expect that trend to continue looking out the next couple of fiscal quarters?\nHaji Glover: Hi Brendan, this is Haji. Thanks for the question. So, as we are looking right now, with the cost of freight in our COGS line, you can see that we have a strong improvement year-to-date. Roughly about $20 million year-to-date that we have saved in both our COGS and our inventory, it’s really driven around our utilization, or we are basically back in line to pre-pandemic levels when it comes to our inventory levels, which is really driving the profitability in our gross margin section.\nBrendan McCarthy: Got it. Thanks. That’s helpful. Turning to the Book Clubs business, another pretty large revenue decline there, but can you offer some insight into the timing of the shrink to grow strategy there? Maybe over the next couple of quarters, when do you expect the other revenue variation to kind of normalize?\nPeter Warwick: Well, it’s a medium to longer term project, Brendan, in terms of what we are doing. What we are seeking to do is to have a smaller Book more profitable business. And I would expect that it’s going to take some quarters before we get to the destination that we might ultimately want to be to, but I am reasonably confident that there is going to be improvement quarter-over-quarter in terms of performance. And what we are doing at the moment is very much working right now on testing some new strategies for next year that we hope will contribute very much to our medium to long-term plan.\nBrendan McCarthy: Got it. Thanks Peter. Maybe one more question for me, just looking at the 9 Story investment, and I know you mentioned probably lower capital intensity business that you are looking out in the future as well as certain tax advantages. But do you expect to see any integration costs or elevated costs from this investment over the next couple of quarters?\nHaji Glover: We don’t expect to see a large number of integration costs. If anything, we are looking to continue to let 9 Story’s working is to our and find opportunities to bolt on things within that business. But right now, it’s very efficient, and we could continue to see that there is potential opportunity for some synergies in the future.\nBrendan McCarthy: Understood. Haji and Peter, thank you very much for the answers. I appreciate it. That’s all for me.\nPeter Warwick: Thank you, Brendan.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our Q&A. I will pass the call back to management for any closing remarks.\nPeter Warwick: Well, thank you, operator, and thank you to all of those who joined us this afternoon. I wish you all a happy spring. We look forward to engaging with our investors in the coming days and to providing a further update on our progress, including our investment in 9 Story and on our plan for fiscal 2025 in July on our year-end call. Thanks again. Goodbye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

And now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Warwick to begin this afternoon's presentation.\nPeter Warwick: Thanks, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us. Scholastic executed solidly in our second quarter during the important back-to-school season in the Northern Hemisphere. Our School Reading Events and Education divisions while progressing their plans continued to demonstrate Scholastic's unique capabilities to get tens of millions of kids' access to engaging high quality books. Scholastic's Trade Publishing and Entertainment teams continue to create and publish best-selling books and highly rated content and IP for the company's own channels, as well as retailers and third-party ones, fulfilling the second pillar of Scholastic's unique integrated publishing and distribution strategy. With kids back at school and parents and educators refocused on the importance of reading and learning, Scholastic's mission is as relevant as ever today, even in the more complex environment in U.S. schools in which we currently find ourselves operating this year. Last quarter, we also took actions to create long-term value, continuing our investments in growth initiatives and returning over $58 million to shareholders through share buybacks and our dividend. Quarter two profits remained steady on modestly lower revenues. These results, however, came in below our expectations for profit growth as a result of external factors, a trend we now forecast to continue for the remainder of the school year. As a result, we've adjusted our fiscal 2024 guidance and have taken steps to target additional revenue opportunities underlying spending in the second half of the year. We remain positive about long-term outlook for growth and impact, as we continue executing on our strategy. Investing in content and capabilities to drive growth and returning capital to shareholders, including under an expanded share repurchase authorization announced today. This afternoon, I'd like to review our second quarter results and updated outlook for the rest of the year. Ken will then discuss our financial results in more detail. I'd like to begin with some comments on the macroenvironment in which we're operating. First, as I referenced a moment ago, compared to a year ago, the environment in U.S. schools is currently more complex and challenging, reflecting growing polarization in our society and politicization of schools and school boards, higher rates of absenteeism, and chronic teacher shortages. Together, these factors have put greater demand on schools and teachers, including through expanded restrictions on educators, parents, and kids ability to choose books and mandate changing how kids are taught, especially with respect to literacy instruction. Taking the longer view, however, it's clear that reading, literacy, and learning are key priorities that families, educators, and leaders all agree on independent of geography or party affiliation. Scholastic remains uniquely positioned to respond to these needs today and in the future. We will continue to focus on serving all kids, families, and educators as we've done for the past 100-plus years. Second, we saw signs of a modest short-term slowdown in consumer spending growth for a period this fall relative to prior year and expectations for our school-based channels. During recent weeks, we've seen signs of a rebound. This pattern is in line with trends reported by some retailers this fall. Retail sales of children's and young adult books also declined 2% during our second quarter versus a year ago according to BookScan. The retail adult and kids book market is still up significantly compared to the same period in 2019. So we see this dynamic largely as a reversion to pre-pandemic growth trends. Third and positively, we continue to benefit from lower costs of paper, manufacturing, freight, and shipping versus a year ago. This is seen in our inventory purchasing already and therefore cash flows and will be reflected in operating as we sell through [technical difficulty]. Turning to our results. Quarter two is the seasonally largest quarter for the Children's Book segment. Segment revenue declined 6% reflecting the planned resizing of Book Clubs, as well as lower expected production revenue from Scholastic Entertainment, which is reported in consolidated trade. Excluding Scholastic Entertainment consolidated trade sales rose 3%. Fair sales grew 1% to $242 million in quarter two, surpassing the previous year's record and demonstrating their enduring presence in the U.S. Education system. Fair count rose as planned. Revenue per fair rose modestly on a same fair basis but declined on average due to mix, reflecting the addition of mostly small fares for the fall schedule as we increase fair count. Cancellation rates improved year-over-year. Over the past two years, we've transformed Book Fairs with new customer-centric strategies and operational improvements, which have resulted in higher participation and transaction sizes, contributing to higher revenue per fair. Average revenue per fair or RPF remained close to record levels, reflecting the progress we've made, however, this full year we have seen RPF grow more slowly than last year or our expectations for the current one, dampened by the macro factors in schools and consumer spending that I just described. Lastly, as a result, Fair's profitability did not meet expectations because RPF contributes strongly to operating leverage and expanding margins. Looking ahead at the second half of the school year, we largely expect full trends to continue into the spring as it is the historical pattern. In response, however, we've made adjustments to our merchandising strategy in Fair's for the spring, which we're optimistic about. We also remain confident in achieving near 90% of pre-pandemic fair count this year. We remain focused on innovating and improving the book Fair host experience with new tools like our updated online fair preview, an improved online restock process, while maintaining our focus on kids with high-quality kid-centric merchandising. In our School Book Clubs, this year is a transitional year as we integrate Clubs and Fairs into a combined School Reading Events division. Last quarter, Clubs gross profit remained approximately level with prior year, while we right-size the business. Revenues declined 44% with planned reduction in unprofitable offers and promotional spending resulting in lower order. Participation and spending by teachers and families, however, we're also lower than expected, delivering lower revenue per order echoing the macro trends we are seeing elsewhere. We see improvements in response rates as we continue to iterate our redesigned club flyers, which should benefit order numbers in the second half of the year. That said, we also expect to see the impact of lower teacher participation and spending in the fall to carry over into Clubs' spring results. Scholastic's trade publishing continued to execute strongly in the retail book-selling market that was down slightly year-over-year, as I just described. This primarily impacted backlist titles. Very encouragingly, Scholastic's new frontlist titles continue to dominate and expand our presence on bestseller lists, achieving 117 weeks cumulatively on the New York Times Middle-Grade bestseller list, and 88 weeks on the Times Young Adult bestseller list. We also maintained our leading presence on the New York Times Graphic Books and Manga and Children's series bestseller lists. If best-of-year lists are published, Scholastic titles have found throughout. Among our top sellers, last quarter, the interactive edition of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and The Harry Potter Wizarding Almanac, both regularly ranked on bestseller lists. Cat Kid Comic Club Number 5; Influencers by Dav Pilkey, which shipped during quarter two and went on sale on November 28, became the number one bestselling book on BookScan across kids and adult categories. Its success has lifted backlist sales of Dav's Dog Man and Captain Underpants series too. The new paperback edition of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, Suzanne Collins' prequel to The Hunger Games series also performed strongly, driven by the highly anticipated movie release last month. Once again, Scholastic benefited from the virtuous circle from page to screen and back to page, which has helped build many of our mega-publishing franchises. Looking ahead, we're excited about our publishing plan for the spring, which includes new titles in Dav Pilkey's Dog Man and Alice Oseman's Heartstopper series, both of which are hugely popular, as well as the new titles from New York Times bestselling adult and young adult author Alan Gratz,. And new graphic novels in our Wings of Fire, Baby-Sitters Club, and Amulet series. The new live action, Goosebumps TV series, co-produced by Scholastic Entertainment with Disney also debuted in quarter two. Based on the classic Scholastic series, which is sold over 400 million copies, Goosebumps was Disney's most-watched season premiere of the year on both Disney Plus and Hulu. Since its launch, the series has reached the top 10 spot in streaming rankings overall. According to the Hollywood reporter, its success makes it close, a rare non-Marvel of Star Wars original series for Disney Plus in Nielsen's rankings. Keeping up this momentum with today's readers and viewers finding comfort in the familiar brands of Childhood, Scholastic Entertainment has a broad slate of new nostalgia projects in development that bring back legacy Scholastic properties in fresh and innovative ways. We are partnering with top-tier platforms, producers, screenwriters, and actors, including co-producing The 39 Clues with Amblin on Netflix, developing Animorphs and Fly Guy as feature films, and working with Elizabeth Banks and Marc Platt Productions to bring The Magic School Bus to the big screen. All of our Entertainment projects include fresh publishing programs tied to our new media moments, as well as the classic and time consumer product programs for the existing and emerging fan bases. Now moving to Education Solutions. Quarter two sales were up 1% relative to last year's record levels. This division also navigated the changing school environment while developing new channels and models to expand kids' access to books and literacy beyond schools. We also continued investing to build new flexible supplemental learning programs that respond to evolving needs in the marketplace. Sales of book collections rose through our partnerships with states and school districts. This growth continued to offset declines in sales of supplemental instructional materials that we've seen over the past few quarters. Districts shift approaches to literacy instruction, often in response to state and local laws and regulations. In some cases, districts are pausing new purchases, leaving teachers using existing materials and pedagogies as they work to retrain teachers and implement new curricula. In the meantime, we continue to work to realign key product lines to the signs of reading, while we invest in new content and products. Looking ahead, we remain positive about the mid and long-term opportunity for Scholastic's Literacy Focus Education business. As we move forward with our plan to build new digital print solutions, building on our current profitable print-based education business as I just discussed. Last week, we announced an expanded investment in our summer learning offering, which has emerged as a significant differentiated opportunity for Scholastic to grow and drive impact. School districts of acute needs to support students, educators, and families with instructural programs in books at home and outside normal school hours year round. Scholastic acquired from LitLife, Inc. rights to and control of LitCamp, a foundational reading skills program for summer and extended learning, which we co-developed and have been successfully selling since 2015. We also acquired all rights and control of MathCamp, a new companion program to LitCamp, which we expect to be in the market for this summer. We're excited about this move, which solidifies Scholastic's position as a leading provider of high-impact solutions for summer learning. After nearly four months in the position, Education Solutions President, Beth Polcari is moving forward with plans to reinvent our classroom magazines business as a comprehensive blended content and data-driven instructional program. She and the Education Solutions team are also looking at opportunities to strengthen other core businesses within the division, while targeting revenue opportunities and particularly focused on the approximately $50 billion in unspent federal ESSER funding which must be obligated by September 2024. Turning to our International segment, revenues declined 4% in local currency as sales in Australia and New Zealand were impacted by continued softness in the overall retail market, but higher Book Fairs and trade sales in U.K., partly offset this. As a reminder, Ken Cleary now leads this division's President of International, building on his deep operating knowledge of Scholastic to help our International subsidiaries better leverage U.S. resources and drive growth. Of course, he is also -- he also continues to serve as our CFO as we move forward with the search process, which is being productive. We look forward to providing further updates in the coming weeks. So Ken will discuss in more detail shortly, largely as a result of external factors, we are revising our fiscal 2024 guidance on account of lower than expected profit growth in quarter two and reduced expectations for the second half of the year. Scholastic continues to build on our unique strengths as the world's largest and most trusted children's publisher and distributor. Last quarter's solid execution reinforces our conviction in our long-term growth outlook, as well as our commitment to continue deploying capital to invest in growth and enhance shareholder returns. And now, I'll ask Ken to provide greater detail on the quarter's results.\nKen Cleary: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. Note that we recorded no one-time items in fiscal 2023 or in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Please refer to our press release tables and SEC filings for a complete discussion of one-time items. As Peter discussed earlier, our second quarter profits improved year-over-year and we remain confident in our long-term growth outlook and shareholder value creation strategy. Results came in below expectations, however, largely due to external factors. Turning to our consolidated financial results. Second quarter revenues decreased 4% to $562.6 million. Operating income in the quarter was $101.3 million, up from $100.1 million in the prior year period. Net income was $76.9 million compared to $75.3 million in the prior year period and adjusted EBITDA increased to $124 million from $122 million a year ago. Earnings per diluted share was $2.45 compared to $2.12 last year as our share buyback efforts over the previous four quarters have driven down our outstanding share count. Now turning to our segment results. In Children's Book Publishing and Distribution, revenues for the second quarter decreased 6% to $392.8 million, primarily driven by lower participation in orders in Book Clubs as the business has repositioned to a smaller more profitable core, as well as lower timing related production revenue from Scholastic Entertainment. Operating margins improved and operating income decreased by only 2% from the prior year period to $110.8 million. Lower spending in clubs on promotions and operations, improved gross margins and consolidated trade, partially offset the impact of lower sales. Book Fairs revenues increased 1% to $242.1 million in the quarter, driven by higher fair count and increased redemptions of incentive program credits, partially offset by lower revenue per fair. As Peter noted, we benefited from modestly higher revenue per fair on same fair basis. Fair count remains on track to reach nearly 90% of pre-pandemic levels this year, up from 85% in fiscal 2023. Book Clubs' revenues of $32.4 million were down versus the prior year period revenues of $57.6 million. As part of the transition of this channel to a smaller more profitable core, we eliminated unprofitable offerings during the back-to-school season. Consolidated trade revenues were $118.3 million in the second quarter compared to prior period revenues of $119.9 million. The segment revenue decrease was driven by lower revenues in Scholastic Entertainment relative to the prior year when the company completed the delivery of episodes of the animated series Eva the Owlet based on Scholastic's Owl Diaries series. Excluding the year-over-year impact of these media revenues, trade increased 3% driven by multiple frontlist bestsellers in the quarter despite continued softness in the retail book-selling market. Education Solutions segment revenues were up 1% to $81 million in the second quarter driven by higher revenues in state and district partnerships, partially offset by sales declines in supplemental instructional materials related to the shift and prevailing approaches to literacy instruction. Segment profit decreased $1.2 million to $5.8 million compared to the prior period, largely reflecting lower gross margins due to product mix. Growth in low-margin customized book collections, driven by districts seeking to comply with state and local content mandates contributed to the shift. International segment revenues of $86.5 million in the second quarter trailed the prior year period revenues of $89.6 million. Excluding the $700,000 year-over-year impact of favorable foreign currency exchange, International revenues were down $3.8 million reflecting lower revenues in Australia and New Zealand and softness in retail book-selling continued to impact trade sales in these countries. Segment operating income increased $1.3 million to $8 million, primarily driven by improved results in Canada, which benefited from the reorganization of Book Clubs in the first quarter. Unallocated overhead costs of $23.3 million decreased from $26.8 million in the prior period benefiting from higher rental income associated with an additional tenant in the retail space of the company's owned headquarters building in New York City. We continue to market floors two through four of our headquarter building for outside tenants. We recognized rental revenue of $2.3 million in the second quarter. As a reminder, this was previously recorded as a benefit in SG&A in the prior year period. On the 26,600 square feet leased as of today, we expect annualized straight-line rental revenue to total approximately $9.9 million in fiscal 2024. Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $109.7 million in the current quarter compared to $81.6 million in the prior period. Lower inventory spend in the quarter, driven by a lower freight and manufacturing costs compared to a year ago benefited working capital. As we noted last quarter, we continued to manage inventory purchases substantially closer to our demand, resulting in sufficient inventory on hand and lower spend. We also continue to expect our cost of product per unit to decline in fiscal 2024 from the prior year with this benefit appearing in the P&L in the second half of this fiscal year. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $88.6 million compared to $62.7 million in the prior year period, reflecting this tighter inventory management. At the end of the second quarter -- at the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents, net of total debt was $143.2 million compared to $218.5 million at the end of fiscal 2023. In addition to our investments in content and capabilities to drive growth, we continue to return capital to shareholders in the second quarter for our regular dividend and open market share repurchases. We repurchased almost 1.4 million shares last quarter for $52.3 million. Together with our regular dividend, we returned over $58 million in the second quarter and $101 million this fiscal year. In the fiscal year 2024 thus far, we have repurchased 2.2 million shares, which net of 391,000 shares issued related to stock compensation represent 6% of the company's shares outstanding. Company shares outstanding are now below 30 million. Today, we announced our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $66.2 million for repurchases, topping up our current share buyback authorization to $100 million. Scholastic remains consistent in our capital allocation priorities and we are committed to pursuing opportunities to leverage our balance sheet and deploy capital by; first, investing in growth opportunities; second, maintaining a strong and efficient balance sheet; and third, returning excess cash to shareholders to enhance their returns. Turning to our outlook. Based on our second quarter results and our current forecast for the second half of the year, we have updated our fiscal 2024 guidance. We now expect adjusted EBITDA of $165 million to $175 million. This excludes the impact of one-time charges related to restructuring and cost savings activities of $7 million to $10 million of which we have incurred $6.3 million so far this year. Full year revenue is expected to be approximately level with or slightly below the prior year. As a reminder, Scholastic typically generates the greatest contribution in the seasonally important second and fourth quarters. We continue to expect solid fourth quarter performance following a seasonally smaller third quarter. We now forecast fiscal 2024 CapEx and prepublication spending of $100 million to $110 million, compared to $88.9 million in fiscal 2023 and full year free cash flow of between $35 million and $45 million. As Peter discussed earlier, in response to this revised outlook, we have taken steps to target additional revenue opportunities and align spending in the second half of the year. Though we have reduced our outlook for the year largely based on external factors that Peter described, our business remains fundamentally strong and remains focused on our long-term growth and our capital allocation priorities including returning capital to shareholders. Thank you for your time today and have a happy holiday season. I'll now hand the call back to Peter for his final remarks.\nPeter Warwick: Thank you, Ken. As you and I've discussed this afternoon, Scholastic performed solidly in the second quarter despite the macro environment, the slowed profit growth below our expectations, and that's caused us to adjust our guidance. I'm confident that Scholastic's unique scale and ability to create high-quality books and content and get it to millions of kids in the U.S. and globally, there's so much potential for growth and impact today. I want to take a moment to thank Scholastic's world-class employees. They've worked tremendously hard this fall to serve our customers, engage our partners, and protect Scholastic's long-term mission and opportunity, and I'd also want to thank our shareholders for their continued support. So let me now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Mathews: Thank you, Peter. We appreciate your time today and continued support. With that, I will turn the call over to the operator.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brendan McCarthy with Sidoti. You may proceed.\nBrendan McCarthy: Hi, good afternoon, Ken and Peter. Thanks for taking my questions today.\nKenCleary: Hi, Brendan.\nPeter Warwick: Pleasure.\nBrendan McCarthy: Hi, so I think we could start off by taking a look at Book Clubs business, I guess, how from a revenue perspective or just in general, how small do you expect the business to get eventually?\nPeter Warwick: Well, I don't -- I don't think we've got an exact number in mind, and actually what we -- what we've always planned for is that there would be a reduction in the revenues in Book Clubs, but that would form a much more stable basis in order to go forward and to increase the profitability. So essentially what we've been doing is a sort of shrink to grow strategy and, you know, the revenues have been a little bit below, perhaps what we might have expected, because of the general environment within schools, but I don't think it's in any way undermine the strategy that we're -- that we're pursuing for a longer term, you know, profitable and stable Book Clubs business.\nBrendan McCarthy: Got it. Understood. And then looking at the Education Solutions segment, you mentioned there has been a shift in spending supplemental instruction spending at the school and district level, can you go into detail about, I mean, what exactly this change looks like, and then also maybe what Scholastic is going to adapt?\nPeter Warwick: Well, the thing -- what's happening within schools and literacy is sort of a movement away from what was termed as a guided reading approach to literacy towards a more phonics-based approach, which is called the signs of reading. And that's a trend that has accelerated over the last two or three years. And what we're doing is clearly adapting our own supplemental materials, so that they are much more in tune with the signs of reading. What's important to say is the independent reading is still incredibly important in the literacy journey and that Scholastic is better positioned there than any other literacy provider.\nBrendan McCarthy: Got it. That's helpful. And then Peter, I know you mentioned the ESSER funding initiative due to sunset I believe in 2025. I guess, did you see any benefit from that spending in the second quarter -- second fiscal quarter?\nPeter Warwick: It's due to -- what's going to happen is that the funding has to be obligated. In other words, doesn't necessarily have to be immediately spend but it has to be committed by no later than September 2024. So we would expect that with a lot of hard asset on our part, that there are still good opportunities for us both in the second part of this financial year, but also in the following financial year as well. Also, we're encouraging all that we can to make sure that those federal - ESSER funds can be used in areas where we have really tremendous products. So particularly in areas like summer reading, for example, so that we can really make sure that schools have got the funding that they need for what is an increasing priority in how they do things, which is why the summer book collections, et cetera, becomes so important to us and we can see that the remaining ESSER funding is one of the sources, whereby we will be able to do and continue to get very strong representation in the purchasing at that time.\nBrendan McCarthy: Got it. And then one last question for me, just with regards to the retail book market, I know you mentioned strong results from the frontlist titles, I'm just curious as to maybe your outlook on the backlist titles and when that market might return to growth?\nPeter Warwick: I don't have a complete roadmap on that, but I think what we -- one of the things that we have been seeing is some pickup in trade sales, main street sales as it were during the last few weeks and we're particularly benefiting from that because of the titles that we've got, that have done so well, the Cat Kid and other titles. I think what's important about backlist is the most successful publishers all have really strong backlist, and is particularly important for us because we can monetize those backlist not just through sales of books on bookshelves. But we through our media activities, we were able to, as I mentioned in the report, we can see other purposes for that intellectual property, and, you know, that is going to be an increasingly important part of what we do, and furthermore, as there has been sort of changes in the sort of screen-based market at the moment, whereby fewer but much more higher value properties are being transformed into media interest streaming and particularly into feature films, then the high quality of our backlist titles and our characters are really important, and as we've discovered in recent discussions with houses in LA and elsewhere, is the tremendous value that screen-based companies see in our backlist. And so having that backlist, I think what we're going to find is an increasing part of the value of that is going to be coming through screen-based opportunities rather than just paper-based opportunities, but it is, as I mentioned in the talk, it's the virtuous circle going from print to screen to merchandising to back to the books.\nBrendan McCarthy: Thank you. That's all from me.\nPeter Warwick: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our Q&A, I will pass the call back to management for any closing remarks.\nPeter Warwick: Thank you very much, Josh, and thank you to all of you who joined us this afternoon, and of course, I wish everyone a very happy holiday season. We look forward to engaging with our investors in coming days and to providing a further update on our progress in March on our quarter three call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. One moment and I will go ahead and introduce our host for today's program, Jeff Mathews, Executive Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nJeffrey Mathews: Hello, and welcome, everyone, to Scholastic's Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. Today on the call, I'm joined by Peter Warwick, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Cleary, our Chief Financial Officer. As usual, we have posted the investor presentation on our IR website, investor.scholastic.com, which you may download now if you've not already done so.

Should you have any questions after today's call, please send them directly to our IR e-mail address, investor_relations@scholastic.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Peter Warwick to begin this afternoon's presentation.\nPeter Warwick: Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. We're happy you're joining us. Scholastic began fiscal 2024 solidly, excited and well-positioned for the year's back-to-school season, which represents another opportunity for Scholastic to work with families, educators and kids to address the critical needs for literacy, reading and stories. We continue to execute on our integrated strategy to drive growth, impact and shareholder value creation over the coming years while we protect margins and sustain the growth that we achieved in fiscal 2023. Last quarter, we continued to invest in strategic growth initiatives, including in go-to-market and blended product development capabilities in Education Solutions as we took further steps to ensure Scholastic is structured for future growth, executing reorganizations in our U.S. and Canadian Book Clubs and announcing key leadership changes. As we expected and previewed on last quarter's call, first quarter's operating loss grew from a year ago, reflecting these ongoing and onetime investments as well as the changing seasonality and timing of education revenues and planned spending ahead of expected growth in school reading events, our recently combined Book Fairs and Clubs division. As a reminder, Scholastic typically records operating losses in the first and third quarters, which coincide with summer and winter school vacations in the Northern Hemisphere. We generate the greatest contribution in the seasonally important second and fourth quarters. Based on quarter one results, we are affirming our fiscal 2024 guidance for revenue growth of 3% to 5% and adjusted EBITDA of $190 million to $200 million, excluding the impact of onetime charges of $7 million to $10 million related to restructuring and cost savings activities. Our confidence in our outlook is also demonstrated by our continued share repurchases. In total, last quarter, we returned over $42 million to our shareholders. This afternoon, I'd like to review our first quarter results and outlook for the rest of the year. Ken will then discuss our financial results in more detail. As I've done on past several calls, I'd like to begin with some comments on the macro environment in which we're operating. First, reading, literacy and learning remain a top focus for families, educators and leaders across our country and something that everyone can agree on even as we're seeing increasing debate across our society including around education policy and book choice. Scholastic continues to be uniquely positioned to respond to these needs. As we've done for more than 100 years, we will continue to focus on serving kids, families and educators. Second, the global retail bookselling market continues to revert year-over-year to pre-pandemic levels as reflected in softness at retail and continued reductions in backlist inventory by book sellers. Based on NPD BookScan data, sales of children's and young adult books in the U.S. declined 8% during our first quarter. Notably, sales of our frontlist titles have been strong as I'll discuss in a moment. As we've said, despite short-term softness in the trade channel, our confidence in overall demand for children's books remains strong, bolstered by the positive same-fair sales we saw last year in Book Fairs. Third, having lapped the steep rise in paper manufacturing, freight and shipping costs that we saw during the pandemic, these costs, especially manufacturing and freight, have begun to fall. As Ken will discuss, this is first benefiting our inventory purchases and free cash flow and will flow through operating margins later this financial year. With that, I'll provide a high-level overview of our first quarter 2024 results. In its seasonally smallest quarter, revenue in the Children's Book segment declined, driven by lower results in our consolidated trade channel. This primarily reflected industry-wide softness in the retail market as I just described. Multiple frontlist bestsellers in this quarter helped partly offset this. Some standout successes included This Winter by Alice Oseman, the best-selling author of the Heartstopper series, The Bad Guys in Let the Games Begin! by Aaron Blabey, and The Official Harry Potter Cookbook. We also had strong sales of the new paperback addition of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes; Suzanne Collins' prequel to The Hunger Games series, ahead of the highly anticipated release of that movie this November. Looking ahead at the fall and spring, we have a strong lineup with new titles in Dav Pilkey's Dog Man and Cat Kid Comic Club series, a new Heartstopper title and Harry Potter, including the interactive MinaLima Edition of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and The Harry Potter Wizarding Almanac. We're also looking forward to the release of the new Goosebumps TV series on Disney+ and Hulu on October 13th. The series, which was developed and coproduced by Scholastic Entertainment, already has a lot of buzz, and Disney is supporting its launch with extensive marketing. We expect it will introduce a whole new generation of readers to this beloved Scholastic series of books, which has sold over 400 million copies to date and is the second best-selling kids series ever, second only to Harry Potter, which has sold over 600 million copies worldwide. This is another success by the Scholastic Entertainment team, whose focus is on building global brands and franchises through the virtuous cycle from page to screen and merchandising and back to the page. By developing Scholastic book titles and intellectual property into compelling viable media projects, we can partner with studios and streaming platforms, both domestically and internationally, to bring our brands to kids and families around the world. Goosebumps comes on the heels of the Peabody and Emmy Award-winning Stillwater series that Scholastic Entertainment coproduced for Apple TV+. Now turning to our unique school-based distribution channels. Scholastic Book Clubs and Fairs generate minimal revenue during the first quarter when schools are out, so the year-over-year trend last quarter is not meaningful. Over the past two years, we've transformed Book Fairs with new customer-centric strategies and operational improvements, which have resulted in higher participation, strong growth in fair count and revenue per fair and higher operating contribution. For back-to-school, we've now begun implementing these customer-centric strategies and operational improvements in Book Clubs. We remain optimistic about continued growth in Book Fairs this year. At the same time, our plan is to strategically transition Book Clubs to a smaller, more profitable core business this year, upon which we can grow going forward. Turning to Education Solutions. Last quarter, we continued investing to build capabilities and to focus the organization around executing our blended learning strategy under new leadership. First quarter sales were lower year-over-year as expected. This reflected two things. First, the shifting seasonality of this business is increasingly driven by the strength of our summer reading programs, which mostly benefit quarter four; and second, the timing of revenues related to our growing state-sponsored programs, which vary year-to-year and are not typically correlated with the school year. We've also seen declines in supplemental instructional sales over the past few quarters related to the shift in prevailing approaches to literacy instruction and for which we are in the process of realigning our key product lines. We now have a clear long-term vision to grow our sales in literacy-focused blended learning programs like our newly launched Ready4Reading, which combine digital and print components. Our opportunity is to execute this long-term growth strategy while protecting and building on the long-term strength of our profitable print content businesses. In addition to continuing to build our long-term capabilities, last quarter, we took actions to optimize the organization and operating model. I'm delighted to have appointed Beth Polcari as our new President of Education Solutions who will continue to advance this vision. Beth is a proven leader, including most recently as President of Scholastic's International division, which she led through the pandemic and oversaw significant operational improvements, especially in Scholastic's growth markets. Before that, she oversaw Scholastic's classroom magazines, digital subscriptions and teaching resources businesses, all of which are key foundations of our Education Solutions business today. Beth also led key digital growth initiatives, including the development of Scholastic Literacy Pro. Beth's leadership, deep knowledge of the education market and our businesses and strong operational focus will be invaluable as Education Solutions enters its next chapter. Turning last to our International segment, which offers a significant long-term opportunity for Scholastic, both strategically as we build global publishing franchises such as we've done with Aaron Blabey's Bad Guys and financially as we grow our scale to further improve operating efficiencies and drive profitable growth. Last quarter, we completed the reorganization of Book Clubs in Canada in line with actions we took in the US business. We're confident this will drive greater operational efficiencies beginning later this year. Softness in the global retail book market, however, continued to depress our major markets, particularly Canada and Australia, which impacted segment results. As we also announced last month, our CFO, Ken Cleary, has taken on responsibility for our International division and will be transitioning to become the full-time President of International as soon as the company appoints a successor for his current role as Chief Financial Officer. We have retained a nationally recognized search firm, which has begun the process of identifying and hiring a growth-oriented CFO to partner with our leadership team to deliver on Scholastic's long-term strategy. This is a great opportunity for Scholastic and for Ken. Ken has over 15 years of service in Scholastic's finance organization. Under his leadership as CFO, Scholastic successfully navigated the pandemic and dramatically increased efficiencies across our operations. He's an ideal successor to Beth as President of International, given his deep knowledge of our domestic and international businesses. And I'm confident that Ken will be a highly effective partner, helping the company's International subsidiaries realize their full potential. So now I will turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Cleary: Thank you, Peter, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, I will refer to our adjusted results for the first quarter, excluding onetime items in fiscal 2024, unless otherwise indicated. Note that we recorded no onetime items in fiscal 2023. Please refer to our press release tables and SEC filings for a complete discussion of onetime items. As Peter discussed earlier, we are excited for this year's back-to-school season. After a strong finish to fiscal 2023, results in our seasonally quiet first quarter were in line with our expectations, including a greater year-over-year operating loss. Over the past three months, we have made progress and execute organizational improvements across all three of our business segments. I am proud of our team's hard work and preparations ahead of the back-to-school season. These actions have positioned us for upcoming fall and spring seasons and we look forward to continuing our progress next quarter and beyond. Turning to our consolidated financial results. First quarter revenues decreased 13% to $228.5 million. Operating loss in the quarter was $92.8 million, down from $58.1 million from the prior year period. Net loss was $69.5 million compared to $45.5 million in the prior year period and adjusted EBITDA was a loss of $70.6 million from $35.6 million a year ago. Loss per diluted share was $2.20 compared to a loss of $1.33 last year. Year-to-date free cash use was $57.8 million, improving from $76.5 million in the prior year period. As discussed, first quarter's operating loss grew from a year ago as expected. After a record generating operating income in the fourth quarter, we anticipated these results as we continue to prioritize strategic investments and growth initiatives and execute on our plan in the school reading events business. Additionally, our Education Solutions business saw lower sales, driven by the timing of revenues related to our growing state-sponsored programs and the shifting seasonality of sales to be more Q4 weighted. As Peter explained, we typically record an operating loss in our first and third quarters due to the highly seasonal nature of our business. We remain positive about the remainder of the year and continue to focus on protecting margins and sustaining growth in fiscal 2024 as we execute on our long-term growth and shareholder value creation strategy. Now turning to our segment results. In Children's Book Publishing and Distribution, revenues for the first quarter decreased 18% to $102.8 million. Segment operating loss increased $11.4 million from the prior year period to $41.5 million. Segment performance in the first quarter trailed the prior year, primarily driven by continued softness in the retail book market and planned spending ahead of expected growth in the school reading events business. Book Fair revenues declined 4% to $27.3 million in the quarter. Revenues and profits are not meaningful as schools are largely not in session in the summer. As noted on our previous earnings call, we expect participation at our in-person Book Fairs to remain strong in the school year and fair count is on track to reach approximately 90% of pre-pandemic levels, up from 85% in fiscal 2023. Book Clubs revenues of $2.6 million were down versus the prior year period revenues of $6.3 million, again, in a very small quarter for this division. Book Clubs underwent a successful reorganization this quarter as they were combined with Fairs, which resulted in onetime severance recorded in overhead. The team has begun to implement new customer-centric strategies as we reduce this business to more profitable foundation to build upon. Overall, we are confident that the school reading events business is well positioned for a successful back-to-school season. Consolidated trade revenues were $72.9 million in the first quarter, trailing prior year period revenues of $90.1 million. While our bestsellers continuing to perform well, trade continues to be impacted by headwinds in the retail book selling market, impacting sales. As Peter discussed, despite the near-term book selling environment, we are excited about the many frontlist titles we are publishing later this year as well as the film and streaming series that are launching. Lower media revenues contributed to the segment revenue decrease as the company completed the delivery of episodes associated with the production of the animated series, Eva the Owlet, in fiscal 2023. Education Solutions segment revenues were down 10% to $66 million in the first quarter, reflecting ongoing trends in the timing and seasonality of customer buying patterns. Operating loss increased $14.4 million to $18.7 million compared to the prior year period, in line with our expectations. This was driven by lower revenues and continued investment in growth opportunities to become a provider of blended learning solutions while remaining focused on protecting our strong literacy offerings, which are a pillar of Scholastic's long-term growth strategy. As Peter described earlier, we completed actions in the first quarter to streamline the Education Solutions organization and adjust the operating model under new leadership as the business executes on our blended learning strategy. This resulted in onetime severance recorded in overhead. International segment revenues of $57.2 million in the first quarter trailed the prior year period revenues of $65 million, a $1.4 million year-over-year impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange and lower revenues of $1.6 million due to the fiscal 2023 Q1 disposition of the direct sales business in Asia contributed to this decline. Excluding these factors, International revenues were down $4.8 million, reflecting lower revenues in major markets, specifically Canada and Australia, as softness in the retail book selling market continued to impact global trade sales. Segment operating loss increased $3.5 million to $7 million, partly reflecting lower revenues and operating pressures in Canada. We expect the reorganization of Book Clubs in Canada, which resulted in onetime severance, to drive greater operating efficiencies in the coming quarters. Unallocated overhead costs of $25.6 million in the first quarter increased from $20.2 million in the prior period, primarily driven by higher employee-related costs. As discussed last quarter, we have now rented all of our first floor retail space at our owned headquarters building in New York. We're currently marketing floors two through four for outside tenants. As we now disclosed in our filings with the SEC, we recognized rental revenue of $2.5 million in the first quarter. As a reminder, this was previously recorded as a benefit in SG&A in the prior year period. On the approximately 26,600 square feet leased as of today, we expect annualized straight-line rental revenue to total approximately $9.9 million in fiscal 2024. Now turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Net cash used by operating activities was $38.1 million compared to $60.3 million in the prior year. Lower inventory purchases in the first quarter compared to a year ago benefited working capital, reflecting lower manufacturing and freight costs as well as lower purchase volumes compared to a year ago when the company replenished inventory levels post pandemic to meet demand and mitigate shipping delays. With a significant improvement in lead times for product, we're able to manage purchases substantially closer to our demand this quarter, resulting in sufficient inventory on hand and lower spend. We expect our cost of product per unit to decline in fiscal 2024 from the prior year, with this benefit appearing in the P&L in the second half of the fiscal year. Free cash use in the first quarter was $57.8 million, improving from $76.5 million in the prior year period, reflecting lower working capital requirements, partly offset by higher CapEx and prepublication spending on new products, growth initiatives and onetime severance costs. At the end of the quarter, cash and cash equivalents, net of total debt, was $119.9 million compared to $218.5 million at the end of fiscal 2023. In addition to increasing growth investments, we continue to return capital to shareholders in the first quarter through our regular quarterly dividend and open market share repurchases. We repurchased 818,000 shares last quarter for $36.2 million. Together with our regular dividend, we returned over $42 million in the first quarter as Peter mentioned. We remain consistent in our capital allocation priorities. We will pursue opportunities to leverage our balance sheet and deploy capital by. First, investing in growth opportunities, second, maintaining a strong and efficient balance sheet and third, returning excess cash to shareholders to enhance their returns. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, we are affirming our fiscal 2024 guidance, as Peter has said. We continue to expect revenue growth of 3% to 5% and are targeting adjusted EBITDA of $190 million to $200 million. This excludes the impact of onetime charges related to restructuring and cost savings activities of $7 million to $10 million, of which we incurred $6.3 million in the first quarter. Based on our current outlook for fiscal 2024 CapEx and prepublication spend of $115 million to $125 million compared to $88.9 million in fiscal 2023, we now expect full year free cash flow of between $55 million and $65 million. Thank you for your time today. I will now hand the call back to Peter for his final remarks.\nPeter Warwick: Thank you, Ken. This past quarter, our team made good progress and built a solid foundation for the remainder of fiscal 2024. After first quarter results that were in line with expectations overall, we are affirming our guidance and looking ahead. We're positive about fiscal 2024 and our multiple long-term opportunities to grow our business and impact, addressing kids' pressing need for reading, learning and stories. Thank you very much. Let me now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Mathews: Thank you, Peter. We appreciate everyone's time today and continuing support. With that, we will open the call for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Brendan McCarthy from Sidoti. Your question please.\nBrendan McCarthy: Yes, thank you for taking my question. I think I wanted to start off at the trade channel sales and just the general, the retail market in general. I'm just wondering if you can kind of talk about what you're seeing in the industry versus your back and frontlist sellers. It looks like, obviously, you mentioned it's kind of reverting to the pre-pandemic normal -- more normalized levels. But I was also wondering if you could provide some insight into when you might think the timing of that might play out.\nPeter Warwick: Yes, it's Peter here. I mean, what we -- there are two things going on at the moment, the first of which is that we're seeing that, hang on, yes, sorry, it’s Peter here. The first thing that we're seeing is that sales are soft going out of the door. And the second thing we're seeing is that the larger inventory purchases, which many book sellers have made during the pandemic mean that restocking has not been happening at the same level as before. This has been coming for the last few months and parts of this year. But we see this, I think, as reverting to more normal sort of activities in the trade channel once the full impact of the pandemic is through. And indeed, we're beginning to see some stronger elements of that post the quarter. Certainly the last weeks of August, which is our third month and now in September are encouraging. I think also with the trade, one's position in the trade market is that a lot depends too on the new publishing that you're doing. And whilst our trade channel was soft during the first quarter, we've got much more in terms of our publishing coming in quarter two. So we would expect quarter two to be a really quite strong trade month. And we don't really have any major concerns about our overall trade forecast for the year as a whole. The other piece to bear in mind is that we can see a more complete picture really of book buying because of our school book fairs in particular. And school book fair buying has been very strong. It was strong through the spring season this year. And in terms of fairs booked for the fall season, that all looks very, very promising and strong as well. So I think one's got to look at this in terms of the totality of the market, we're in a particularly good position to see the totality of the market because of the volume of books which are actually sold through the Book Fairs and Book Clubs, which are not captured by BookScan.\nBrendan McCarthy: Great. Thank you, Peter. I was also wondering as a follow-up, do you think it's fair that -- or I guess do you think it's fair to say, is inflation still having an impact on consumer purchasing patterns as it pertains to trade channel sales?\nPeter Warwick: Well, we haven't particularly seen that. I think probably not is the answer. Again, we can look at things like revenue per fair as an indication of, as it were, kids and parents purchasing. And we saw throughout our last fiscal year and particularly in the spring this year that actually the revenues per fair have been strong and stronger than pre-pandemic. So I think it's not that particularly. I think one's also got to think of this in terms of the, as I said earlier, the totality of what goes on in trade and how parents and children actually buy kids' books. And so I think that we feel reasonably, I have to say, we feel comfortable about how trade publishing and trade forecasting because in many ways, one year is never exactly the same as the prior year because of timing of new titles. And so we're -- that's not a cause of concern for us at all.\nBrendan McCarthy: Got it. That's helpful. One question on the Education Solutions segment. I know you mentioned there was some impact from the timing of state-sponsored programs. I was just wondering if you could go into detail about that specific timing.\nKen Cleary: Hey, Brendan, this is Ken Cleary. How are you? So there was -- we have a very large contract with NWRI in the State of Florida, and part of that called for some billings that we don't have this year. So we continue to grow our student base there, and we continue to reach out to more students because there's an awful lot of more students in Florida that are eligible for this program and we're investing in marketing to reach these students. And therefore, the timing in really the beginning of the year cycle starts, I believe, in July and continues through the next July. So we're -- this quarter really caught the beginning of the year cycle for that. But the idea is that we're looking to increase participation in that program. And to that end, we have incremental opportunities in terms of, it's now open to kindergartners and Pre-K as well. So we're very encouraged by our sponsored programs, particularly in Florida, and that's what you're seeing impacting in the quarter, but also elsewhere, as we continue to try and replicate this model in similar models in other states and through other either state-sponsors or other sponsors in general.\nBrendan McCarthy: Got it. Thank you, Ken. One more quick question for me. I just noticed the over cost or I'm sorry, overhead costs were up year-over-year and that was driven by employee-related costs. Is that just compensation or?\nKen Cleary: Yes. Some of its higher headcount, but a good bulk of it is higher utilization of medical expenses as well. And again because our medical expenses don't particularly time out with our fiscal year, our medical year is the calendar year and our fiscal year is a full year, we're still working to look at those accruals and understand exactly where they are. So right now, this is what we have in there, but we're definitely seeing higher utilization post-pandemic of medical costs, but more to come as the year progresses. We'll certainly have it ironed out by the time we get to the end of the year.\nBrendan McCarthy: Great. Thank you, Ken. Thank you, Peter. That's all from me.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to management for any further remarks.\nPeter Warwick: Thank you, everyone, for joining today's call and for your continued support. I'd like to thank again all of Scholastic's employees for their hard work and preparation ahead of the back-to-school season. We're positive about our plan for fiscal 2024 and about the long-term opportunities for Scholastic as we continue to execute on our strategy this year and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day."
