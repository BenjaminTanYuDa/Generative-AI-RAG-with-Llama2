At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After a brief statement, we will open up the call for questions from analysts. Instructions for queuing up will be provided at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.  I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Chelsea Heffernan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Heffernan, you may begin.\nChelsea Heffernan : Thank you, and good afternoon. Joining me on today's call is John Forsyth, Cirrus Logic’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Venk Nathamuni Chief Financial Officer. Today at approximately 4 p.m. Eastern Time, we announced our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. A Shareholder Letter discussing our financial results, the company's earnings release, and the webcast of this Q&A session are all available at the company's Investor Relations website.  This call will feature questions from the analysts covering our company. Additionally, the results and guidance we discuss on this call will include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, and they're all available on the company's Investor Relations website.  Please note that during this session, we may make projections and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from projections. By providing this information the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any projections or forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new developments or otherwise.  Please refer to the press release in the shareholder letter issued today, which are available on the Cirrus Logic website and the latest Form 10-K as well as other corporate filings registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations.  I will now turn the call over to John. \nJohn Forsyth : Thank you, Chelsea. And thank you everyone for joining our call today. As you've seen in the press release that Chelsea referred to, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, Cirrus Logic delivered record revenue of $619 million and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.89. In a moment, I'm going to hand the call over to Venk, to discuss these results in greater detail, but before we get on to that, I'd like to provide a quick update on the progress we've made in the last quarter regarding the long term growth strategy that I've outlined on prior calls.  As I've said previously, our first strategic priority is leadership in smartphone audio, where we are looking forward to introducing our next generation custom boosted amplifier, and our first 22-nanometer smart codec later this year. These new products will deliver significant performance improvements over prior generations, enabling our customers to build more compelling and power efficient devices for users.  In addition to preparing these products for launch, we're also continuing to win designs with Android customers, our next generation flagship smartphones. During the quarter, a key Android customer began shipping its latest flagship phones featuring Cirrus Logic audio amplifiers. And we also began ramping multiple components for the early 2024 launch of another leading Android flagship device.  Shifting to the second pillar of our strategy, we remain very enthusiastic about the potential to grow content in smartphones with our high performance mixed signal solutions. We view this product line as a substantial opportunity to not only expand our addressable market, but also to grow and diversify our revenue. Our progress in this area has been showcased with our camera controllers. Since the introduction of our first camera controller in calendar year 2020, we have launched three generations of these products, with each delivering enhanced performance functionality and most recently, in the fall of 2023 additional signal processing capability to enable new features.  The overall value of our camera content has increased over time. And we foresee this upward trend continuing in the future as we maintain our close engineering collaboration with our customer to further innovate in this area.  Beyond the camera, we also see significant potential to expand our addressable market with advanced power and battery related technologies. And today, we're actively engaged in a number of R&D programs focused on power and battery performance, which we believe can fuel future growth.  The third element of our strategy is our focus on expanding into new applications and markets beyond smartphones. In this area, we continue to be excited about the opportunities we see in the laptop business. Today, we are delivering content to each of the top five laptop OEMs and actively pursuing many future design opportunities. In January at CES 2024, we saw a leading laptop OEM introduced two flagship laptops featuring several of our amplifiers, multiple haptic drivers and a codec.  Moreover, in addition to our growing momentum in laptop audio, in the December quarter, we were pleased to have been awarded our first laptop power socket further expanding our laptop content opportunity. And yesterday, we were proud to announce our collaboration with Intel and Microsoft on a new PC reference design for Intel's upcoming Lunar Lake processor. This reference design includes our codec, amplifier and power converter products and will enable the creation of richer, more immersive audio experiences for laptops as well as extending battery life and enabling thinner, sleeker laptop designs. Finally, we remain keen to deploy our products and technologies in further markets beyond smartphones and laptops. And in the December quarter, we began ramping production of two custom components for a newly introduced augmented reality computing device. With our commitment to product innovation and world-class execution, we believe we can continue to identify and capitalize on further opportunities in new applications and markets in ways that grow our business.  With this growing and diversifying portfolio of technologies and products, it's important that we actively invest in our supply chain in order both to develop new process technology that will meet the needs of future generations of products and in order to provide our customers with the assurance of supply and geographical diversity that is becoming increasingly important. During the December quarter, we took delivery of and commenced validation of our first silicon from a new foundry partner. This development will serve to qualify both the process technology and core IP needed to enable the creation of next-generation power solutions and provides us with a path to delivering those products from fabrication facilities based in the United States. We believe that this initiative will help make our supply chain more resilient and competitive and help us meet our customers' needs for innovation and quality for many years to come. In summary, we are pleased with our progress in the December quarter as we delivered record financial results and executed on many important areas of product development. With a commitment to great execution and to serving our customers in their mission to deliver the world's most innovative products, we are, today, investing in the product areas that we believe will enable the company to grow and diversify in the coming years. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Venk to provide an overview of our financial results for our fiscal Q3 2024 as well as guidance for the fourth quarter.\nVenk Nathamuni : Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our fiscal third quarter results and then provide guidance for fiscal Q4. Thanks to outstanding execution from the entire Cirrus team, we delivered record revenue as well as record earnings per share for the fiscal third quarter.  Revenue was $619 million, which was significantly above our guidance range, as sales of components shipping and smartphones exceeded our expectations, driven by strength in orders from our largest customer. Shipments stayed strong throughout the quarter, including the first holiday week, and we also benefited from an additional week of revenue in the quarter associated with the 53-week fiscal year. As such, revenue was up 29% quarter-over-quarter and increased 5% year-over-year due to higher smartphone unit volumes. Turning now to gross profit and margins. Non-GAAP gross profit in the quarter was $317.9 million, and non-GAAP gross margin was strong at 51.4%, driven by the higher revenue. On a sequential basis, gross margin was roughly flat, while on a year-over-year basis, gross margin increased by 110 basis points, reflecting lower supply chain costs mainly driven by the absence of wafer premiums and expedite fees as well as favorable inventory reserves. This was partially offset by a less favorable product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $125.6 million, up $11.2 million sequentially. Non-GAAP operating expenses increased by 10% sequentially, but was substantially below the 29% quarter-over-quarter increase in revenue. The sequential increase was mostly due to higher employee-related costs including an extra week of salaries and benefits associated with a 53-week year as well as variable compensation.  As in prior quarters, we will continue to control discretionary expenses. Non-GAAP operating income was $192.2 million in the third quarter or 31.1% of revenue. Turning now to taxes. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates for the December quarter were lower than expected due to recent IRS guidance issued to U.S. taxpayers regarding R&D expense amortization rules in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Consequently, our tax rate for the December quarter reflect the cumulative tax benefit of applying the IRS guidance to decrease R&D capitalization amounts for all periods since the fiscal year '23 effective date of this provision. And lastly, on the P&L. Non-GAAP net income in the third quarter was $160.6 million or a record $2.89 per share as the higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin flowed through to the bottom line in addition to the onetime tax benefit I alluded to earlier. Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong. And we ended the third quarter of fiscal '24 with approximately $587 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our ending cash balance was up $234.5 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to strong cash flow from operations, partially offset by stock repurchases during the quarter.  We continue to have no debt outstanding. Additionally, as noted in prior quarters, we have $300 million undrawn on our revolver credit facility. I'd like to reiterate that our balance sheet remains strong, with a solid cash position and no debt. During the December quarter, we reduced inventory levels. Inventory balance at the end of the third quarter was $256.7 million, down from $328.9 million in Q2 as we drew down inventory to support our largest customer's new product launch. As a result, days of inventory declined 50 days sequentially, and we ended the quarter with approximately 78 days of inventory, down from 128 days in the prior quarter. Looking ahead, in Q4 fiscal '24, we expect inventory dollars to increase slightly from the prior quarter. We continue to actively manage our inventory position to meet customer demand while still fulfilling our purchase commitments. And turning to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $313.7 million in the December quarter, and CapEx was roughly $9.8 million, resulting in non-GAAP free cash flow margin for the quarter of 49%. For the 12-month period ending in the December quarter, non-GAAP free cash flow margin was 14%. On the share buyback front, in Q3, we utilized roughly $57 million to repurchase approximately 780,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $72.93. As of the end of Q3 fiscal '24, we had $365 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We expect to continue to return capital in the form of stock repurchases, which we believe will provide a long-term benefit to shareholders going forward. And now on to the guidance. For Q4 of fiscal '24, we expect revenue in the range of $290 million to $350 million. We expect gross margin to range from 49% to 51%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to decrease sequentially and to be in the range of $114 million to $120 million, primarily due to lower variable compensation and one less week of salaries as we return to a 13-week quarter. Overall, from an operating expense perspective, we will continue to control discretionary spending, but invest strategically in product development to drive long-term growth.  Our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 21% to 23%, which is lower than our prior quarter's guidance of 24% to 26% and reflects the cumulative tax benefit of applying recent IRS guidance at clarified aspects of the capitalized R&D rules. In closing, we had a strong Q3 fiscal '24 as we delivered record revenue and record non-GAAP earnings per share, thanks to the collective efforts and strong execution by the entire Cirrus Logic team. Going forward, we will continue to focus on the best opportunities to enable the company to grow both revenue and profitability over the long term. And finally, while we understand there is intense interest related to our largest customer, in accordance with Cirrus Logic's company policy, we will not discuss any specifics about this business relationship.  With that, let me now turn the call to Chelsea to start the Q&A session.\nChelsea Heffernan: Thanks, Venk. We will now start the Q&A portion of the earnings call. Please limit yourself to a single question and 1 follow-up. Operator, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg : Yes, thank you. And congratulations on the record revenue and especially the cash flows. First question. So John, you said in your shareholder letter that the camera content has increased overtime. You just introduced your third generation, but it's going to be like three generations in three years. So should we assume there's going to be a fourth generation next year that will potentially have some additional content? And obviously, that's above and beyond what's happening on the audio side.\nJohn Forsyth : Thank you, Tore, and thanks for the nice words. I wouldn't assume that as a baseline assumption. What we have seen over time is that the value of the content has grown partly with the introduction of new camera controllers from us, which have more features, but partly also as a consequence of increased attach rate, and then greater proliferation through the SKUs and generations of products. So we see that as being the kind of collection of drivers to the trend of growth and value overtime. That's not to say that we don't have plenty of development work going on in the pipeline around the camera controller. We do have some very exciting stuff, but we're not signaling a time frame for that coming to market yet.\nTore Svanberg : Good, thank you. And as my follow-up, you announced the new foundry. It sounds like maybe that's more for power management, correct me if I'm wrong there. But should we sort of assume that this goes hand-in-hand with some of the R&D programs you have going underway? And how long would it take, I guess, for you and your foundry partner to develop this to be a very high-volume business?\nJohn Forsyth : Right. Great question. The focus there is predominantly around power-related devices. So that might include some power management, power conversion, Obviously, we've had some products out there that we call Power Conversion control and so on, which don't quite fit any of the net boxes in that area of products. But that kind of stuff generally will be extremely well served as we go forward by this foundry partnership. And so yes, that's -- yes, to the first part of your question. In terms of time frame, well, we've just seen the first silicon.  I think we're very excited by it, but that's still quite some way from that being a high-volume kind of process for us. So think of us as being still two to three years out from actually having product and then probably not starting with a huge volume product just so that we can get up the ramp safely together. But these things are -- they take a while to develop. But then as I think our track record has shown, certainly, in other areas where we've invested and worked very, very closely with foundry partners. We then get many, many years. And in fact, in the case of some of our products that a decade or so of deriving a lot of competitive advantage and performance advantage from the work that we've done together on process development.  So it takes a while, but then we’re very excited about where it can take us in the long run.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay : Thank you very much. Good afternoon. John, I wanted to ask about the notebook market. It's been something that's been on the come for Cirrus for a while, and you've mentioned, and congrats on the partnership with Intel and Microsoft, you mentioned being in shipping to the each of the top five laptop OEMs. And I wanted -- it's a fraction of the units of the smartphone market, but it's not that horribly different from the units shifting into the smartphone market by your largest customer. So I'm just trying to get my head around how you're thinking about the notebook opportunity overtime in terms of realistically addressable market in the next three to five years?  Is this something that you could ship many of the same components into -- and from a unit perspective and an ASP perspective collectively, it's relatively similar opportunity to what your company is serving in the smartphone space, given you ship primarily to one big customer there? I'm just trying to get -- calibrate my expectations over a three to five-year period of how you're thinking about that margin. Thanks.\nJohn Forsyth : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So just to unpack that a little. We are in the early innings. And I've given a bit of color previously on what I expected our potential revenue ramp maybe over the next year or two. So fiscal '24 we're really just is de minimis. But as we get into fiscal '25. We think that will be kind of low tens of millions and then growing beyond that. So the work that you're seeing us talk about today when we talk about design-ins and the Lunar Lake reference platform, that's really mostly feeding into products that we'll see in calendar '25. So that should be an accelerant to revenue there.  I would like to put a ceiling on the SAM that we see because that's, as we uncover more opportunities, I think that we are feeling more optimistic about that over time. There are certain variables there, which, honestly, remains to be seen. Like, for example, how many amplifiers are attached in the various different product tiers? So we see today designs ranging from between two boosted amplifiers to six boosted amplifiers. And that may be alongside a codec.  And in the case of the flagship products that we talked about in the opening remarks that were launched in January, we also saw haptics drivers along there as well. So I think that's the color on the revenue rep that we see right now.  I think the biggest and most important thing here is really the three milestones that we've passed. So First of all, we're seeing the launch of the audio products. So those boosted amplifiers and the codec that were in that product -- in those products that I mentioned. Those are laptop-specific brand new audio products from us. Then -- and the audio proposition, I think, is extremely strong. So what we've seen in benchmarking that against the competition is that our products enable you to double the output loudness, 3x the low frequency response while consuming 50% less board space, 50% less power and something like a third of the overall component count. So that's a very compelling proposition. It's going to take time to see people adopt all of that or parts of it and for that to proliferate down through the tiers. But I think the opportunity is very, very significant. And then -- so the first milestone was really getting those audio products into the market and launched. The second is winning our first power products. So again, that's something where we can see an attach rate. Where that gets designed in, the attach rate can be two or three products, in some cases, conceivably more than that. But that, again -- and those products, the power conversion products are fairly significant value by our standards, so kind of buck and change.  So we don't know where the -- exactly like how far down through the tiers that can go yet. But again, it's -- it represents a great opportunity and getting the first design in of Power Products is a very significant milestone for us. And then the third milestone that we're talking about here today really is that reference design launch. And that as we know, can be a real catalyst for helping design activity as we go forward.\nVenk Nathamuni : Yeah. And Matt, this is Venk. Just to add to what John said, in terms of just the total size of the opportunity that we're looking at as well as the pricing question that you asked. So clearly, we're starting out with addressing the high end of the laptop space. And as John just alluded to, there's a range of possibilities there in terms of selling the codec and the amplifiers and then power eventually. And then just from a pricing standpoint, I'd say we expect this to be in line or above our corporate average gross margins. So that's our model long term, and that's what we're working towards achieving.\nMatt Ramsay : Got it. Thank you both for all the detail there. Don't worry, we won't get over our skis of modeling. I'm just trying to sort of calibrate my expectations over the longer term. As my follow-up question, it's a year where, as you sort of, I guess, reemphasize that you're going to be shipping a new codec on 22-nanometer and new boosted amplifiers, both later this year.  And I guess I just wanted to ask, is there going to be anything -- I mean, units aside, which obviously you won't want to predict, but anything different in the revenue ramp cadence or timing given you have new products shipping in on both the codec and the amplifier side? Just all else equal on units, would you expect a different shape to the year because both of those products would be new into SKUs? Thanks.\nVenk Nathamuni : Yeah, Matt, I'll address that. No, I think you correctly identified the increased content that we had alluded to in prior quarters in terms of what we expect in our fiscal '25. And I think in terms of just the timing of those ramps, the typical pattern with our customers being to ramp those products in right around the middle of the year, plus or minus. So we don't see anything that's fundamentally changed in terms of the timing of those ramps. And in terms of the overall content, we did talk about those four components that will have a newer generation compared to the prior phone model. So we're pretty excited about the fact that we're reducing the next generation of the codec and three instant stations for the next generation of the amplifier. And that’s what we expect will drive our performance in fiscal ‘25.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Thomas O'Malley with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nThomas O'Malley : Hey, good evening, guys. And thanks for taking the question. John, in the script, you talked about two custom components for an augmented reality product. Could you talk about what sort of products you would be shipping into that genre? And then potentially how you see that portfolio scaling? You're seeing small unit volumes to start there over the past couple of years, but that could obviously be a lot larger in the coming years. I just want to understand where you guys best address that market.\nJohn Forsyth : Yeah. Thanks, Tom. I think we're excited about that category without really having anything significant in our model for it for now, as you alluded to. If you look back over the last three or four years, I think, perhaps, even slightly longer than that since the category has been emerging VR and AR. We've got a very good track record of getting sockets in there, typically with off-the-shelf silicon and typically focused on audio.  In this case, the components that I was alluding to in my opening remarks are actually in the HPMS category. I'm not going to be more specific about what they're doing from that, but again, that's a positive for us, I would say, as it demonstrates that we have both HPMS and audio relevant capabilities for that category of device.  And I think that makes a lot of sense because we know that physical size, physical weight and power efficiency are going to be incredibly important when it comes to anything that you have to wear on your head for extended periods. So we're excited long term, and we'll kind of continue to monitor that category as, hopefully, it accelerates.\nThomas O'Malley : Super helpful. And then switching to an entirely different topic. Just back on the other updates in the new foundry. I just wanted to be clear. So you're talking geographical diversity, you're talking to more power products there. Is this a foundry that's based in the U.S. or just a foundry that has a facility in the U.S.? Just trying to understand better the landscape. Thank you.\nJohn Forsyth : Yes. Yeah. The foundry facilities are in the U.S. I think I'll probably leave it there. We're still in fairly early innings with them in the partnership. But yeah, as you correctly highlighted, we have seen geographical diversity become an increasingly important concern, along with the other things that we look for within our supply chain and foundry partnerships, namely technology leadership assurance of supply and a competitive playing field. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Mine's around Intel reference designs. So first of all, I just want to make sure you are not in the Meteor Lake reference design. I would assume that you're not in the Arrow Lake. And so the first one would be Lunar Lake. I guess, getting into a reference design, how does that change the profile of wins for this market? And I guess, tied to this as well, this power product. Can you tell us a little bit more about this as a power conversion? Is it DC-DC? What's its actual function? Thank you.\nJohn Forsyth : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. I would love to be able to tell you with confidence what it's going to do for the design momentum I think -- but we -- the truth is we don't know yet. I think it can only be a good thing. I think we're certainly -- we've been very excited in that collaboration with Intel and Microsoft about the vision for laptop devices, which are substantially more immersive when it comes to the audio and visual experience and thinner, lighter, more power efficient. So we're very, very proud to be a part of that.  How that translates in terms of adoption and what it means for designing of our components? It's probably too early for us to say. I would say that, typically, I think you can expect pretty good design momentum on the back of being on the reference design, as you would expect. And also, we're excited that it looks like that, that laptop market may see a bit of a kick from the interest in the AI-centric devices and use cases as well. So hopefully, we're getting to board a train that's accelerating there. The Power Conversion product itself, yeah, that's leveraging Switch cap power conversion technology, which originated with the Lion acquisition that we did. So it's replacing a kind of a classic multiphase power controller, power conversion architecture. So it reduces the component count as well as really significantly increases the efficiency of the DC-to-DC conversion. So your heat losses are much lower, you're able to effectively get more done using less power drawn from the battery. So that's really going to be focused primarily on driving fanless and single fan designs, so thinner, quieter, more efficient products.\nChristopher Rolland : It's great. Nice to see that Lion acquisition come around. My second question is around gross margin. And in particular, as we think about laptop products mixing in, but also this new content coming in the fall. Is there anything that we should consider regarding gross margin between here and there?\nVenk Nathamuni : Yeah, Chris, thanks for the question. This is Venk. So from a gross margin perspective, as I alluded to earlier, as it relates to the PC business, we do expect that to be in line or slightly accretive to our gross margins long term. As you know, our model has been fairly steady between 49% and 51%. And in some quarters, we come in close to the high end, some quarters right in the middle. And I think that's driven by the fact that we want to optimize between revenue growth and profitability such that we still are able to grow the top-line at a fairly decent clip and maintain good profitability. Now overtime, our objective, obviously, is to improve the profitability across the board, and that's driven by the fact that we want to improve the supply chain infrastructure and just boost efficiencies in general. But I think for the next, at least a year or so, you can model it between the 49% to 51% range, and that's inclusive of the PC business. As I said, with the PC business, we expect to be in line or above the corporate average.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah : Hey, yeah. Thanks guys, for taking the questions. Good afternoon. And congrats on the really solid execution. I guess two quick ones, if I could. Maybe, John, just dovetailing off of your remark about GenAI a moment ago, it does seem like there's an increasing commitment from sort of edge device makers, the phone makers, the PC makers to lean in to GenAI sort of config. And so I guess the question is, if that were to happen at some critical mass, the benefit to you, would it be a volume feature? Is there a mix component? I guess, any context you can share there on how it would benefit you guys. And then I have a quick follow-up as well.\nJohn Forsyth : Yeah. Thanks for the question, Ananda. I think, I mean, there's certainly a growing tendency for people to jump on the AI -- edge AI bandwagon from a marketing perspective. I think there's probably some substance there and that, in some cases, there may be less.  In our case, when we think about AI at the edge, I really think it comes down to -- the potential there really comes down to three things. One is that to the extent that it excites and inspires users, and I think end users do want a number of the features, you can see that with the adoption of AI services, then that's exciting from a unit's point of view. And clearly, when I talk about the laptop market, seeing that kind of coming over the horizon as a catalyst for unit sales, that's very exciting. Secondly, I think just that AI and GenAI has the potential to open up a lot more -- a variety of ways in which you interact with the device. So to the extent that people are interacting with the device more via audio and speech interfaces, which are obviously enabled by AI, I think that's very good for us, and we can see things that we could potentially do there in the audio domain that could be very beneficial. And then finally, I think on the power front, that's the third area where I think we stand to benefit because AI is clearly very power hungry. The result is everybody wants to do more with less, and that's squarely what our power conversion products are aimed at and our overall approach to power efficiency and everything that we do.\nAnanda Baruah : That's great context. I appreciate it. That's super helpful. And I guess, a quick follow-up is just really a clarification. When you were speaking earlier about PC SAM, you said something around like sort of putting a ceiling on to SAM. Did you say you would or wouldn't put a ceiling on that SAM as you guys think about it?\nJohn Forsyth : I think it's premature to put a ceiling on it right now. As I indicated, there are -- we've got a very good array of products. So we've got these kind of new-to-Cirrus laptop-specific products across audio and power. We've got an amazing portfolio of haptics products. And one of the things that we don't yet have a feeling for, and I think this is because the market is going to discover it, is what the right attach rates for those various products are. So in some cases, it will be two boosted amplifiers. In some cases, maybe none, but driven by a codec. And in some cases, it might be six boosted amplifiers.  Similarly, we saw multiple haptics drivers to drive very large track bad areas and so on. So I think we’re still in the discovery phase there, and the opportunities are very exciting.\nOperator: This will be our final question from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel.\nTore Svanberg : Yes. I just had a few housekeeping ones for you, Venk. So this is your strongest cash balance ever, rates are high. So -- how should we think about the other income line going forward? And now that you have all this cash, should we assume continuous buybacks? Or are you also looking at some potential M&A?\nVenk Nathamuni : Yeah, Tore, thanks for these questions. And yes, as you pointed out, our cash balance is really strong at $587 million. I think the way to think about the interest that we generated, obviously, we've benefited especially in the last three or four quarters with the higher interest rates. And the way we have structured our portfolio, we do expect that to continue for some time to come.  And clearly, from an M&A perspective, it certainly gives us the optionality. Just for everybody's benefit, I do want to highlight the fact that in terms of our strategy, the first use of cash is obviously to continue to grow the business. And we have lots of irons in the fire in terms of the projects that we're working on, the technologies that we're working on as such. And we want to continue to invest in R&D going forward, as we have in the past. And then obviously, we've been doing buybacks, and we'll be regular buyers. The quantum of those buybacks will depend on market conditions and such.  And then M&A is also an option. And in this environment, we do feel that the M&A environment is getting somewhat better than it was the last couple of years. Obviously, too early to call what happens with regulation and such, but we feel there’s enough in the pipeline for us to be able to consider M&A. And at the right time, we’ll share that with you in more detail.\nOperator: With that, we will end the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to John for his final remarks.\nJohn Forsyth : Thank you, operator. In summary, Cirrus Logic delivered record revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter and continued to execute on important initiatives across each of the three key areas of our strategy. We're excited about the opportunities in front of us, and we thank you for your continued interest in our progress. In addition, I'd also like to extend my appreciation to the entire Cirrus Logic team and to our supply chain partners and customers around the world. It's thanks to their commitment, support and partnership that we've been able to deliver these results. Before we close, I'd also like to note that we will be participating in the Susquehanna Virtual Technology Conference on February 29, the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference on March 7 in San Francisco, and the Loop Capital Conference in New York City on March 12. Please check our Investor website for all the details.  Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today.\nOperator: And that does conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Chelsea Heffernan, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Heffernan, you may begin.\nChelsea Heffernan: Thank you, and good afternoon. Joining me on today's call is John Forsyth, Cirrus Logic's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Venk Nathamuni, Chief Financial Officer. Today, at approximately 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time we announced our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal year '24.

This call will feature questions from the analysts covering our company. Additionally, the results and guidance we will discuss on this call will include non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in our earnings release, and are all available on the company's Investor Relations website. Please note that during this session, we may make projections and other forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from projections. By providing this information, the company expressly disclaims any obligation to update or revise any projections or forward-looking statements whether as a result of new developments or otherwise. Please refer to the press release and the shareholder letter issued today, which are available on the Cirrus Logic website, and the latest Form 10-K as well as other corporate filings registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For additional discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.\nJohn Forsyth: Thank you, Chelsea, and thank you, everyone, for joining our call today. As you've seen in the press release that Chelsea referred to, in the second quarter of fiscal '24, Cirrus Logic delivered revenue of $481.1 million, near the top end of our guidance for the quarter. In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Venk to discuss those results in greater detail. But before we get on to that, I'd like to provide some color on the progress that we made during the last quarter regarding the strategy that I have outlined on prior calls. Our first strategic priority is leadership in smartphone audio. And this quarter, we received the first silicon of our next-generation custom boosted amplifier and sampled it to our customer. Like our customer, we're excited about the performance, the efficiency and the system cost improvements that it will deliver. Alongside that product, we remain on track with our first 22-nanometer smart codec which represents a significant step forward for audio sensing and other key signal processing applications. Both of these products, the amplifier and the codec are on schedule to be introduced next year.  In the general market side of our smartphone audio business, this quarter, we had multiple customers introduced new flagship devices featuring our audio components and we anticipate more devices using our products to be introduced in the first half of the coming calendar year. Turning now to the second pillar of our strategy. Our goal is to continue to broaden our high-performance mixed-signal content in smartphones. Progress in Q2 on this front included ramping shipments of our latest camera controller ahead of a customer's product launch. Once again, in that product launch, we saw the cameras stand out as a key differentiating feature and we are proud that our products help enable our customer to deliver outstanding innovations in this area. We continue to maintain an exceptionally close engineering relationship with our customer in the camera space, and anticipate partnering on further exciting products in the future. Beyond the camera, we have also been investing in new intellectual property that aims to enhance overall battery monitoring, health and performance expanding the portfolio of technologies that began with the power conversion and control device that we introduced in fiscal '22. We continue to be excited about the long-term potential these areas represent for further growth and diversification of our revenue.  The third element of our strategy is our focus on expanding into new applications and markets beyond smartphones. I've talked principally about the laptop space here, given that it is the market where we see our efforts coming to fruition soonest. While we are still in the early innings of our strategic plan for this market, today, we are shipping content in each of the top 5 laptop OEMs, and we are actively engaged with those same OEMs on design win opportunities for next-generation laptop models. There are several favorable trends driving the adoption of our products in this space. First, the post-pandemic desire for high-quality audio, which has historically not been a focus area for most laptop OEMs. Second, the desire for thinner and lighter devices. That desire creates a need for a better audio amplification for haptic rather than mechanical track beds, and for fanless designs where the thermal constraints bring demand for ever greater efficiency and power conversion. Finally, there is the architectural evolution towards SoundWire that we've spoken about previously, which creates an opportunity for OEMs to rethink their audio architectures and their partners. Today, we have excellent product sampling to customers. We have participation in the SoundWire-compatible reference design from Intel and we are seeing great customer interest. While it will take some time for that momentum to flow through to meaningful revenue, we continue to be excited about these opportunities. As an example of what can be possible at the higher end of this market. During the quarter, we began initial shipments for a high-end laptop model that features 7 pieces of Cirrus Logic silicon, including several amplifiers, multiple haptic drivers and a codec, resulting in multiple dollars of content. We continue to believe this is a market where Cirrus Logic has an opportunity to increase both content per device and market share over time. Beyond the laptop market, we are also investing in new products for our general market business, which services a large number of customers across the professional audio, automotive, industrial and imaging end markets. These components offer sustained differentiation with improved performance, lower power consumption and new feature enhancements, and we believe they can be important contributors to our profitability in the years to come. In summary, we believe the company is well positioned for the future with new products in the pipeline for the coming year, momentum building in our market diversification efforts and significant opportunities to expand our high-performance mixed signal content. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Venk to provide an overview of our financial results for our fiscal Q2 '24 as well as guidance for the third quarter.\nVenkatesh Nathamuni: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our fiscal second quarter results. Fiscal second quarter revenue was $481.1 million, which is near the top end of our guidance range due to higher-than-expected demand for products shipping into smartphones. Revenue was up 52% quarter-over-quarter, driven primarily by higher volumes associated with new smartphone launches. On a year-over-year basis, revenue decreased 11%, which reflects a reduction in components shipping into smartphones as well as continued weakness in sales of general market products. Turning to gross margin. Non-GAAP gross profit in the quarter was $247 million and non-GAAP gross margin was 51.3%, which is above the high end of the guidance range we had provided. On a sequential basis, gross margin increased 90 basis points, reflecting lower supply chain costs, largely due to a reduction in freight costs. On a year-over-year basis, gross margin increased by 110 basis points due to lower supply chain costs and inventory reserves, partially offset by a less favorable product mix. During the quarter, we completed the disposition of wafers associated with a new high-performance mixed-signal product that was previously expected to ship this year. We work in close collaboration with our key customer and supply chain partner in resolving this issue and as anticipated, the disposition did not have a material financial impact. Turning to operating expenses. Non-GAAP OpEx in the quarter was $114.4 million, roughly flat sequentially and close to the low end of the guidance range mostly due to product development timing as well as lower discretionary spending. We will continue to control discretionary expenses, especially given the current environment. Non-GAAP operating income was $132.5 million in the second quarter or 27.5% of revenue.  And lastly, on the P&L, non-GAAP net income in the second quarter was $101.6 million or $1.80 per share as the higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin as well as the lower than expected operating expense flowed through to the bottom line. Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong and we ended the second quarter of fiscal '24 with approximately $352.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our ending cash balance was down $73.6 million from the prior quarter as we built inventory to support seasonal product launches and used cash to repurchase stock during the quarter. We continue to have no debt outstanding. And additionally, as noted in prior quarters, we have $300 million undrawn on our revolver credit facility. I'd like to reiterate that our balance sheet remains strong with a solid cash position and no debt.  Turning now to inventory. As we indicated in prior quarters, we've been building inventory to support seasonal product launches as well as fulfill our wafer purchase commitments for our long-term capacity agreement with GlobalFoundries. As a result, inventory was $328.9 million, up from $301 million in Q1 '24. However, days of inventory declined 47 days sequentially and we ended the quarter with approximately 128 days of inventory, down from 175 days in the prior quarter.  Looking ahead, in Q3 fiscal '24, we expect both inventory dollars and days of inventory to decline from the September quarter as we draw down the inventory to support the ongoing seasonal product ramps. While we expect inventory levels to remain elevated through this fiscal year as we balance anticipated product demand and wafer purchase commitments, we expect Q2 fiscal '24 to have been the high point of inventory for the current fiscal year. We'll continue to actively manage our inventory position to meet customer demand while fulfilling our purchase obligations. Turning now to cash flow. Cash used in operations was $22.7 million in the September quarter, and CapEx was roughly $8.5 million, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of minus 6%. For the 12-month period ending in the September quarter, free cash flow margin was roughly 7%. On the share buyback front, in Q2, we utilized $40.6 million to repurchase approximately 510,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $79.45. As of the end of Q2 fiscal '24, we had $422 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Subsequent to Q2 fiscal '24, we utilized $24.4 million to repurchase roughly 350,000 shares at an average price of $69.40 under a rule 10b5-1 share repurchase plan. We expect to continue to return capital in the form of stock repurchases, which we believe will provide a long-term benefit to shareholders going forward.  And now on to the guidance. For Q3 of fiscal '24, we expect revenue in the range of $510 million to $570 million, and we expect gross margin to range from 49% to 51%. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be up sequentially in the range of $120 million to $126 million, primarily due to an additional week of salaries as well as higher variable compensation. As a reminder, fiscal year 2024 is a 53-week fiscal year, and our fiscal third quarter will span 14 weeks instead of the typical 13 weeks. Overall, from an operating expense perspective, we'll continue to control discretionary spending but invest strategically in product development to drive our long-term growth. On the tax front, as we previously discussed, our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate will continue to be unfavorably impacted by capitalized R&D expense and as expected, our foreign tax credits will be lower this year. Our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 26% consistent with our prior quarter's guidance. We continue to anticipate that the impact of capitalized R&D will become less unfavorable over time as additional years of R&D expenses are amortized for tax purposes. In closing, we had a strong Q2 fiscal '24 as we executed well to deliver these results. Going forward, we will continue to focus on the best opportunities to enable the company to grow both revenue and profitability over the long term. And finally, while we understand there is intense interest related to our largest customer, in accordance with Cirrus Logic company policy, we'll not discuss specifics about our business relationship. With that, let me now turn the call to Chelsea to start the Q&A session.\nChelsea Heffernan: Thanks, Venk. We will now start the Q&A portion of the earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready to take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsay Matthew. Ramsay, your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. John, there's -- for the first time in a long more time from an architecture and share perspective, there's a lot going on in the notebook market with the emergence of what Apple has done with the M2 and now M3 and obviously what Microsoft is going to do with CoPilot and sort of shaking up the ecosystem a bit. And you guys have been sort of hinting at opportunities in that space.  So what I'm interested in is to sort of compare and contrast that to what you've seen the Windows market in laptops versus the Android market and smartphones for your company. You obviously have your largest customer and a really, really strong relationship there, but do you have like legit opportunities in audio and other areas and sort of the Windows part of the notebook market? And is it dependent on ARM folks gaining share? Or do you feel like your opportunities with Intel platforms are equally strong? Thanks.\nJohn Forsyth: Thank you, Matt. I agree with your observations. I think there are a number of dynamics that make this market, the laptop market really interesting again and specifically interesting for us in a way that it hasn't been in quite a long time. And there are multiple drivers for us that I think will help us gain customer adoption. To answer your question specifically, we have great relationships with customers across the Windows side of the laptop market. And our relationship with Intel and our presence in the Intel reference design that I referred to earlier, is really helping to drive customer engagement around the new products that we have. So we feel we're in a very good position with regards to our engagement with the key market leaders in Windows laptops. Today, we're shipping to, as I mentioned, the top 5 OEMs overall in the laptop market. And we're engaged with each 1 of those OEMs around future designs. So we're very excited about that. And those conversations tend to be right now more focused on audio, but also including haptics and, to some extent, power products, which are coming a little behind the audio and haptic products for us. But lots of great opportunity there. And it's in no way limited to ARM. In fact, I think ARM is potentially a tailwind for us given the experience we have integrating into ARM-based systems in the smartphone space and the degree to which notebooks start architecturally, looking more and more like smartphones, especially with the advent of ARM-based SoCs, but that's not a necessity. I would just say it creates additional opportunity over time.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you for that perspective, John. As my follow-up question, I wanted to ask, I think it was good to hear your comments on sort of the resolution of the content and the product that didn't ship this year as you guys thought. I wanted to ask a bit about the technology and the IP that you developed for some of these haptic opportunities and its applicability into the Android market. I mean when you guys made the big push and then you have Wolfson acquisition and tried to push into audio in Android with fits and starts and you had to kind of \"break the bundle with Qualcomm and MediaTek in those markets and sometimes it was successful, sometimes not. But if you look at the haptics arena, you have technology, you have IP and I wonder if the environment for the Android smartphone market around haptics, if there's an opportunity there -- and are the SoC providers, do they have strong solutions? Or is this a new TAM that you could go into in Android? Thanks.\nJohn Forsyth: Thank you, Matt. In haptics, we are shipping haptics today into flagship Android phones. The story of haptic adoption in Android has been somewhat different from the iOS world and that not every OEM values it to the same extent. And to begin with, the platform support was somewhat limited. We've seen in key flagship designs and appreciation for high-quality haptics and that's tended to win our sockets. But I think there's probably a bit of a long-term headwind to the SAM for us there, given that it comes at a higher cost and OEMs are perhaps comfortable putting high-quality haptics into flagship devices, but less so as they go down the tiers. I would say that the opportunity for us to continue serving flagship phones there with haptics continues, and we'll certainly aim to do that.\nOperator: Question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland. Christopher, your line is now open.\nChristopher Rolland : Guys, thanks for the question. I guess, first of all, can you talk about your inventory balance once levels are done with this customer ramp. Is that where you're going to want them to be? And does the wafer supply commitments come into play? Or is that behind us at this point as well?\nVenkatesh Nathamuni: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, as I had indicated in my prepared remarks, the inventory that we have been building the last couple of quarters was just to come to balance with the both the supply that we had to fulfill in terms of our commitments to our partner. But in addition, also the ramp of the new products that we alluded to. Now -- as you may recall, prior to these last 2, 3 quarters, we were in a pretty constrained position from the standpoint of inventory and living a pretty much hand-to-mouth existence. So we wanted to build inventory in anticipation of these product ramps. And as I mentioned on the call earlier, we are expecting that the current fiscal quarter, which is Q3, we'll see a meaningful reduction in inventory from what it was last quarter, and we expect Q2 to be at the high point. Now obviously, looking ahead, we still have some supply requirements that we have to meet in terms of the purchase commitments to our partner, but we also see reasonable demand with the next set of products and such. So -- it will be something that we will carefully monitor. As you've seen, we have come down the inventory path pretty substantially in the last few quarters, and we expect that to be substantially better going forward. But we'll just guide for it one quarter at a time. As it relates to this current quarter, we do expect inventory to be down from the prior quarter. And just to give you some perspective, last fiscal year, we were at about 4.0 turns in inventory, and that's our ultimate goal in terms of where we want to be from an inventory turns perspective.\nChristopher Rolland: Excellent. Thank you, Venk. And maybe following up just talking about the Android opportunity over the next year. Where you think you could capture some kind of needle-moving revenue? It sounded like in the latter, audio, you have some -- I would assume that the ramps coming in the first half, but maybe you can talk to that. Do you think anyone would ever copy your lead customer's telephoto camera architecture for opportunities there? How are haptics ramping? I think you said you had some battery products efficiency products that you're trying to ramp as well? Where are all the opportunities, particularly needle-moving opportunities for Android?\nJohn Forsyth: So specifically around Android. I'd say the market for us really splits into two buckets. There's the China-based OEMs and then there's Korean and North American-based OEMs. And -- if you look at the China-based OEMs, we still have a good business there. We very much value our business with Xiaomi, Vivo and Meizu. But we think that, that environment long term has some headwinds for us. It's become a more difficult environment to do business. So it's not a major area of investment.  If we then look at the other bucket, the other side of the Harrison Android, we've got great relationships with those OEMs. We continue to invest in those and to support future designs. I think our business with Samsung was up -- was bigger this year or has been bigger so far than last year. We feel very good about that, and we're excited about supporting them further in the future. But the Android opportunity as a whole is something that I think for us is not as large when we look further out, as the potential of the laptop opportunity. So we can see, as we look a few years out, we can see a scenario where the laptop opportunity in our laptop business exceeds that of our Android business. And that's one where we have, I think, much more greenfield space for expanding content and gaining market share right now. So that's the greater area of our focus when it comes to customer engagement and new product development.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg. Tore, your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you. And congrats on the results, especially getting through this wafer purchase commitment in light of the spread product that was great execution on your side. I had a question about the 22-nanometer products John, you mentioned the word introducing them next year. So does that mean that they will be sampling in calendar '24, and then we'll see potential revenues the year after?\nJohn Forsyth: They are sampling today. Thank you for opening the door to that clarification. Sorry, they're sampling today. The 22-nanometer smart codec in particular, is the product that we're talking about. That's in our customers' hands. It's performing beautifully. It's a marvelous product, and we're very happy with it, which means that we are working towards a market introduction in the back half of next calendar year.\nTore Svanberg: Very good. And as far as the timing and opportunity in laptop, I understand you're in the top 5 today. But as far as this sort of bigger content ramp. Is that something that could happen already next year? Or is that more a calendar '25 or '26 story?\nJohn Forsyth: Yes, that's a great question. Obviously, I've referred to the fact that we have a significant number of designs in development now. And we need that, but it's also important to have the right being the right products, have the right designs in development and enough of them to start moving the needle on revenue given where our overall revenue is today. So I guess I'll try to frame that for you in broad terms so you can get a sense of what we anticipate could happen here. This year, as I mentioned, we've got a number of designs coming to market within the remainder of fiscal '24, including the poster child device that I referred to in my prepared remarks, which we're very proud about. But by definition, anything shipping in the second half of the fiscal year, and that really means in practice in the laptop space, most likely in the early part of next calendar year isn't going to contribute much during the current fiscal year. So think of the contribution of laptops in our fiscal '24 as being pretty minimal. However, those -- there are designs coming to market now, which will start to contribute to revenue as we move into fiscal '25. So we anticipate seeing a moderate step-up in fiscal '25 as more of those current design wins not going into production, putting us likely in the range of the low tens of millions of revenue in fiscal '25. A lot of what's happening today around the reference platforms that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, will lead to customer product that's launching early calendar '25. So we would anticipate that, that would likely lead to steeper growth and more meaningful revenue than in fiscal '26 and beyond. And as I mentioned, previously, I know that we don't break it out as such, but to give you a sense of how we think about the opportunity. If Android stayed flat, then somewhere beyond that, we are -- we see the potential for our laptop revenues to overtake the Android business.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis. Blayne, your line is now open.\nBlayne Curtis : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you, you've been mentioning several quarters in a row diversification efforts in HPMS. I don't read too much in the language, but I guess the language is a little different. You said there's some customer interest in power and battery. Can you just talk about the diversification efforts and maybe any kind of rough timing as to when we should think about maybe that impacting the model?\nJohn Forsyth: Yes, we certainly have customer interest, Blayne, and principally, that's around the power space. So really stuff that sits around the battery is an area that we believe we have significantly differentiated technology. We have that IP in silicon for the most part at this point. So we've been able to demonstrate IP to customers there, and we're excited about tha. Translating that into specific program design awards and design wins and so on. I'm going to limit what I say on this call, but that would be a little further out. That's obviously beyond the audio products that we've got coming next year. It's likely still some time before we see that come to fruition, but we believe there are meaningful opportunities. So we're certainly investing in securing those.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks. And then maybe a question for Venk. I wanted to ask on seasonality for March. Obviously, the 14 weeks impacts OpEx, I don't know with such high customer concentration, whether that matters for revenue. But any thoughts on March seasonality.\nVenkatesh Nathamuni: Yes. I mean it's too early to talk about March. But you're right. I mean in terms of just the current December quarter, we do have that extra week of both revenue and expenses, and that's kind of factored into the guidance. Now what happens in March, obviously, is a big function of what happens to our -- the top customers' main product. So I think we'll just reserve judgment on it. But a typical sequence between the December quarter and March quarter is that there's a seasonal decline. We'll quantify it at the right time. But I don't see anything that's different this time around in terms of the seasonality, just the magnitude of it is what we'll have to determine going forward.\nChelsea Heffernan : And this will be our last question.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah. Ananda, your line is now open.\nAnanda Baruah : Hey, thanks guys. I appreciate the questions. I guess going back to the PCs, John, would you -- if the sort of it's thought that there perhaps could be a little bit of a PC adoption dynamic in 2024. If that were to happen broadly would you anticipate seeing an impact to your PC business that we may notice as well? And then I have a quick follow-up also.\nJohn Forsyth: Sorry, are you referring to headwinds in the PC market?\nAnanda Baruah: Tailwinds in the PC market. A bit of a PC cycle. Yes.\nJohn Forsyth: I guess, yes, although we're still building design momentum. So we would certainly expect to benefit from that. And we think that when you do an AB comparison between laptops that have Cirrus Logic audio and haptics in them versus competitive products that do not. The difference is really striking. It's really a night and day difference. We're very, very proud of what we're doing there, and we think it's really meaningful for the PC experience. So I would certainly hope to benefit from that next year, even if we're still building our design momentum in our pipeline today.\nAnanda Baruah: And then on the PC opportunities that you spoke about a few moments ago. Yes -- like HP is talking about in the next handful of years, 40% eventually of their PCs and laptops shipping what they're calling AI-enabled processing. Dell is probably in the similar ballpark. So folks like that. Do you -- is that captured that kind of AI capability in PCs and laptops. Is that already captured in your thought process? Or would that provide kind of incremental content opportunity with that kind of AI enablement?\nJohn Forsyth: I'm not sure how that intersects quite with our current laptop-focused product portfolio. It may be that it does. We know, of course, the typical AI use cases burn a lot of power. So anything we can do to increase power efficiency across the system is obviously going to be a benefit. But what I would say more broadly is I think anything that makes laptops more interesting and more of a vector for innovation and more of a focal point for improving the user experience is likely to benefit us in general.\nChelsea Heffernan: And with that, we will end the Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to John for his final remarks.\nJohn Forsyth: Thank you, Chelsea. So in summary, Cirrus Logic delivered revenue toward the top end of our guidance for the second quarter and made solid progress across each of the three key areas of our strategy. We're excited about the opportunities in front of us, and we thank you for your continued interest in Cirrus Logic. In addition, I'd also like to thank the entire Cirrus Logic team, whose commitment to disciplined execution and to bringing innovation to bear on the challenges that our customers are addressing is ultimately what enables us to deliver strong results. Before we close, I'd also like to note that we will be participating in the Barclays Conference on December 6 in San Francisco. Please check our investor website for the details. Thank you all for joining our call today.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

As you've seen in the press release, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, Cirrus Logic delivered revenue of $317 million towards the top end of our guidance for the quarter, driven by products, shipping and smartphones. In a moment, Venk will discuss the results in greater detail. But before we get on to that, I'd like to provide some color on how we're doing against the strategy that I've outlined on previous calls. The first pillar of that strategy is to maintain and build our leadership in smartphone audio. And to that end, this quarter, we taped out our next-generation custom boosted amplifier, a component that we believe will deliver significantly increased performance and value to our customer and which we anticipate will ship next calendar year. We also completed product validation of our first 22-nanometer smart codec, a new product, which is also on track for introduction next year. This new codec represents a significant technology transition for Cirrus Logic and again, we'll deliver meaningful feature and performance benefits to our end customer. In our general market smartphone business, we also secured several next-generation Android sockets. And as a consequence, we anticipate seeing many great smartphone products featuring Cirrus Logic, audio and haptics being launched in the market in the coming year. Moving on to the second pillar of our strategy, we're excited about the opportunities we see to continue to grow our high-performance mixed signal content in smartphones. The cameras are a marquee feature of every major smartphone launch. We're proud of the progress that we've made in this area since we introduced our first camera controller product in calendar 2020. We're currently ramping production of our latest camera controller product for a smartphone that is expected to be introduced later this year. And looking forward, we believe there's still significant potential to continue to grow value in this area, and we are today investing in a road map of further products and features in pursuit of that goal. Beyond the camera, we've also previously indicated that we believe advanced power and battery-related technologies represent great opportunities for the Company. And today, we have a number of R&D programs underway related to high-efficiency charging, battery management and system side power delivery. We believe that the investments we are making in this space today will continue to drive product diversification and revenue growth in the future. Turning to our third strategic vector, we're increasingly leveraging our strengths in audio and high-performance mixed signal to diversify into additional applications and markets. Most recently, we are focused on expanding into the laptop market, where we see significant greenfield opportunity for the Company in the coming years. Today, we have well-established relationships with the top five laptop OEMs who together account for a significant majority of all laptop unit volumes, and we are shipping content with each of them. While we're still in the early stages of our entry into this market, we already see significant customer demand and engagement around our amplifier and codec products that have been specifically optimized for laptops, and we expect end devices incorporating these new components to come to market in the next 12 months. During the June quarter, we also secured our first business laptop win with our new amplifier, highlighting the growing importance of audio quality in this key segment, and we anticipate this device will begin shipping next year. Additionally, we're delighted that both our new amplifiers and codec have been selected as part of the sound wire compatible reference design from Intel, which will accelerate time to market and enable adoption of our components across more OEM platforms. Beyond the laptop market, we also continue to invest in further products and customer engagements that we anticipate will expand both our revenue and market diversity in the long term. These include gaming, augmented in virtual reality, automotive, industrial and professional audio applications. The latter illustrated by our recent launch of a range of industry-leading professional audio ADC products. We're excited about the number of ways in which we believe we can leverage our outstanding engineering talent and best-in-class intellectual property to grow our business in these areas and beyond. Finally, I would like to discuss briefly the difficult decision we took in July, resulting in a workforce reduction of approximately 5% of our global employee base. This action was taken in order to better align our overall cost structure with our revised revenue expectations. In light of both a previously discussed change in customer plans regarding HPMS product that we have been expecting to be introduced this fall and the current general market softness. We remain committed to disciplined execution of our strategy and believe that following this action, we are well positioned to invest in the many opportunities we see to drive future growth. And with that, let me now turn the call over to Venk to provide an overview of our financial results for our fiscal Q1 2024 as well as guidance for the second quarter.\nVenk Nathamuni: Thank you, John. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of the fiscal first quarter results and then provide guidance for fiscal Q2. Fiscal first quarter revenue was $317 million, which was close to the top end of our guidance range as unit volumes were higher than expected. Revenue was down 15% quarter-over-quarter and down 19% from a year ago due to lower volume of components shipping into the smartphone end market and, to a lesser extent, continued weakness in general market sales. Turning to gross margin. Non-GAAP gross profit in the quarter was $159.7 million, and non-GAAP gross margin was 50.4%, which is slightly above the midpoint of the guidance range we have provided. On a sequential basis, gross margin increased slightly, while on a year-over-year basis, gross margin declined by 110 basis points due to higher inventory reserves and a less favorable product mix. I'd like to provide an update on the high-performance mixed-signal product that John alluded to earlier. As we mentioned in the shareholder letter, we have removed the revenue associated with this component from our internal model. But during the quarter, we made good progress with both our customer and foundry partner on the disposition of wafers associated with this product, and we do not anticipate the disposition to have a material financial impact. I'd also like to reiterate that our customer relationship remains strong as we continue to collaborate on a range of technologies and programs and pursue opportunities for both the next generation of our existing components as well as new products. Turning to OpEx. Non-GAAP operating expenses in the quarter were $113.8 million, down $6 million sequentially. I'd note that operating expenses came in below the low end of our guidance range due to product development prioritization as well as controls on discretionary spending. Restructuring costs associated with the cost actions John referred to earlier are not expected to be material and are reflected in the Q2 fiscal '24 GAAP operating expense guidance. I'd note that we're continuing to invest in products and technologies in order to pursue opportunities to drive our long-term revenue growth. And overall, non-GAAP operating income was $45.8 million in the first quarter or 14.5% of revenue. And lastly, on the P&L, non-GAAP net income in the first quarter was $38 million, or $0.67 per share as the higher-than-expected revenue and the lower operating expense flowed through to the bottom line. Let me now turn to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to remain strong, and we ended the first quarter of fiscal '24 with approximately $426 million in cash and cash equivalents. Our ending cash balance was down $91.1 million from the prior quarter as we built inventory to support seasonal product launches in the second half of the calendar year and also used cash to repurchase stock during the quarter. Specifically, cash used in operations was $39.8 million during the June quarter, which is about 13% of revenue. We continue to have no debt outstanding, and also, we have $300 million undrawn on our revolver. Now turning to inventory. As we indicated in prior quarters, we've been building inventory to support seasonal product launches in the second half of the calendar year, and fulfill our wafer purchase commitments for our long-term capacity agreement with GlobalFoundries. As a result, inventory was $301 million, up from $233.5 million sequentially, and days of inventory was approximately 175 days in Q1, up 60 days sequentially. Let me add some additional color on our GlobalFoundries agreement. While a portion of the capacity associated with this agreement was originally intended to support our new HPMS component, the agreement allows for wafer allocation flexibility within our product portfolio. As a result, these wafers are being reallocated to other products that use the same underlying 55-nanometer high-voltage process technology, including amplifiers, haptic drivers and battery and power ICs. Looking ahead, in Q2 fiscal '24, we expect inventory dollars to increase from the prior quarter. However, days of inventory are expected to decline due to seasonal product ramps. While we anticipate increased inventory levels of these other products during this fiscal year, we expect Q2 to be the high point of inventory for the remainder of the fiscal year. Turning now to cash flow. Cash used in operations was $39.8 million in the June quarter, and CapEx was roughly $12.3 million, resulting in free cash flow for the quarter of minus 16%. For the 12-month period ending in the June quarter, free cash flow margin was roughly 10%. On the share buyback front, in Q1, we utilized $38.5 million to repurchase approximately 466,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $82.59. As of the end of Q1 fiscal '24, we had $462.6 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We expect to continue to return capital in the form of stock repurchases, which we believe will provide a long-term benefit to shareholders going forward. And now on to the guidance, for Q2 of fiscal '24, we expect revenue in the range of $430 million to $490 million. We expect gross margin to range from 49% to 51%. Non-GAAP operating expense is expected to be up sequentially in the range of $114 million to $120 million as higher variable compensation and product development costs is partially offset by lower employee expense. We will continue to control discretionary spending but invest strategically in product development to drive long-term growth. On the tax front, as we previously discussed, our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP effective tax rate will continue to be unfavorably impacted by capitalized R&D expense, and as expected, our foreign tax credits will be lower this year. Our fiscal 2024 non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be approximately 24% to 26%, consistent with our prior quarter's guidance. We continue to anticipate that the impact of capitalist R&D will become less unfavorable over time as additional years of R&D expenses are amortized for tax purposes. We're closely monitoring legislation recently introduced that would restore immediate tax deduction for R&D investments if passed. In closing, we had a solid Q1 fiscal '24 as we executed well to deliver these results. Going forward, we will continue to focus on the best opportunities to enable the Company to grow both revenue and profitability over the long term. And before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to note that fiscal year 2024 is a 53-week fiscal year and will include 14 weeks in the fiscal third quarter. And finally, while we understand there is intense interest related to our largest customer, in accordance with Cirrus Logic's company policy we will not discuss specifics about our business relationship. With that, let me now turn the call to Chelsea to start the Q&A session.\nChelsea Heffernan: Thanks, Venk. We will now start the Q&A portion of the earnings call. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we're ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: John, I guess for both of you guys, I wanted to ask a couple of questions around the resolution of the HPMS product that didn't ramp with a large customer. So you guys talked about a couple of different things, one of which is sort of the resolution on the wafers that were built. If you could give a little bit more color on that, if you're able to at all? And I guess are those wafers still included in your inventory balance that you talked about? And then the second question on that topic is, John, this is kind of a longer-term one. And conversations over the years with yourself and with your predecessor Jason, it's always been really, really hard to find mixed-signal analog audio engineers. And I know it was a rough go, not of your own fault at all, that thing happened with that product. But I just kind of wondered the decision to take the workforce reduction rather than just given the scarcity value of that engineering talent, maybe reallocating that with those folks. And so maybe you could talk a little bit about that?\nJohn Forsyth: Yes. Thank you, Matt. I'll speak to that and then hand over to Venk, and he can talk about how we've been working through the dispositioning of the work in progress around the product. Yes, first of all, obviously, there was not a decision that we took lightly at all. But the reality is there's a significant change to immediate near-term revenue expectations there, and we wanted to work very hard to bring the cost structure more into line with that reality, whilst still ensuring that we were in a position to invest in all the things that we believe will drive us forward as a company in the mid- to long term. And I'd emphasize the latter point because we do have very many areas of opportunity across those three pillars of the strategy. And our plan is to continue to invest in that growth. So although this action was kind of distributed across the business, we will, in fact, exit this quarter with more people working in design than we had a year ago. So this is -- we had to take some steps to navigate the short-term challenges, while at the same time, ensuring that we're positioned for execution on the opportunities that we believe are going to help us grow and diversify in the medium and long term.\nVenk Nathamuni: Yes. And thanks, Matt, for the question. This is Venk. So, I wanted to address your question about the inventory related to the part that's no longer expected to ship. So the first point I want to make is that we do not expect a material financial impact, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. The inventories in different levels, basically, at the high level, I want to mention that we've made really good progress with both our customer as well as our foundry partner on the disposition. And clearly, this is factored into our current guidance. Now one thing to keep in mind is that as we talked about the GlobalFoundries contract, we do have some flexibility in terms of how we allocate the capacity that we have across the different products. And suffice it to say that we have factored that into our guidance, and there's no material financial impact of the inventory for the component that's no longer going to ship.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel. You may now go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: If I could just follow up on that last topic, Venk. So your inventory days were 175. I mean I know there's a lot of things that go into the inventory, but what would that number perhaps have been without the issues with the HPMS product just roughly?\nVenk Nathamuni: Yes. Thanks for the question, Tore. So a couple of things on the overall inventory that we talked about is a lot of it is driven by the fact that we are building ahead of the traditional launch of our key customers' products that happens in the second half of the year. That's the vast majority of it. And obviously, we also have a commitment to our foundry supplier in terms of fulfilling wafer starts and such. So without going into the specifics of what the split is, I can tell you that it's a relatively small number. And clearly, we're in discussions with both our customers as well as with our foundry supplier. And as I said before, we do expect our inventory days to come down next quarter and we have taken into account whatever is the inventory associated with that particular product.\nTore Svanberg: That's very helpful. And for John. John, I know you don't -- I mean, you can't preannounce your customers' products, obviously, but can you just give us some puts and takes right now on content growth for the second half and next year? I mean, second half, it sounds like it's mainly new camera controller products. But how should we think about possible or opportunities for 2024?\nJohn Forsyth: Yes, sure, Tore. So going into the cycle this fall, yes, the content growth that I've alluded to previously is in the camera controller area. So we have a new product ramping then. As we turn to next calendar year, in 2024, we've got two significant products coming to market in our new audio components, the boosted amplifier and the codec, both of which we believe deliver meaningfully more value to the customer. So we're on track with those, and very excited about those and their potential impact. As we look beyond that, we believe there are multiple opportunities to continue to grow in the camera space, but also expand in other HPMS areas, in particular, I've alluded to power and areas around the battery where we believe there's still further opportunity for us to grow.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Rolland: I guess my first question is, you guys did mention some upside in revenue due to better units. And also, you guys had a nice guide as well. As we look out beyond September, and I know you guys don't guide, but is there anything we should think about in terms of shipment pull-in versus a typical cycle that you guys have out there? And these high DOIs and build-aheads, for example, does that also -- even when you make an adjustment for the HPMS part and wafer supply commitments. Do these high DOIs also tell us about something beyond September as well?\nJohn Forsyth: Chris, I'll make a comment here and then hand over to Venk to provide additional color if he wants. I -- obviously, we don't guide beyond the quarter, the additional bit of color that I would add is that when we look at the backlog today and the movement there, it's pretty robust and stable. We haven't seen a lot of really any signs of the kind of stuff that you're alluding to. So it's pretty steady as this goes.\nVenk Nathamuni: Yes. And I'll reiterate what John said, as we look at the bookings parts throughout the quarter, nothing unusual. And obviously, we have the business with our top customer, but also the rest of the business, we've seen -- there are no changes in terms of order cancellations or pushouts and pull-ins and so forth. Obviously, we're only guiding one quarter at a time. But so far, what we've seen has -- doesn't give us any reason to believe that there's anything unusual, number one. And then the second question, Chris asked about in terms of the inventory. Again, I want to reiterate the point that for the prior couple of years, we were pretty much in a hand to march existence as it relates to inventory. And obviously, days were incredibly low. So, we have been talking for the last couple of quarters about building that inventory so that we can service our customers more promptly. And that's what we are down the path of executing. And also reiterate the point that while the inventory days are up this quarter, we do expect it to decline in the next quarter.\nChristopher Rolland: And then secondly, on your wafer commitments. How are you guys feeling about the $560 million in '24 and the $380 million in '25 yet to come? And you'll have less flexibility probably because of those high DOIs, does that come into play here or not?\nVenk Nathamuni: Yes. Good question. So clearly, from the long-term commitment standpoint, we feel good about where we are with the supplier. We are working very collaboratively with them in terms of trying to figure out how do we make use of those parts and repurpose them for the ones that we see demand going forward. And longer term, we still see a lot of opportunity in terms of being able to work with this supplier and then obviously continue to look for other sources of supply over time because we do see the runway ahead over the last -- over the next several years in terms of the increased content and the new capabilities that we're working on.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. You may now go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes, two quick ones, if I could. Guys just sort of with regards to the go-forward opportunity, that you talked about, both with regards to advanced power and battery capabilities. Is philosophically as smartphone -- if smartphones were to begin to adopt kind of more robust AI features and functionality? And even if ARR, DRR, more robust ARR, DRR features and smartphones were to work their way in, in the coming years. Would that create a need for a noticeable step-up in advanced power and value capability that you guys provide? And then I have just a quick follow-up.\nJohn Forsyth: Yes. Thanks. That's an interesting question. I guess I'll probably be bearing into a kind of speculative domain here. But yes, two things would be potentially favorable to us. One is that where we really specialize is in the interface between the physical world and the digital domain. So anything where a lot of data needs to cross that boundary at very low power and be subject to some kind of processing then we're really ideal for solving problems in that space. That's why we've done so well traditionally in the boundary between -- the boundary around audio and more recently in the camera and optical space. And I think in general, AI, augmented reality and so on, certainly drive use cases, which look like that. So I think that presents opportunity for us to grab. And then since you asked about the power space, I think one thing that's very obvious with anything related to AI is that it is very, very power hungry, it causes major spikes in power demand within any system. And that's exactly the kind of thing where even already our power conversion and control, I see is it really delivers a lot of benefits to the system, to the end user and to our customer in terms of battery protection, in terms of managing the system -- the power across the system and so on. So yes, I think that would probably accentuate some of the kinds of problems that we're really experts at solving.\nAnanda Baruah: Yes. That's awesome. I appreciate that context. And the quick follow-up is the context that you were giving just around sort of I know you're not talking specifically about given December quarter guidance. You're just talking about the backlog looking stable and steady as she goes. Is that also to say sort of if we just look at what your classic seasonality might be, that's not an awful place to start for our modeling purposes?\nJohn Forsyth: I think so. I'll caveat it because when we get into this part of the year, of course, around any quarter boundary, there's a lot of material on either side of that. So it doesn't take much movement to move the needle of fair amount. But if you look at the shape of the quarter we're guiding now relative to the last quarter, that is and then compare it against the last six or seven years in terms of seasonality, it's straight down the middle of the fairway. So again, it kind of looks pretty normal to us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBlayne Curtis: I just want to ask you, it might be a tough one to answer, so answer as you can. But to the product that got shells, I'm just kind of curious if you can speak to I guess, the why part. And I guess I asked because I'm wondering if you can speak to kind of what's the status of it? I mean is the customer but they're never going to use it, kind of who owns the chip? Is there any IP that you need? I mean, you spend a lot of time on this development, I'm assuming in cost. So, I think you spoke to maybe getting some reconciliation on the wafers and the cost of like product that was made. I'm kind of curious either recouping your efforts or monetizing it later, anything you can speak to as to the future of that product?\nJohn Forsyth: Yes, I'm not going to go through the details as we understand them of what lay behind the decision. I did point out in the previous call, we were certainly happy that we hit our milestones, but obviously, there were other factors involved. Regarding expectations going forward for it, per the comment in the prepared remarks, we've taken it out of the model, which means that we don't have any expectations around it. That's not to say it mightn't come back. There is some very cool technology in there, so we would obviously love that. And it's also not to imply that we're saying something about the actual plan that the customer has because we're not, and we don't have insight into that. But we -- it's just to say that we really don't have line of sight of the plan for it right now. So, it remains on the shelf. But yes, there's a lot of great IP there that we would really like to find a way to get it to see the light of day.\nBlayne Curtis: Great. And then just, Venk, on the workforce reduction, I was just kind of curious the timing of that? Obviously, OpEx is up in September, and then you have the 14 quarter in December. I'm just kind of wondering how to think about OpEx for December? And when you get the full impact of the reduction, does that offset some of the kind of the mechanics of the extra week?\nVenk Nathamuni: Yes, Blayne, thanks for the question. Yes. So clearly, from a guidance perspective, we're giving guidance on you for the September quarter, but I understand your point. So essentially, in terms of the timing, the effect of the actions that we took will obviously only be valid for about 6.5 to 7 months of the full fiscal year. And so that's the way to think about it. And we announced in the 8-K that it was roughly 4% to 5% reduction. So, if you just do the math, it will work out to somewhere around the 4% to 5% spread out over the next several months, right? So I think that's the way to think about it. In terms of the December quarter, clearly, you're not going to see any benefit on the revenue side. But on the OpEx side, in the extra week will definitely have an impact on OpEx, and that's the way you should model it as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nMatt Ramsay: Thanks for let me jump back in. John, I wanted to -- you've been having increased commentary about the laptop market and your large customer is a big player there. But you talked tonight about getting in some reference design programs with Intel. Maybe you could expand on that a little bit. The status of that relationship, how immediate that might translate into revenue and just your understanding of the size of the unit opportunity that might be covered under those reference design programs at that customer?\nJohn Forsyth: Yes. Thank you, Matt. I guess I'll talk about the PC opportunity in -- on a couple of axis. So one is just the timing of our expectations of how our market penetration and revenue potential looks. And then I'll talk about the stack of content that we believe is going to be relevant and formal part of our SAM there. So we're in the early innings. We've just sampled the codec and amplifier to customers. We've just announced the inclusion of those on the reference design. Typically, those reference designs will be made available to OEMs between 18 and 24 months before you see end products in the market. So, where we've still got some way to go for that to grow significantly, but we also have a number of designs, pretty significant number of designs underway today, which predate that reference design. So I think the way to think about it is that we will see some products coming out late FY '24 that include those new devices from us, but the total revenue in FY '24 is going to be fairly limited than growing somewhat in '25 and then continuing to grow and become more and more meaningful through FY '26 and beyond. And the SAM that we see is going to be made up of audio and HPMS products. So if you look at designs, which are underway today, we have at least one design underway where we can see multiple amplifiers a code and haptics driver, which starts to become a pretty meaningful stack of content, obviously. And then over time, we expect power products from us to be layered on top of that. And we can see -- we can also see potential in some products for multiple dollars worth of power content. So if you look out to 2027, we think there's about $1.2 billion of SAM when you take both the audio products and the HPMS power-related products into account.\nChelsea Heffernan: This will be our last question.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nTore Svanberg: I just had a follow-up to that last topic because I mean this is obviously part of your third strategy. Will you start to break out how much notebook is as a percentage of revenue? And if so, I mean, would it like 10% number, something like that be used? Because obviously, we want to track your progress there and just wondering numerically if you would share some of that with us.\nVenk Nathamuni: Yes, Tore, great question. So as John just mentioned, we're pretty excited about the opportunity that we see in front of us, especially in the PC market across multiple dimensions and codecs and amplifiers and such. Clearly, from a short-term perspective, everybody knows that the PC market is going through some tough times. So over time, we do expect these design wins to translate into meaningful revenue and at the appropriate time, we will consider that. And yes, watch the space.\nChelsea Heffernan: With that, we will end the Q&A session, and I will now turn the call back to John for final remarks.\nJohn Forsyth: Thanks, Chelsea. So in summary, Cirrus Logic delivered revenue towards the top end of our guidance for the first quarter and made great progress across our core areas of strategic focus. The first of which is maintaining our leadership in smartphone audio; secondly, continuing to expand our high-performance mixed signal content in smartphones; and thirdly, leveraging our outstanding audio and high-performance mixed signal expertise to diversify into new markets. We're excited about the opportunities in front of us, and we thank you for your continued interest in Cirrus Logic. I'd also like to thank all of our employees for their incredible dedication and commitment. Before we close, I'd also like to note that we will be participating in the KeyBanc conference in Vail on August 7. Please check our investor website for the details. Thank you all for joining the call today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."
