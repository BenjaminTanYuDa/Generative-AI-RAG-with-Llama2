        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Lakeland Industries Fiscal 2024 Third Quarter Financial Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. During today's call, we will make statements relating to our goals and objectives for future operations, financial and business trends, business prospects and management's expectations for future performance that constitute forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Any such forward-looking statements reflect management's expectations based upon currently available information and are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or developments after the date of this call. During today's call, we will discuss financial measures derived from our financial statements that are not determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. A reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is presented in our earnings release.  At this time, I would like to introduce you to your host for this call, Lakeland Industries' Executive Chairman, Jim Jenkins, Mr. Jenkins, the floor is yours.\nJim Jenkins : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us for our third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. I would like to begin today's call by thanking and celebrating our Lakeland team members across the company with our commitment to delivering our strategic initiatives during the quarter. These efforts have helped drive revenue growth in key strategic markets, execute a continued shift in our revenue profile towards higher-value products and carry out our small, strategic and quick, or SSQ, acquisition strategy. As we enter the next chapter for Lakeland, I know I can speak for myself, our executive team and the Board when I say that we are excited about the company's future supported by the strength and depth of our organization and leadership teams.  Before turning to our third quarter results, I'd like to provide a brief update on our ongoing CEO search. The Board is following a very thorough vetting and selection process and engaging executive recruiter has preliminarily identified a few candidates. We're eager to find the right leader, but we will be methodical and deliberate as we seek a candidate who will continue to drive our business strategy and culture. Lakeland has a solid foundation in place with an exciting runway for growth, and the Board and I look forward to sharing more with you as the search process evolves.  Now shifting gears to the quarter. Our first third quarter results -- our fiscal third quarter results were very positive. And as we continue to see demand accelerate and growth within our key product lines and markets, Lakeland delivered net sales of $31.7 million, up 11.6% year-over-year. Notably, many of our high-value strategic product lines saw growth in the quarter, including fire service and industrial products categories. Our fire service business continues to expand, driven by our superior lead times versus our competitors, innovative designs from the Eagle team and onboarding successes with new distributors. As expected, we also continue to see strong demand from oil and gas turnaround activity, which, as we discussed in previous quarters, is having extended season in 2023. Finally, we saw a significant increase in our direct-to-customer container business, which is a strategic focus for us. This growth highlights the significant momentum Lakeland is building in our high-value product lines, and our goal to increase penetration in high-value markets is producing positive results. We believe our recently announced Pacific Helmets acquisition will further enhance our fire service growth. In terms of profitability, our third quarter gross margins remained strong at 42.2%. And importantly, our adjusted EBITDA grew by over $300,000 or 10.8% to $3.3 million in the quarter, even with the negative impact of foreign exchange in the quarter, which Roger will discuss later. This resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.4% compared to 10.4% last year. Adjusted for the impact of negative FX in the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately 14.2%. With regard to our geographic markets, we continue to see strong demand trends in North America, particularly in the U.S. and Latin America as well as our EMEA markets to a lesser extent. We also were encouraged to see increases in our India and Australia markets for the quarter as these are potential growth markets for us. In North America, our sales teams continue to have success adding new distributors and expanding our commercial reach. Additionally, our considerably shorter manufacturing lead times as compared to many of our competitors have resulted in Lakeland gaining traction as a preferred supplier in our fire service and industrial categories. As we have discussed in past calls, we continue to see our strategically located manufacturing as a competitive advantage in enabling our favorable lead times. Finally, our Latin American business continued its exceptionally strong performance for the year as we are the market leader in several of the markets served. As has been the case for the first half of the year, our Asian markets continued to perform below expectations as a result of ongoing macroeconomic weakness and overhang of PPE equipment from China's COVID-19 lockdown. As a result, we expect our Asia Pacific business to remain below our initial projections over the last quarter of the year. Shifting gears a bit, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the company's small, strategic and quick M&A strategy and our overall commitment to identifying and maintaining a robust acquisition pipeline with opportunities that enhance Lakeland's high-value product portfolio. Last week, we were pleased to announce the acquisition of Pacific Helmets. Pacific is a highly regarded global brand with a well-established reputation for quality and innovative design and manufacturing and the growing first responder safety helmet market. The company has a broad range of helmet models, styles and certifications and they have demonstrated the ability to develop new products and sell successfully around the world. The acquisition of Pacific is a significant milestone in our efforts to build Lakeland as a premier global fire brand as it enhances our product portfolio and strengthens our ability to deliver exceptional fire turnout protection offerings to our customers worldwide. Pacific has one of the largest ranges of helmets -- helmet model, styles and certifications of any international helmet manufacturer. The company currently produces 26-plus helmet models and has a significant number of new product innovations launching in the near future. Like Lakeland, Pacific owns its own manufacturing facilities and has an in-house R&D team that enables it to customize and produce helmets specified to the customers' specific requirements more easily. Pacific Helmet currently has a strong revenue and tender pipeline and global demand for safety helmets is growing. They already sell into over 40 countries, and we believe the business is further scalable through the addition of new distributors, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere and emerging markets, in which Lakeland already has a strong presence. We expect this acquisition to be immediately accretive to Lakeland's bottom line results and are excited about the organic and cross-selling opportunities going forward. I'm excited to see our global sales team execute on this opportunity, and we look forward to sharing more about the integration of the Pacific business in the Lakeland platform in the future. I'd also like to welcome the Pacific team to the Lakeland's family, and we're very excited to have you as part of our team and the potential for the future. I also want to thank our team here at Lakeland for all their hard work recently in closing this deal. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our Eagle acquisition, and we believe Eagle is an excellent template for our SSQ acquisition model. After delivering a large tender during Q2 of this year, we expect Eagle to ship another larger order in Q4. Additionally, we are continuing efforts to integrate Eagle products into Lakeland's geographic markets as well as to accelerate the sales of Eagle gloves in particular block and hoods. Eagle's fired gloves and particle blocking hoods are progressing through the certification process, and Lakeland has leveraged Eagle's in-house designers in the development of our next-generation NFPA turnout gear, which is currently underway. As we look to the balance of the fiscal year and beyond, I am confident in and impressed by our current management team. I'm also encouraged by the exciting runway for growth this company has. Lakeland is focused on solidifying our foundational business and investing our resources in high-growth geographies, which will include product line enhancements and the optimization of our operating and sales channels. Over the longer term, we are committed to building out a premier global fire brand, as I previously mentioned. This will include the release of new and innovative products, additions to our global sales force and a renewed marketing focus, all of these efforts will benefit from the addition of Pacific to our existing platform. Finally, Lakeland is committed to expanding our products and capabilities through our small strategic and quick acquisition strategy. Continued M&A will help Lakeland's already diverse line of products, bring premier global brands on to the Lakeland platform and drive strong operating leverage through cross-selling on Lakeland's vast distribution and sales network.  I'll now pass the call to Roger to provide an overview of our financial results. Roger?\nRoger Shannon : Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. Before I get started with my comments on the financials, I'd like to remind everyone listening that we have posted investor slides that align with the information I'll present on our website at www.lakeland.com. Lakeland delivered sales of $31.7 million in the third quarter ended October 31, 2023. Domestic sales were $15.1 million or 47.6% of total revenues and international sales were $16.6 million or 52.4% of total revenues. This compares with domestic sales of $14 million or 49.3% of the total and international sales of $14.4 million or 50.7% of the total in the third quarter of fiscal '23. As we noted in our earnings press release issued yesterday afternoon, we delivered strong year-over-year sales growth and continued strong profitability. In terms of product mix for the quarter, our fire service category continues to increase as a percentage of Lakeland sales and represented 18% of the total revenue for the quarter compared to 12.5% in the year ago period. Disposables continue to decrease as a percentage of Lakeland sales and represented 38% of total revenues compared to 50% in the year ago period. This reflects the efforts we've made to shift our product mix towards higher value, higher margin and less commoditized products, as we have discussed in prior calls, as well as continued weakness for this product line in Asia. For the fiscal year-to-date, our fire service business is 21.4% of sales and disposables are 39%. From a segment reporting standpoint, Lakeland saw strong sales growth in our U.S., European, Canadian and Latin American markets. This growth was partially offset by softer Asian sales, particularly in China, which is a continuation of what we've seen over the last few quarters. For the current quarter, sales in the U.S. were $15.1 million or 48% of total revenue, an increase of $1.1 million over the year ago period. Latin American sales grew $1.6 million to $4.2 million in the current quarter, an increase of 63% over Q3 of last year. All geographic regions except for Asia showed increases over the year ago period. Due to the inherent timing variability in our fire service business as a result of the timing of deliveries on large tenders, we have begun more closely tracking our trailing 12-month, or TTM, revenue. For the 12 months ended October 31, 2023, our TTM revenue was $122.4 million, an increase of $11.8 million or 11% over the trailing 12 months ended October 31, 2022. Gross profit for Q3 of this quarter was $13.4 million, an increase of $1.1 million or 9% over the year ago period. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42.2% for the fiscal 2024 Q4, as compared to 43.3% a year ago. Gross profit performance in the current period was driven by increased revenue during the quarter, including sales of previously reserved excess inventory, partially offset by an adjustment for intercompany profit in ending inventory. Our gross margin percentage was affected by an adjustment for intercompany profit and ending inventory and amortization of previous year adjustments to excess inventory, partially offset by improved product mix, lower freight cost, manufacturing cost improvements and the reduction of total inventory, including fully and partially reserved inventory. Lakeland reported operating profit of $3.6 million in Q3 of '24 as compared to $2.1 million in the third quarter of last year. As a result, operating margins were 11.4% in the third quarter, up from 7.6% in the third quarter of last year. Our operating profit benefited from increases in sales and lower operating expenses during the third quarter. The company evaluated the earn-out consideration accrual related to the Eagle acquisition and reduced this accrual by $1.5 million, which was recorded as a reduction in operating expense in the quarter. This decrease was offset by increases in currency fluctuations of $700,000, primarily related to the Argentine peso. Additionally, higher related -- higher sales-related costs, including increases in travel and trade show expenses, were realized as we continue to invest in growth initiatives across the company. Lakeland delivered net income of $2.6 million or $0.35 per basic share and $0.34 per diluted share during the quarter. This compares to net income of $1.4 million or $0.19 per basic and diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $3.3 million in Q3 '24, an increase of 10.8% compared to $3 million in Q3 of '23. Adjusted EBITDA performance in the quarter was driven by higher sales, partially offset by the impact of the previously mentioned negative FX impacts in operating expenses. Our adjusted EBITDA margin for Q3 of fiscal 2024 was 10.4% compared to the same number in the year ago period. Adjusted for the impact of negative FX in the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately 14.2% in the current quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, Lakeland's adjusted EBITDA of $12.1 million is an increase of 21.2% versus the TTM adjusted EBITDA of $9.9 million as of October 31, 2022. Now turning to the balance sheet. Lakeland ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $26.4 million, an increase of $1.8 million compared to our prior year-end cash balance of $24.6 million. Lakeland delivered cash flow from operations during the quarter of $3.8 million, driven by profitable operations and a $2.6 million reduction of raw materials and finished goods inventory. Year-to-date, we have produced positive operating cash flow of $7.7 million, led by profitable operations and a $3.2 million decrease in inventory. Offsetting the operating cash flows were $3 million in investing activities split between capital equipment and additional investment in body track. Financing activities for the fiscal year-to-date, primarily quarterly dividends, U.K. bank repayments and treasury stock purchases totaled $1.8 million. Finally, cash balances have been impacted by $1.1 million during the year-to-date due to currency fluctuations, primarily from the Chinese yuan and Argentine peso. The company continued to have no debt at the end of the quarter and has up to $25 million available from bank credit facilities. Capital expenditures for the 3 months at October 31, 2023, were $400,000 and $1.5 million year-to-date. As a reminder, we now expect CapEx to be approximately $2 million for the full fiscal year as we replace existing equipment in the normal course of operations. The Monterrey expansion, which we discussed last quarter, remains on pause as we continue to assess weather-related damage to our leased building. Inventories declined $3 million quarter-over-quarter to $54.4 million from $57.4 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal '24. We were pleased to see the acceleration of inventory reduction in the quarter, and this remains a top operating objective. During the quarter, we utilized various sales and marketing programs as well as price deviations on reserved inventory to assist this effort, and we will continue to do so moving forward. In closing, I'd like to briefly discuss 2 transactions that occurred subsequent to quarter end and their impact on Lakeland's financial profile. First is the acquisition of New Zealand-based Pacific Helmets for $8.5 million, subject to post-closing adjustments and customary holdback provisions, which Jim already covered in detail. The transaction was funded through the company's revolving credit facility and cash balances. We expect Pacific to add $7 million to $8 million of sales revenue to Lakeland in our next fiscal year and for the company to be immediately accretive to Lakeland's bottom line results. Next is the sale of the company's Brantford, Ontario warehouse. On November 27 of 2023, the company sold its office and warehouse facility in Brantford, Ontario to an unrelated party for $4.9 million. This sale will result in a pretax gain after selling expenses approximately $3.8 million that will be recognized in the fourth quarter of this year. Going forward, the company will utilize third-party logistics providers for customer fulfillment in Canada. Finally, on November 30, 2023, we entered into Amendment number 3 to the loan agreement with Bank of America. In this third amendment, the lender consented to our acquisition of the equity interest of Pacific and to permit additional indebtedness to be made available on Pacific by its existing bank relationships. The amendment also waived Lakeland's borrowing base limitations through January 31, 2024.  With that overview, I'd now like to turn the call over to the operator to open the call up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Gerry Sweeney with ROTH Capital.\nGerry Sweeney : Just a couple of quick questions. Obviously, fire service is doing quite well, and there's a lot of talk about getting into distributors. Just curious, is the fire -- are the fire gear products in all your distributors that you currently want to be in? Or is there an opportunity to get into more meaning? If you have some relationships with distributors, are they all in those distributors that you have relationships with, not new ones? I'm assuming sometimes it's easier to get into existing relationships expanding\nJim Jenkins: I think it's a combination of -- yes, I do. I think it's a combination of both at this point, Gerry. And in particular, with our North American sales team, they have done a tremendous job of developing additional distribution arrangements. And we are -- we've recently hired somebody in the West Coast to help further expand those relationships. So we've seen what I would consider more than modest success in developing our current distribution network but also expanding it. And I give kudos to our North American sales team -- the fire sales team, in particular, for that. And then, of course, on the Eagle front, we've inherited a lot of relationships from them as they seek bidding opportunities throughout the world. And certainly, with Pacific Helmet, we'll see beneficiary of some very strong APAC distributor relationships that they have. And then you sort of do the cross-selling with that, and I get really excited about it because there's all kinds of opportunities that we might have had to partner with someone else to do that now we don't have to do that because we've got it -- we've got that service and product offering in-house.\nGerry Sweeney : Got it. I mean I don't want to put words in your mouth, but sort of what I'm looking at it is distribution growth has been great. It sounds like there's still opportunities there, but you take your fire turnout here, Eagle, Pacific Helmet, there's you can layer on additional cross-selling opportunities and maybe even get into additional distributors different regions of the world. So still some low-hanging fruit maybe on the distributor set?\nJim Jenkins: Yes. Look, I remain -- yes, I think that's -- and you're not putting words in my mouth. I think that's right. And I think we feel we're in the early stages of growing out this opportunity. And given the certain competitive advantages we have, certainly on our sort of captive manufacturing, the additional product lines that we offer, yes, this is -- in a 9-inning game, I think we're at about second inning.\nGerry Sweeney : All right. That's very helpful. And then, obviously, maybe acquisitions, right? Totally Pacific Helmets absolutely makes sense. Are there other opportunities out there that you would be looking for that sort of add -- I don't know whether it's the fire gear or some other areas that just add this cross-selling opportunity?\nJim Jenkins: Yes. I mean we see opportunities in industrials and in fire. Fire is where we sort of found the low-hanging fruit. We'd love to round -- we want to round out our fire offering with other possible products. So I'm certainly interested in that. And in terms of the pipeline, I mean, for anybody's benefit on the call, my background is I really have been moving on a strategic plan for Transcat in the M&A circles where we have pretty much done what we're trying to do at Lakeland, right? And as I look at the 2 companies, there's lots of similarities there about opportunities that we can move the needle without betting the farm, right? Pacific was an $8.5 million deal, we're going to get it right. I know we're going to get it right. But if we only get it a little right, we're going to be fine. In fact, we're going to be better than fine.\nGerry Sweeney : Got it. Yes, certainly -- sorry, go ahead.\nJim Jenkins: Yes, go ahead.\nGerry Sweeney : I was going to say, Transcat, you absolutely expanded the addressable market, right, through the asset management side. So that's sort of what I'm seeing here.\nJim Jenkins: Exactly.\nGerry Sweeney : Yes. Got it. Maybe just a couple of quick questions on disposables. Where does this go in terms of percentage of revenue? I imagine there's always some component of sales for disposables but some needs. And I'm just curious if it's less important that there's less differentiation, et cetera, but I'm wondering where that goes longer term? And then maybe just talk about where inventory -- maybe a right inventory level should be in terms of dollars on a -- maybe a constant basis, I know it's going to change over time, but I think\nJim Jenkins: So in the interest of not making myself a fool, I'm going to have Roger answer that one.\nRoger Shannon: Yes, I would just point out that under Jim's and the Board's leadership, we have spent a lot of time and effort over the course of the summer and the fall. And of course, I joined in February 1 of this year kind of looking at our strategy, strategic direction, how we compete and where we think we have competitive advantages. Of course, we have talked about the benefits that in-house manufacturing brings. We don't want to give the message at all that we're minimizing disposables. Disposables, even though it's down to 38% or so of the total revenue, that's because other revenue is growing in addition to, of course, the weakness in China that we've seen. But as we think about disposables, we don't want to give the message or the perspective, the disposables are not strategic. Now there are some places where it does not make sense to compete in disposables where we don't think we have competitive advantage and we don't want to race to the bottom on pricing there. But as we think about what is strategic and how best to where we have advantages, there are disposable products that we're very excited about and we're going to continue to leverage. And a couple of things specifically that come to mind, and we talked about this a bit last quarter is the clean room applications. Clean rooms, it's not just your basic run the mill, low level disposable item, we see opportunities in semiconductor EV, continued in health care and the Lakeland brand and the product there is very good. The other, we alluded to this a bit in our prepared remarks is our larger distributor direct-to-customer container program. And we saw a tick in that. This quarter, again, our large customer sales force is doing a great job. And what that enables us to do is kind of strategically use certain disposable products to fill out a container that we ship directly to the customer. It's better margin and cost profile for us because we're not handling it and it results in more sales because they can go to one place, one stop and kind of get the full range of needs that fill out the container the goods shipped to them. So while we see the most growth -- the most accelerated growth and growth percentages in fire and especially from an M&A perspective in fire service and also in industrial, the disposables as it relates to things like critical environment, clean room and direct-to-customer container programs is considered highly strategic for us.\nGerry Sweeney : Got it. Understood.\nJim Jenkins: And I didn't mean --\nGerry Sweeney : Disposable go all the way, but I -- that's a great overview.\nRoger Shannon: And I'd just add, it's kind of hard -- gotten the question, it's hard to say what you think the percentage is going to be It gets down to what the -- when you see China recovery on one hand and on the other hand, what the acquisitions look like because the acquisitions are going to be typically in the fire or the higher value industrial. So that revenue channel would just expect it to grow faster.\nGerry Sweeney : Understood. Yes. And I'm sorry, I didn't mean to imply that it was going to absolutely go away, but what -- I understand what you're saying. There's certainly --\nRoger Shannon: No, no, we didn't take it that way. It's just you opportunity to kind of make it clear how we think about disposables.\nJim Jenkins: And in a lot of ways, it's math, right? A lot of ways, it's math, Gerry, right? I mean as we continue to grow the higher value and we continue -- and we move -- continue -- we don't abandon in any way, safe perform the disposable market, but it's just as a percentage of our portfolio, we just sort of naturally get a little bit smaller, which I don't think\nGerry Sweeney : What -- and this -- little housekeeping more for modeling, but where do you want to get inventory levels down? I think all things being equal, right. You're going to grow -- you're continuing to grow, et cetera. But just curious as to what level\nRoger Shannon: Gerry, I'll take that one as well. And again, it's -- what way we'll need to kind of keep in mind is the caveat is that we are starting to do the purchase accounting on Pacific. We will bringing that in. So that will affect the inventory balance. Like -- kind of like Eagle, like our fire products, these are made to order. So there's not going to be significant, if any, finished goods that come along with Pacific. But of course, they have the raw materials and the work in process. That said, we have been very pleased at how we were able to reduce the -- call it, the -- what I've roughly circled up is the $58 million of inventory down to the $54 million level. As I think about that baseline, we would like to get another $2 million to $4 million out of that. It's like\nGerry Sweeney : So you're pretty close, yes.\nRoger Shannon: Yes. So now we still have -- it's a call we still have weekly. We have targets and programs underway, and it's still very much a high priority. And you can see the cash flow that's resulted in during the quarter.\nGerry Sweeney : Got it. I appreciate.\nA –Jim Jenkins: And I’ll just add on that just briefly, and that’s really a testament to Roger and his team, our COO, Helena and her team, they really have worked together on – and our sales team on forecasting and driving down that inventory number. And it’s become a significant priority for us. And under Roger’s leadership, we’re starting to see some real encouraging results.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to Jim for closing remarks.\nJim Jenkins : Thank you, operator. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We appreciate your continued interest in Lakeland. The global growth opportunities for our business are robust, and we look forward to building on the strong momentum Lakeland has built and sharing our successes with you in fiscal 2024. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

A reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is presented in our earnings release. At this time, I would like to introduce you to your host for this call, Lakeland Industries' Chief Executive Officer, Charlie Roberson. Mr. Roberson, the floor is yours.\nCharlie Roberson: Thank you, Holly. Good morning and thank you all for joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. Please note that we also have an earnings presentation posted on our IR page of our website at www.lakeland.com. Our second quarter results were very encouraging as we continued to see strong improvements in growth within our strategic product lines and markets. Lakeland delivered net sales of $33.1 million, up 17.3% year-over-year. This growth was driven both organically and by Eagle Technical Products, which contributed $3.4 million in revenue to our results this quarter. Notably, our fire service product category continued to see very significant growth with sales up 202%, compared to last year. This growth highlights the significant momentum like when it's building in our strategic product lines. And our goal to increase penetration in high value markets is producing positive results. In terms of profitability, our second quarter gross margin remained strong at 42.9% and importantly, our adjusted EBITDA grew by over 50% to $4.2 million in the quarter. Our Eagle Technical Products acquisition, which makes European Standard Fire Services gear, produced $900,000 of EBITDA in the quarter, helping elevate Lakeland's consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin to 12.6% this quarter, compared to 9% in the prior year. With regard to our key geographic markets, we saw a similar demand trends to the first fiscal quarter with strength in the U.S., Europe and Latin America. The U.S. benefited from continued strength in the oil and gas sector as refinery turnarounds continued well into Q2. Sales of turnout gear into the U.S. market were particularly strong, as mentioned earlier, largely due to the lead time advantage that we have over our competitors as a result of our proactive raw materials planning and manufacturing efficiency improvements. Our European sales strength continued as in Q1 meeting its performance targets and on the strength of the Eagle acquisition. Latin America also experienced strong fire service sales as a result of a large order delivered during the quarter. Despite those markets -- strengthened those markets, our Asian markets have been weaker-than-expected, primarily driven by continued weakness in China. China's economy struggled throughout our fiscal second quarter as exports were at multiyear lows and unemployment increased. China's distribution channels for PPE remain in an overstock position, as China works through its overstock of disposables, we are focusing on new end users to grow sales. Biopharma, semiconductors and batteries are among our targeted applications. As I already mentioned, Eagle contributed very positively to our results during the quarter. Our integration efforts continue to generate significant cross organizational synergies and we expect the Eagle platform to continue to enhance our adjusted EBITDA performance going forward. Eagles fire glove and particle blocking hood are progressing through the certification process and we will soon be including Eagle's designers in the development of our next generation NFPA turnout year. Additionally samples of Eagle products have been produced in Lakeland facilities and are being used to certify those facilities to make some of Eagle's products. Shifting gears to our capacity expansion initiatives, as we have previously communicated, we currently have an expansion project underway in Monterey, Mexico. Due to damage experienced during the second quarter at our newly leased Monterey site, we are currently evaluating our leasehold improvement build out schedule, which may impact our go live production timing. This evaluation is still underway. However, and importantly, we do not anticipate an adverse impact to our financial results and operations or our ability to meet our forecast. We believe our expectations going forward are not at risk. As it relates to our strategic priorities for the remainder of the fiscal year, we remain committed to driving revenue growth in key strategic markets, while executing a shift in our sales resources towards higher value products. Our shorter lead times are resulting in market gains in our fire service and woven products and we are utilizing our core strength in disposables and chemical garments, combined with our manufacturing flexibility to attract new end users to our container program and higher value strategic products. The fact that we can supply a full range of safety and PPE products from a single manufacturing facility is attractive to our large customers. We are leveraging our core products to help our customers, fill containers more easily, which increases the frequency with which they can order high value products by container. This improves customer's planning and reduces their freight and inventory costs. Moving forward, our leadership team is committed to identifying and maintaining a robust acquisition pipeline with opportunities that enhance Lakeland's strategic product portfolio and expand our geographic reach. Our M&A efforts are focused on finding opportunities like Eagle that meet our SSQ, small, strategic and quick acquisition strategy by identifying targets that are similar in size, highly strategic, and accretive to our bottom line in a short period of time. I’ll now pass the call to Roger to provide an overview of our financial results. Roger?\nRoger Shannon: Thanks, Charlie and good morning, everyone. Lakeland delivered sales of $33.1 million in the second quarter ended July 31, 2023. Domestic sales were $15.2 million or 46% of total revenues, and international sales were $17.9 million or 54% of total revenues. This compares with domestic sales of $11.9 million or 42% of the total and international sales of $16.3 million or 58% of the total in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As we noted in our earnings press release issued yesterday afternoon, we continue to see very strong growth within our fire service product category with sales, up 202% year-over-year. In terms of product mix for the quarter, fire service increased to 27% of sales for the quarter, up from a 11% in the same quarter of last fiscal year. As a reminder, our fire service product category was up 101% last quarter. Disposables continued to decrease as a percentage of Lakeland sales and represented 38% of total revenues, compared to 45% in the year ago period. This reflects the efforts we've made to shift our product mix toward higher value, higher margin and less commoditized products as we've discussed in prior calls. From a segment reporting standpoint, Lakeland saw strong sales growth in our U.S., European and Latin American markets. This growth was partially offset by softer Asian sales particularly in China, which is a continuation of what we saw last quarter. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 42.9% for the fiscal 2024 second quarter, as compared with 41.3% a year ago. As Charlie already highlighted, our gross margin improvement has been driven primarily by a deliberate sales focus on strategic products, supported by manufacturing efficiencies that have resulted in reduced lead times, as well as decreases in transportation costs. Lakeland reported operating profit of $3.7 million in Q2 ’24, as compared to $1.8 million in the second quarter of last year. As a result, operating margins were 11.3% in the second quarter, up from 6.4% in the second quarter of last year. Our operating profit benefited from improved gross margins resulting from our product mix shift and operating leverage resulting from higher revenue as previously discussed. This was partially offset by an increase of approximately $600,000 in operating expenses, compared to last year. The increase in OpEx is attributable to currency fluctuations, one-time expenses related to severance and startup costs, increased depreciation and amortization and OpEx related to the Eagle acquisition and year-over-year labor cost increase. Currency fluctuations, primarily related to the Chinese yuan and Argentinean Peso, totaled approximately $600,000. One-time expenses related to severance and start-up costs were approximately $500,000, and increased DNA and OpEx related to Eagle totaled approximately $300,000. These increases were partially offset by a reduction of $700,000 in the earnout consideration accrual related to the Eagle acquisition, which was recorded as a reduction in operating expenses. Lakeland delivered net income of $2.5 million or $0.33 per basic share and $0.32 per diluted share during the quarter. This compares to a net loss of $900,000 or $0.11 for basic and diluted share in the prior year period. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.2 million in Q2 ‘24, compared to $2.5 million in second quarter ‘23. Lakeland delivered operating cash flow during the quarter of approximately $200,000. Our robust balance sheet provides us with significant flexibility as we continue to explore acquisition opportunities, organic growth investments and returning capital to our shareholders. Lakeland ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $24.3 million, compared to our FY ’23 year ended cash balance of $24.6 million. The company continued to have no debt at the end of the quarter and has up to $25 million available from bank credit facilities. Capital expenditures for the three months ended July 31st 2023 were $400,000. For the full fiscal year, we now expect capital expenditures to be approximately $2 million, down from our previous estimate of $3 million as we replace existing equipment in the normal course of operations and pause the Monterey expansion to assess the damage to our leased building as Charlie previously discussed. We expect to fund capital expenditures from our cash flow from operations. Inventories declined slightly quarter-over-quarter from $57.9 million to $57.4 million at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Raw materials inventory increased by [$990,000] (ph), while finished goods inventories decreased by approximately $360,000. The increase in raw material inventory is driven by growth in our higher value strategic products as we continue to strategically position ourselves to take market share from competitors. More specifically much of our success in these end markets can be attributed to having more favorable lead times versus our competition and having raw materials on hand is key to the strategy. While the overall decrease in inventory during the quarter was minimal, we remain committed to accelerating the reduction of our finished goods inventory this year as previously communicated. We are aggressively pursuing additional sales channels, marketing programs and price deviations on excess inventory to drive these reductions. We expect these efforts to accelerate in the second-half of this fiscal year. With that overview I’d now like to turn the call back over to the operator to open up for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question for today is coming from Gerry Sweeney at Roth Capital.\nGerry Sweeney: Good morning, Roger and Charlie. Thanks for taking my call.\nCharlie Roberson: Please, Jerry.\nGerry Sweeney: I want to start the high value products and even a little bit on the fire products and wovens. But to start off, obviously, you're getting some great momentum there. Can you give a little bit more explanation? Is this obviously you talked about lead times and raw materials and that giving you advantage. But what can you do to keep this momentum going, or you can accelerate it to some degree in terms of maybe sales resources or things along those lines? Or are we looking at, sort of, a steady state and you are in good shape from the momentum standpoint?\nCharlie Roberson: Well, let me start by saying this market differs from our core markets and disposable and chemical in that -- it's got its own distribution channels. And a number of those distributors are exclusive to a specific manufacturer of turnout gear, right? And this is true, not just in North America, but globally as well. And what has happened is our operations, people, planning and sales have done a very good job. Over the last three quarters of managing raw materials availability, that's kind of the long pole in the tent for lead time in [Technical Difficulty] market. As a matter of fact, they've done an excellent job. Our lead times will continue to be below our competition even though the early lead times are coming down. And as a result of that, competitors lead times have been extended now for over a year in some cases. And a number of large distributors that were exclusive to other competitors are taking Lakeland product now. There -- that's one of the nice things about lead time reduction is it becomes a weapon. As long as you have a product that is a quality product, which we had before, they just wouldn't break the relationship even if it was a great product. Now they have reason to do that, and we have our foot in the door. As far as maintaining the lead time, I've never seen the lead times that we have in that market right now delivered by anybody. I know that our operations, planning and salespeople are committed to regular cross-functional meetings to continue to replicate the planning that they've done in that market. And the sales team is continuing to pursue additional opportunities that are out there. I think that the main avenue for growth, we maintain what we've done, we will continue to see growth in U.S. But, expanding this and replicating it with Eagle Internationally will be a very interesting, well, a great opportunity for us.\nRoger Shannon: Hey Gerry…\nGerry Sweeney: On Eagle, yes sorry go ahead. Sorry about that.\nRoger Shannon: Yes, we just have briefly that early referenced Eagle and no that really was the strategic rationale behind that acquisition. And also the opportunity that we've identified within fire service, and as we've talked about on previous calls, we see this -- we see a significant addressable market, but a market that is very fragmented. So although we are seeing advantages versus the major competitors on lead time. There's -- the major competitors still make up a fairly small part of the overall addressable market. So we see globally the opportunity to increase our market share and that really was the strategic rationale, we're pleased to see execution on that. We do expect that to continue and just kind of taking Eagle as an example, it’s a tremendous product that we acquired with the European standard that we're able to add to our portfolio, which is the NFPA standard, put in -- that into our global sales distribution channel, and kind of, increasing that opportunity around the world. And we've found products within the Eagle portfolio, Charlie mentioned, gloves and particulate hoods, that we're running through, qualification and certification now. So I think that kind of validates that acquisition strategy. And like Charlie and I mentioned, we have a -- we believe a robust acquisition pipeline where we're looking to identify similar opportunities and grow that market.\nGerry Sweeney: Yes. Actually, the Eagle acquisition was what I wanted to ask next about. On the last call, you really talked about, I think, ramping up some of the cross-selling or some of the sales on the Eagle Product and vice versa. And I think into Latin America, South America, there was an opportunity. I'm just curious as to how that's going and if you could touch upon that?\nCharlie Roberson: We have some of the Eagle products already being offered in South America through Eagle's current manufacturing channel. Those opportunities should really accelerate once we have certification of our own facilities to make those products. We're also getting some traction in Europe with Eagle products. And we're kind of still in our infancy in North America, as far as bringing in the gloves and the hoods, but that is moving forward. And we should see results from that within the next six to 12 months.\nGerry Sweeney: Got it. So the North America hoods, gloves, I mean, that's still on yet to come, which is a positive.\nCharlie Roberson: As I mentioned it in the call, another important part, while it's not quick cross-selling, but the involvement of Eagles designers and the development of our next generation NFPA a year, that's North American gear. So we are going to have an entirely different perspective on our next gen gear. That is a huge synergy for us.\nRoger Shannon: Hey Gerry, just a specific example, during the past quarter, we had a sales conference sales trading with Eagle products and Eagle personnel for our Latin American team in country. So that was very well received.\nGerry Sweeney: Got it. And then final question, acquisitions, you had the SSQ strategy. And you actually just touched upon the Eagle. Obviously, you have a global distribution footprint. I'm curious as to what that acquisition pipeline looks like? And I would suspect it's a little bit more maybe gear or product-driven over maybe geographic expansion. Could you touch upon that?\nCharlie Roberson: You are correct that it is more product focus. We do have companies that are -- their primary -- our primary interest might be geographic. We have a healthy pipeline, not to quantify, but there are plenty of opportunities out there in the Eagle size range, particularly the fire market is such a stratified fragmented market globally that they're actually more manufacturers there, I think, in the Eagle size range than there are [Indiscernible]. I mean, our estimation is that the largest player globally in the market only has a 10% market share. The next one after that's down to five, so that gives you some idea of how fragmented it is. So it is a market that is right before that repeating that the Eagle process. Roger, do you want to add to that?\nRoger Shannon: Gosh, that's exactly right. And like I mentioned in the call, you know, we currently have no debt. We, you know, we saw the contribution that Eagle made to [Multiple Speakers] and in EBITDA, so that's also supportive of being able to build on that strategy.\nGerry Sweeney: How much competitive advantage in the maybe the fire and turnout gear? Obviously, I think you talked about the hood and gloves for Eagle, but if you start building out additional products, how much advantage does that give you versus some of that stratified or the China fire market?\nCharlie Roberson: Good question, Gerry. One of the issues that the end users deal with is selection of the garment and what certification to go with. Currently, there's only two other, well, there are a number of people trying, but there's only two other companies that are actually offering, European certified gear in North American certified gear globally. Having that global reach and the ability to offer both product lines and explain the features and benefits of both is a tremendous service to the end users. There is confusion, for instance, in EMEA, there's a lot of use of NFPA gear, but CE is also coming in. So it's mixed and people don't necessarily understand the trade-offs they are making. The differences in pricing of the gears as much as 30% or 40%. So for the savings in CE, what are you giving up, it’s a tremendous amount of credibility, within individual markets and the ability to supply from a global manufacturing base makes us cost competitive. There are a lot of advantages. The number of people that are trying to do it, you know, the problem is they don't have the global footprint that Lakeland has to support it. We already have that, you know, so the products are what we're looking for.\nRoger Shannon: Yes. What I would add to that and this -- I think this is probably intuitive as well. We talked about, Charlie talked about, getting additional distribution channels due to our lead times, you know, having that full suite of products, you know, both NFPA and CE and then being able to be head to toe, just kind of strengthens that position with distributors. And we've also seen, and we expect to continue to see advantages in RFPs, because these smaller to medium size, customers it certainly would favor someone who's able to deliver the full ensemble.\nGerry Sweeney: Got you. Super helpful. I appreciate it. I'll jump back in queue. Thanks. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question for today is coming from George Melas at MKH Management.\nGeorge Melas: Good morning, Charlie and Roger. Congratulations, looks like a great quarter. Quick question on operating leverage seems like you had really nice leverage this quarter and margin -- your breakdown of the OpEx and the OpEx increase was quite interesting, because it seems like there's a lot of -- there was sort of a lot of one-time expenses. Of course, there was a reduction in the year or not as well, but it seems like you're maintaining with control over OpEx? Do you see that continuing to the future? Or do you feel like you're going to have to, sort of, spend more money as you try to expand share?\nRoger Shannon: Great question, George, and thank you for the question. We've alluded to having operating leverage in previous conversations in the past, including with you, I recall fairly recently. It was very good to see that be the case. And like you said, a large -- a significant amount of the OpEx we saw in the quarter was either one-time or currency related and we are obviously like any company with taking measures to manage the currency risk. But we do believe we have operating leverage. We think our platform is currently scaled well to be able to manage this growth. So it was very nice to see that. And the other thing that I would add is we're going to continue to put an even sharper focus on OpEx and OpEx reduction. And as I'm sure you've heard Charlie and me say before, we're very intently focused on free cash flow, and we're looking to make improvements in that across the company and we'll continue to focus on those items and hopefully drive additional efficiencies.\nGeorge Melas: Okay, great. That's good to hear. And maybe can you tell us a little something on the issues with the monetary clients. I don't know how much you can say, but I don't know if just sort of explain a little bit what happened, and where you are, where you stand? And what are the options that you you're considering?\nCharlie Roberson: Yes. George, we're very early in this process. As we said, there's not much that we can add because quite frankly, we were still investigating and have a lot of questions ourselves that we're still looking to answer. Suffice it, I think the best thing I can say about it is, while we are delayed and we are on pause, we don't see an impact to future earnings or our operations or our ability to meet our forecast. That was our first concern. And we're -- we believe that we have that handled. There was a startup time associated with that business anyway. So it's not an immediate impact to our projections. But right now, unfortunately, we just, you know, we're waiting on some engineering reports. And once we have those, we'll know more. But at this point, there's not much else we can share.\nGeorge Melas: [Indiscernible] Thank you.\nCharlie Roberson: Thank you, George.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. And I will now turn the call over to Charlie for closing remarks.\nCharlie Roberson: Thank you, Holly, and thank you all for joining us on today's call. I'd like -- I would also like to thank our employees for their commitment and hard work to execute on our strategic vision, which help drive strong results in the fiscal second quarter. We look forward to capturing the large opportunity ahead of us and building on the momentum we have achieved so far this year. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

And the floor will be opened for your questions and comments following the presentation. During today's call, we may make statements relating to our goals and objectives for future operations, financial and business trends, business prospects and management's expectations for future performance that constitute forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Any such forward-looking statements reflect management's expectations based upon currently available information and are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks and uncertainties that are more fully described in our SEC filings. Our actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or developments after the date of this call. During today's call, we will discuss financial measures derived from our financial statements that are not determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, including EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. A reconciliation of each of the non-GAAP measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measure is presented in our earnings release. At this time, I would like to introduce you to your host for this call, Lakeland Industries' Chief Executive Officer, Charlie Roberson. Mr. Roberson, the floor is yours.\nCharlie Roberson: Thank you, Jenny. Good morning and thank you all for joining. I'd like to begin by pointing out that in addition to the press release, yesterday, we also posted a Q1 investor deck on the Investors Section of our website, and while we will not speak directly to it on this call, we do invite you to access it and follow along. We're pleased with our fiscal first quarter results as Lakeland delivered net sales of $28.7 million, up 5.2% year-over-year, while our net sales for the quarter included $2 million from our acquisition of Eagle Technical Products this past December, Lakeland also delivered organic growth in targeted geographic markets and product lines. Of note, our fire and flame resistant, arc resistant performance product category saw a significant year-over-year growth of 103% and 55% respectively. In terms of profitability, our first quarter gross margin of 43.4% was above our long-term target of 40%, and as Roger will cover in more detail, benefited from multiple dedicated actions from our team members. In regard to our geographic markets, North American industrial demand continues to hold strong, and is performing in line with our expectations. Oil and gas turnaround activity, which was significantly curtailed during COVID, is returning at a measured pace over a prolonged period, partially due to ongoing labor availability constraints. We anticipate labor constraints continuing throughout the remainder of the year and are expecting an extended strong fall turnaround season. Going forward, we will continue to monitor global oil market developments such as the recent production cuts announced by OPEC+, and I would characterize our outlook for the year as cautiously optimistic given the shifting macroeconomic backdrop. While our North American markets are performing in line with our targets. Our Asian markets have been weaker than expected, driven almost entirely by China. China's departure from a zero tolerance COVID-19 policy in late December significantly curtailed government demand for testing related PPE, including disposable [Indiscernible]. Industrial economic activity has been very slow to recover as foreign customers seek to reduce dependence on China and their supply chains, and as China experiences a subsequent outbreak of the XBB variant of the COVID-19 virus. In addition to depressed industrial activity, China is experiencing post-pandemic excess inventory in its distribution channels. We anticipated an excess inventory condition would likely occur in China, but believed it would not be as severe as in the U.S. or Europe due to significantly shorter lead times within China. As a result of these factors, we anticipate China's economic recovery will remain slower than our initial projections throughout the course of the year. Europe continues to outperform our expectations this year, but admittedly, this is because our forecast hit it into the fiscal year was quite cautious given some of the macro, geopolitical and energy security or supply related issues that overhang this region. So we do not -- we do expect Europe to continue to progress this year at a pace ahead of our original expectations even though industrial activity in general remains muted. Turning to other important markets globally, India and Mexico are tracking slightly behind our projections for the first quarter, although we believe activity will ultimately improve and come in line with our projections for the year. Latin America is performing ahead of forecast right now and is expected to maintain this performance for the remainder of the fiscal year. In terms of our focus on high value products, we're seeing year-over-year success with our fire and flame-resistant, arc-resistant products in North America. Our sales team has been successful in adding new distributors, expanding geographic reach and have begun displacing our competitors as key or primary suppliers with a number of existing and new distributors, resulting in 29% organic revenue growth for fire products and 55% organic growth within the FR/AR products line. Lakeland is gaining traction in these markets, and we believe that our focus on these product lines is yielding success. Shifting gears to Eagle. Our integration efforts are tracking firmly on schedule and we are continuing to accelerate synergy capture between organizations. This is evident in our fire business as Eagle is successfully promoting sales of NFPA certified gear into their existing sales channels. Our legacy team is also in the process of incorporating Eagle CE hoods into our NFPA markets and promoting Eagle CE turnout gear into our international markets. Our efforts to integrate Eagle Products into Lakeland's geographic markets are initially focused on Latin America and Mexico and will be followed by India and Southeast Asia. To this end, Lakeland's leadership team and Eagle personnel will be meeting with our Latin America -- American and Mexico sales teams to train them on Eagle products later this month. Eagle will have a chance to learn firsthand about the South American firefighting market. On the expansion front, we're pleased with the progress we are making at our new Monterrey, Mexico facility, which we expect to be complete by the fiscal third quarter of this year. As we have previously communicated, this manufacturing plant will greatly benefit our efforts to gain market share in higher value strategic end markets, most notably fire, flame-resistant, arc-resistant, high performance for electrical utilities and chemical by providing short run capability and additional capacity to service our growing high value product sales. As we look to the balance of our current fiscal year, we anticipate little change in our existing business environment. We believe that China will remain weak with little in the way of economic recovery. India and Mexico were slightly behind projections as of the end of Q1, but are recoverable and we believe they will meet revenue projections for the year. North America is currently running at forecast sales pace and is expected to continue to do so through the remainder of the year. Europe and Latin America are both running ahead of their projections through the first quarter and do not show any signs of weakening. In the aggregate, we believe based on current market information and the strength that we are seeing in fire and industrial FR markets, that we will attain our goal of mid to high-single-digit growth this year. Overall we remain very positive on the position we are generating for ourselves within the market and we expect to deliver continued revenue growth in our core markets, as well as profitability levels in line with the company's three-year to five-year targets. We will accomplish this through geographic targeting of specific products, turnout gear, flame-resistant, arc-resistant, high performance and chemical suits, and through pricing deviations and disposables to select end user accounts where we believe we can leverage the business to capture strategic sales currently held by our competitors. I'll now pass the call to Roger to provide an overview of our financial results. Roger?\nRoger Shannon: Thanks, Charlie, and good morning everyone. Lakeland delivered sales $28.7 million in the first quarter. Domestic sales were $12.3 million or 43% of total revenues and international sales were $16.4 million or 57% of total revenues. This compares with domestic sales of $11.2 million or 41% of the total, and international sales of $16.1 million or 59% of the total in first quarter of fiscal 2023. In terms of product mix for the quarter, disposables continued to decrease as a percentage of Lakeland sales and represented 43% of total revenues, compared to 53% in the year ago quarter. This again reflects the efforts we've made to shift our product mix toward higher value, higher margin and less commoditized non-disposable products as we've discussed in prior calls. Additionally as we noted in our earnings press release issued yesterday afternoon, we saw strong growth within our fire product category with sales up 103% year-over-year. From a geographic standpoint, Lakeland saw strong sales growth in our U.S, Canada and European markets. However, this growth was partially offset by soft Asian sales particularly in China and India. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 43.4% for fiscal 2024 first quarter, as compared to 40.5% a year ago. As Charlie already highlighted, the strong improvement in our gross margin performance was driven by deliberate sales focus on higher value products, as well as improved finished goods, material costs, and lower manufacturing expenses. Compared to the prior quarter, our gross margin percentage increased 6 percentage points, up from 37.4%, due to improved product mix. The absence of excess freight expense write-offs that we had in Q4, profit in Q1 ending inventory and a positive Q1 inventory reserve adjustment. Lakeland reported operating profit of $1.9 million in Q1 2024, as compared to $1.4 million in the first quarter last year. As a result, operating margins were 6.8% in the first quarter, up from 5.3% for the first quarter of last year. Our operating profit benefited from the improved gross margins and higher revenue as previously discussed, partially offset by an increase of $900,000 in operating expenses in Q1 of 2024. The increase in operating expenses is attributable to increases in severance expenses and currency fluctuations. Travel and trade show expenses and higher professional fees. Currency fluctuations, primarily related to the Argentinian peso, which totaled approximately $300,000 negatively affected operating profit. Lakeland delivered net income of $1.3 million or $0.18 per basic and diluted share during the quarter. This compares to $1.1 million or $0.15 per basic share and $0.14 per diluted share in the prior period. EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $2.4 million, compared to $1.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.8 million in Q1 2024, compared to $2.3 million in Q1 of ‘23. Moving to the balance sheet. Lakeland ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of approximately $26 million, an increase of $1.4 million, compared to our fiscal year 2023 year-end cash balance of $24.6 million, due primarily to cash provided by operating activities of $3.7 million for the three months ended April 30, 2023. The company continued to have no debt at the end of the quarter and has up to $25 million available from bank credit facilities. Capital expenditures for the three months ended April 30, 2023 were $700,000 and were related to capital equipment for the company's new manufacturing facility in Monterrey and Mexico that is scheduled to open in the second-half of the current year, as Charlie previously mentioned. As a reminder, we anticipate fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately $3 billion, as we complete the new manufacturing facility in Monterey, Mexico and replace existing equipment in the normal course of operation. We expect to fund the capital expenditures from our cash flow from operations. The company purchased $300,000 of common stock under its repurchase program during the quarter, leaving approximately $5.1 million remaining under the current authorization. Lakeland was also pleased to pay its initial quarterly dividend $0.03 per share to stockholders during the quarter. Our inventories declined slightly quarter-over-quarter from $58.2 million at January 31, 2023 to $57.9 million at the end of Q1 ‘24. Raw materials inventory increased by approximately $400,000, while finished goods inventories decreased by approximately $500,000. Our increase in raw material inventory is driven by increases in our higher value strategic products. Moving forward, we remain committed to accelerating the reduction of our finished goods inventory this year as previously communicated and will continue to explore various price deviations on additional product styles. With that overview, I'd like to now turn the call over to the operator to open for questions-and-answers.\nOperator: Thank you very much. At this time we are opening the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question is coming from Alex Fuhrman of Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Alex, your line is live.\nAlex Fuhrman: Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question and congratulations on a really nice quarter. We'd love to talk about gross margin and what could expect to see for the rest of this year and heading into next year, it seems like you, you know, very quickly hit your longer term profitability target. Was there a mix shift involved in getting there so quickly? We'd love to just hear your broad thoughts on what we can expect to see over the next few quarters and years?\nRoger Shannon: Hey, good morning, Alex. This is Roger. No, thank you for the question and thank you for the comments. We work obviously pleased with the quarter. We did see a very nice increase over Q4, as well as year-over-year. The bulk of that increase was driven by product mix, obviously, with a slight increase in revenue driving gross profit, but the mix driving gross margin as we talked about with the focus on the higher value strategic product line with Inspire and FR/AR. The other thing, as you probably remember, compared to last quarter, particularly we had about 200 basis point decrease or write-off in excess freight cost in Q4, and we did a comprehensive inventory costing analysis, cost roll in Q4, can clean that up from some of the higher freight costs during the COVID period. The other thing that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did have a slight adjustment into positive from profit and ending inventory in an inventory reserve, of course, we'll have those every quarter. They could go either way, but this quarter they were a positive. So longer term, course over the course of the remainder of the year, which we certainly are not guiding to count on those the quarterly adjustments in any inventory like we just said, but that we are on track for that 40% plus gross margin that we've indicated.\nCharlie Roberson: Hi, Alex, it's Charlie. Also like to point out the investor deck that we did for Q1 actually does contain a bridge showing the margin improvement in quarter-to-quarter.\nAlex Fuhrman: Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys. And then you mentioned in your remarks and in release last night that you're seeing a lot of good response to the higher value products that you've been focusing more on. Obviously, that sounds like that's having a positive impact on gross margin as well. Can you give us a sense of how much of your business today is what you would call those higher value products? And where you see that going over the next few years?\nCharlie Roberson: Yes. Alex, we're already seeing a shift to that, it's -- we look at that in more general terms within our product categories, we have sales even of the same product that may, in one case, may be strategic or higher value where another is not. We tried -- we're trying to get that message across in our press -- in the press release, we talked about how we define high value, it’s an end user definition, and it really goes to the amount of effort and consultation that they put into the purchasing decision. Now having said that, disposables with the exception of cleanroom is we just generally consider entirely commodity or not high value. And we've seen a year-over-year shift.\nRoger Shannon: Full-year.\nCharlie Roberson: A full-year shift in our disposables, a decline of 6% that has moved largely into the fire and the FR/AR wovens categories, okay? So as we move forward in future years, I expect to see that trend continue, maybe not at a 6% a year pace. But as we keep going, I think that eventually, we will see our strategic items grow to where they're a 60%-plus, maybe even as high as 65% of our total revenue.\nRoger Shannon: And Alex, I would again encourage you and the listeners to kind of refer to a couple of slides we have in the Q1 investor presentation that we posted, you will see. If you look at it, it's probably referred to as you look at the full-year 2023 or the year that we just finished revenue about 49% of that was from disposables for Q1 of 2024 that was 43%. So as Charlie mentioned, it's a 6 point decrease, compared to the full-year of last year. The chemical remains, kind of, consistent at around 20% and where we did see the pickup was in the FR/AR and particularly the fire. So Eagle, of course, contributed, having the first full quarter performance or results from Eagle, but also as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're seeing organic growth in fire. Yes.\nCharlie Roberson: Yes. And Alex, the other part of that question is in the higher value products is where we have value for product development. We've got things that are in the middle there that represent an opportunity to grow those markets, as well as to take market share from our competitors.\nAlex Fuhrman: Great. That's really helpful guys. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you very much. Well, we don't appear to have any further questions in the queue. I'm now going to hand back over to the management team for any closing remarks.\nCharlie Roberson: Thank you, Jenny. Thank you all for joining us on today's call. We look forward to building on our momentum, and sharing our successes within this year. Thank you and have a good day.\nOperator: Thank you, everybody. This does conclude today's conference call. You may disconnect your phone lines at this time and have a wonderful day. Thank you for your participation."
