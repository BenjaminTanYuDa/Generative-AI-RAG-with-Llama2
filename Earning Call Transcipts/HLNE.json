Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Tuesday, February 6, 2024. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Oh, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\nJohn Oh: Thank you, Joanna. Good morning, and welcome to the Hamilton Lane Q3 fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today, I will be joined by Erik Hirsch, Co-CEO; Juan Delgado, Co-CEO; and Jeff Armbrister, CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation which are available on our website. Before we discuss the quarter's results, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial position, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance, and business. These forward-looking statements do not guarantee future events or performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. For a discussion of these risks, please review the cautionary statements and risk factors included in the Hamilton Lane fiscal 2023 10-K and subsequent reports we file with the SEC. These forward-looking statements are made only as of today, and except as required, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of them. We will also be referring to non-GAAP measures that we view as important in assessing the performance of our business. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in the earnings presentation materials made available on the Shareholders section of the Hamilton Lane website. Our detailed financial results will be made available when our 10-Q is filed. Please note, nothing on this call represents an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase interest in any of Hamilton Lane's products. Beginning with the financial highlights. Year-to-date, our management and advisory fee revenue grew by 19%, while our fee-related earnings grew by 16% versus the prior-year period. This translated into GAAP EPS of $2.43 based on $92 million of GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $2.54 based on $137 million of adjusted net income. We have also declared a dividend of $0.445 per share this quarter, which keeps us on track for the 11% increase over last fiscal year, equating to the targeted $1.78 per share for fiscal year 2024. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Erik.\nErik Hirsch: Hello, everyone, and thank you, John. This is officially our first earnings call post the management transition on January 1st. It now sees me and my partner, Juan Delgado, as co-CEOs of this firm. It has been a strong start to the year as you will hear shortly, but we wanted to begin by providing you an opportunity to hear directly from Juan on his background and prior roles at Hamilton Lane. With Juan living in Hong Kong, he will not be joining these calls with regularity, but as we begin, we thought it important to provide an introduction. And so, with that, I turn it over to Juan.\nJuan Delgado: Thank you, Erik, and hello, everyone. I'd like to simply begin by saying that I'm extremely excited about this next chapter. Erik and I have been friends and partners for over 19 years and I really look forward to continuing our partnership and continuing the growth and the expansion of this business. As a bit of background, I joined Hamilton Lane in 2005 to help build out our presence in London. Prior to joining, I was an Investment Manager at Baring Private Equity Partners where I focused on mid-market investing throughout Europe. I have my B.A. and Ph.D. from Universidad Complutense de Madrid in Spain, and I was a lecturer and Fulbright Scholar Stanford University. In joining Hamilton Lane, I have worn many hats. First, I was working to build out our investment and sales presence in Europe and the Middle East. I was responsible for hiring the leadership team in place today in EMEA and open our Tel Aviv office. I have also managed the opening of our first Asian offices in Hong Kong and Tokyo in 2009. As our Asia business grew, I relocated to Hong Kong with my young family of three in 2011, and since then, I have served as Head of APAC, Head of International, and overseeing the expansion and the opening of several offices, including Seoul, Singapore, Sydney, and Shanghai. In June 2019, I took on the title of Vice Chairman for Hamilton Lane. Today, I serve on several of our investment committees. And as of January 1st, I joined the Board of HLNE. As we highlighted in our initial announcement, I will be overseeing our global clients and business development teams from Hong Kong and have joined oversight with Erik of the global investment teams. During these 19-plus years at Hamilton Lane, I've had the privilege of witnessing growth of our non-US business. Our model of having localized teams that embrace the culture and speak their native language has allowed us to deliver best-in-class client service and strong investment results. We utilize a truly global one-team approach with really close collaboration and access to all the teams and resources Hamilton Lane brings to bear. We've become a global leader in private markets with this strategy, and I look forward to working alongside Erik in furthering in our leadership. Before I conclude, I want to mention that I am currently en route traveling to see clients and prospects as I'm doing quite often, and therefore, I will excuse myself from the live Q&A. And with that, I will now pass it back to Erik.\nErik Hirsch: Thank you, Juan, and safe travels. Coming off of a strong calendar 2023, we are excited about 2024. The business has tremendous momentum and the employee base is excited about what is to come. Part of that excitement stems from our culture, and I am very proud to announce that once again, Hamilton Lane has been named a Best Place to Work in Money Management by Pensions & Investments for the 12th consecutive year. Even more impressive is the fact that we are only one of five firms who have been bestowed this distinction every single year since the awards creation. Some firms say culture doesn't matter and that it is all about results. Those firms tend not to have healthy cultures. We think a great culture aids in creating great results. Be good and do good. Create a strong culture of excellence and collaboration, and use that to deliver for your clients and partners. Let's move on to the results for the quarter. I'll start with our total asset footprint, which we define as the sum of our AUM and AUA. This stood at $903 billion and represents a 9% increase to our footprint year-over-year and highlights our continued and steady growth as a firm. AUM stood at $120 billion at quarter-end and grew $12 billion, or 12%. The growth came from both our specialized funds and customized separate accounts. AUA was up $59 billion, or 8% year-over-year, primarily the result of the addition of reporting and advisory mandates. As a reminder, AUA can fluctuate for a variety of reasons, but the revenue associated with AUA does not necessarily move in lockstep with those changes. Turning now to fee-earning AUM, which continues to be the largest driver of management fees. We continue to generate strong growth in both our customized separate accounts and specialized funds. Our total fee-earning AUM stood at $63.1 billion and grew $8.2 billion, or 15% relative to the prior-year period. Taken separately, $3.8 billion of net fee-earning AUM came from our customized separate accounts, and over the same time period, $4.4 billion came from our specialized funds. Our blended fee rate across the platform also continues to increase. This stems from the continuing shift in the mix of our fee-earning AUM towards higher fee rate specialized funds, most notably, our Evergreen product, where growth remains strong. Moving now to additional detail on our customized separate accounts. Fee-earning AUM here stood at $36.9 billion, growing 12% over the past 12 months. We continue to see the growth coming across type, mandate size, and geographic location of the clients. Over the last 12 months, more than 80% of the gross inflows into customized separate accounts came from our existing client base. While this clearly speaks to the power of the recurring relationship model, it also tells you that with the remainder of flows, despite a very large installed base, coming from new relationships, that the market continues to offer up plenty of new opportunities. Moving to our specialized funds. Momentum here also continues to be strong. Fee-earning AUM here stood at $26.2 billion at quarter-end. Over the past 12 months, we've achieved positive net inflows of $4.4 billion, representing an increase of 20% relative to the prior-year period. This growth stemmed from additional closes from our funds currently in market, robust investment activity, and continued expansion of our Evergreen platform. Going into some detail around the drivers of Specialized Fund flows during the quarter's growth, I'll begin with our secondary fund that is currently in market. During the quarter, we closed on over $485 million of LP commitments, and that generated $6.1 million of retro fees. This brings the total now raised to over $3.5 billion. As a quick reminder, we raised $3.9 billion for our prior secondary fund and we are on target to meaningfully surpass the prior fund size with this current fund. We expect to hold the final close for these funds over the coming weeks. We continue to be encouraged with the momentum heading into the final stages, and historically, our final closes have tended to be our largest and we expect that pattern to hold true here. Moving on to our Strategic Opportunities Fund, which is our annual direct credit fund targeting the institutional LP. As a refresher, this series of funds is effectively always in market as we raise and deploy the capital with short investment periods and charge management fees on invested capital. We are currently in market with our eight series, and since our last update, we've closed on an additional $105 million of LP commitments. This brings the total raise for this current series to nearly $675 million. Like many of our products, we've been granted an extension on the final close of the series to allow for additional time for investors to close into this fund. We expect to hold the final close in the coming weeks. Again, I'd like to highlight that our direct credit platform has continued to experience strong growth over the past few years, with this annual institutional series now being complemented with other sleeves of credit-focused capital, including various separate accounts and our Evergreen funds. Today, credit represents 15% of our total AUM and we continue to see opportunity to scale. Let's now turn to our Evergreen funds. As of December 31st, 2023, total AUM across our three offerings stood at $5.7 billion, growing 76% since the beginning of the calendar 2023. This growth was driven by solid investment performance, which in turn drove NAV growth along with continued strong net inflows. For calendar 2023, we averaged net inflows of $160 million per month with our US private market offering making up strong progress with our two wirehouse relationships. In less than a year of being on those platforms, we've received more than $615 million of net inflows. Our Evergreen complex continues to thrive despite an increasingly competitive marketplace. We've emerged as a real leader in this channel and we are confident that this is only the beginning of our exciting journey. We are eager to grow our footprint in this space through additional product offerings and expansion of our distribution partnerships. Let's move now to some announcements around our most recent technology partnerships. As you'll hear, we continue to seek out partners who share in our vision of driving increased access to the private markets for the non-institutional investor. We firmly believe that managers need to meet the retail investor where they are, and the most efficient way to accomplish that is through technology. With that, let's start with an update on Helix, which we announced on a prior call and is our newest joint venture with one of our strategic partners, TIFIN. As a reminder, Helix is the first of its kind generative AI assistant technology solely focused on the private markets. It is designed for future integration within wealth platforms and digital marketplaces used by advisors and investors seeking allocation to the private markets. Helix combines TIFIN's technological expertise with Hamilton Lane's proprietary database and market analysis to provide data-centric information around private markets benchmarking, forecasting, and diligence for financial advisors. On December 7th, Helix announced that it has successfully completed its seed funding round led by FINTOP Capital. Hamilton Lane and FINTOP have developed a successful track record of partnering and investing in leading private markets-focused companies, including DealCloud, Hazeltree, and Cobalt. We are thrilled to partner with FINTOP Capital once again, who shares our common goal of driving technological innovation and broadening access within the private markets. Next, on January 10th, we announced our newest strategic partnership alongside Brevan Howard with Libre. Libre is a platform that connects high-net-worth investors with alternative asset managers and wealth advisors, offering them access to the global alternatives market. Libre will leverage tokenization and smart contracts that will provide asset managers with seamless direct connectivity to the growing high-net-worth channel. Libre makes access for distributors simple through API connectivity. This provides integration into Libre's comprehensive suite of wealth management services, data, and infrastructure. Libre is scheduled to go live during the first quarter of 2024, and has already partnered with several global distributors. We are excited to be a strategic partner to Libre and one of the first to go live with them and we look forward to providing you with future updates on this exciting journey. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to cover the financials.\nJeff Armbrister: Thank you, Erik, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal year-to-date, we achieved strong growth in our business with management and advisory fees up 19% versus the prior-year period. Our specialized funds revenue increased by $41 million, or 28% compared to the prior-year period. This was driven primarily by a $2.2 billion increase to fee-earning AUM in our Evergreen platform in the last 12 months and over $3.5 billion raised since inception in our latest secondary fund. Retro fees for the fiscal year-to-date included $12.8 million from our secondary fund in market versus $2.4 million from our direct equity fund in the prior-year period. As a reminder, investors that come into later closes during a fundraise pay retroactive fees dating back to the fund's first close. We expect to generate additional retro fees as we hold the final closes for Secondary Fund VI. Moving on to customized separate accounts. Revenue increased $9 million, or 11% compared to the prior-year period due to the addition of several new accounts, re-ups from existing clients, and continued investment activity. Revenue from our advisory, reporting, and other offerings decreased by $2 million compared to the prior-year period due primarily to the sale of the 361 Capital assets, partially offset by increases in revenue coming from our technology solutions. Lastly, the final component of our revenue is incentive fees. Year-to-date, incentive fees totaled $49 million and are down 65% relative to the prior-year period. Recall, that last fiscal year, we generated a large amount of incentive fees due to the catch-up period that several of our carry-eligible vehicles were in. Let me now turn to some additional detail on our unrealized carry balance. The balance is up 18% from the prior-year period, while having recognized $66 million of incentive fees during the last 12 months. The unrealized carry balance now stands at approximately $1.1 billion. Moving to expenses. Year-to-date, total expenses decreased $10 million compared with the prior-year period. Total compensation and benefits decreased by $18 million, driven primarily by lower compensation associated with the decreased amount of incentive fees. G&A increased $9 million, driven primarily by revenue-related expenses, which are the third-party commissions related to our US Evergreen product being offered on wirehouses that we've discussed on prior calls. I'd like to remind you that the flows that come in through the wirehouse channel have an associated upfront fee from the dollars raised there. That payment is made and applied to the total amount when those dollars close into the fund. However, the corresponding management fees we earn from those same dollars come in over the course of a year for as long as the client is invested in the fund. This creates a timing mismatch between the cost of bringing those dollars on and the revenue associated with those flows. This causes our G&A to increase with the eventual offsetting revenue to come in during the subsequent quarters and years. Said more simply, we bear the full cost upfront and then receive our revenue over time. Lastly, year-to-date fee-related earnings, or FRE, were up 16% relative to the prior-year period as a result of the management fee and fee-earning AUM growth discussed earlier. As we noted on our prior call, FRE margin for the quarter was impacted due to extending the final close for Secondary Fund VI. Recall, that extending the timing of Secondary Fund VI's final close will extend out the timing of receiving the associated retro fees and could potentially cause interim movements in our quarterly FRE margins, which is what we witnessed this quarter. However, for the fiscal year 2024, we expect to maintain levels consistent with fiscal 2023 and the first two quarters of fiscal 2024. I'll wrap up here with some commentary on our balance sheet. Our largest asset continues to be our investments alongside our clients in our customized separate accounts and specialized funds. Over the long term, we view these investments as an important component of our continued growth and we'll continue to invest our balance sheet capital alongside our clients. In regard to our liabilities, we continue to be modestly levered. With that, we will now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the new tokenization strategic relationship that you have. I think you had called that with Libre. Maybe you could just elaborate on that. And maybe if you can update us on some of the prior tokenization partnerships that you have to Securitize and ADDX over in Asia I think it was. Just curious what lessons learned you take away from those relationships and how that informs your view on how you see the market developing for tokenized private market funds?\nErik Hirsch: Thanks, Mike. It's Erik. I'll take that. I think we're clearly at the very beginning of what we think is going to be a journey. How long that journey goes, I think, is a question mark. And this really goes to what is going to be the adoption of this. In my sort of 30 years in this industry, you don't find a lot of things that are better for both the fund manager and the investor. Tokenization is one of those things. It is truly better, faster, cheaper. And so, we are big believers in the technology. We're believers in increasing and easing the access into these products for both retail investors and, frankly, institutional investors. And so, what you're seeing us do is that it's hard to know today who's going to be a winner. I don't suspect it's going to be one winner. And so we're building a set of strategic relationships around the globe to make sure that we are covering different kinds of exchanges in different locales, because the regulatory markets for each of those is different. What we have experienced so far is flows. We have been receiving capital from the variety of these different partnerships coming through the token channel. Has it been massively significant amounts of capital? It has not. But I think our costs around it are modest, and our strategic investments, we believe, are panning out well. And so, I think it's telling us that the customers are there and that they need to continue to be educated and awareness continues -- needs to continue to rise, and we think all those things are happening. And we see ourselves as a very, very clear leader in the space. I think we believe we've got more of these strategic relationships than anybody else out there and a variety of products now sitting in these various channels.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. And just a follow-up question around new customers coming to Hamilton Lane. You mentioned about 80% of the SMA contributions are from existing customers, that even as the installed base continues to grow, this is suggesting that you're still finding meaningful opportunity to bring new customers to the firm. So maybe you could just elaborate on the opportunities that you see in the marketplace that -- where you're winning new customers coming. Maybe you can elaborate on these folks that are new the asset class or are these folks that are already invested but need a little bit more assistance? Maybe you can just help flesh that out.\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Mike. Erik. I'll stick with that. So I think it's a combination, as you noted. We are continuing to see both investors that are brand new to the asset class. And again, in the SMA business, we're talking institutional investors. So, as we kind of travel around the globe, as we continue to geographically expand, we are absolutely seeing and meeting with institutional investors who have yet to embark on their private equity journey, and we are there and ready and able to assist them. The other source of that 20% is us taking clients away from competitors. So, there's also an aspect here of us positioning ourselves as a better service provider versus their current alternative, and we are then sort of taking clients away from another service provider. So it's really the combination of those two pieces that's really fueling that 20%.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. So first on margin. So FRE margin declined in 3Q. You're still guiding to 42%, 43% FRE margins for the year, which suggests that 4Q margins has to pick way up, suggests comp is going to pull way back, all else being equal from third quarter levels. Do I have all this right? Am I putting all these pieces together sort of correctly?\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Ken. Erik. So, I think as we said on the last earnings call, due to the sort of significant amount of retro fees and the fact that we have visibility, we opted to do what we've done historically, which is accrued compensation, and we're talking about variable compensation, on a steady basis throughout the year. Managing to an ultimate margin, which is in line with what we have been sort of setting expectations around. That's what we did through this quarter. And obviously, the result of less -- lower retro fees, again, because we pushed some of the closings out into the subsequent quarter, resulted in what looks like today, artificially inflated compensation ratios. Once we get to the next quarter, our view is that compensation ratios are going to remain in line with what they've been historically and you're going to see margins in line with what we posted for the first two quarters of the year.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then I guess, next, I would love to dig into distributions in the SMA business. So, in 2020 and '21, the pace of SMA distributions really jumped, I think at the time you mentioned there was some recycling of capital, which impacted that pace. And then in '22 and '23, that piece of distributions came way down. So as we think about from here and going forward, maybe first, what are the factors that really go into this pace of distributions? I assume it's part contract timing, part realizations. And as we look to this calendar year, how do we see those kind of pieces fitting together? And does -- I don't know, the pace of realizations kind of stay at these levels? Does it go up because the market is better and there's more deal activity? I don't know. There's a whole bunch of moving pieces. Just if you could help us think about the next four quarters.\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Ken. Erik. So what you saw a couple of years ago was really the impact of COVID. And as we had discussed then, it did a couple of things. That market environment changed dramatically and two things occurred. One, investment pacing increased significantly, and distributions increased significantly. We're now in a market environment where hold periods are extending out, distribution activity is coming down. So what's happening in the SMA is really no different than what's happening in kind of the market at large. And you've seen it across a variety of the other fund managers. Hold periods are extending, exit activity is somewhat muted. And so whether that's in specialized funds or SMAs, that's what you're seeing here. To the extent, and we sort of continue to see that the public markets and the overall economy stabilizing, and investors believing that it's kind of safe to go back in the water, our expectation is that you will see distribution activity increase. And so that will come across SMA specialized funds, and it will also come across the carried interest line.\nKen Worthington: Great. Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. Just maybe zooming out a little bit on the margin question, the FRE margin question, you guys are clearly investing in the business, that all makes a lot of sense. And the retail dynamic with the wirehouse has really masked some of the kind of embedded profitability in that channel. As you look out a couple of years from now, how should we think about the trajectory of FRE margins for the business as a whole relative to kind of where you're likely to end up for your fiscal 2024?\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Alex. Erik. I think as you know, we are clearly investing for the future. So I think the way we look at margin is that, among our peer set, we're already posting a substantially larger margin than most, if not all. And we've been doing that with continued double-digit growth. We see a lot of opportunity to continue to put capital back into the firm to both expand resources around institutional and retail sales, to continue that geographic footprint expansion, and to continue to invest in a variety of these technology partnerships, all of which we think are contributing to the results you're seeing on the fundraising side today. That said, you're seeing the fee shift occurring because higher price and also, by the way, over time, higher-margin product lines. And so, from a management standpoint, we'll have strategic decisions to make around what we want to do with the margin going forward, you mentioned a few years out, relative to continued investment back in the firm for growth versus letting those margins sort of rise up a little bit further and out. I think our view is over the next several years we can do both.\nAlex Blostein: I got you. That's helpful. And then a couple of clarifications maybe around the flagship funds. So, I heard the details on a number of them. I don't know if we got an update on infrastructure. So maybe give us a sense of where that is shaking out. And as you sort of look beyond this quarter, next quarter and as you wrap up the secondaries fund, what else are you guys expecting to be in the market with on the specialized fund side of things?\nErik Hirsch: Sure. Alex. Erik. So infrastructure, early days. We'll get started, we'll have -- I expect you'll have multiple updates from us over the coming quarters on that fund raise as we get in and start having closes that we'll start reporting on. The other big mover will eventually be the direct equity fund, which is now officially in market. But again, nothing to report yet because we've started the marketing process with existing investors, but we have not yet had a close.\nAlex Blostein: All righty. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Adam Beatty from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you, and good morning. In prepared, Erik mentioned the credit business and a lot of opportunity there, currently 15%, I think you said, of AUM. So I just wanted to get some thoughts and maybe some more detail around growing that business, whether you're looking to new products, growing existing products with future vintages or what have you. And also where you would expect that to shake out as a proportion of total AUM given growth in other areas? Thank you.\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Adam. Erik. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the credit piece today is growing because it has a multitude of avenues for which it can grow. So today, we have dedicated specialized funds for credit, both in institution, that's the strategic opportunities, and in retail, which is our non-U.S. credit-only Evergreen product. So, we already have the specialized fund piece covered outside of the U.S. I think over time, we'll certainly look to have a U.S. credit Evergreen product. On the institutional side, so both again, as I noted, the specialized fund, and we have a variety of dedicated SMAs, we also have a lot of multi-strat SMAs of which credit is a portion. And in addition to that, our sort of two flagship retail Evergreen Funds, U.S. and non-U.S., both have meaningful credit co-investment aspects to them. So, the growth has been occurring because we have lots of different buckets that are all absorbing credit opportunities today. We're continuing to invest in that team and expand those resources. And we believe that, at 15%, it's already a very meaningful portion of AUM. But as you see in kind of a relatively high rate environment and with the kind of consolidation of sort of lending resources around the globe, particularly in the U.S. with kind of the diminishing impact of regional banks, we see the attractiveness of private credit continuing to be there. It's been a very good performer inside of client portfolios. And so our view is we continue to lean in, we continue to see lots of opportunities, and we continue to see growth.\nAdam Beatty: Sounds good. Thanks, Erik. And just one follow-up on tokenization. Just wondering whether you see that or how you see it. Now, obviously, early days. But interacting with your existing sort of wealth management channel, do you feel as though you could actually productively introduce tokenization into some existing accounts? Or do you see it more as an avenue to kind of expand the TAM in retail and wealth management? Thanks.\nErik Hirsch: Yeah, Adam. Erik. I think it's both. I think if you sort of just look at what the retail investor is going to eventually demand of this asset class, it is ease of use. When we think about how easy it is for us to transact in the public equities world, we have apps on our phone, they're tied to funding accounts, we can very easily pull up research, and trade and transact, we can pull up views of our portfolio, all stored in one easy location. The private markets is going to need to meet the investor there. I don't believe that the investors are going to have two wildly different expectations of what they kind of get and receive on the public equity side versus what they get and receive on the private market side. So, our view is that tokenization and digital wallets are a real move towards more replicating that public equity experience. Single funding source, single kind of know your customer anti-money laundering aspects again, single point of portfolio management and construction. And with tokens, a much more ease of use around trading positions. And so,, we see all of that as very attractive. And our belief is that, while in a lot of places it's the institutional investor who kind of drives change, we think here, it's going to be the opposite. We think the retail investor is going to be the one that drives change, and that the institutional investors will actually follow behind them. So we think it's an and. We think it's both tying into some of the existing opportunities and channels and, frankly, getting clients who otherwise don't want to invest if they can't do it in the digital world.\nAdam Beatty: Got it. Makes sense. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mike Brown at KBW. Please go ahead.\nMike Brown: Hey, great. Thank you for taking my questions. The Evergreen Funds have been a tremendously strong story. But I guess as you alluded to, it is becoming a bit more of a competitive market. Can you just speak to the competitive dynamics that you're seeing? I guess on one hand, it's maybe a little tough to stand out in a crowded field with some strong brands coming into the space. But on the other hand, I can almost envision there's like a rising tide lifts all boats dynamic for the wealth channel as you were just kind of talking to, there's maybe greater comfort for these products that will continue to make the pie grow larger. So, I'd love to just hear how you're thinking about maybe the push and pull between those two dynamics.\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Mike. Erik. I think this is probably, again, similar to my comment to Adam, it's probably an and, which is there's no question that interest in the space very high among the retail investor. And they're starting with an exposure that in most cases is basically zero. So you have a tremendously large pool of capital, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. that is either dramatically underexposed to this asset class or not exposed at all. And so if you see that trend more mirroring, if not exceeding, what the institutional investor is doing, then you're going to see allocation levels for the retail investor well into double digits. We're nowhere near that today. Again, most investors today are single digits and low single digits. So the sheer amount of capital that is present and available is massive. So you're talking about a huge market. We also don't see this as a one winner. I think if we sort of compare it to, again, the public equity world, today, you have a large group of very large, very successful asset managers controlling billions, if not trillions, of dollars of capital. It's not a single firm or a single winner. And so, we think that that's what this is going to look like over time for this asset class as well. So, huge addressable market, massively underpenetrated, room for lots of successful product offerings. And so the way you stand out, we think, is great results, unique product offerings and great customer service. And we think one of the reasons why we're having the success that we're having with great flows and kind of getting onto these various channels which, again, everyone is not doing, is because we're doing well across all three of those things. And we will look to continue to make sure that that's the experience that the investors have and that we're finding ways to stand out, continue to invest in our brand, we think these various technology partners are again, additive and unique to what others are doing. And that's how we sort of see this playing out over time.\nMike Brown: Okay. Great. And then, if I just change gears to some of your strategic partnerships and some of your tech investments. I know this is an important part of the culture and fabric of Hamilton Lane. Can you maybe just expand on some of the -- how some of the recent investments could translate to growth for you? And maybe give us a little bit of inside baseball. When you're considering these investments, how do you think about what the growth potential could be? Like what does the framework look like in terms of what your growth expectations are? And then maybe how much capital to deploy into these strategies on an annual basis?\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Mike. Erik. The tech investments are across a variety of different buckets. So bucket number one and, frankly, the bucket we started with and have done the most around our technology tools that make Hamilton Lane both more efficient and a better service provider to our customers. So think about back-office reporting, data ingestion, analysis, analytics, sort of think about that as bucket one. The vast majority of those we simply use as a client, oftentimes with preferential terms or again, different unique strategic angles, or single-purpose use cases. So, I would sort of look at that bucket as Hamilton Lane is a better and, frankly, higher-margin firm, delivering better results more efficiently to clients as a result of that bucket. Now as you remember, we have also monetized a variety of those over time with great success. So, very large significant cash multiple. So, we've not only gotten the internal benefit, but we've gotten good return on our balance sheet capital. Bucket number two, I would sort of put around distribution. So think about that with not only the token space, but also plugging into firms that are servicing the adviser and offering product on their platforms. So that has been a way for us to try to access a customer that we might not otherwise be able to reach, or reach a customer in a way that is more beneficial to them. We also think that some of those, because they're much more visible and our brand is associated with them, are great ways for us to enhance the Hamilton Lane brand in a way that we see more value-added and more efficient than, say, putting our logo on a baseball uniform. And so that's been the benefit there. Bucket one, the operational side, I think we've already seen significant meaningful results. Bucket two is where we're a little earlier. And so as we go forward and think about what we're going to be doing or spending or deploying, we're looking at -- we're always looking at firms that are kind of occurring in both buckets to see where we think we're going to have strategic benefits. We don't have a set budget around these because they have been opportunistic to-date. But again, we have a meaningful balance sheet, and we think this has been a very good and effective way to use it.\nMike Brown: Great. Thank you for all that color.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Finian O'Shea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nFinian O'Shea: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Good afternoon. Another question on wealth specifically for the newer credit Evergreen. Are you finding that lands with wealth advisers, perhaps as a different kind of multi-manager product? Or do they tend to group it in with all of the non-traded BDCs in market? And in that context, how would you describe the addressable flow potential? Thank you.\nErik Hirsch: Yeah, Finian. Erik. I think the way we've been standing out and differentiating is because of that multi-manager approach. It's no secret that our Evergreen products are co-investment oriented. And we think one of the big advantages of that is the fact that we're providing in a single vehicle multi-manager, multi-industry, multi-size, multi-geography exposure, in a way that's harder for a single manager to do. And so that is our differentiation and that is sort of where we are targeting. If you look at the credit flows, a number of them have come from folks that were already in one of the flagship Evergreen Funds, have had a good experience, liked the service, thought the returns were strong, and then have decided to add additional exposure to us via credit.\nFinian O'Shea: Okay. Thank you. And just a follow-up there, given it does seem to be one of the few products as described in market. Is it at all on the table to, say, invest more meaningfully in distribution that's likely required to pick up to the monthly flow pace that some of the leaders in the market show? That's all for me. Thanks.\nErik Hirsch: Yeah. Thanks, Finian. I mean our goal is to increase flows, period. I noted that if you look at Evergreen flows kind of calendar over calendar, we're up 76%. So I think we have been doing a terrific job of that. But we're not stopping or resting on our laurels. And so if you look at sort of future expansion plans for us, it very clearly has additional adds to sales team, other mechanisms for distribution. And all of this is designed to increase the flows, continue to maintain, and to build that brand in that space as a market leader. So 76%, I think, calendar over calendar impressive, and our view is let's keep going.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions. I will now turn the call back over to Erik Hirsch for closing comments.\nErik Hirsch: With that, we thank you for the time. We thank you for the questions. Wishing everyone well. And thanks for the support.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating, and we ask that you please disconnect your lines."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Hamilton Lane Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Tuesday, November 7, 2023. And I would now like to turn the conference over to John Oh, Head of Shareholder Relations. Please go ahead.\nJohn Oh: Thank you, Nina. Good morning, and welcome to the Hamilton Lane Q2 fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today, I will be joined by Mario Giannini, CEO; Erik Hirsch, Vice Chairman; and Jeff Armbrister, CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. Before we discuss the quarter's results, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial position, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. These forward-looking statements do not guarantee future events or performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. For a discussion of these risks, please review the cautionary statements and risk factors included in the Hamilton Lane's fiscal 2023 10-K and subsequent reports we file with the SEC. These forward-looking statements are made only as of today and, except as required, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of them. We will also be referring to non-GAAP measures that we view as important in assessing the performance of our business. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in the earnings presentation materials made available on the Shareholders section of the Hamilton Lane website. Our detailed financial results will be made available when our 10-Q is filed. Please note that nothing on this call represents an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase interest in any of Hamilton Lane's products. Beginning with the financial highlights. Year-to-date, our management and advisory fee revenue grew by 20%, while our fee-related earnings also grew by 20% versus the prior year period, translated into GAAP EPS of $1.92 based on $73 million of GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $1.83 based on $99 million of adjusted net income. We have also declared a dividend of $0.445 per share this quarter, which keeps us on track for the 11% increase over last fiscal year, equating to the targeted $1.78 per share for fiscal year 2024. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mario.\nMario Giannini: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with addressing the CEO transition announcement we made several weeks ago. At the beginning of calendar 2024, I will be stepping down as CEO of Hamilton Lane after having served the last 22 years in that capacity. I will move into an executive co-chair role alongside Hartley Rogers, our current Chairman. At that time, Erik Hirsch and Juan Delgado-Moreira will become the new co-CEOs of Hamilton Lane. I want to emphasize that I will not be moving on or back from Hamilton Lane and, in fact, quite the opposite. I'm a significant shareholder and I plan to remain very active and do my part in continuing to grow and scale our business. Once as a fund manager, how you know if someone is a good CEO? His answer was that you don't know until a couple of years after that person is no longer CEO. Because the mark of a good CEO is that his or her transition to another CEO is smooth and the successor continues to run the business successfully. That's the measure that I am certain that I will be regarded as a good CEO, because this transition has and will continue to be seamless, and Juan and Erik will be great CEOs at Hamilton Lane. I've worked with both of them over many years here, and there has been no decision or strategic discussion over the last 15-plus years of which they haven't been an integral part. Their thoughts and judgments have been a key part of Hamilton Lane's success and we would be nowhere near what we are today without them helping to spearhead the growth of the business over the last decade and longer. Both Erik and Juan have highly complementary investment in strategic management skill sets and bring fresh perspectives on the future of our business. Juan will primarily focus on leading Hamilton Lane's global sales effort and client service organization, while Erik will take the lead on the strategic direction and operations of the firm. Erik and Juan will jointly lead our global investment team. We look forward to working with them as Hamilton Lane builds on its market leadership position. I will now turn it over to Erik.\nErik Hirsch: Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into detail around the quarter's results, I want to take this opportunity to thank the Board, Hartley, and Mario for entrusting me and Juan with this new responsibility. We are excited to continue to build on the firm's strong position and momentum. Juan will join the next earnings call to introduce himself to you all. But our plan going forward is that future calls will be led by me, Jeff Armbrister and John, and to keep our interaction with you and the market consistent. With that, let's move on to the results for the quarter. I'll start with our total asset footprint, which we define as the sum of our AUM and AUA. This stood at $854 billion and represents a 4% increase to our footprint year-over-year and highlights our continued and steady growth as a firm. AUM stood at $119 billion at quarter-end and grew $12 billion or 11%. The growth came from both our specialized funds and customized separate accounts. AUA was up $18 billion or 3% year-over-year, primarily the result of the addition of reporting and advisory mandates. As a reminder, AUA can fluctuate for a variety of reasons, but the revenue associated with AUA does not necessarily move in lockstep with those changes. Let's turn now to fee-earning AUM, which continues to be the largest driver of management fees. And despite a challenging fundraising environment over recent quarters, we have experienced strong growth in both our customized separate accounts and specialized funds. Our total fee-earning AUM stood at $61.4 billion and grew $8.7 billion or 17% relative to the prior year period. Taken separately, $3.9 billion of net fee-earning AUM came from our customized separate accounts, and over the same time period, $4.8 billion came from our specialized funds. Our blended fee rate across the platform also continues to increase. This stems from the continuing shift in the mix of our fee-earning AUM towards higher fee rate specialized funds, most notably our Evergreen products where growth is strong. Moving now to additional detail on our customized separate accounts. Fee-earning AUM from our customized separate accounts stood at $36.2 billion, growing 12% over the past 12 months. We continue to see the growth coming across type, size and geographic location of the clients. Over the last 12 months, more than 80% of the gross inflows into customized separate accounts came from our existing client base. While this clearly speaks to the power of a recurring relationship model, it also tells you what the remainder of the flows, despite a very large installed base coming from new relationships, the market continues to offer plenty of opportunities. Moving to our specialized funds. Momentum here continues to be strong. Fee earning AUM from our specialized funds stood at $25.2 billion at quarter-end. Over the past 12 months, we achieved positive net inflows of $4.8 billion, representing an increase of 24% relative to the prior-year period. This growth stemmed from additional closes for funds currently in market, robust investment activity, and continued expansion of our Evergreen platform. Moving on to some detail around the drivers of specialized fund flows, I'll begin with our secondary fund currently in market. During the quarter, we held two additional closes that totaled approximately $622 million of LP commitments, and that brings the total raised here to over $3 billion. As a quick reminder, we raised $3.9 billion for our prior secondary fund, and we are on target to surpass the prior fund size with this current fund. Capital raised this quarter generated $6.1 million in retro fees. Originally, we had until calendar fourth quarter of 2023 to finish raising this fund. However, demand and opportunity remain strong, and our existing investors have granted us an extension to the end of March 2024. Overall, the fund continues to perform well, and we continue to be encouraged with the momentum heading into the final stages. Moving on to our strategic opportunities fund, which is our annual direct credit fund targeting the institutional LP. As a refresher, the series of funds is effectively always in market as we raise and deploy the capital with short investment periods and charge management fees on invested capital. We are currently in market with our eighth series. And since our last update, we've held additional closes that have totaled over $230 million of LP commitments. This brings the total raise for this current series to nearly $570 million. We expect to hold the final close of the series sometime before the end of calendar 2023. I'd like to highlight that our direct [credit] platform has continued to experience strong growth over the past few years with this annual institutional series now being complemented with other sleeves of credit-focused capital including various separate accounts and our Evergreen Funds. Together, the platform remains on solid footing with opportunity to continue to grow and scale. Before I move on to our Evergreen Funds, I'm happy to announce that we've held the first close for our second Infrastructure Opportunities Fund. Our first fund raised nearly $575 million of investor commitments in and alongside the fund, and recall that this strategy centers around transaction-focused investments, namely direct equity and secondaries in the real assets and infrastructure space. For this first close of our second fund, we secured more than $300 million of commitments in and alongside the fund. We are pleased with the progress and momentum, having raised over 50% of Fund I's capital with this second close. Let's turn now to our Evergreen Funds, where growth remains robust. We continue to witness strong demand coming from across the globe as the noninstitutional channel continues to seek out access to the private markets via our semi-liquid funds. As of the end of September, total AUM across the Evergreen complex stood at nearly $4.9 billion. For the first 9 months of calendar 2023, we are averaging net monthly inflows of nearly $160 million across the entirety of the platform. For our U.S. private markets offering, we continue to generate solid traction with the wirehouses that we've been onboarded to earlier this year. As of the end of September, we've generated nearly $440 million of flows and have achieved that level of success in just a few short months of being live on those platforms. Our success demonstrates our strength in providing access to the private markets for the noninstitutional investor. We believe that we are still very much in the early stages of this exciting business, and look forward to expanding our presence in this space. Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I'd like to take this opportunity to highlight our newest strategic technology investment from our balance sheet. On August 8, we announced an investment and partnership with IDR. IDR is an investor onboarding platform which securely streamlines the onboarding process for private market managers and their fundraising efforts by providing a central, globally accepted and standardized investor onboarding solution, connecting all parties involved in the investment process and supporting onboarding workflow across know-your-customer, tax and anti-money laundering services. Our investment in partnership with IDR is yet another example of our commitment to increasing efficiency and improving the private markets user experience for all parties, investors, fund managers and even our own teams. We have implemented IDR onboarding services in our portfolio of fund offerings to help maintain consistent oversight and to streamline our KYC and AML processes. This has led to continued operational efficiencies as well as cost, time and resource savings. Other users today include leading fund managers and fund administrators. We are excited to embark on this journey with IDR and look forward to providing you with future updates. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff to cover the financials.\nJeff Armbrister: Thank you, Erik, and good morning, everyone. As this is my first HLNE earnings call as Hamilton Lane's CFO, I'd like to start by conveying how excited I am to be working alongside the Board, Erik, Juan, and the rest of the senior leadership team here. With the last 5 years leading and growing Hamilton Lane's direct equity platform, now I'm looking forward to this exciting opportunity to continue to help drive growth at the firm. Let's move on now to the financial results. Fiscal year-to-date, we achieved strong growth in our business with management and advisory fees up 20% versus the prior year period. Specialized funds revenue increased by $29 million or 32% compared to the prior year period. This was driven primarily by a $1.8 billion increase to fee-earning AUM in our Evergreen platform in the last 12 months and over $3 billion raised since inception in our latest secondary fund. Retro fees for the fiscal year were $8.8 million from our secondary funded market versus $1.2 million from our direct equity fund in the prior year period. As a reminder, investors that come into later closes during a fundraise pay retroactive fees dating back to the fund's first close. We expect to generate additional retro fees as we hold subsequent closes for secondary Fund VI. Erik mentioned earlier, we received an extension for the final close for secondary Fund VI out to calendar Q1 of 2024 that will extend out the timing of receiving the associated retro fees. This now has potential to cause interim movements in our quarterly FRE margins. But on an annual basis, we expect to maintain our current levels. Moving on to customized separate accounts. Revenue increased $6 million or 10% compared to the prior year period due to re-ups from existing clients, the addition of several new accounts, and continued investment activity. Revenue from our advisory reporting and other offerings decreased by $784,000 compared to the prior year period, due primarily to the sale of the 361 Capital assets partially offset by increases in revenue coming from our technology solutions. Lastly, the final component of our revenue is incentive fees. Year-to-date, incentive fees totaled $37 million and are down 66% relative to the prior year period. Recall that the last fiscal year we generated a large amount of incentive fees due to the catch-up period that several of our carry eligible vehicles we're in. Let me now turn to some additional detail on our unrealized carry balance. Balance is up 17% from the prior year period, while having recognized $84.1 million of incentive fees during the last 12 months. Unrealized carry balance now stands at approximately $1.2 billion. Moving to expenses. Year-to-date total expenses decreased $15 million compared with the prior-year period. Total compensation and benefits decreased by $23 million driven primarily by lower compensation associated with the decreased amount of incentive fees. G&A increased $7 million, driven primarily by revenue-related expenses, which are the third-party commissions related to our U.S. Evergreen products being offered on our wirehouses that we discussed last call. I'd like to remind you that the flows that come in through the wirehouse channel have an associated upfront fee from the dollars raised there. That payment is made and applied to the total amount when those dollars close into the fund. However, the corresponding management fees we earn from those same dollars come in over the course of the year for as long as the client is invested in the fund. It creates a timing mismatch between the cost of bringing those dollars on and the revenue associated with those flows. It causes our G&A to increase with the eventual offsetting revenue to come in during the subsequent quarters and years. Said more simply, we bear the full cost upfront and then receive our revenue over time. Lastly, our fee-related earnings were up 20% relative to the prior-year period as a result of the management fee and fee earning AUM growth discussed earlier. I'll wrap up here with some commentary on our balance sheet. The largest asset continues to be our investments alongside our clients in our customized separate accounts and specialized funds. Over the long term, we view these investments as an important component of our continued growth and we will continue to invest our balance sheet capital alongside our clients. With regard to our liabilities, we continue to be modestly levered. With that, we will now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kenneth Worthington from JPMorgan.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Alex on for Ken. Maybe to double-click on the Evergreen platform, and congratulations on all the continued success there. Maybe just initially to get a better sense of the decision process that you're making across choosing to launch new products versus trying to onboard existing products onto some of the larger distribution platforms, which is the wirehouses you discussed. Maybe if we can start there, please.\nMario Giannini: Sure, Alex. It's Mario. The decision is fairly straightforward in the sense that, obviously, these products that we have on the platforms are having great success. And so we fully intend to expand the product offerings. As you're aware, we have a credit offering outside the United States on those platforms. So we have already expanded. And we look at it and think that we will have an additional number of offerings. But really, it's a function of making sure that we have the right investment platforms that both the platforms want and in which their space to provide them. But we would expect that we will continue to be providing products into that platform and expanding our own platform there.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. And maybe as a follow-up, some of your peers that also had Evergreen products have been looking at some more innovative structures such as ticker subscriptions and things of that nature. Do you see merit there? And is that something that you're considering? Or how are you framing that question?\nMario Giannini: Alex, it's Mario again. Look, I think everyone is looking at developments in that market. What does the market want? And clearly, as you see in our numbers, the market wants what we're offering. So as we think about do we need to change that in order to increase demand, we just haven't seen that need. With that said, I would expect that you'll continue to see innovation around the kinds of things like you described where either it's necessary or the market requires it. But as I said, in terms of the existing products we have, we've not had much demand for people saying, if you tweak it this way, you will get more incremental demand. You've seen the flows. They're healthy. And so I would not expect any time soon that we're going to be changing that. But sure, products looking forward, I think as the markets change, we will certainly change and hopefully beat some of them.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Michael Brown from KBW.\nEvan Holeman: This is Evan Holeman on for Mike Brown. The FRE margin has been fairly stable the last several quarters. And as the Evergreen platform continues to grow its contribution to the business, is there an embedded operating leverage that can support further expansion? Or is there further investment that would limit this dynamic? And if so, can you just kind of help us quantify that?\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Evan, it's Erik. Thanks for the question. I think as Jeff said in his section, we're thrilled with the success we're having, particularly with the wirehouses, but that does come with that kind of upfront cost and then kind of the revenue coming later. So I think what you're seeing with margin right now, I think, is actually noteworthy, in an environment where we're certainly seeing margins falling across peers in the market segment, I think the fact that we're holding steady with this growth and with those upfront costs, I think is noteworthy and sort of shows that I think management is doing a good job on sort of managing all of those dynamics. Going forward, you would say in a vacuum that margins could be rising as you start to get -- as you've now paid the upfront cost and now you're just benefiting from revenue. That would be a margin enhancer, particularly given the margin on this product. That said, I think management's focus here continues to be on growth and investing in growth. To Mario's point, new product expansion, continuing sort of building out of the sales force. So I think our focus today is not on can we increase margins further, it's how can we continue to invest smartly in the business to make sure that we're continuing to put up these significant growth numbers.\nEvan Holeman: Great. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on any color or visibility you guys have to additional wirehouses that the Evergreen product may be added to just as we think through kind of that dislocation in revenue and expenses, that would be great.\nErik Hirsch: Sure. I mean our focus -- I mean, the team continues to build in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And our focus is just putting the product in as many locations as we think makes sense. We want to make sure you're doing that in a way that not only are you adding on to those platforms, but in order to be successful, you have to actually support it once it's there. There's a tremendous need for education, customer support and the like. So I think we view this as really a marathon and the race is just getting started. So while we're thrilled with the success that we've had and we're thrilled that we're already on some wirehouses, as you look forward, I think what you should expect to see is addition of more distribution partners and an addition of more product and a continued kind of reinvestment in our resources around all of those areas. But again, I think from management's perspective, we're viewing this as this is a long road, which is exciting. That's one of the big growth drivers we see as the future of the business, but this is all not going to be coming in tomorrow.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Mr. Erik Hirsch, there are no further questions at this time. Please proceed.\nErik Hirsch: Again, thank you for the time. We know it was a very, very busy day for a number of you. So we appreciate the participation. And again, wish everyone well. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect."

A supplemental slide presentation to accompany the prepared remarks can be found on the company's website. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.

Good morning, and welcome to the Hamilton Lane Q1 fiscal 2024 earnings call. Today, I will be joined by Mario Giannini, CEO; Erik Hirsch, Vice Chairman; and Atul Varma, CFO. Earlier this morning, we issued a press release and slide presentation, which are available on our website. Before we discuss the quarter's results, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements discuss our current expectations and projections relating to our financial position, results of operations, plans, objectives, future performance and business. These forward-looking statements do not guarantee future events or performance, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected. For a discussion of these risks, please review the cautionary statements and risk factors included in the Hamilton Lane's fiscal 2023 10-K and subsequent reports we file with the SEC. These forward-looking statements are made only as of today and, except as required, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of them. We will also be referring to non-GAAP measures that we view as important in assessing the performance of our business. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in the earnings presentation materials made available on the Shareholders section of the Hamilton Lane website. Our detailed financial results will be made available when our 10-Q is filed. Please note that nothing on this call represents an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase interest in any of Hamilton Lane's products. Beginning with the financial highlights. For the quarter, management and advisory fee revenue grew by 23%, while our fee-related earnings also grew by 23% versus the prior year period. This translated into GAAP EPS of $0.81 based on $31 million of GAAP net income and non-GAAP EPS of $0.94 based on $51 million of adjusted net income. We have also declared a dividend of $0.445 per share this quarter, which keeps us on track for the 11% increase over last fiscal year, equating to the targeted $1.78 per share for fiscal year 2024. With that I'll now turn the call over to Mario.\nMario Giannini: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I want to take a moment and touch on the announcement we made a few weeks back around several senior leadership appointments throughout the firm. Our personnel goals are simple, hire and retain the absolute best people, put them on a successful path and ensure that path allows for continued growth. With all, but one of the appointments being internal resources, the changes clearly reflect our personnel philosophy and show our continued focus on delivering results for our clients, shareholders and partners. As part of last week's announcement, you saw that Atul Varma will be moving into a senior adviser role here at Hamilton Lane and that Jeff Armbrister will become our new CFO effective August 8th. Jeff has spent the last five years at Hamilton Lane and was most recently the Global Head of our Direct Equity platform, which under his leadership, has achieved strong growth and concluded a successful fund raise earlier this year. Prior to joining Hamilton Lane, Jeff spent 19 years in private equity, with the final five years as Managing Director at a private equity firm, where he participated in all major investment functions and also provided oversight for certain finance-related operational activities, including financial analysis and reporting and cash flow management for a number of their portfolio companies. We think Jeff's experience, firm tenure and strong investment and strategic skill set will serve us well as we are now well into our seventh year of being a public company. Let me end here by thanking Atul for his service and leadership during his tenure as CFO. Before we move to the quarter's results, I want to take this opportunity and highlight that Hamilton Lane was recently recognized in Private Equity International's 2023 new Private Impact's 50 list. This list brings together the largest managers of private market capital across different asset classes, including private debt, infrastructure, private equity and real estate, and measures the amount of impact focused capital raised over a five-year period. The firms represented on this list are united by a common approach of intentional pursuit of positive, measurable social or environmental impact alongside financial returns. We are honored to be recognized as one of the 50 largest managers of impact focused capital and look forward to the continued growth of this platform. I will now turn it over to Erik.\nErik Hirsch: Thank you, Mario, and good morning, everyone. Turning to the results for the quarter. Our total asset footprint, which we define as the sum of our AUM and AUA stood at approximately $818 billion and represents a 2% decrease to our footprint year-over-year. AUM growth year-over-year, which was $9 billion or 8% came from both our specialized funds and customized separate accounts. AUA was net down nearly $24 billion or 3% year-over-year, primarily the result of expiration of reporting and advisory mandates. As a reminder, AUA can fluctuate for a variety of reasons, but the revenue associated with AUA does not necessarily move in lockstep with those changes. This was true for this period, whereby despite a reduction in AUA, advisory revenue increased. Turning now to fee earning AUM. Total fee-earning AUM stood at nearly $60 billion and grew $8.5 billion or 17% relative to the prior year period, stemming from positive fund flows across both our specialized funds and our customized separate accounts. Taken separately, $4.1 billion of net fee-earning AUM came from our customized separate accounts. And over the same time period, $4.4 billion came from our specialized funds. Our blended fee rate across the platform has been increasing over the past few quarters. This stems from the continuing shift in the mix of our fee-earning AUM towards higher fee rate specialized funds, most notably our Evergreen products where growth is strong. Moving now to additional detail on our customized separate accounts. Fee earning AUM from our customized separate accounts stood at $35.9 billion, growing 13% over the past 12 months. We continue to see the growth coming across type, size and geographic rotation of the clients. Over the last 12 months, more than 80% of the gross inflows into customized separate accounts came from our existing client base. While this clearly speaks to the power of the recurring relationship model, it also tells you that with the remainder of flows, despite a very large installed base coming from new relationships that the market continues to offer plenty of opportunities. Moving to our specialized funds. Momentum here continues to be strong. Fee earning AUM from our specialized funds stood at $23.8 billion at quarter-end. Over the last 12 months, we achieved positive net inflows of $4.4 billion, representing an increase of 23% relative to the prior year period. This growth stem from additional closes for funds currently in market, robust investment activity and continued expansion of our Evergreen platform. I'll quickly touch upon two of the drivers of fee earning AUM growth in the quarter. On June 30th, we held an additional close for our Secondary Fund VI that totaled over $490 million. This brings the total raise for this fund to nearly $2.5 billion. This close also generated retro fees of $3.9 million in the quarter. The fund will remain in market into the fourth quarter of calendar 2023 and we remain encouraged with the demand for this strategy coupled with a strong fundraising pipeline ahead of us. Moving now to the Evergreen platform, where we continue to be excited about what we have already accomplished and what lies ahead. As of quarter-end, the platform stood at over $4.2 billion of AUM across our three products. For the first six calendar months of 2023, the platform is averaging over $130 million of monthly net inflow. This compares to a monthly average of $75 million for calendar year 2022. Our success here has been driven by strong performance and by both growing and expanding with our existing distribution channels and adding new relationships. Last quarter, recall that we announced that we had been successfully onboarded by two of the preeminent wirehouses in the US for our PAF product. While still early days there, we've already seen very encouraging uptake with over $220 million of gross inflow from those two channels in just a few short months. It is worth pausing here to clearly state a point. Today, $1 of Evergreen inflow brings more gross revenue than nearly $4 of separate account inflow. Additionally, every dollar of Evergreen capital has the potential to generate deal-by-deal carried interest. We continue to believe that our product offering is differentiated and the growth we've achieved during calendar year 2023 serves to validate that point. Our brand, scale and approach provides investors in these products with both a unique access point and experience in the private markets and we look forward to further building on our success. Let me shift gears now and talk to our most recently announced technology initiative. This new partnership highlights both the strength and strategic value of our proprietary data and analytics and demonstrates why we believe that the most optimal path forward in cutting-edge technology is through partnering with leading companies in ways that extend beyond just balance sheet capital. We announced that we and TIFIN, one of our existing strategic balance sheet investments have come together to launch a new AI-powered conversational investment assistant. This tool seeks to combine Hamilton Lane's high-quality private markets data and intelligence with TIFIN's AI technology and capabilities and provides data-centric information around private market benchmarking, forecasting and diligence and will help educate private wealth investors and their intermediaries on the asset class. We believe this venture to be the first of its kind within the private markets and is intended for integration within the wealth platforms and digital marketplaces used by advisers and investors allocating to the private markets. It is also a powerful brand extension into this market segment for us. This NewCo was being set up as a company jointly owned directly by TIFIN, Hamilton Lane and NewCo management. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Atul to cover the financials.\nAtul Varma: Thank you, Erik, and good morning, everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, we achieved strong growth in our business, with management advisory fees of 23% versus the prior year period. Our specialized funds revenue increased $14.1 million or 32% compared to the prior year period. This was driven primarily by a $1.3 billion increase to fee earning AUM in our Evergreen platform in the last 12 months and $2.4 billion raised since inception in our latest Secondary Fund. Retro fees for the quarter were approximately $3.9 million, stemming primarily from our Secondary Fund in market versus minimal amount in the prior year period. As a reminder, investors that come into later closes during a fundraise pay retroactive fees dating back to the fund's first close. We expect to generate additional retro fees if we hold subsequent closes for Secondary Fund VI. Moving onto customized separate accounts. Revenue increased $3.3 million or 12% compared to the prior year period due to re-ups from existing clients, the addition of several new accounts and continued investment activity. Revenue from our advisory reporting and other offerings decreased $716,000 compared to the prior year period due primarily to the sale of 361 Capital asset, partially offset by increases in revenue coming from our technology solutions. Lastly, the final component of our revenue is incentive fees. Incentive fees for the quarter totaled $19.6 million and are down 60% relative to the prior year period. Recall that last fiscal year, which generated a large amount of incentive fees due to the catch-up period that several of our carry-eligible vehicles were in. Let me now turn to some additional detail on our unrealized carry balance. The balance is flat from the prior year period, while having recognized $126.9 million of incentive fees during the last 12 months. The unrealized carry balance now stands at $1.1 billion. Moving to expenses. Total expenses decreased $2.9 million compared with the prior year period. Total compensation benefits decreased by $8.1 million, driven primarily by lower compensation associated with a decreased amount of incentive fees. G&A increased $5.2 million, driven primarily by revenue-related expenses, such as third-party commissions and fund expenses as well as travel expense. Our fee-related earnings were up 23% relative to the prior year period as a result of the management fee and AUM growth discussed earlier. Before I move on, I want to take a minute and expand on a component of our third-party commissions, which will begin to increase, and this caused G&A to increase as a result of what Erik mentioned earlier around our US Evergreen product now being live on 2 wirehouses. The flows that come in through the wirehouse channels have an associated upfront distribution fee from the dollars raised there. That payment was made and applied to the total amount when those dollars close into the fund. However, the corresponding management fee we earned from those same dollars come in over the course of the year for as long as the client is invested in the fund. This creates a timing mismatch between costs of bringing those dollars in and the revenue associated with those flows. While this upfront cost is a positive as it shows we are gaining traction with the wirehouses and their clients, it will cause our G&A to increase with the eventual offsetting revenue to come in during the subsequent quarters and years. I'll wrap up here with some commentary on our balance sheet. Our largest asset continues to be our investments alongside our clients in our customized separate accounts and specialized funds. Over the long-term, we view these investments as an important component of our continued growth and we'll continue to invest our balance sheet capital alongside our clients. In regards to our liabilities, we continue to be modestly levered. And before we open up the call for Q&A, as Mario noted, this will be my last earnings call for Hamilton Lane. I will be transitioning to a senior adviser role and we'll be working closely with our incoming CFO, Jeff Armbrister, as we move into the role, ensuring a smooth and seamless transition. I'm proud of the growth we have been able to achieve during my tenure as CFO and want to sincerely thank Hamilton Lane for the opportunity to serve. With that we'll open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first just -- Atul, wish you all the best in your next adventure. It's been great working with you. So maybe just a question on the fundraising outlook. You guys have been making some good progress on the Secondary Fund. Maybe you can just remind us here what's in the market today where these funds stand in terms of raising? And what funds might make sense to come back into the market as you look out over the next 12 months? And what sort of newer strategies could we see coming to the market for raising as we look out over the next 12 months?\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Mike. It's Erik. Currently, in market and really the focus is the Secondary Fund, as I mentioned, kind of in market at least through the end of calendar 2023. Our credit fund, that strategic opportunities fund kind of a perpetual in market. So that also is there and then the three evergreen offerings. So that's really the primary focus for the sales team right now. As we look out into next year, we have a variety of other products, as you know, whether that's infrastructure, direct equity, or other pieces. And so we'll sequence those as we sort of see market conditions and as we continue to deploy capital.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kenneth Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Worthington: Hi. Good morning. Can you talk about the outlook for realized carry in the coming quarters? It seems like confidence around the macro environment has improved. And I wanted to see if you see the market backdrop improving as well. And does that drive a more constructive realization environment for you as we look into the back half of the calendar year and beginning in the following calendar year?\nMario Giannini: Hi, Ken, it's Mario. It obviously is affected very much by the macro backdrop. And as you said, that seems to be improving. That will really be a function of whether markets stay strong over the next six months. We obviously have a lot of conversations with general partners who talk about preparing companies for exits, and that would certainly have an impact on anyone's carry realizations. And if those exits happen then I suspect you would see that increase the carry numbers. But it's just very hard to say because I would say just as you look out there, it will very much depend on what happens over the course of the next six to nine months in terms of the macro-outlook. We think it looks positive, but your guess on the stock market is probably as good as ours and how strategics feel about what they want to do with acquisition activity.\nKenneth Worthington: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alexander Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlexander Blostein: Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a question around operating leverage in the business. You guys have been running with an FRE margin of about 43%, pretty consistently over the last several quarters. So curious on two fronts, I guess, one, as the platform continues to scale and given your success in Evergreen, how do you think about trajectory of FRE margins over time? And then more near-term, I was hoping you can give us maybe a framework of how to think about the near-term distribution cost impact on G&A? So I don't know if you could provide something along the lines of like a, I don't know, $1 of gross sales through the wires impacts G&A by X, and how that ultimately will translate into the management fee pickup. I'm assuming it's because based on deployed capital and that's why there's a lag, but maybe a little bit more color around that structure would be helpful. Thanks.\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Alex, it's Erik. Let me start on the first piece. I think if you look at margins, I mean I'll sort of say, I think management has continued to do a very good job. As you know, we're in a rising cost environment. We're in a rising kind of activity environment. So for us specifically, that's sort of manifesting itself in a few different ways. So there are more offices than there were sort of over the last two or three years. There are more salespeople, there are more client people. Therefore, there is more travel, more conferences and just generally more sales activity. So despite all of that, you have seen, as you noted, very consistent numbers on the FRE margin. That is, I think, both a) good cost management and b) we are seeing the operating leverage kind of kicking in, allowing us to maintain steady margin, while still increasing significantly our sort of think that as sort of our distribution activity in every way, shape and form. I think for management, we're always balancing looking at that margin with also eyeing kind of continued growth. And I think right now, our focus is primarily on setting pieces in place for continued growth, not for trying to significantly increase the margins from where they are today. We've seen the benefit of that operating leverage and I think that will continue to show itself, but we also see numerous places where we feel like there's terrific return on capital being invested to set ourselves up for new product launches, new geographic expansion and again generally new sales activity. Turning to your second question. As Atul said, there's a timing issue here, which is when on these wirehouses, and I'm sure you have seen this with the other players who are in those channels and have been for longer than us. That wire house is essentially capturing a kind of onetime distribution fee paid at the time of the subscription, whereas the client itself is paying that management fee over time to us. So that upfront cost comes at the beginning and then the revenue to us kind of comes later. So that's really what Atul is saying. It's just a timing issue as to when we're paying out versus when we're kind of recouping.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Adam Beatty of UBS Financial. Please go ahead.\nAdam Beatty: Thank you and good morning and all the best to Atul. Just wanted to ask about the conversational investment assistant and the NewCo that you're developing around that. Just curious as to kind of operationally what's envisioned in terms of the user base, would it mainly be FAs or end clients or headquarters or some mix of that? Also interested in any either feedback or development participation that you've gotten from the wirehouses or other big distributors with that? And finally, how much of a kind of white label product is it going to be? Will the involvement of Hamilton Lane and TIFIN be visible to kind of the end users or more transparent? Thank you.\nErik Hirsch: Sure. Adam, it's Erik. I'll take that. I think as we step back and look at what's happening in private wealth, what do we know? We know interest level is high. And we, frankly, no knowledge is not as high as interest level is. And so there is an educational mismatch that is occurring in the market as this asset class is newer to those participants. I think for us, we're focused on two things. One, expanding our brand into that channel and two, arming those participants with good data and good market intelligence. We believe that as people are more knowledgeable, their comfort in investing will rise. So what TIFIN and Hamilton Lane have come together is to kind of create this AI chatbot. And the target audience is the financial adviser, distribution will be done by NewCo, led by the TIFIN sales team. If you look at where TIFIN's products are deployed now, that is where they are deployed. Magnifi, as an example, is one of their other large products, also AI-driven. And so think about this chatbot as being able to be distributed directly into the FA channel. But I think more powerfully think about it as something that could be incorporated into a broader software offering already on those platforms. So those financial advisers are tapped into a variety of technologies, some of it kind of parent technology-driven, the AI chatbot can really be an add-on piece to that. And again, in some simplistic terms, think about it as a tool that is going to allow a financial adviser to ask a question such as what was top quartile performance for the 2016 vintage year, or in 2018, did private credit outperform or underperform private equity? And then that chatbot is giving them quantitative data charts and analysis that is powered by that Hamilton Lane database, immediately back to them in a user-friendly way. Again, trying to better educate, better empower them to make good decisions. So we see this as a very large addressable market. We see this as a market today where we frankly don't really see kind of a competitive landscape. And we see ourselves as having a good first mover advantage and partnered with somebody who has already had broad success in that channel.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Mike Brown of KBW. Please go ahead.\nMichael Brown: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question. So this quarter, you had some retroactive fees. It sounds like there may be more, but I just wanted to, I guess, ask about how we should think about the fee rate starting point for next quarter? And maybe any views into how the catch-up fees could compare to this quarter? And then just longer term, what innings do you think you guys are in, in terms of the fee rate mix shift dynamic here?\nErik Hirsch: Sure, Mike. It's Erik. I'll take that. If you look at what's been happening, I mean, the fee rate has been sort of gently moving up into the right. And as we noted, kind of driven by really two pieces. One, faster growth in specialized funds than separate account and in particular, the power of that evergreen dollar, as I noted, being worth on a gross revenue basis kind of 4X what a typical separate account dollar is worth. So in terms of inning, I mean we think we're in very early innings for the Evergreen product. But again, we're running a marathon here, not a sprint. So we're proud of kind of the $4 plus billion that we're at today. But again, we've only been at this for a few years, and we look around and see other participants that have a sort of 10 to 15 plus year history and we sort of look at that as something that we sort of aspire to. So we see this as early. So to the extent that that -- those two things happen together that those specialized funds, including Evergreen continues to grow faster, you're going to see that sort of rate shift continue to sort of move over to the right. On the retro fee piece, again, we're looking into a crystal ball. But if you look at us historically, our fundraisers have tended to be a little bit barbelled. So bigger activity at the very beginning, a little bit quieter in the middle and then bigger at the end. So to the extent that we come into the Secondary Fund as we have with past products with very strong fundraising towards the back end of the fund raise, those larger amounts raised relative to what we're raising today, coupled with a longer time period is going to result in retro fees being higher going forward for those subsequent closes.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line Finian O'Shea of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nFinian O'Shea: Hi, everyone. Good morning. Just a high-level question on the private equity secondaries market and how you're seeing the opportunity play out. Would you say it's sort of a golden age like they say for private credit, where you're seeing great terms, great returns or is there something like less supply or more competition holding that back? Thank you.\nMario Giannini: Finian, it's Mario. On the credit market question, I don't know that I termed a golden age, anytime anyone says a golden age, you look back and go, well, you shouldn't have said it was a golden age. But there are a lot of secular trends that are favoring private credit. One is just higher interest rates. So that's good. All of the regional bank issues in the United States as people have talked about has pulled credit back in a lot of areas and private credit has certainly been a beneficiary of that. The scale of some of these private credit platforms -- there was news this morning that one private credit provider had basically supplanted bank capital and doing a fairly large deal, I think you'll see more of that going forward. The terms are far better because there's obviously less competition as some of the banks have pulled out and some of the other players. So I would say that, yes, the private credit market is having a very good time in here. And as long as you believe that credit will continue to be a little tighter in the bank markets and in the public markets then that will certainly be the case. And no one can really know how long that will last.\nErik Hirsch: And Finian, it's Erik, I'll take the second part of that on the secondary space. I think that really depends on what part of the market you're looking at, I mean, one, secondary has not been a golden era right now. It might become that, although as the markets continue to rebound, that seems increasingly unlikely. You certainly have seen little pockets of distressed selling on kind of traditional LP portfolios. Some pricing there has gotten more interesting. On the GP-led deals, pricing there has been less interesting. Those deals that are getting done, and I repeat getting done, tend to be more trophy assets, and so pricing there continues to be tighter. So opportunity set, interesting but again, I think to echo Mario's point on the credit side, nothing that we would deem today to be kind of golden era like.\nOperator: Thank you. We have a follow-up question from the line of Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Maybe just sticking with credit. It seems the deployment that you guys had in the quarter was pretty healthy. Maybe you can just help contextualize that and talk about some of the areas where you guys are seeing some of the most compelling opportunities to put that to work in your credit strat ops? And then more broadly on credit, maybe you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking about further expanding your credit platform, whether it's in terms of investment and sourcing capabilities, as well as vehicles and funds that you might be able to bring to the marketplace over the next couple of years?\nMario Giannini: Michael, it's Mario. Yes. I mean in terms of the investment opportunity on the credit side, I don't know that we're looking at any one area that is particularly more interesting than another. I think as you -- as the credit landscape I described, it's across the entire landscape. It's companies large and small. It's companies in all industries. And so when we look at where the opportunity set is, it really is more a function of does the risk return profile on a particular company look interesting to us. And I would say that is true in different kinds of situations, whether it's a robust cash flow company or a company that needs additional capital for whatever reasons. It just isn't one of those situations where you say, oh, this segment is particularly more interesting than another. I think it is across the entire scale of what's going on in the credit markets. In terms of additional products, in terms of additional areas, sure, we're always looking at that. But I would say that the basic opportunity set is robust enough and the areas for expansion across that basic opportunity set are strong enough that I don't know that you need to reach for new additional products or new additional areas and say that that's the way to expand or that's the way you have to do it, but I think that the credit market in general is offering a good amount of opportunities.\nOperator: Thank you. We have another follow-up question from the line of Kenneth Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKenneth Worthington: Great. Thank you. Also on credit, I think you're on strategic opportunities, 13. How much has been raised thus far in that fund? And actually, at what point do you transition to 14? And then a separate question for Secondary VI, what is the cadence of closings that you would expect through the end of the calendar year? Is it likely we'll see two more closings before time runs out? And is there the option to extend fundraising into 2024, if there is demand?\nErik Hirsch: Ken, it's Erik. So on the credit question, so we're actually on Fund VIII. We aspire for 13. We'll hope to get there eventually. But we're on Fund VIII, and if you look at the last couple of years, we've basically been raising between $700 million and $900 million per series. And remember that those are annual series. And so -- we've raised -- we're -- that cadence isn't changing for where we are with eight versus the others. So we'll continue to be in market through the end of the calendar year. And then we will sort of turn our attention to the next in the series, which will be nine. On the Secondary Fund, again, a little crystal ballish. So we're always trying to figure out when to have the right close. That's a balance of how much capital is in. And wanting to sort of just make sure that we're managing expenses and a good client experience et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. If I'm crystal balling, I would guess that we have at least two closes between now and the end of the calendar year. And then we're going to just have to assess where we are, what LP demand looks like, what the market looks like and whether we want to think about looking for an extension. We have in the past, on occasion, done that, so it's not something that we're unfamiliar with. And if we think that's the right decision for the customer and for the best investment results, we would certainly consider that.\nOperator: Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. So I'd like to take this opportunity to transfer the call back over to Erik Hirsch for closing remarks.\nErik Hirsch: Great. Again, thank you for the time today. Thank you for the questions. Thank you for the interest and wishing everyone a good rest of summer.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."
