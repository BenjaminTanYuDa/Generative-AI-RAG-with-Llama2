        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Research Solutions, Inc. Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Beisler, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJohn Beisler: Thank you, Betsy and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the Research Solutions second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings call. On the call today are Roy W. Olivier, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Nurthen, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed this afternoon, the company issued a press release announcing its results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This release is available on the company's website, researchsolutions.com. Before Roy and Bill begin their prepared remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the statements made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied due to a variety of factors. We refer you to Research Solutions' recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact the company's future operating results and financial condition. Also on today's call, management will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful information for investors. A reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures is included in the earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. Finally, I would like to remind everyone this call is recorded and made available for replay via a link on the company's website. I would now like to turn the call over to Roy W. Olivier. Roy?\nRoy Olivier: Thank you, John and thanks to everyone joining us for our second quarter fiscal 2024 results. While there are a lot of moving pieces in this quarter's results which Bill will help walk you through, I do want to take a minute to report a few milestones for the business. First, our core platform revenue from Article Galaxy and references is above $10 million in ARR for the first time. Second, our total ARR is now over $15 million for the first time. Third, the addition of scite and Resolute are positioning the company well for the future. The new products from these acquisitions and the products we can build using the combined technology of the 3 companies, positions the company to provide competitive and unique functionality across the research workflow and into other departments in most research-intensive organizations. I'll speak more about that in detail after Bill walks you through our fiscal second quarter 2024 results. Bill?\nWilliam Nurthen: Thank you, Roy and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everyone that our second quarter results include a full quarter's contribution from the acquisition of ResoluteAI on July 28 and approximately 1 month of contribution from the scite acquisition which closed on December 1. For fiscal year-to-date numbers, there are approximately 5 months of ResoluteAI and 1 month of scite factored into the numbers. Another item I would like to discuss before going deeper into the numbers is that, the scite acquisition brings with it a material amount of what we classify as B2C recurring subscription revenue. This is revenue from individual subscribers who are typically students or research professionals that subscribe to the services through scite's website and make automatic payment on either a monthly or annual subscription basis. I wanted to help everyone understand how we are accounting for those subscriptions from both an annual recurring revenue, or ARR perspective and from a revenue recognition perspective. For the purposes of calculating ARR, in our financial and operational summary tables, we have separated out what we call B2B ARR and B2C ARR. B2B ARR consists of annual subscription agreements with corporations, academic institutions and government entities. We have contracts with those entities across the Research Solutions, ResoluteAI and scite product platforms and everything is aggregated across those product lines for the purposes of calculating B2B ARR. B2C ARR consists of individual subscriptions, some of which are annual but most of which are month-to-month. For the purposes of calculating B2C ARR, we aggregate the monthly subscriptions by taking their monthly subscription amount and multiplying it by 12. Please see today's press release for further information regarding how we define and use annual recurring revenue and other non-GAAP terms. Lastly, for the purposes of revenue recognition, all revenue resulting from our portfolio of B2B and B2C software products is flowing through the platforms line in our profit and loss statements. With that, I'll start going through some of the numbers. Total revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $10.3 million, an 18% increase from the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our Platform subscription revenue increased 48% to $3.1 million. The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by the acquisitions of ResoluteAI and scite, as well as organic growth in our core Article Galaxy platform. We ended the quarter with $15.6 million in annual recurring revenue, up 77% year-over-year. scite contributed almost $4.4 million of the ARR which was a good outcome when you consider at the time of acquisition, we announced that their ARR as of the end of October was roughly $3.6 million. Article Galaxy also had a strong quarter with net incremental ARR for the quarter being the best result in the last 4 quarters. On a stand-alone basis, Article Galaxy ARR is now over $10 million. The growth in scite and Article Galaxy was offset by some churn in ResoluteAI. We do expect some continued churn in that product over the next 6 months before it stabilizes. However, we still feel there is tremendous value in the technology that was acquired as part of that transaction. Our Transaction revenue increased almost 9% from the second quarter of fiscal 2023 to $7.2 million and our total active customer count for the quarter was 1,398, a net increase of 175 from the same period a year ago. The increases are primarily due to organic growth, notably in the academic segment of the business which was enhanced by higher transaction volumes and contracts transferred related to the FIZ Karlsruhe acquisition effective January 1, 2023. I will note that we are now at a point where the FIZ transaction will anniversary itself starting in our Q3. This will slow the growth rate we have seen over the past 4 quarters in transactions. However, we still do expect organic growth on this line for the foreseeable future. Gross margin for the second quarter was 43.5%, a 450 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2023. The increase is due to the ongoing revenue mix shift towards our higher-margin platforms businesses, as well as some modest increases in transaction margins. The Platform business recorded gross margin of 84.4%, a decrease compared to 88% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is related to the inclusion of Resolute's platform revenues which generate a lower margin. Gross margin on Article Galaxy remained consistent with recent history and the gross margin of scite's products are similar to that of Article Galaxy. Gross margin in our Transaction business increased 230 basis points to 25.7%. The increase was primarily due to increased copyright margins, aided by better fixed cost coverage due to the higher order volume. We did lower some copyright reserves in the quarter which also contributed to the increase. So I would expect this number to fall back to somewhere between 24% and 25% on a more normalized basis going forward. Total operating expenses in the quarter were $4.9 million compared to $3.7 million in the prior year quarter. A little over $700,000 of the year-over-year variance comes from the addition of the cost basis of Resolute and scite. In addition, this quarter's results included roughly $300,000 in costs associated with the acquisition of scite, as well as other M&A activities in the quarter. Net loss for the quarter was $54,000 or roughly breakeven on a per share basis compared to a net loss of $256,000 or $0.01 per share in the prior year quarter. Given some of the churn in Resolute, we did reduce a portion of their contingent earn-out liability which generated some below-the-line income in the other income category of our operations statement. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $318,000 compared to $201,000 in the year-ago quarter. It is important to note that the adjusted EBITDA result includes the aforementioned $300,000 of acquisition-related expenses in the quarter and as a result, would have been $625,000 on a more normalized basis. Turning to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2023, was $2.7 million versus $13.5 million on June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the cash used for the Resolute and scite acquisitions which was approximately $10 million. We also had heavy outlays in Q1 related to the proxy issues which have since been resolved, as well as costs related to our M&A activities. Despite continuing to incur expenses related to the M&A activities in Q2, we were able to generate $300,000 in cash flow from operations in the quarter. We expect our cash flow to improve as we move on from a number of these one-time expenditures and more fully integrate the acquisitions into our business. Additionally, we have experienced some good growth in cash in the early part of Q3. As we look ahead, Q3 and Q4 will be much cleaner from an expense perspective which will give us an opportunity to demonstrate the profitability of the business. We will have some M&A-related costs in the first month of Q3 but should not incur much after that. From a year-to-date perspective, recall that, one, we had roughly $700,000 in costs related to the proxy matter and an additional $300,000 in M&A-related expenses. In Q2, most of the proxy costs were behind us but we still had $300,000 in M&A-related expenses. Those expenses collectively total about $1.3 million year-to-date and are included in the year-to-date adjusted EBIT loss of $100,000. In Q3 and Q4, we are aiming to produce a more normalized adjusted EBITDA result and see that results improve over time as we further integrate the acquisitions. From a cash perspective, we are targeting to improve cash flow as well. However, it should be noted that cash flow will likely lag behind adjusted EBITDA for the next 6 months. This is related to working off some deferred revenue associated with the acquisitions, paying off some of the one-time-type items that were previously discussed and paying down some severances that were previously expensed. All this said, I think Roy and I feel very good about where the business stands today. Despite some of the proxy matters in Q1 which affected our profitability and cash position, we were able to execute on our acquisition strategy and now feel like we have the pieces in place to grow the business and realize the profit potential that will come from our ongoing mix shift to higher-margin platform revenues. I'll now turn the call back to Roy. Roy?\nRoy Olivier: Thanks, Bill. I'm going to address several issues on today's call but I'd like to start with what we plan on doing with acquisitions and the acquired products going forward. As a reminder, scite is an advanced discovery tool or a search tool focused on scientific, technical and medical content. It has a full tech search capability for most published articles and has a great user interface. It also includes a citation badge that helps the researcher understand how often the article they are looking at has been cited by other papers. In addition to showing how many times the article has been cited, it shows the number of supporting, mentioning and contrasting statements in that article based on scite's unique learning model. Think of this as a FICO score or a Rotten Tomatoes score for the article that user is looking at. It has been successful in academic and corporate segments worldwide. The B2B corporate and academic ARR is about $400,000 and the ARR associated with the B2C version used by academic and corporate researchers is about $4 million as of the end of the quarter. scite's product have been successful, largely based on their full tech search capabilities, the AI assistant and their unique citation badge. Resolute has a similar advanced discovery tool but with some very specific differences. In addition to searching available scientific, technical and medical content, research products, research -- I'm sorry, Resolute products also have over 10 external databases connected. So search results show the scientific, technical and medical content, plus whatever the external databases return if they are turned on. Some of those databases include clinical trial information, patent data, FDA databases, financial information and more. Think of this capacity is providing a 360-degree view of the search, not just STM or scientific, technical and medical articles. The advanced version of Resolute's platform provides for enterprise search capability. Think of this as searching the customers' internal databases. Some examples include scientific notebooks, videos and other data. Resolute built a very flexible and capable product but did not build specific workflows to solve specific problems for the customer. In my opinion, the Resolute technology was a black box with very advanced capabilities that had to be programmed to do specific tasks like identifying key opinion leaders, post-market surveillance and other solutions. As such, the user interface and the workflow was built largely on a case-by-case basis. Moving forward, we are executing on what we call a one search strategy where we will bring these tools together and then build solutions for our customers that will address specific problems that they are working on. scite will be our front-end and user interface layer with Resolute adding the external and enterprise search capability. scite will be our STM or scientific, technical and medical search tool, scite Pro will be scite plus Resolute's external databases and scite Enterprise will be scite plus Resolute's enterprise search and external databases. We will then use these tools to build new solutions that service the needs of other departments in research-intensive organizations. The initial solutions we build are technology landscape, solutions, clinical trial solutions, key opinion leader, identification, competitive intelligence modules, a patent data and more. We will also be releasing an enhanced post-market surveillance and the patent module. These modules are key to our long-term growth objectives. The first release will be the tech landscape module which will launch this quarter with clinical trials coming in our Q4 fiscal 2024. The remaining modules will launch late this fiscal year or in the first half of fiscal 2025. So what does this do to our total addressable market and serviceable addressable market? The answer is simple. It expands it exponentially. The current IR deck shows that a couple of years ago, we offered solutions that serviced one part of the life sciences innovation value chain. Previous to these acquisitions, we organically built additional capacity that addressed 4 areas of the value chain. Not only does Resolute and scite add to the 4 areas we already serve, it also allows us to service a total of 13 areas of the value chain going forward. For the first time, we can also provide solutions to areas outside of scientific, technical and medical content and life sciences. Two-plus years ago, I set a BHAG, B-H-A-G of $20 million in ARR in 3 years. In October of 2024, I will have been this formal CEO for 3 years. We are at $15.6 million in ARR as of 12/31. So I'm confident that we'll be close to $20 million by October but likely a bit short. I'm happy that we did not aggressively acquire someone when valuations were still at or near top of the market. That said, our BHAG has been adjusted up to $30 million in ARR by the end of fiscal 2026, almost double where we are now. We believe this number can be hit through all organic growth with the product portfolio we have today and no further acquisitions. In addition, margins should expand as we approach this goal and we would expect the overall EBITDA margin at that point to be in the double digits. I want to reiterate this is not guidance, this is our BHAG. Now, this is not to say that we will not continue to evaluate and acquire companies that align with our shareholder return objectives in addition to our business and product strategy. We expect to continue to focus on providing solutions throughout the research workflow and the innovation value chain. Regarding what I recently referred to as acquisition number 4, we have decided not to pursue that opportunity further. While we are excited about the technology, some items in the diligence did not meet our threshold. We will continue to be disciplined about acquisitions moving forward. We do have other opportunities that we will continue to investigate. However, we will be more selective over the next 2 or 3 quarters to allow us to focus on getting our new strategy and the integration of the various products underway. Early returns on Resolute have not been in line with our financial expectations as we have experienced customer churn, some of which was expected when we signed the deal. We have developed a strong pipeline for new prospects. However, it should be noted that these products have the longest sales cycle of any products we offer. On the other hand, we have been encouraged to find that the core technology is as strong as we believed it was and we remain confident that we can utilize that technology in the new solutions described earlier. And that those solutions will be more relevant to our customers. We have added 2 senior sales executives selling that product and expect to see some results in the form of new sales in the second half of the fiscal year. Conversely, the early days of scite has shown -- has overperformed to our expectations on B2C and B2B. Our belief was that we could cross-sell scite into our academic and corporate customer base through our existing sales teams. Those teams are trained and doing demos now. In just the past few weeks, we've closed $50,000 new ARR on what was a $400,000 B2B business and we have a very robust pipeline going forward. We're excited about our prospects as we integrate scite's best-in-class capability with Resolute's extensive external and enterprise data capabilities and tie that integration with our industry-leading document delivery platform. In closing, I'll say that the entire management team believes that we now have the building blocks in place that will allow us to transform Research Solutions from a document delivery company to a software solutions provider that can compete with anyone in the space. We're very excited about our future and we'll continue to report our progress in our future calls. With that, I'd now like to turn it back over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Allen Klee with Maxim Group.\nAllen Klee: Congrats on the quarter. Could you talk about why you think guide has been performing so well? And then you also said that Article Galaxy was your best quarter. What's -- what do you think turned that around?\nRoy Olivier: Yes. Alan, in terms of scite, I would say a couple of things. One is, I think, scite being part of a larger public organization has really helped its B2B prospects feel more comfortable with acquiring that platform. So I think that's helped accelerate some sales or even close some sales that maybe would not have closed because scite was a small independent company with a few employees. We now offer 24/7 technical support. We have a whole onboarding team to help onboard customers. We have larger sales and support organization. So I think that's really helped increase the velocity of some of the B2B business. The B2C business has actually a very predictable investment return conversion rate. In other words, if we invest in digital marketing, it typically results in a certain amount of trials and those trials convert at a very predictable rate. So we have been ratcheting up digital marketing spend on the B2C side and we see those results literally in days or weeks, whereas, as you know, we have at least a 20-week or typically about an average 20-, 22-week sales cycle for Article Galaxy and a longer sales cycle for Resolute. So we're able to basically move that needle very quickly by investing more in marketing. Bill, anything you want to add to the scite comments?\nWilliam Nurthen: No, I think that's good, Roy.\nRoy Olivier: Yes. On the AG comments, I think that we're seeing the new new sales teams pick up the pace; they're doing a nice job. We've closed a number of large deals. We actually closed the largest deal that we've closed in since I've been with the company during the quarter. And we're seeing pretty good success with larger deals which is encouraging to me because there was a period there where we were closing a lot of new logos but they weren't -- the average revenue per customer was not as high as we'd like it to be. So I think new news starting to perform well. Part of that is marketing is driving, I think, a nice amount of leads into that new new team. I think our challenge going forward is taking what's working on the Article Galaxy. Article Galaxy references new new team and applying it to upsells and scite and Resolute products. Bill, anything you want to add to that?\nWilliam Nurthen: Yes. I think I would say it was our best quarter in the last 4 quarters but just recall the last 4 quarters have been kind of coming down steadily. So this was a nice rebound for us this quarter and we saw a nice bounce back. Not -- it was bounced up product with a rate that is acceptable to us but not quite sort of the rates we've seen before we started talking to you about some of the issues with the economy hitting the sales process there. To Roy's point, new new has been performing very well. So new sales are coming through strong. I think where we're still struggling a bit, at least for this year is on the expansion upsell side of things. Last year, we launched References which was a big catalyst to upsells. We don't have as much catalyst going into the fiscal year. So running a little bit behind there but it was nice to see the platform sales turnaround in Q2 and we're hoping that's going to -- that's a trend that will continue on for the rest of the fiscal year.\nAllen Klee: Then also on scite, you mentioned that most of the ARR is with the B2C business and that while you have some annual customers, it's mostly under monthly subscription. So do you have enough data to have a sense of the churn of that? How confident can we say those monthly customers will be annual customers? Do you have a sense of that?\nRoy Olivier: Do you want to take that, Bill?\nWilliam Nurthen: Yes. I would say, we don't have enough data yet. And that's part of the reason we definitely wanted to separate this out on a separate line to really isolate it and give investors view of sort of the changes in that over time. We are going to kind of look at it and continue to monitor it. I also will say that we do recognize that B2C tends to obviously have higher churn rates. We did see higher churn rates from that business in the diligence. However, what I would say is, we're already hard at work on things to do to basically make that product more sticky and reduce the churn rates in that segment. So there's some software we're using to help reduce churn but there's also things that we can do from a pricing and packaging perspective, we think, to reduce churn in that segment. And so, I think as we learn more over the next few quarters, we'll be able to discuss that in a little more detail with investors.\nRoy Olivier: Yes. And I would just remind everybody that net churn rate in scite B2C is higher than we want it to be. That said, it's net ARR growth for the short time that we owned it went from $3.6 million to $4 million. So it continues to show a really strong growth profile in spite of its churn, we all, I think, are on the same page in terms of if we can cut that churn down. It's just going to accelerate the growth even more.\nAllen Klee: My last question is on incremental ARR. Is there -- you have more moving pieces now. So I was curious, do you have an internal target for what you shoot for each quarter?\nRoy Olivier: Well, Research Solutions, definitely had very detailed budgets of what we expected in all of various sales categories. scite did not but we have applied our kind of planning to scite. So we now do have specific targets for B2B. We really don't have specific targets for B2C other than continue the growth rate you're growing because that is a new kind of animal to us. We've been a strong B2B player for years. B2C is relatively new for us. That said, scite has some very experienced B2C people that are doing a great job. And then I think on Resolute, we did put a plan together. And I think on the top line, Resolute's not where we wanted them to be on the EBITDA line they are. scite's overperforming on both lines and Research Solutions is doing a nice job on new new. But we continue to see a little bit of softness on upsells and more churn than we would like to see.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Roy Olivier for any closing remarks.\nRoy Olivier: Yes. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today. We will be participating in the ROTH Conference in Dana Point, California on March 18 and 19. Qualified investors that would like to attend or schedule a meeting should contact their ROTH sales representative. We look forward to speaking with you in May to discuss our third quarter results and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

As a reminder, the conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Beisler Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nJohn Beisler: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the Research Solutions First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. On the call today are Roy Olivier, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Nurthen, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed this afternoon, the company issued a press release announcing its results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The release is available on the company's website at researchsolutions.com. Before Roy and Bill begin their prepared remarks, I would like to remind you that some of the statements made today will be forward-looking and are made under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied due to a variety of factors. We refer you to Research Solutions' recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the risks that could impact the company's future operating results and financial condition. Also on today's call, management will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful information for investors. A reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures is included in the earnings press release issued this afternoon. Finally, I would like to remind everyone that this call will be recorded and made available for replay via a link on the company's website. I would now like to turn the call over to Roy W. Olivier, Roy?\nRoy Olivier: Thank you, John, and thanks to everyone for joining us for our first quarter fiscal 2024 results. During the quarter, we had some great things going on, including record ARR of over $11 million, 16% overall revenue growth and completing the acquisition of Resolute data AI. This acquisition will help us launch an advanced discovery or a search tool, which has been the number one requested tool by our customers. It will also help us create new sources of revenue, both in terms of new products and in new workflows that expand our total addressable market and represent a strong cross-sell opportunity for us. There's a lot of things good going on around the business, including in the marketing, sales, product and M&A segments, which I'll discuss with you in more detail after Bill's comments. The quarter is a bit messy in terms of our EBITDA performance due to several costs that Bill will discuss in detail. I'm happy with the core business EBITDA performance in Q1. I'd like to pass the call over to Bill to walk through our fiscal first quarter 2021 financial results in detail, and then I'll wrap up with some comments. Bill?\nWilliam Nurthen: Thank you, Roy, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everyone that our first quarter results include the acquisition of Resolute AI on July 28 and as such, are inclusive of approximately 2 months of results from Resolute. Please note that we have integrated Resolute's operations into our existing business. And as a result, it will not be practical to report on Resolute as a separate entity. That said, given it was only part of our operations for 2 months this quarter, I am able to provide some insight for this quarter only as to how it affected our ARR and P&L performance. Lastly, it should be noted, Resolute's revenue is all captured on the platforms line of our P&L. Total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $10.1 million, a 16% increase from the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The growth rate, excluding Resolute was approximately 13%. Our platform subscription revenue increased 29% to $2.6 million. The growth was primarily driven by a net increase of platform deployments from last year and the contribution from Resolute, which added a little over $200,000 of platform revenue for the quarter. We ended the quarter with $11 million in annual recurring revenue, up 32% year-over-year, reflecting our continued sales and upselling efforts, low churn of existing platform subscribers and approximately $1.35 million of new ARR associated with the Resolute transaction. Please see today's press release for how we define and use annual recurring revenue and other non-GAAP items. Our transaction revenue increased almost 12% from the first quarter of fiscal 2023 to $7.5 million, and our total active customer count for the quarter was 1,395, a net increase of 175 from the same period a year ago. The increases are primarily due to organic growth, with additional growth resulting from higher transaction volumes related to contracts transferred from the FIZ Karlsruhe transaction effective on January 1, 2023. Gross margin for the first quarter was 40.1%, a 150-basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2023. The increase is due to the ongoing revenue mix shift towards our higher-margin Platforms business. The Platform business recorded gross margin of 85.3%, a decrease compared to 88.6% in the prior year quarter. The decrease is related to the inclusion of Resolute's platform revenues, which generate a lower margin. Going forward, as we consolidate Resolute into our business, I suspect our platform gross margin will decrease. However, it should remain in a range between 80% and 85%. Gross margin in our Transaction business increased 90 basis points to 24.3%. The increase was primarily attributable to pricing initiatives, resulting in increased copyright margins. Total operating expenses in the quarter were $5.1 million compared to $3.2 million in the prior year quarter. This quarter's results include roughly $1.2 million related to a series of unique items, including $542,000 in proxy-related expenses, $339,000 in legal costs associated with our M&A activities and $280,000 in costs associated with the termination of our former Executive Chairman. These costs all appear on the G&A line of the P&L with the exception of about $80,000 of that cost, which is classified as stock compensation. In addition, Resolute added approximately $300,000 of operating costs in the quarter, most of which appear on the technology and product development line of the P&L. Lastly, stock compensation was also up an additional amount of roughly $333,000 related to the expense from the long-term equity bonus plan where restricted stock shares vest at higher stock prices, which is not implemented until Q2 of last year. Net loss for the quarter was $988,000 or $0.04 per share compared to net income of $215,000 or $0.01 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $441,000 compared to a positive $433,000 in the year ago quarter. Excluding the unique items I previously noted, adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $637,000. Turning to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2023, were $9.9 million versus $13.5 million on June 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the cash used for the Resolute acquisition in payments related to the FIZ acquisition, which collectively totaled about $2.8 million. We did burn approximately $750,000 of cash in the quarter, primarily related to excess legal costs associated with the M&A activities and the proxy matter and the fact that Resolute is presently in a cash burn situation. In addition, I will remind everyone that we pay our executive bonuses and sales commission overages for the prior fiscal year in Q1. As we look ahead, going forward, there are a few key items I would like to know. First, our P&L should be less impacted by the items that affected us in Q1. The proxy costs and separation costs related to the former Executive Chairman have, for the most part, all been expensed. That said, we will continue to work heavily on M&A in Q2 and should expect higher than normal costs related to M&A through Q2 before it tails off from there starting in Q3. Second, performance will still be hampered by a number of factors in Q2. Although expensed still have some bills to pay from the proxy matter will pay out the separation cost of the former Executive Chairman over time. When you combine this with the high M&A costs and Resolute still being in a burn position, Q2 will be another quarter of cash burn. Third, is that cash burn from Resolute will reduce over time and be offset by core cash flow performance as our business gets past the unique items affecting it in Q1 and Q2. Fourth, I will remind everyone that we have stated we are working on 2 other acquisitions, and both of these acquisitions are cash flow positive and will contribute to cash flow when they close. The net of all this is that I believe we will see improved P&L performance in Q2. However, cash flow will continue to be effective. Once we hit Q3, however, as these items and see an improved, more normalized run rate for the business. As I've stated in the past, we have unique items impacting the business currently and indeed, these items are material, anything that represents a change to the profit and cash flow profile of the business that we saw as we exited fiscal year 2023. Additionally, we are working on acquisitions that I think will positively affect those numbers. I'll now turn the call back to Roy. Roy?\nRoy Olivier: Thanks, Bill. The quarter was promising in terms of new business as our collective bookings of new existing and Article Galaxy Scholar showed strong growth versus last year. All 3 of those areas overperformed expectation, which is a nice improvement over last year's results and speaks to the improvements we have made in sales process, sales materials and marketing lead generation efforts. We underperformed expectations in churn and in upsells. While our net churn rates continue to be over 100%, we remain concerned about our performance in those areas as some of our customers are downsizing or continue to operate with tight budgets. The good news is that we are seeing very strong lead generation results in the past 2 months, which leads us to believe that we will see continued strong performance in the new, new and new existing sales teams. We've also not seen any material change in our competitive position. Very little churn is due to competitive takeaways. And the upsell headwinds continue to be a function of our customers tightening their spending. We did launch some new pricing bundles to drive additional upsells in Q2 that are generating a nice pipeline that we think will help in Q2 and Q3. Turning to product. We did several releases during the quarter, including expanding our AI-related offerings in the platform. We released our beta ChatGPT assistant to expand our capability in the platform, allowing our customers to quickly create ChatGPT article reviews for supported publishers. This is in addition to our AI-based recommendation engine in Article Galaxy and our post-market surveillance tool, where we accelerate the review process using this technology. We have one small sale with the Resolute AI product during the quarter. As a reminder, most of the value creation with this product will be through cross-sell activities, which are dependent on product enhancements. We remain on track to include document delivery inside the Resolute AI platform, advanced discovery or search tools in the Article Galaxy platform and several new workflows in Q2 and Q3, which is when we can expect to start generating revenue, primarily in the back half of fiscal 2024. We did bring on a new enterprise sales professional that will focus on the Resolute products, both new and upsells. He has extensive experience selling these products for publishers, and we remain excited about the possibilities as we move forward. With the proxy matter largely behind us, we are focused on executing our plan and are closely monitoring employee morale and engagement so we can make sure that there are no distractions to hitting our goals for Q2 and the remainder of the year. Regarding M&A, we continue to work on 2 additional acquisitions, barring any diligence problems, we expect to close one of them shortly. As a reminder, both are accretive to our growth objectives and our EBITDA objectives. In addition, they both represent a strong cross-sell opportunity and line up with our long-term product strategy. Regarding our outlook for fiscal 2024, I have a next view. I do remain concerned about the economic headwinds impacting our upsell and churn rates, which in turn will affect our overall growth rate. That said, the acquisitions we are working on, if and when they close, will result in strong ARR as we roll into fiscal 2025, and they will result in nice EBITDA growth as well. I'm also confident that we will produce respectable bottom line performance versus last year from our base business as we put the proxy matter behind us and wind down our M&A activities. In my mind, our biggest challenge for fiscal 2024 and the beginning of 2025, will be to effectively integrate the products we have acquired and transition our sales and marketing efforts to successfully cross-sell those products. In short, we will be focused on integrating what we have acquired, resulting in us being much more selective about what other[indiscernible] in the future. I am excited about the months ahead for our business. As we execute on our plans, I think it will give investors a much clearer picture regarding what we are trying to build. I think we have a great opportunity to finish the back half of the year with a great deal of momentum, which will be evident both in our integrated product suite and our financial performance. We will be presenting at the Roth Technology Conference in New York next week on November 15 and the Southwest IDEAS Conference in Dallas on November 16. Qualified investors that would like to attend or schedule a meeting should contact 3-part advisers. With that, I'd like to turn it over to the operator for Q&A. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Baldry of Roth MKM.\nRichard Baldry: Thanks. When I back out the onetime items from the OpEx side, it's well below your recent trends and even it looks like a little bit down year-over-year. Were there any onetime things that held back the normalized spend, I might have thought it would go up a little bit even given Resolute's integration.\nRoy Olivier: Bill, do you want to touch that?\nWilliam Nurthen: Yes, no, if understand your question correctly, Rich, we basically held tight on a lot of other spend just given some of what we knew was coming with the proxy cost and the M&A-related costs. I'll also say as we budget for a fiscal year at times, we'll put a few new heads in the budget, but it does take some time to get them on board and hired and that might have affected things a little bit as well. But we tried to run it pretty tight, knowing we're going to have some of these costs hit us in the quarter.\nRichard Baldry: And when you talk about customers have been asking for a search feature top of their list. Can you walk through what you need to do to integrate Resolute in its technologies into the core platform? Are there meaningful challenges to that? Or is it just blocking tackling APIs, basic stuff?\nRoy Olivier: I would say it's probably somewhere between basic and complex. However, we expect that integration to be complete and the first version of that product to be released late Q2, early Q3, and then we'll continue to enhance it from there. And what I mean by that is we have 2 different platforms that in the first version will link to each other, so you would do the search and resolute and then jump over to Article Galaxy. Where we want to go ultimately is that the platform is completely integrated into Article Galaxy. So you don't have 2 things talking to each other. You have one seamless experience. But V1, which gets us to cross-sell capability is sometime between very late this quarter and very early in Q3.\nRichard Baldry: And last maybe, the cash came down a little bit. You did the acquisition in the quarter. Talk about when you're looking at other acquisitions, how comfortable are you with the cash position? Or how comfortable carrying debt for at least an intermediate period of time? Would you look to use more equity as the cash balance comes down just for less understand the funding backdrop to those M&As? Thanks.\nRoy Olivier: Yes. I'll not comment further. I think I will say Bill and I had a number of conversations about what our cash floor is. And our cash flow is $3 million to $4 million. So we're not going to run this thing with $1 million in the bank. We're going to minimally have $3 million to probably $4 million in the bank. And Bill, you want to address the remainder of that question.\nWilliam Nurthen: I think as we start to announce some of these, Rich, we all get a little more flavor for how we intend to finance it. But obviously, the larger some of these deals get, there's our first thing we want to do is try to use cash, but we will likely do some equity to complete some of these transactions. And we continue to basically look at all sorts of options. If you look at what Roy and I have done in the past, we've used seller notes. We used or announce things like that. So I think that will also be part of the structure, while at the same time, as Roy mentioned, making sure we keep a reserve amount of liquidity in the business to make sure that we can execute on our plans and don't run into any issues.\nRichard Baldry: Last one. The ASP jumped more meaningfully than we've seen in a while. Is that really an impact of Resolute coming in? Or is there more to it than that?\nWilliam Nurthen: Resolute, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Allen Klee of Maxim Group.\nAllen Klee: Yes, hi. Could you give us a sense of how much of the incremental ARR that was added in the quarter came from the core business, excluding Resolute?\nRoy Olivier: I mentioned in my script, Resolute brought about $1.35 million of ARR. I think we had about not quite 16 of incremental in the quarter and $135 million of that came from Resolute.\nAllen Klee: And then if we're going to think about there's still a little left over incremental onetime -- well, not recurring type spending related to the things you mentioned mostly next quarter. Is there a way to think of what the magnitude of that might be compared to what you just had in the fiscal first quarter?\nRoy Olivier: I think we itemize those costs out that affected this quarter. And of that, the proxy stuff goes away pretty much and the Chairman up goes away pretty much. So it's really around 350-ish of legal, I would say, is probably a legal over and above normal related to M&A type stuff would be the impact.\nAllen Klee: On the M&A that you're looking at, could you remind us in terms of what you're looking for, what these new businesses will be doing? What they'll be contributing to the type of stuff that you offer compared to what you offer today?\nWilliam Nurthen: Well, yes, obviously, we have to narrow our comments on this, but we're looking for unique capability that we do not have today that allows us to provide a unique value proposition to our user base. We also are highly interested in complementary adjacent markets where we're not as successful as others in. For example, we were very strong in corporate not as strong in academic or government. So people that are showing in academic or government and maybe not in corporate would be of interest to us. And then if I point you back to the investor deck that we've used over the last 30 or 60 days, there is a number of capabilities slides that point out here's where we were when we just had Article Galaxy. Here's where we were 3 months ago with Article Galaxy Q data and references. And here's what Resolute does for us. But even with that Resolute deck, there are a few empty boxes. So the way that we think about it is, is there a capability that we can acquire that also has strong cross-sell capability. They also have strength in a segment of the market that we're not necessarily strong in that we can acquire that will fill out that portfolio allow us to have another strong cross-sell opportunity both ways. So I would just point you to the currently filed investor deck, which an updated version will be filed probably tomorrow, if not today. And if you go to the slide titled innovation value chain, there are three empty boxes there that are interesting to us in terms of M&A targets as long as they meet the other requirements, which has got to have cross-sell capability, got as some strengths we don't have, and they've got to be accretive to our organic growth and EBITDA targets.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Roy Olivier for any closing remarks.\nRoy Olivier: Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. And as a reminder, we will again be presenting at the Roth Tech Conference in New York on November 15 and the Southwest IDEAS Conference in Dallas on the 16th. If you'd like to attend, please reach out to 3-part advisers. We look forward to speaking to you in February, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines. Thank you for participating, and have a pleasant day."
