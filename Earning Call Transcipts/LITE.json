Lumentum's press release with the fiscal second quarter results and accompanying supplemental slides are available on our Web site at www.lumentum.com under the Investors section. With that, I'll turn the call over to Alan.\nAlan Lowe: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Lumentum stands at the leading edge of photonics innovation, partnering with customers to enable the future of data centers and the networks that connection them. We equip our customers with the industry's most comprehensive photonics portfolio, enabling them to unlock unparalleled performance and efficiency. From pluggable high-speed transceivers to enabling customers AI-optimized architectures with industry-leading transmitters and photonics, we are at the forefront of data centers' needs. Together with our cloud customers, we are shaping the future of data transmission through pioneering technologies such as chip-scale photonics and advanced data transmission protocols, as well as highly efficient and automated manufacturing at scale. It has been just three months since we acquired Cloud Light, and we are thrilled with the team that has joined us and the many opportunities that lie ahead. In this brief period, we have had meaningful traction with customers on new data center opportunities which we expect will drive significant additional growth as we complete the development of the new products and receive customer qualifications. The market opportunity is accelerating, and we expect broader customer adoption of 800G technology as these qualifications finalize. Additionally, the initial ramp-up of 1.6 terabit products by early technology adopters is creating a lot of pull from customers. And we expect to have a first-to-market advantage given our vertical integration and test results from our labs. Cloud Light transceiver shipments were very strong in the December quarter, contributing $59.5 million during the approximately eight weeks after the acquisition. We expect our shipments will be even stronger in the March quarter. Given a mid-calendar-year product transition planned by our largest data center customer, we expect revenue from data center transceivers to temporarily dip in the June and September quarters, and then grow significantly through the end of the year and into calendar year '25, as this transition completes and other new customer programs start to ramp. Given the surging data demands of AI data centers and our strong traction on new transceiver opportunities, we are strategically expanding our leading-edge transceiver manufacturing capacity. As a key part of this expansion, we are investing in state-of-the-art production lines at our manufacturing facility in Thailand. Our Thai factor has proven photonics manufacturing capabilities, and has received numerous customer accolades, giving us confidence in our ability to ramp rapidly. This capacity will come online this summer, and we expect to lead the first wave of 1.6 terabit transceivers from multiple customers at this site. In addition to this new capacity expansion in Thailand, we will be leveraging Lumentum's components in new Cloud Light transceiver designs. We believe the combination of our established history of customer partnership, proven manufacturing leadership, and unrivaled breadth of differentiated photonic component capabilities puts us at an excellent position to accelerate top line revenue growth and margins in this rapidly growing cloud transceiver market. While cloud data centers are forecasting double-digit CapEx growth in calendar '24, we are navigating challenging market conditions in other parts of our business. Based on sluggish carrier CapEx spending and our latest customer discussions, we now expect customer inventory digestion to extend through the balance of fiscal '24. Nevertheless, we are highly confident in our market position and the ultimate recovery and growth of this business. As fiber transmission reaches its physical capacity, network providers increasingly recognize the value of technologies, like ours, that enable continued network scaling, reinforcing our long-term confidence in this business. Moving to our Industrial Tech segment, we are very excited about our traction on new products serving new applications, particularly for our ultrafast lasers. These are ramping up and are adding to our customer end market diversification in our Industrial Tech segment. That said, we do expect a period of lower demand over the coming quarters driven by typical seasonality in our consumer business and by macro softness in the industrial market, along with elevated customer inventory levels at one of our large laser customers. We expect the industrial laser inventory to be corrected over the next six months, around the same timeframe as the seasonal uptick in our consumer business. This, combined with our wins at new customers in new markets, should lead to an Industrial Tech segment recovery during second-half of the calendar year. Moving on to fiscal second quarter results, second quarter revenue and EPS results were above the midpoints of our guidance ranges, with revenue of $366.8 million and EPS of $0.32. I'm very excited about the contribution that our Cloud Light acquisition had on the quarter, and will have in the future given the technology and capability of the combined companies to address the rapidly growing AI and ML photonics market. We have continued to drive acquisition synergies to drive down our fixed costs, and Wajid will provide more color on this shortly. The combination of these lower fixed costs and the rebound in revenue will result in an accelerated expansion in our margins during fiscal '25. Cloud & Networking revenue was up 25% sequentially driven by strong cloud data center demand and the contribution from the Cloud Light acquisition, but down 25% year-on-year given broad-based softness across most of our telecom networking product lines due to the continued inventory correction at our network equipment customers. The future is bright for our cloud technology roadmap. In the second-half of calendar '24, we expect to qualify the industry's first power-efficient 800G transceivers that employ 4x200 gig lanes of traffic using silicon photonics technologies. As I mentioned earlier, we expect to ramp capacity this summer at our campus in Thailand, and expect to lead the first wave of 1.6 terabit transceivers for multiples customers in this facility. These ultrahigh-speed transceivers provide additional bandwidth needed for AI workloads, while also alleviating data bottlenecks with lower power consumption and latency as customers move to 200-gig-per-lane technology. We expect that 200-gig-per-lane optics, using not only silicon photonics technology, but also our vertically integrated EML lasers will be the workhorse of the next generation of hyperscale data centers once these new products are qualified at leading cloud and cloud infrastructure customers. We have been receiving positive customer feedback about our 100-gig VCSEL performance for short-distance data center applications. And expect to start ramping production in the second-half of calendar '24. We will qualify our VCSELs in Cloud Light's active optical cables and transceiver platforms in the coming quarters. We are also working closely with cloud infrastructure providers on novel components and modules that leverage our unique technology capability to enable new future AI hardware architectures for higher-bandwidth lower power density and low-latency optical interconnects essential for training in inference applications. With the rapid build-out of AI and ML data centers, connecting those data centers with high-speed power and cost-efficient interconnects is becoming even more important. To that end, we continue to have success in our 400-gig ZR module business where, in Q2, we grew over 30% sequentially. Additionally, we are receiving positive customer feedback on our 800G ZR modules. And, we are on-track to be first to market with customer samples this year. These modules will enable even higher speed extended reach data center interconnects to help keep space with rapidly expanding data center infrastructure. Our coherent transmission products outside of the data center are receiving positive customer feedback and transaction on our next generation 130 and 200 gigabaud data rate technologies that enable next generation coherent applications at 800G, 1.2G, and 1.6G. These high speed products are available in both the suite and integrated form factors to enable enhanced performance in next generation metro and long haul applications. As we move through calendar '24, we believe we are at the forefront of 200 gigabaud optical technology with our first-to-market and first-to-volume products. Turning to Industrial Tech. Fiscal Q2 was down 9% sequentially as expected, driven by seasonality in our 3D sensing business and inventory consumption at one of our large industrial lasers customers. Industrial Tech was down 35% year over year, primarily due to increased competition for market share on a certain 3D sensing socket that we have discussed previously and overall macroeconomic softness. We expect revenue of 3D sensing for consumer applications to contribute approximately 5% or less of company revenue in Q3 and Q4 of fiscal '24. As the shift industry 4.0 and 5.0 drives demand for greater automation and precision manufacturing, our laser products are well-positioned to address evolving industrial needs. With precise control and pulse parameters in quality and stability, we are seeing growing opportunities for our ultrafast and solid state lasers across key micromachining applications in semiconductor, EV batteries, displays, PCBs, and solar cell manufacturing. Growth in new micromachining applications will help to partially offset the near-term headwinds I mentioned earlier. To summarize, high speed data center demand is skyrocketing. And, we are accelerating product development and production to capture this growth. Armed with longstanding customer partnerships, industry leading manufacturing, and an unmatched portfolio of advanced photonic components, we are positioned to market share in the surging cloud transceiver market, driving significant top line and margin growth for Lumentum. Before turning it over to Wajid, I would like to thank our employees and our customers around the world for their focus and dedication as they continue to collaborate and partner with Lumentum. With that, Wajid?\nWajid Ali: Thank you, Alan. As Alan mentioned, we are confident about our market position and growth opportunities across our surge markets. We are focused on lowering our fixed cost base so that as the revenue recovers, operating margin dollars will expand faster than revenue. To this end, we have made significant progress on manufacturing synergizes by hitting key milestones on closing two new photonic factories in China this past December. The benefit will accrue to our financial position as we ramp production of most of those products at our Thailand facility. Additionally, our Japan wafer fab consolidation plans are progressing well. And, we expect to execute this plan by the first-half of fiscal '25, allowing us to attain significant additional synergies in both manufacturing and operating expenses beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2025. As well, we continue to see incremental synergy and efficiency opportunities within our operating expenses. Consequently, we are increasing our synergy attainment expectations to $100 million, up from the prior target of $80 million. To date, we have achieved approximately $60 million in annual run-rate savings and expect to achieve the remaining $40 million as we execute against our plan. We will provide you with further updates as we achieve critical milestones. As I have mentioned previously, we had pre-built inventory of NeoPhotonics products to enable these factory transitions. In Q2, we reduced Lumentum's overall inventory levels by approximately $20 million sequentially, excluding the increase in inventory related to Cloud Light. In addition, despite incorporating the operational expenses of our recent acquisition of Cloud Light in Q2, our tight financial discipline drove company-wide operating expenses down by $4 million on a year-over-year basis. We're confident that our combined efforts on manufacturing efficiency, inventory management, and cost control will pave the way for continued improvements in gross and operating margins as telecom revenue recovers and our cloud revenue continues to grow. Net revenue for the second quarter was $366.8 million, which was up 15.5% sequentially and down 27.5% year-on-year. As Alan mentioned, during the quarter, we recognized $59.5 million in revenue from a partial quarter of Cloud Light. The majority of this revenue came from 800G transceiver shipments. GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 17.4%. GAAP operating loss was 28.7% and GAAP diluted net loss per share was $1.47 with a large portion of the GAAP net loss due to acquisition related charges and amortization. Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 32.6%, which was down sequentially, and down year-on-year driven by product mix and factory underutilization. Second quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 3.5%, which was up sequentially and down year-on-year. Second quarter non-GAAP operating income was $13 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $39 million. Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $106.7 million or 29.1% of revenue, up $6.6 million from Q1, due in part to the acquisition of Cloud Light and down $3.6 million from the year-ago quarter due to tight expense controls and continued synergy attainment. Q2 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $38.4 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $68.3 million. Interest and other income was $12.3 million on a non-GAAP basis due to interest earned on our cash and investments. Second quarter non-GAAP net income was $21.7 million and non-GAAP diluted net income per share was $0.32. Our fully diluted share count for the second quarter was 67.4 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. Our cash position decreased by $720 million during the quarter, to $1.22 billion, this was primarily due to the $705 million in cash used for the purchase of Cloud Light. In addition, we incurred approximately $8 million of normal course expenses associated with the transaction. Turning to segment details, second quarter cloud and networking segment revenue at $286.7 million increased 24.8% sequentially and was down 25.1% year-on-year. Cloud and networking segment non-GAAP reporting profit at 10.1% decreased sequentially and year-on-year. Our second quarter industrial tech segment revenue at $80.1 million was down 8.9% sequentially and down 34.9% year-on-year. Second quarter industrial tech non-GAAP reporting profit of 15.9% was down sequentially and year-on-year. Before I move to our guidance, I would like to add some context to an impact to our revenue related to export regulations. Late last year, we were notified by certain critical IC suppliers that service the industry broadly that their products do not comply with the latest export regulations. Consequently, in December, we stopped the majority of our product shipments to the largest networking equipment manufacturer in China. Our assumption is that these export regulations will continue indefinitely, and result in an approximately $40 million to $50 million reduction in calendar year '24 revenue from our prior expectations. Longer-term, we believe geopolitical factors could pose a benefit to our revenue opportunity given our larger product footprint within other customers who are expected to be end-market share-gainers over time. Now, let me move to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal '24, which is on a non-GAAP basis, and is based on our assumptions as of today. We expect net revenue for the third quarter of fiscal '24 to be in the range of $350 million to $380 million. This Q3 revenue forecast includes the following assumptions. Cloud and networking to be up driven by strong cloud demand and a full quarter of Cloud Light despite more than a $10 million impact from the export regulations just mentioned, and Industrial Tech to be down nearly $40 million sequentially at the midpoint due to 3D-sensing seasonality and share dynamics, as well as industrial laser customer inventory digestion that Alan mentioned earlier. Based on this, we project third quarter non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 2% to 5%, and diluted net income per share to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.35. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the third quarter is based on a non-GAAP annual effective tax rate of 14.5%. These projections also assume an approximate share count of 67.8 million shares. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathy to start the Q&A session. Kathy?\nKathy Ta: Thank you, Wajid. Before we start the Q&A session, I would like to ask everyone to keep to one question and one follow-up, this should us get to as many participants as possible before the end of our allotted time. Now, let's begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: We will now start today's Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you very much for taking the question. I will try to keep to that one. So, I just wonder if you could maybe talk a little bit about your customer mix, customer concentration in this quarter. I'm wondering if you did have a new 10% customer, and how you see that particular concentration changing or evolving, both sequentially and then longer-term? And then I've got a quick follow-up.\nAlan Lowe: Yes, thanks, Simon. Yes, we did have a new 10% customer primarily due to the Cloud Light addition to revenue to that customer. And I'd say that, as we talked about on the script, we expect that diversification around our transceiver business will grow rapidly towards the end of this calendar year and into '25 as new 800-gig and 1.6T products are qualified with other hyperscalers as well as AI infrastructure companies. So, we're very excited about that and the diversification of the customers around our transceiver business. I would say that one of the things we did talk about was the less dependency on our consumer business, and that's why we gave specifics around 5% or less of our revenue in the next few quarters. And I think that's a healthy place to be with, with our consumer business. Does that answer your question, Simon?\nSimon Leopold: Thanks. And then, -- it does. And you sort of teed up my follow-up nicely, in that, in the deck, the footnote mentions that Industrial Tech is expected to decline approximately $40 million sequentially. And I'm still sort of adjusting to this new segmentation. And I'm just wondering that implies 3D is essentially dropping to zero. I know you said less than 5%, but zero is also less than 5% or whether there's a significant portion of that $40 million coming out of this inventory adjustment product cycle angle on your industrial lasers, so just looking for a little bit more help how to split that $40 million. Thank you.\nAlan Lowe: Yes, I would say that we're pretty confident in that 5-ish percent for consumer in Q3, so the balance would come from, we mentioned on the call, around the inventory reduction efforts by one of our largest laser customers. So, that's how you could kind of split up that $40 million.\nSimon Leopold: Thank you.\nAlan Lowe: Thanks, Simon.\nKathy Ta: Thank you, Simon.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Henderson from Needham. Your line is now open.\nAlex Henderson: Great, thanks. I wanted to dig into the Cloud Light business a little bit and understand some of the dynamics there. But I also wanted to understand whether Cloud Light's technology in selling transceivers has changed the dynamics around your chip sales to other transceiver companies at all. First question, is the 800-gig products that you were talking about ramping on in VCSELs, is there a 1.6 terabit product coming down the pike for that, because we've just heard from Fabrinet that they're expecting some impact on their business because of a product transition. I would assume that that is in the AOC segment because they don't really do much in the InfiniBand segment. And I'm not aware of anybody having a 200-gig VCSEL product to ramp. So, can you talk about whether that technology is out there, and whether that's something that's in your cards on the AOC side?\nAlan Lowe: Yes. Let me address your first question first, which is around the dynamics of our chip sales. And I would say certainly our chip customers had some concern around us being a competitor, but we assured them that we are their partners, and we really treat those two businesses very separately, with a wall between our chip development team and our transceiver team, so there's no cross-contamination or concerns. And I think we've alleviated a lot of those concerns to the point where I am sold out on Datacom chips today, and through next quarter, and we're adding capacity to meet the demands of our EML business, and bringing up our CW laser business in a rapid way. On the VCSELs, we talked about the 100-gig VCSELs being released in the second-half of this year, very positive results, just going through final qualifications. And that would be more of an 800-gig AOC or 800-gig SR multimode transceiver. As far as 200-gig VCSELs, that's a little bit out for us, and I think for the industry. So, 1.6T would be more of a silicon photonics or EML-based transceiver. But I'll let Chris talk a little bit more about his thoughts on 200-gig VCSELs or 1.6T. Chris?\nChris Coldren: Yes, I mean, as you alluded to, Alan, we are focused -- initial products of 1.6 terabit will be silicon photonic based. The industry is however developing 200-gig VCSELs on our roadmap, developing other third-party suppliers developing 200-gig VCSELs. So, those will feather in over time as well. And the Cloud Light transceiver platform has multimode transceiver, single-mode transceivers, so we're well-positioned to participate in both opportunities.\nAlex Henderson: So just that I understand, then if there is a 1.6 terabit product coming in the June quarter, it would have to be 16 lanes of 100, because I mean there is clearly an implication that there's something of that sort coming down the pike in the June quarter, and by other peoples' commentary. Is that not true?\nChris Coldren: I can comment on what our plans are, which involve silicon photonics-based approaches. I think we also have alluded to on the call that 200-gig-per-lane technology is also on the horizon, let's say, and will coming out over the next year. So, I think you can put those facts together.\nAlex Henderson: Okay, thanks.\nAlan Lowe: Yes, but just to be clear, we have 1.6 terabit silicon photonics in our labs today. And we have 200-gig EMLs that we have qualified internally that are ready to go, and waiting for both internal qualification at the transceiver level as well as our customer's transceivers qualifications using 200G EMLs that I think will come out later this year.\nQ – Alex Henderson: Just for clarification, that would then be InfiniBand-related product, not AOCs, right?\nA – Alan Lowe: Well, it would be either Ethernet or InfiniBand. How ever our customers use our Datacom chips is really up to them. And, we're kind -- we don't really care whether it's InfiniBand or otherwise. So, Chris, do you have any other comments on InfiniBand? Yes. Okay, Thanks.\nA – Chris Coldren:\n.:\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Samik Chatterjee from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nQ – Samik Chatterjee: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Maybe just not to sort of keeping going on Datacom, but to just make sure I am not confused. You talked about the product transition that your primary customer there for Cloud Light is undergoing. Maybe you can flesh that out a bit in your own words what's the transition? And more curious to hear what's your visibility in terms of market share with the customer following that transition? Any thoughts or any color on whether you expect any changes in relation to market share? And then, I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nA – Alan Lowe: Yes, I'll comment on product transition. Certainly, we have to be a little careful of customer sensitivity. But you can imagine that as 800G is launched, there are subsequent generations of 800G whether that be different form factor or transitioning from 100G to 200G per lane. So, there are range of changes as you get further into technology maturity to reduce power consumption and power density challenges in your systems. I think with regard to market share, we are very excited and believe that we have lots of opportunity to gain share. And, that's why as we talked about in our prepared remarks that we are expanding capacity very significantly so that we can come out and really accelerate growth later this calendar year and into calendar '25.\nQ – Samik Chatterjee: Okay, got it. Thanks for that. And, maybe just for my follow-up. On the telecom segment, your primary competitor of your company is calling out a recovery in demand in China, which I am assuming you are not able to capitalize on because of the trade regulations. But, just curious if that this is a situation where you would sort just go rework the product and get through some of the supply chain reorganization to still try to address that market with a different customer? Or is this sort of an area where you really don't have an option to go around and capitalize on that demand recovery in the China market? Thank you.\nA – Alan Lowe: Yes, Samik. There are deployments about to happen in China that we are part of through non-Huawei customers. And, where in meaningful way very large part of the share non- Huawei in China network equipment manufacturers and things like that, so that's one of the areas of strong string. We stopped shipping due to the need to follow regulations obviously. And I think that will trickle down eventually to the point where share will shift from network equipment manufacturers that we have a higher share of wallet on that over the long term we believe will be a tailwind for us.\nQ – Samik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nKathy Ta: Thanks, Samik.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Christopher Rolland from SIG. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nQ – Christopher Rolland: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Mine is about Cloud Light. So, first of all, you talked about maybe the end of program and a dip in June and September. If you could kind of describe why that program just ends and why there isn't something fluid into the segment of AI or what have you? And then, you talked about a broadening into new customers. How many are you thinking and how large do you think they may be versus your primary customer? Thank you.\nWajid Ali: Yes, Chris, I mean, we do, as you're alluding to have a degree of customer concentration in the Cloud Light business. So, the customer that's driven a lot of 800 gig growth over the past several quarters, there's a time to ramp down of the current generation of product and takes time to ramp up the next generation of product. So, while there are other customers and other customers are growing, they're not sufficient to offset that product transition, if you will. And as Alan alluded to, we are, through the capacity expansions as well as new product activities, expanding the number of sockets that we have with multiple customers so that such product transitions, which do occur time to time, will be more smoothed out as the revenue base grows and diversifies. In terms of the magnitude of other customer opportunities, certainly, as we talked about when we announced the acquisition of Cloud Light, I mean, this is a very large market, and so the opportunity to add multiples of current revenue in the coming years is certainly well ahead of us and very well positioned with both the Cloud Light capabilities, then you add what momentum brings to the table. Customers, to-date, are very encouraged by the possibilities and are working closely with us to bring that to a reality over the coming year. You can't develop a product, qualify it, and ramp it in a few quarters. That does take a little bit of time, and so that's why we're talking about having significant capacity additions and revenue growth later this calendar year.\nAlan Lowe: Yes, and Chris, maybe I can add to that as well.\nChristopher Rolland: Yes.\nAlan Lowe: Yes, just to add to that, I think given that we're a U.S. headquartered company and now investing heavily outside of China is a very attractive alternative U.S. partner to all of the cloud customers, as well as the cloud infrastructure companies. And so, that's what's really got our attraction with, I'd say, every one of the customers. And that's why we're investing strongly in Thailand and will continue to invest to meet the needs of the demands that our customers are asking for. Because when they say go, they want to make sure we have the capacity in place. And so, that's what gives us confidence and why we're investing so strongly.\nChristopher Rolland: Thank you, Alan. Maybe as a follow-up, just to understand some of these moving product dynamics, when will 100-gig VCSELs be meaningful for you in terms of revenue? And then it sounds like you don't have a roadmap for 200-gig VCSELs, you'll have a hard cut to SIFO or EMLs for 200-gig, and that will be going into Cloud Light products as well. Did I get that transition correct?\nAlan Lowe: Sort of, I would, say today our 100-gig VCSELs have a lot of positive feedback. We'll start revenue in the second-half of the calendar year, we will be meaningful in calendar '25, both from an AOC standpoint as well as a multimode SR transceiver. We do have 200-gig on our roadmap. We are doing development work and the progress that we made over the last year on 100-gig gives us a lot of confidence that we will have a 200-gig at the right time, and that's probably end of 2025 and into 2026. So, 100-gig VCSELs have a very nice runway through 2025 and I think our confidence in our 200-gig roadmap is very strong. So, we will have both -- [multiple speakers] that will hit first, EMLs as well around the same time at the 200-gig per lane, and then VCSELs, 200-gig. We'll come after that.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks, Alan. Thanks, guys.\nKathy Ta: Thanks, Chris.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nMeta Marshall: Thanks. It's been touched on a couple of questions, but just wanted to kind of narrow down into kind of the process or timeline of bringing your lasers into the Cloud Light portfolio, just kind of what the timing of that vertical integration would be, and then maybe just as a second question, more on the 3D sensing side of the portfolio, there are new kind of devices out from your major customer, just anything in terms of kind of contextualizing how big that opportunity either is or could contribute to the things.\nAlan Lowe: Yes, so the timing of our lasers into Cloud Light's portfolio in the lab, certainly they're already there in the short period that we've been one company, both on 100-gig VCSELs as well as EMLs. So, then it's just a matter of -- customers don't want to do changes in existing products and so it will come up as we get new product qualifications and new customers and new opportunities. And so, I would say that it's all dependent upon how fast those qualifications happen. But I would say that, that would be really a second-half of calendar '24 and into '25 in a more meaningful way. 3D sensing new devices, they're very secretive. We believe we are in some of their new devices, but quite frankly, the volumes of those devices are very small relative to handsets. So, I don't think you should model any meaningful contribution on those new devices in the short term.\nKathy Ta: Great. Thank you. Thanks, Meta.\nOperator: Our next question today is from Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, good morning. I have a question for Alan and one for Wajid. Wajid within telecom, 130 and 200 gigabaud and coherent optics with eventually your own coherent DSP, that appear to be growth drivers for you, but where do you think your customers are on digesting inventory? I know you indicated it may not recover until September quarter, but have you seen book-to-bill trough in that area of the business? Any color on that would be helpful as we think about the recovery in telecom.\nAlan Lowe: Yes, so on the high gigabaud products, those are constrained by our ability to meet customer demand today. And you're right, I think the combination of 130 gigabaud and 200 gigabaud and our own DSP is a real winning solution to meet the needs of next generation ZR products, as well as the long-haul and metro products. So, today, our 200 gigabaud and 130 gigabaud are going into more metro and long haul applications, just as prior products, and prior generations, as they cost reduce over time and get into a smaller form factor into ZR products. So, that is off into the races, and it feels like the old times, the number of emails I get from executives asking us to ramp up faster and work with our suppliers to get product to them when they need it. So, that's a very, very strong positive. As far as digestion is concerned, I'd say that we have a lot of single source or primary source products that during the pandemic were in short supply where customers ordered in anticipation. And for example, our tunable laser that came from Neophotonics is the workhorse of the industry and there's inventory at many of our customers of those products as the anticipation of ZR demand was very, very strong and it became less so over the horizon. So, inventory needs to be digested of tunable lasers and when that goes away, we believe that will take another quarter and a half or so that those products will ramp back up. So, I think putting aside the short-term inventory glut, we're very well positioned on existing products, on new products, and the new product demand is very strong. So, I think from that perspective, we're very confident in our position and the market share today and going forward.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you for that, Alan. Maybe a follow-up, you indicated how you are expanding production capacity in Thailand for high-speed laser components. At the same time, there seems to be quite a strong willingness by your customers to accept that. So, are you seeing a willingness across the supply chain for your customers to co-invest in your capacity as they ready some of these very high-capable products, really for AI clusters and next-generation AI networks as they wait for that demand? Thank you.\nAlan Lowe: I would say on existing capacity and short-term growth of capacity, that's on our dime and our customers are encouraging us and will reward us over time with orders. They're investing their R&D and engineering resources to qualify our products in the short term. I would say that we are getting co-investment on development projects to develop unique alternatives to transceivers. So, for the long term, I think we have a share of mind with some of the AI infrastructure companies around what does the next generation of Datacom or optical interconnect or GPUs, et cetera, what does it look like? And they're willing to help us make those investments that will turn into revenue a little bit further out. But they're clearly partnering with us because they see the breadth of technology and capabilities that we have. So, I'd say that's kind of the answer both from the short-term as well as longer-term. Does that answer your question, Karl?\nKarl Ackerman: Yes, it does. Thank you.\nAlan Lowe: All right.\nKathy Ta: Thank you, Karl.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dave Kang from B. Riley. Your line is now open.\nDave Kang: Thank you. Good morning. Just one more question on the Datacom segment. So, with that pause or dip in June and September, how should we think about Datacom revenue for those two respective quarters?\nAlan Lowe: Yes.\nWajid Ali: I think\nAlan Lowe: It's -- \nWajid Ali: Go ahead.\nAlan Lowe: Go ahead. Okay, yes, let me take that. I'd say we're still working on what that dip looks like and clearly our customer is looking to help us smooth that dip. And so, I would think from a modeling standpoint it could be down 30% through that transition period. But again, that's a matter of still working through. And then, can we pull in the new products into the September quarter that would make that June quarter the low? And I think that's probably the case, as we have made tremendous progress on the new products and the demand for those new products are strong. So, I'd say you can model kind of a dip in the June quarter with a slight pickup in the September quarter, but that's a little bit dynamic.\nDave Kang: Got it. And then, my second question is on the telecom. Just wondering, you talked about tunable lasers. Just wondering how big that business is and also can you -- any update on the ROADM segment?\nWajid Ali: Yes, Dave, we don't break those products out specifically, but I think maybe a key point, as Alan highlighted on the call, or in a previous question, is both of those products are ones where there are more inventory out there, given the position we have and the criticality we are to our customers and the supply challenges around semiconductors or ICs a year ago or so that's an area where inventory was built quite heavily. So, for example as our ZR modules ourselves are ramping up, tunable lasers aren't yet. There will be a time lag, here of a quarter or two before they start to recover given the amount of inventory that's out there. So, unfortunately, the situation is that some of the major product lines that we have driven a lot of our historical revenues are the ones that where there are high levels of inventory that are remaining to burn off in the coming couple of quarters.\nDave Kang: Thank you.\nKathy Ta: Thank you, Dave.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Ruben Roy from Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRuben Roy: Thank you. I hope my first question is quick, because you guys have been talking about this quite a bit. But Chris, I think this is for you in answer to previous questions around this little bit of applause in the June-September quarters on the transceiver technology. I just wanted to make sure I understood. That's a design change, 100% related to kind of your product and not because of other network elements. Is that the right way to think about it?\nChris Coldren: I would say, well, maybe a slightly different, which is to say that the customer wants to purchase different products, then we have to make a new product. And so, there is a period ramping down the old before we ramp up the new. And that's what presented the dip.\nRuben Roy: Okay.\nChris Coldren: Customers trying to improve system or network performance, if you will through a different sort of product design.\nRuben Roy: Okay, thank you for that. And then, on the industrial side, you have outside a pretty fencing you've got the inventory consumption at a large customer, and obviously macro weakness ongoing. I'm wondering if you could kind of sort out the macro side of it, how has design activity been, Alan, I know you have gotten some new products out there with some of the fast industrial lasers. Are you seeing any sort of pick up in design activity or discussions around either additive manufacturing or otherwise, I'm just curious how you're thinking about over the next 12 to 18 months?\nAlan Lowe: Yes, good question. I would say, as we said in the script, a lot of new applications, I would say, the one that we are ramping today is primarily around solar processing and manufacturing, and our laser gives them a differentiated efficiency of the solar cells. So, as you can imagine, 1% efficiency or even a fraction of a percent efficiency for solar cells is a big deal. And so, for whatever reason our unique capability in our ultrafast lasers had a lot of attraction in that space. And similarly, we are seeing a lot of design activity around other applications, and we have talked about those on the call around EV batteries, and PCBs, and displays that are coming to fruition, and will turn into business really in the second-half of calendar '24 and into '25. So, yes, a lot of activity and a lot of success with respect to our Femto second and Pico second lasers.\nRuben Roy: Thank you.\nKathy Ta: Thanks, Ruben.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. And I just wanted to nail down what we have heard so far about June and September. So, it seems like June is at least $30 million below March levels, all else being equal. And then, September it recovers, but maybe doesn't get back to March levels, but I wanted to confirm that. And if June and September are both below March levels, then what happens to gross margins? Are they also below March levels? I just wanted to make sure that we just connect all the dots that we have heard so far on the call.\nAlan Lowe: Wajid, I think you are on mute.\nWajid Ali: Sorry. Thank you. Hi, Vivek. So, I think that sounds about right. We do try to guide one quarter at a time, just given the number of customers that we have that are over 10%, and the type of volatility we can see. But based on the information we provided, that's probably about the right math. Our gross margins, we are going -- well, gross and operating margins, we should be able to see some of the synergies flowing through in our June and September quarter, that we talked about earlier. We have achieved $60 million exiting the December quarter, and we are expecting additional synergies to help us a little bit in March and probably more in June. And so, we should be able to see the benefit of that flowing through. And so, gross margins should be probably about flat, at least into the June quarter with some improvement into the September quarter. Some of the new programs that Alan talked about do require some incremental R&D expenses for those large hyperscale customers. And so, we won't be backing off on those. And so, OpEx will modulate between June and September as well. I think that's the right way to think about it. Sorry, just for clarification, 30% Datacom down, not the company down in the June quarter, right?\nVivek Arya: Right. At $30 million, right?\nChris Coldren: Yes, $30 million, it's about $30 million-ish, yes.\nVivek Arya: My follow-up, how do you think about your balance sheet right now? Net leverage is kind of higher than peers. And so, how do you think about the balance sheet right now? Do you think you need to do anything extraordinary to shore it up. And in general, how should we think about just cash flow generation this year? So, just any comment on the balance sheet would be helpful. Thank you.\nChris Coldren: Yes. So, we exited the December quarter with a little over $1.2 billion in cash. Our expectation is that we'll continue to generate cash flow from operations, both in the March quarter and in the June quarter as well. We are making some incremental investments in capital in our Thailand facility that Alan talked about. And so, that'll modulate between March and June just depending on when the CapEx comes in and when we pay for it. We have a convertible debt due in March, in the middle of March. And so, our expectation is that we'll be able to pay that often the cash that we have on the balance sheet. And that still leaves us with a comfortable level of cash exiting that payoff. So, we're quite comfortable with the level of debt we have, both on a gross and a net basis, just kind of given those dynamics.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nKathy Ta: Thanks, Vivek. So, Drew, I think we have time just for one more question.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah from Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Baruah: Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just sort of going back to the transceiver comp, Alan, Chris, what's a good way to think about overall Gen AI exposure right now? I guess, how big would you size your kind of Gen AI related business in the December quarter? And I guess, what's a good way to think about, and you can include ZR in there if you think did that belong? Sounds like, Alan, you in your prior remarks, you think it to some degree, you think it belonged. And then, what's a good way to think about sort of, I guess kind of like the growth rate of those of how you size that Gen AI-related business over the next 12 to 24 months. And there are a lot of moving parts with new customers and programs and stuff like that coming on, but any context, both of those questions would be probably pretty useful for us. Appreciate it.\nChris Coldren: Sure. I would say as we highlighted on the call, the Cloud Light revenue around $60 million and will be going up significantly here in the March quarter with a full quarter of it. I think the vast, vast majority of that given the vast, vast majority of that is 800 gig is going into AI platforms. If you were, look beyond that, then obviously we've got our Datacom, chip business, which is several tens of millions of dollars a quarter as well adding into that. I would be cautious to start throwing in, some of the telecom revenue at this point. Certainly, data going in and out of the data centers is relevant, but I think that's more of a longer term story as more data centers are built purpose built and spread out further for power consumption reasons that will start to really drive the telecom space. Now, going back to the revenue pieces that I highlighted between the Cloud Light transceivers and our Datacom chips, I expect, I mean obviously, we've talked about kind of dip here over the coming quarters. But if we were to look at that over several year periods to smooth those out, I think the industry expecting that, AI is growing at a 50% CAGR or something like that over the next three plus years. So, I think we've got an opportunity to grow at least as fast as that, if not faster, given our more modest overall market share, but having all of the essential ingredients to be able to be a share gainer.\nAnanda Baruah: That's helpful, Chris. I appreciate. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot.\nKathy Ta: Thank you so much, Ananda. And now I think we're going to turn the call back over to Alan for some closing remarks.\nAlan Lowe: Great. Thank you, Kathy. I would like to leave everybody with a few thoughts as we wrap up the call. We are confident in our agility and leadership position to navigate the current market environment. Lumentum stands at the forefront of the data center revolution from pioneering chip scale photonics to automated manufacturing and to new and growing partnerships with hyperscale cloud customers and infrastructure providers. Our Cloud Light acquisition has already proven to be a success with a fantastic team and valuable insight propelling our high speed transceiver production to meet surging demand. With that, I would like to thank you for attending today's call, and we look forward to meeting you again at investor conferences, upcoming meetings and at the OFC Show in San Diego. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's 2024 Lumentum earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line."

Please also note, today's event is being recorded for replay purposes. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference call over to Kathy Ta, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Ta, please go ahead.\nKathy Ta: Thank you, and welcome to Lumentum's fiscal first quarter 2024 earnings call. This is Kathy Ta, Lumentum's Vice President of Investor Relations. Joining me today are Alan Lowe, President and Chief Executive Officer; Wajid Ali, Chief Financial Officer; and Chris Coldren, Senior Vice President and Chief Strategy and Corporate Development Officer. Today's call will include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations and beliefs regarding recent acquisitions, including Cloud Light and NeoPhotonics; financial and operating results; macroeconomic trends; trends and expectations for our products and technology; our end markets; market opportunities and customers; and our expected financial performance, including our guidance as well as statements regarding our future revenues, financial model, and margin targets.

Lumentum's press release with the fiscal first quarter results and accompanying supplemental slides are available on our website at www.lumentum.com under the Investors section. With that, I'll turn the call over to Alan.\nAlan Lowe: Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We are thrilled to welcome the Cloud Light team to Lumentum. The addition of Cloud Light's products to our portfolio positions Lumentum as a leader in providing photonics to cloud operators at a time when artificial intelligence is rapidly accelerating growth in the data center market. We believe Lumentum's served opportunity within data centers has expanded more than five-fold as a result of the Cloud Light acquisition. For years, Cloud Light has been supplying differentiated high-speed products to leading hyperscale customers, both custom products to address unique customer needs, as well as standard products to address a broad range of hyperscale customer requirements. In the last 12 months, over 90% of Cloud Light's revenue was derived from 400G and higher-speed products. In the most recent quarter, over half of Cloud Light's optical transceiver revenue was derived from 800G transceivers. In calendar 2024, we anticipate strong growth in Cloud & Networking revenue, driven by accelerating AI, computer requirements and a resumption of shipping more in-line with end market demand. Also, in calendar 2024, we expect cloud applications to drive over 30% of Lumentum's cloud and networking revenue. Our cloud customers are responding very positively to this transaction. This combination results in a broader portfolio of differentiated products and technology. It also enhances the security of supply for our customers, given our broader combined global manufacturing footprint and high levels of vertical integration. Lumentum is well-equipped to address future cloud technology roadmaps as AI models drive an exponential increase in compute and networking requirements. I would also like to highlight that starting with this fiscal year, we are updating our financial segment reporting to better reflect the rapidly changing market opportunities ahead. Our financial reporting is now focused on two large and growing end market segments: one, Cloud & Networking; and two, Industrial Tech. Within Cloud & Networking, the cloudification of the network is blurring the lines between our historical served markets of telecom and datacom. Cloud data center and traditional telecom operators are increasingly purchasing the same types of data transmission products. We anticipate the emergence of new applications for optical switching technology not only to serve the growing complexity of long-haul and metro networks, but also to support the high optical link density required for AI training models in the data center. Our customer mix is changing as well. The addition of Cloud Light brings much more direct sales to cloud operators and infrastructure providers. We are also increasingly serving cloud and networking operators directly for their data center interconnect and edge networking applications. To better align our reporting with these market trends, the telecom product lines and the datacom product lines are now included in the Cloud & Networking segment. Turning to the Industrial Tech segment. Our portfolio of imaging, sensing, and laser products aligns with Industry 4.0 and 5.0 trends. Industrial sensing applications require high accuracy in determining distance, speed, and displacement, and are increasingly turning to laser-based approaches. Leading-edge semiconductor, solar cell, and electronic component manufacturing require the beam precision and short-pulse duration of ultrafast lasers to produce precise cuts and features to better reflect the growing importance of precision photonics across this broad application space. The industrial and consumer and commercial lasers product lines are now included within the Industrial Tech segment. Now, I will summarize our fiscal first quarter results. As we reported last week, first quarter revenue and EPS were above the mid-points of our guidance ranges. Through cost controls and efficient operations, we are managing the factors that are in our control. While we continue to see very strong growth in the demand for our data center chips, as well as our newly acquired intra-data center transceivers, this strength is being offset by the telecom and industrial inventory drawdown activities. Due to this inventory correction, we believe we continue to ship below end market demand. As we navigate this transition period, we are delivering as planned on our product roadmaps and synergy attainment with respect to our NeoPhotonics acquisition. Of course, we are also excited about the new opportunities that Cloud Light brings starting in the current quarter as we leverage their leading transceiver technology to deliver the fastest speed products to cloud customers. Now let me provide more detail on our segment level results in Q1. Cloud & Networking revenue was down 20% sequentially and down 36% year-on-year, with broad-based softness across most of our networking product lines, partially offset by sequential growth in intra-data center lasers and tunable access module. This is as we have expected, given the inventory correction underway at our networking customers. Robust cloud data center demand is currently the strongest growth driver for our Cloud & Networking business. As data centers are designed to support the high bandwidth requirements of AI workloads, 800 gig transceivers can provide that bandwidth while also reducing latency. For our transceiver customers, their new 800 gig transceivers utilize eight different wavelengths at 100 gig per lane, triggering orders for our chip-level photonics and driving growth for our EML product line. We are also seeing an increase in deployments of 800G transceivers that are supplied by our Cloud Light business, and we are working with our new team to enable them to ramp even more rapidly. Over time, we also expect to supply custom-designed high-power CW laser arrays for leading AI hardware architectures to provide the high bandwidth, low latency optical interconnects essential for training and inference applications. In calendar '24, our 200 gig per lane EMLs will enable the next generation of transceivers with capacity of up to 1.6 terabits. We are shipping qualification samples of our 200 gig EMLs now and expect to ramp production in calendar '24 with customer qualifications of 800 gig and 1.6 terabit transceiver designs well underway. We expect that 200 gig per lane optics will be the workhorse of hyperscale data centers for years to come once these qualifications are completed. Through Cloud Light, Lumentum is now a leader in high-speed active optical cables, or AOCs, as well as VCSEL-based transceivers to cloud customers to fulfill their short-reach connectivity requirements for new AI and machine learning cluster architectures. In addition, we've been developing high-speed 100 gigabit per second VCSELs and VCSEL arrays for these short-reach optical links, and we expect to ramp these shipments meaningfully in calendar '24. Moving on to our high-speed transmission product developments, we are receiving positive customer feedback on our next generation of 130 gigabaud and 200 gigabaud data rate coherent technologies. These high-speed products will be available in both discrete and integrated form factors to enable enhanced performance in metro and long-haul applications. In addition, at the ECOC conference last month, we received positive customer feedback on our coherent 800 gig ZR product. We believe we are the first to market with this capability, which will provide high-speed connectivity with extended reach for data center interconnect within metropolitan areas. Turning to Industrial Tech. Fiscal Q1 was up 4% sequentially from Q4, driven by the expected uptick in our 3D sensing business with a new smartphone product ramp partially offset by softness in fiber lasers as our leading fiber laser customer works to bring down inventory. Industrial Tech is down 40% year-over-year as expected, primarily due to more intense competition for market share on a certain 3D sensing socket, end market demand and pricing, as discussed previously. Based on our latest customer forecasts, we continue to expect industrial lasers demand to be soft into calendar 2024 due to customer inventory digestion and macro factors impacting end markets. However, we expect the rapid growth in new applications for ultrafast lasers to partially offset these near-term headwinds given growth in new solar cell manufacturing applications. To summarize, our market outlook is currently a tale of two dynamics. On the other hand, outside of the data center customers, we are facing continued headwinds from networking and industrial customer inventory digestion. In all of our end markets, we are committed to our long-term R&D roadmaps, and we are positioning the company for the robust growth of photonics opportunities that we see ahead. Before turning it over to Wajid, I would like to again welcome our new employees from Cloud Light, and thank all of our employees and our customers around the world for their focus and dedication as they continue to collaborate and partner with Lumentum. With that, Wajid?\nWajid Ali: Thank you, Alan. Net revenue for the first quarter was $317.6 million, which was down 14% sequentially and down 37% year-on-year. During the quarter, we had three greater than 10% customers, two of which are in Networking and one 10% customer in the Industrial Tech market. GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 24.1%, GAAP operating loss was 25.4%, and GAAP diluted net loss per share was $1.02. First quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 34.9%, which was down sequentially and down year-on-year, primarily driven by product mix, factory underutilization, and lower revenue. First quarter non-GAAP operating margin was 3.3%, which decreased sequentially and year-on-year. First quarter non-GAAP operating income was $10.6 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $34.6 million. First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $100.1 million, or 31.5% of revenue, down $2.3 million from Q4 and down $6.6 million from the year-ago quarter due to tight expense controls. Q1 non-GAAP SG&A expense was $39.1 million. Non-GAAP R&D expense was $61 million. Interest and other income was $16.8 million on a non-GAAP basis due to higher interest rates on our cash and investments. First quarter non-GAAP net income was $23.4 million and non-GAAP diluted net income per share was $0.35. Our fully diluted share count for the first quarter was 67 million shares on a non-GAAP basis. Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash position decreased during the quarter due to a few key items. We used $30 million in cash to purchase our wafer fab and campus in the UK. This purchase reflects our confidence in the longevity of indium phosphide technology to address the ever-growing need for higher and higher performance telecom transmission components. In order to capture our COGS synergies from the NeoPhotonics acquisition, we are pre-building nearly $30 million of inventory to help facilitate the factory consolidation happening over the next few months. And we had an annual Japan tax payment of approximately $17 million, as well as expenses related to the Cloud Light acquisition. As a result, cash and short-term investments decreased $69 million sequentially to $1.94 billion. To streamline operations and achieve synergies, we will be consolidating NeoPhotonics back-end manufacturing facilities, and therefore, we expect an under-absorption of capacity relating to these moves during Q2 and Q3. By the end of Q4, as we ramp up production of NeoPhotonics' products within Lumentum's manufacturing footprint, we expect to shift buffer inventory, enabling these manufacturing costs to align with the rest of our production. In addition, as we continue to focus on cash generation, we expect our internal inventories to decline throughout the balance of the fiscal year. Turning to segment details. For the benefit of our investors, we have expanded our earnings press release to include tables of historical financial data that are reformatted into our new segment categories. First quarter Cloud & Networking segment revenue at $229.7 million decreased 19.8% sequentially and was down 36.2% year-on-year. Cloud & Networking segment non-GAAP reporting profit at 10.4% decreased sequentially and year-on-year. Our first quarter Industrial Tech segment revenue at $87.9 million was up 4.3% sequentially and down 40.1% year-on-year. First quarter Industrial Tech non-GAAP reporting profit of 17.4% was up sequentially, but down year-on-year. Now let me move to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '24, which is on a non-GAAP basis and is based on our assumptions as of today. We expect net revenue for the second quarter of fiscal '24 to be in the range of $350 million to $380 million. Within this Q2 revenue forecast, we anticipate Industrial Tech to be down sequentially with Cloud & Networking to be up sequentially with the addition of a partial quarter of Cloud Light revenue. Based on this, we project second quarter non-GAAP operating margin to be in the range of 2% to 4%, and diluted net income per share to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.35. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance for the second quarter is based on a non-GAAP annual effective tax rate of 14.5%. These projections also assume an approximate share count of 67.4 million shares. In terms of expectations beyond Q2, as Alan mentioned, we do expect a return to growth in Cloud & Networking shipments in calendar '24 compared to calendar '23 as customer inventory levels are reduced and our shipment rate is more in sync with end market demand. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathy to start the Q&A session. Kathy?\nKathy Ta: Thank you, Wajid. Before we start the Q&A session, I would like to ask everyone to keep to one question and one follow-up. This should help us get to as many participants as possible before the end of our allotted time. Now, let's begin the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSimon Leopold: Great, thanks for taking the question. I'll start off with a very easy one. Just want to get an understanding of what your assumption is for the contribution from Cloud Light into the -- in the guidance for the December quarter. And because that's so easy, I'll give you my second question now. I'm wondering if you could maybe unpack a bit what you see going on in the ZR market now in that -- I know we've had a period of inventory absorption and during the ECOC trade show, it sounded like there was maybe some visibility to that market improving. If you could maybe unpack what you're seeing in that segment, both from a laser perspective as well as your own ZR devices? Thank you.\nAlan Lowe: Thanks, Simon. The Cloud Light revenue is the revenue that they're going to ship from when we announced it closing, which was yesterday. So, about seven-and-a-half weeks of revenue. And we talked about trailing over $200 million, so you can extrapolate what you think the two months will be. And we're not going to actually break that out in any further detail. As far as the ZR market visibility is concerned, I think with all of what's going on inside the data centers with AI and machine learning, we've seen a pickup in ZR demand, in fact, probably earlier than we would have expected otherwise. And so, I'd say that, that has some healthy tailwind to it for data center interconnect, and we've seen some of that come through some of our hyperscale customers in new demand for the ZR modules. Chris, do you have anything else to add on either of those?\nChris Coldren: No. I think that's great.\nKathy Ta: Thank you, Simon.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJoe Cardoso: Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik Chatterjee. Yeah, first question for me. Can you just give us some granularity relative to the underlying trends you're seeing in telecom? I think one of your peers in the space suggested it's seeing a bottom in the September quarter itself and expects it to begin to recover in subsequent quarters, and while another suggested it's more of a mid-2024 phenomenon. Just curious where you are landing on that spectrum and what's driving your confidence there. And then I have a follow-up.\nAlan Lowe: Sure. I'd say we're kind of in between in that -- we still are under-shipping end market demand and I'd say that we've seen some end market demand softening, frankly. And so, that's why we continue to see muted demand for our telecom products. That said, I do think that we'll see inventories being reduced in this time period as well as December, but I'd say there's probably still some inventory consumption going on even into early parts of calendar '24.\nJoe Cardoso: No, I got it. Thanks. I appreciate the color, Alan. And then, just relative to the non-Cloud Light datacom business, you had been talking about ramping capacity there, including some rehiring of headcount. I believe you were moving to a larger wafer size, et cetera. So, a bunch of moving pieces. I guess, can you just give us an update on how that is tracking? And then just whether with Cloud Light on the books now, does that help you accelerate some of these initiatives relative to what you were doing in terms of ramping capacity for the legacy piece of the datacom business? Thanks for all the questions.\nAlan Lowe: Sure. The datacom EML market is very robust and we are on allocation again unfortunately, but our capacity is coming online as we had projected and as we had discussed on prior calls. But the demand, again, is even more robust, given that the hyperscalers really want to go to 800 gig. And if you go with an EML solution, most of those solutions have eight chips as opposed to four chips to get to 400 gig. So, doubling of the chips per transceiver means more and more datacom chips. So, we've seen extreme growth in that business, and we are still on track to go to increased wafer size in calendar 2024. So, all that work is going on in the fab, while at the same time, we are growing our capacity from the capital additions we made earlier this year that are coming online, as well as, as you said, bringing back employees and hiring to be able to meet the demands, although we're still on allocation today on EMLs because they did come back much faster than we had actually expected. So, our backlog is strong through the balance of the fiscal year, and we expect that to continue to grow into fiscal '25, especially as we bring on 200 gig per lane EMLs, and I think we're going to be in a very strong leadership position there as well. In Cloud Light, Cloud Light's designs are -- today are both multi-modal VCSEL-based, and so we're expecting to use our VCSEL designs to do product in-feeds and drive costs down and margins up, as well as silicon photonics-based. And so, we're working with Cloud Light's team today on how do we get our CW laser more prevalent in their designs as we move forward. So, it doesn't impact our EML capacity per se, but it does give us opportunities for margin improvement over time.\nJoe Cardoso: Understood. Very clear. Thanks, Alan.\nAlan Lowe: Great. Thanks.\nKathy Ta: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Maybe first question just on, whether you have kind of ironed out more of what CapEx investment you think Cloud Light will take during the year? And then, maybe as a second question kind of building off of Simon's question, you mentioned kind of the 800 ZR getting positive reception at ECOC. Just when would you expect that to kind of ramp into production? Thanks.\nAlan Lowe: So, as you can imagine, the Cloud Light ramp has been very steep. And one of the things that we work with them on is to make sure that they continue to invest pre-acquisition, and they have. So, they've been continuing to grow their capacity. As far as future CapEx requirements, I'd say it's a little early in that. We have been getting very positive feedback from hyperscalers, customers, and we expect that the acceleration of growth will be even stronger than expected. So, I think it's a little bit early to really determine are we going to further accelerate or stay on the path that they were on. I would say, we're probably going to have to accelerate CapEx as we've gotten feedback again from not only existing customers but new customers that they don't have much footprint in as they view this really as an extreme positive of a diversification of a U.S.-headquartered company and manufacturing footprint that is more global than current existing Cloud Light. So, I think we'll have to wait on that and give you an update on our CapEx plans for Cloud Light on the next call or some future meeting. As far as the 800 gig ZR ramp, I think we're still at the demonstration stage today. And again, positive feedback at ECOC. We've got to get from where we are today to beta samples and qualification samples, and then it takes a couple thousand hours of testing to get to production. So, I'd say that's really more of an early fiscal '25 and late calendar '24 type of initial ramp. But again I think we're positioned quite well with what we think will be first to market on that product. So, very, very happy with progress there.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks.\nKathy Ta: Thank you, Meta.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vogt from UBS. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thanks, guys, for all the color. I'm just going to try maybe triangulating again on this Cloud Light transaction. So I think, Alan, in your prepared remarks, you suggested that the business should accelerate to about 30% growth in calendar year '24. If I just do some really quick math, does that assume your legacy business returns to growth in '24 based on sort of the disclosure that Cloud Light has about $200 million of revenue growing, obviously relatively rapidly? And then in conjunction with that, from a margin perspective, I know you talked about it on the last call, as it being sort of a slightly accretive transaction with regards to the first 12 months post-closing. But can you maybe share with us sort of the margin profile of this business relative to the existing sort of Cloud & Networking part of the business pre the transaction? Thanks.\nAlan Lowe: Yeah, let me take the first question and then I'll have Wajid talk about Cloud Light margins. So, I think you're right about the growth rate. And again, as I said to Meta's earlier question, feedback has been very positive. And when we turn those -- that feedback into orders, we could grow faster. But again, I think that's a little early. But the impact on -- I don't think Cloud Light has any impact on the legacy business except that we're very much closer to the cloud customers. And we're not going to guide more than one quarter at a time. We're actually not going to split up legacy versus Cloud Light in the future. But I'd say that as we talked about, we do believe we're under-shipping end market demand and inventories are reducing. So, we do anticipate that in the first half of '24 that there's probably a pickup. More matching our shipments within customer consumption, probably in Q4. So, I would expect that we would see a pickup in Q4 from today's level. But Q3 is a little bit hard to call right now. Wajid?\nWajid Ali: Yeah, David, so on the margin profile, we certainly see a lot of opportunity with Cloud Light. With the rapid growth that we're expecting in the business, there's some natural leverage that we should see at Cloud Light. And there's also a lot of opportunity with our existing manufacturing footprint to help that part of the business grow while utilizing some of the manufacturing capacity that we've also got. And then, probably the most important thing, which our R&D teams are going to be working with their R&D teams over the next few weeks, is really our plans around vertical integration. And those plans around vertical integration can provide quite a bit of upside from an in-feed standpoint on their own raw materials. So having said that, what we've communicated previously is that the Cloud Light business is currently operating in the low-teens from an operating margin standpoint and in the high-teens from an EBITDA standpoint. Our expectation that we've communicated is that, through the opportunities that we see that we can certainly get that business into the high-teens from an operating margin standpoint over the next 24 months. As the teams dig in more with their R&D teams, we'll be able to update our thinking around that in future quarters, but that's currently where our thinking is in terms of the business.\nDavid Vogt: Great. Thank you, guys.\nKathy Ta: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. First question, I know you gave a 30% growth potential for Cloud Light, but that's more like a three to five year. Is it fair to say that they're growing faster than that? When I look at a lot of the compute deployments, they are growing like a 40%, 50% type of CAGR. So, is it fair to assume that at least in the near- to medium-term, Cloud Light could be growing more at a 40%, 50% rather than a 30% rate?\nAlan Lowe: Yeah, I think that's fair. Given the introduction and rapid growth at 800 gig, we expect that Cloud Light should be able to grow faster than that 30% CAGR. That is a multi-year number. As 800 gig has been introduced, we highlighted that Cloud Light's revenue in the most recent quarter was more than 50% 800 gigs. So, we'll be highly leveraged to the growth of that as customers at the leading edge of AI deployments continue to shift to the 800-gig speed.\nVivek Arya: Thank you. And for my follow-up, I just wanted to kind of double check the accretion math or the potential accretion math. So first of all, when you say something is accretive, are you talking on an EBITDA level? Are you talking on an operating income level? At an EPS level? So, if you could define what accretion means? And let's say if you define accretion on an EPS level, then is it immediately accretive, or will it be accretive sometime in the fiscal year when we put in all the puts and takes of the financial income, right, that is being lost on other fab consolidation activities and so forth? So, when is it actually potentially accretive on an EPS perspective in your opinion?\nWajid Ali: So, Vivek, we've communicated this earlier. We believe it's immediately accretive to earnings per share. And the way we do the math on the earnings per share is the operating income we expect to generate from Cloud Light on a standalone basis without synergies and compare that to what we're earning in our short-term overnight money market rates. And so, we just take a look at those two to determine accretion. And based on that, the transaction is immediately accretive. And that accretion only improves as we go through some of the synergy actions I spoke about earlier.\nVivek Arya: Understood. Thank you.\nKathy Ta: Thanks, Vivek.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Notter from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Notter: Hi guys, thanks very much. I'm just curious if you guys have gotten any other feedback on the Cloud Light acquisition from your other datacom customers. I think obviously you're competing with some of those folks increasingly. I'm just wondering if in the last week or two you've had any more feedback. Is this something that becomes problematic for the rest of the datacom business or non-issue? Thanks.\nAlan Lowe: Yeah, thanks, George. As you can imagine, I've had many discussions with our very important transceiver customers to assure them that our partnership is still very solid and they're very, very important to us. And I think there's plenty of demand to go around. And we've acted like strong partners with them over time. So, I'd say that the alternative is that they buy from another competitor or they buy from someone that they've trusted for years. And so, I don't see any negative implication with respect to our transceiver customers and their demand on us for EMLs, VCSELs, and DMLs for that matter. So, I think so far so good. The feedback has been positive. And we have not seen any demand shifts as a result of the announcement from a week or two ago.\nGeorge Notter: Got it. Thank you very much.\nAlan Lowe: Thanks, George.\nKathy Ta: Thank you, George.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rowland from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Rowland: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. One of your competitors spoke of a strong ramp in 800G starting in March. I was wondering if you could kind of describe the shape of your 800G ramp here over the next 12 to 18 months. And they were going to see kind of as a result of this strong growth, sequential growth each quarter of next year. I was wondering if you would see something similar on your horizon.\nWajid Ali: Hey, Chris. Yes, I would say we would see very similar commentary that both from the chip standpoint that we are shipping a lot of EMLs and have very strong demand that we expect continues over the next four-plus quarters as 800 gig continues to ramp. And then from the Cloud Light acquisition, their revenue is, as we've highlighted on the call, increasingly focused on 800 gig. And that is in its very early days, that market is just emerging and will continue to ramp up into the future. So yes, we believe the 800 gig portion of our cloud business will continue to grow into the foreseeable future.\nChristopher Rowland: Okay. I don't know if you had a take on sequential growth in each quarter of next year, calendar year. But for my second question, I wanted to talk about kind of custom engagements for laser designs by both system vendors, holistic system and -- vendors, but also hyperscalers out there. And I don't know if it's possible to break out cloud networking demand, so 51 terabit switches versus AI, but how do you think this mixes out for next year as well? Thank you.\nChris Coldren: Yeah. So, a couple pieces. So, on the last bit with regards to where our products are landing, if you will, AI versus non-AI, we don't have 100% visibility to that. But our belief is that for the next year, at least, most of the growth or the primary growth in the market is driven by AI-driven applications. And then going back to custom laser designs, or if you will, yes, we are engaged with both, as you said, system providers, if you will, as well as cloud operators directly, hyperscalers. On custom laser solutions as well as now with Cloud Light custom transceiver solutions as AI continues to push the performance envelope and stress from power consumption, latency, and other requirements that are really critical to AI workloads. And that's one of the benefits of this combination, that we're bringing together unique manufacturing capabilities from Cloud Light, bringing together our unique chip manufacturing so that when we partner with customers, we have the full tool chest, if you will, to address the challenges of next generation roadmaps that they're looking to implement sooner than later.\nChristopher Rowland: Thanks, Chris.\nKathy Ta: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Barua from Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAnanda Barua: Yeah, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. Yes, I'll just stick to transceivers as well. Do you guys see, and this would probably be for Chris or Alan, any latency points or sticking points getting Cloud Light -- now that you've closed the deal, getting Cloud Light volumes to kind of what you call run rate? Then I have a quick follow-up.\nAlan Lowe: Could you clarify what you mean, Ananda?\nAnanda Barua: Yeah. So, I mean, I guess is everything in place, is it as simple as just taking the orders in and shipping them out? Or given that -- sort of given that they're newly absorbed into the organization, given that your balance sheet and your kind of street credit, so to speak, may open up new opportunities for them, given the manufacturing capability they have in place, are there things that could be required that could, in the near term, cause some latency to getting those orders out the door as they come in? So just wondering, is the mechanism is it just set up to work smoothly and elegantly right now taking the orders in and send them out, or is there something that needs to be put into place or accomplish near-term to get the orders to run rate revenue?\nAlan Lowe: Yeah. I mean, the Cloud Light team is not lacking orders, if that's what you mean. So I think, as I said earlier, capacity plans and CapEx plans have continued to be able to ramp to the kind of volumes that they had visibility to prior to the acquisition. That said, I do think we will see further demand acceleration and that could take additional capacity in -- as well as additional factory footprint. And I think that would be then accelerated with the acquisition and that we have factory footprint that we could expand into today. Given that we're all of 24 hours into the close and we have a team there now, we're sorting all that out, frankly, and we hope not to screw it up, frankly. So, they've been doing very well. We're trying to stay -- we're trying to let them do their stuff and not distract them as they're going up a very, very steep ramp. But that said, we're here to help them. And I think the combination is really a winner from my discussions with those cloud customers.\nAnanda Barua: Yeah, that's super helpful. That's super helpful. And I guess just in that regard, sort of the follow-up would be, given you made two acquisitions in the -- you're sort of in the pluggable space in the last 12 months or so -- sort of 12 to -- four to six quarters, could you stay active in this area? It's obviously an area of interest. Do you have everything you need? Or do you think -- does it make sense that you could keep looking from a tech perspective?\nAlan Lowe: Yeah. I mean we're always looking. I think our focus is making sure we finish the acquisition synergies of NeoPhotonics, and Wajid talked about that. The back-end factory consolidation is happening now, and we'll get the benefit of those synergies at the end of this fiscal year, and that's meaningful. So, we have to finish that and we have to make sure that the Cloud Light acquisition goes up the ramp effectively to meet the demand of what's going on in the hyperscalers and AI/ML stuff. So, I think we have our hands full today for the next several quarters. But that said, we're always looking and always interested in what we might be able to tuck-in to give us another competitive advantage over our competition. Chris, do you have anything else to add there?\nChris Coldren: I was just going to say that to reiterate that I think Ananda is hitting a key point that we have had a deliberate strategy to build out both technology, manufacturing on the component capabilities over the last N number of years, and then that's translated into now getting more pluggable transceiver capabilities. And as Alan highlighted, as that all has come together now, we've got time to put all those pieces together and fully realize the benefits of those acquisitions and the post-acquisition organic work we are performing to really unlock the value and the multiplier effect between all of these acquisitions. But we are continuing to look. We are not done, if you will, building out our technology and product portfolios. But for the time being, we've got a lot of work to do to realize the maximum potential of what we've already taken on.\nAnanda Barua: Thanks, guys.\nKathy Ta: Thanks, Ananda.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Genovese from Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Genovese: Great. Thanks. First, can you talk -- can you guys talk more about the optical switch opportunity for AI? How -- more about that technology and sort of how far away revenues are? And is that a MEMS-based product? I'm curious.\nChris Coldren: Hey, Mike. So, in today's data centers, obviously, there's a lot of bandwidth going around and as we've seen in core telecom networks for years being able to reconfigure the network optically and electronically brings a lot of value in hyperscale network operators or cloud operators rather, are beginning to realize that being able to reconfigure bandwidth optically within data centers is a key capability. There's a range of technology that can be applied. In our case, it's certainly will involve MEMS. I would say, in terms of time to market, a little premature to talk about an exact timeframe, but I think over the next year, you're going to hear a lot more about it as prototypes begin to ship.\nMike Genovese: Okay, great. Thanks, Chris. And I guess something maybe more immediate then, your competitor yesterday spoke about some near-term opportunity where they expected sequential growth because of some transport opportunities in China, WSS, ROADMs and AMPs. Are you seeing anything similar to that?\nAlan Lowe: Yeah. I mean we've seen the China mobile tender is happening, and it's really -- it's kind of nice to get a customer to expedite WSSs and the components that go around them. So, we've been in the midst of that, and we're trying to meet that demand for tender. And I think it's meaningfully large and it's an opportunity and I think one that will drive calendar '24 volumes more meaningful for that specific opportunity. But that's, I think, more of a unique situation where the deployments are happening -- or the bidding is happening and the deployments will happen early parts of next year. So yes, that is an opportunity. We are seeing that. And I've been on the phone with the executives there to help them get what they need when they need it.\nMike Genovese: Okay. Perfect. Thanks for the color. Thanks, Alan.\nAlan Lowe: Thanks, Mike.\nKathy Ta: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Question comes from the line of Ruben Roy from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nRuben Roy: Yeah, thank you. To just follow up there, Alan, you did mention that you're -- I think, over the last 90 days, it sounded like you started to see some areas of telco softness. I was wondering if that was a geography-based comment or customer or end market-based comment. Any additional detail there, please.\nAlan Lowe: I think it's just echoing what I think you've heard from some of our network equipment manufacturers around regional softness and an inventory at the North America carriers. So I don't think it's anything new and enlightening. It's kind of more of the same that we've seen that is making us be cautious about the outlook for current quarter and into early calendar '24.\nRuben Roy: Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, probably for Chris. With even more focused on data center optics, I was wondering if you can give us an update on how you're thinking about the coherent DSP project? And whether or not longer term, you think there's spot for that team and what you're planning on with data center optics there?\nChris Coldren: Yeah. So certainly, we continue to make great progress in developing our coherent DSP, which is one of -- another puzzle piece, if you will, in our pluggable module strategy. So, we expect that we will start evaluating our latest 400-gig parts in calendar '24, early calendar '24. And yeah, I think it's a critical capability both for the data center interconnect opportunity. And over the longer run, in fact, we expect that technology to penetrate further inside of the data center as well, I think you referenced.\nAlan Lowe: And maybe if I could add to that, Ruben...\nRuben Roy: Thank you.\nAlan Lowe: If I could add to that as well, we have been building out not only our DSP team but other RFIC team to have critically-enabling components in-house to address that margin stacking of the independent IC company. So that -- those teams have been building out, and we've started to see the benefits of things like TIAs and drivers that having that in-house is a big benefit for us.\nRuben Roy: Very helpful. Thank you.\nAlan Lowe: Sure.\nKathy Ta: Thanks, Ruben.\nOperator: And we have our next question coming from the line of Dave Kang from B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nDave Kang: Thank you. Good morning. First question is regarding your comments on telecom. So, how much decline are we -- should we expect in the December quarter? Are we talking a slight decline or still like a high-single digit to maybe even double-digits?\nAlan Lowe: Yeah, I don't think we had indicated that there'd be a decline. I think what we're indicating is that we're still shipping below end customer consumption. And so, it's muted with respect to being back to parity with regard to us building and shipping what our customers are shipping and deploying. And so that's more the comments than it's going the wrong direction because we're already at a very low level.\nDave Kang: Got it. And then regarding your comments about C&N being up in calendar '24 year-over-year, I assume that was organic, right?\nAlan Lowe: I'm sorry, I missed the beginning of the question. What being up?\nDave Kang: Cloud & Networking, I think -- I believe you said it's going to be up calendar '24. It's organic, right?\nAlan Lowe: I would say both organic and inorganic, we expect that to be up. Yes.\nDave Kang: Okay. So just to be clear, I mean, even without Cloud Light, C&N will be up next year, next calendar year?\nAlan Lowe: Yeah.\nDave Kang: Yeah. Okay. Just wanted to clarify that. Thank you. Okay.\nAlan Lowe: Sure.\nKathy Ta: Thanks, Dave.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Alan Lowe for final closing comments.\nAlan Lowe: Great, and thank you. I'd like to leave you with a few thoughts as we wrap up this call. First, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to the Cloud Light team joining Lumentum. The talented Cloud Light team already excels at delivering the highest speed optical transceivers to cloud data center operators and infrastructure providers. I very much look forward to our R&D teams working together to see what else is possible to deliver even more leading-edge product innovations to our customers. In addition, our business fundamentals are solid for the mid- to long-term as we serve the exponential growth in data center bandwidth required by the artificial intelligence, machine learning, mobile, carrier and cloud computing markets. New industrial applications are driving demand for our advanced imaging and sensing products, and our commercial lasers are expanding into high-growth applications beyond our traditional markets. We are committed to investing in innovation to meet customer needs today and in the future. With that, I would like to thank everyone for attending, and we look forward to talking with you again at investor conferences and upcoming meetings in the coming weeks. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a lovely day."
