Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to John Beisler with Three Part Advisors. Please go ahead.\nJohn Beisler: Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining us for the Crown Crafts third quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. Joining me today are Crown Crafts' President and CEO, Olivia Elliott, and the company's CFO, Craig Demarest. Earlier this morning, Crown Crafts filed its 10-Q and issued a press release regarding their third quarter fiscal 2024 results. A copy of this release is available on the company's website, crowncrafts.com. During today's call, the company will make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may be beyond Crown Crafts control, and the company is under no obligation to update these statements. For more information about the company's risk factors and other uncertainties, please refer to the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, I would like to remind you today's call is being recorded, and a replay will be available through the company's Investor Relations page. Now I would like to turn the call over to the President and CEO, Olivia Elliott.\nOlivia Elliott: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect meaningful top and bottom line improvements. We saw our gross margin return to more historical levels, and we continue to see a nice contribution from Manhattan Toy, which contributed $6 million in net sales during the quarter. As we continue to monitor the macro environment, we are encouraged to see that recent economic reports indicate a more favorable outlook as the year progresses. However, the overall impact from the higher inflationary environment that has transpired over the past couple of years, continues to be a prolonged strain on our consumers as reflected yesterday in yesterday's CPI report. This is particularly evident at the lower end of the income scale where those consumers have experienced a longer-term effect to their discretionary income due to higher interest rates for mortgages and credit cards as well as the resumption of student loan repayments. Another encouraging update is the reopening of 11 buybuy Baby stores which started during the quarter. Although we did ship product to these locations, we expect this to be a more gradual benefit as they slowly roll out the opening of more stores.  buybuy Babyâ€™s goal is to open 100 additional stores over the next few years would equal the number of stores that were closed as part of last year's bankruptcy. These openings would be a great benefit, giving us additional physical locations for consumers to get a first-hand look and feel for our products particularly our higher-end infant bedding offerings. We also continue to work with other specialty retailers to add our products to their shelves.  We've made good controls on our inventory throughout the year as major retailers continue to carry lower levels of goods within their systems. At the end of the quarter, total inventory was $34.9 million compared to $34.2 million at the end of fiscal '23, compared to the same period last year, NoJo and Sassy inventory levels have declined from $25.8 million last year to $22.7 million this year. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Craig to cover the financials in more detail.\nCraig Demarest: Thank you, Olivia, and good morning, everyone. Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal '24 increased approximately 25% to $23.8 million compared to $19 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is attributable to the addition of Manhattan Toy, which added $6 million in net sales to the current year quarter. Net sales of bedding, blankets and accessories were essentially flat as consumers face the economic pressures that Olivia mentioned. Gross profit for the quarter was 27% compared to 23.7% in the third quarter of fiscal '23 as margins have returned to historical levels and consistent with year-to-date margins. Marketing and administrative expenses were $4.1 million in the current year quarter versus $2.7 million in the prior year quarter. This increase is primarily related to expenses associated with Manhattan Toy. Net income for the quarter was $1.7 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.3 million or $0.13 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Turning now to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the third quarter were $683,000 compared to $1.7 million at the end of fiscal '23. Borrowings on our revolver at the end of the quarter were $10 million compared to $12.7 million at the end of fiscal '23. And finally, we paid our regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share and declared our next dividend, which will be paid in April. On an annualized basis, our shares currently offer just over 6% yield based on yesterday's closing price. And now I will turn the call back over to Olivia for additional comments.\nOlivia Elliott: Thank you, Craig. As we approach the end of fiscal 2024, we continue to implement our long-term strategic plan, which was approved by our Board in fiscal 2023. As a reminder, this plan includes continuing growth in our Toy category through market share expansion within both Sassy and Manhattan Toy. Toys are projected to represent nearly half of our overall sales for fiscal 2024 compared to just 17% at the end of fiscal 2023.  We also have plans to enter into new and adjacent product categories through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions. We are working on product development to bring select items from the Manhattan Toy lineup into Walmart if the price points make sense and we continue to look at additional acquisition opportunities that expand or complement our existing portfolio. Selling direct to consumers has remained challenging, given the significant upfront spending to build out the website, followed by advertising of the brand. Manhattan Toy had a website in place at the time of the acquisition, which we are using to sell some of the Sassy brands and our NoJo brand is ready to launch its own website. The remainder of the plan is centered on implementing operating cost efficiencies and investing in technology and our organizational structure. Our company has a long track record of holding expenses in line, and we will continue to run the business with this at the forefront. Overall, we continue to manage our business through the ongoing macroeconomic challenges while positioning our brands to capitalize when the overall economy improves. We believe the long-term prospects of the company remain favorable, as evident by our long-standing track record and dividends and look forward to delivering long-term value to our shareholders. With that, I'd like to open up the line for questions. Danielle?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Doug Ruth of Lenox Financial Services. Please go ahead. \nDouglas Ruth: Olivia, and Craig, congratulations, a very good report. A couple of questions for you. Can you talk about -- are you having any success lowering the Manhattan Toy manufacturing cost?\nOlivia Elliott: Yes. Actually, we are. So I mean, we've kind of went into this with a look at everything from the first cost to freight pretty much everything across the whole manufacturing channel, we've managed to get some decreases. \nDouglas Ruth: Is there more to come, do you think?\nOlivia Elliott: We are always trying. So I mean we're pushing on certain things. I mean as you know, the inventory that was already in the warehouse was at some higher cost. And so as we run through that, I'm hopeful that we can see more decreases.\nDouglas Ruth: Okay. And my understanding is that you are considering the possibility of combining warehouses. Could you maybe explain to us what's happening with that?\nOlivia Elliott: We're on the early stages of that. So yes, we're starting to look at other locations for warehouses, possibly even outside of California. And so to do that, it's a pretty big commitment and it takes some time because when we do make a move, it will be for at least hopefully, 10 years or more. So we want to make sure we get it right. So we're looking at that on the front end right now. And hopefully, we'll have a solution within the next 18 months or so.\nDouglas Ruth: Okay. Very good. And then my final question, can you give us a little bit more color on the relationship with Walmart? And is it possible that maybe Manhattan Toy might be able to get into Walmart, maybe in fiscal 2025 is -- anything you could share is appreciated.\nOlivia Elliott: So yes, we've got a very good relationship with Walmart. Sassy and NoJo have both been selling to them for many, many years, longer than I've been at the company. And so we are talking to Walmart. We do have some opportunities in a very minimal amount of stores in fiscal 2025. But hopefully, if the sales go well with that, then we'll have an opportunity to expand more. \nDouglas Ruth: Okay. Thank you for answering my questions. And congratulations, really a tremendous earnings report.\nOlivia Elliott: Thank you, Doug.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] As there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Olivia Elliott for closing remarks.\nOlivia Elliott: Thank you for your continued interest in our company. We look forward to speaking with you again when we report our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results in June. Thank you. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Now I would like to turn the call over to the President and CEO, Olivia Elliott.\nOlivia Elliott: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect the continued progress at Manhattan Toy and year-over-year sales growth within our two legacy categories. While encouraging, cost pressures facing consumers continue to constrain spending, even though overall inflation has trended lower in recent months.  The reopening of 11 buybuy Baby stores is a welcome addition to the marketplace. But this represents only a fraction of the brick and mortar stores that were closed as part of its bankruptcy earlier this year. Having a physical location to experience the difference between our products and others is a key differentiator, and we believe specialty retailers represent an opportunity going forward.  We continue to work with our existing customers to maintain our strong relationships and look for additional cost reduction opportunities across the company. We are effectively managing our inventory. At the end of the quarter, inventory for our Sassy and NoJo brands was 21 million compared to almost 28 million a year ago.  With that, I would like to turn the call over to Craig to cover some financial information.\nCraig Demarest: Thank you, Olivia, and good morning, everyone. Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal '24 increased 28.9% to 24.1 million compared to 18.7 million in the prior year quarter, or an increase of 5.4 million. The increase is primarily attributable to the addition of Manhattan Toy, which added 4.8 million in net sales to the current year quarter and due to slight increases in our NoJo and Sassy businesses.  Gross profit for the second quarter was 27.3% compared to 29.1% in the second quarter of fiscal '23. The profit decrease was primarily attributable to higher lease costs for our warehouse in California. Our second quarter marketing and administrative expenses were 4 million, up 1.3 million from 2.7 million in the prior year quarter, and increased from 14.6% of net sales for the prior year quarter to 16.7% of net sales currently.  The increase is primarily driven by expenses of Manhattan Toy. Net income for the quarter was 1.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared to net income of 2 million or $0.20 per diluted share in the prior year quarter.  Now turning to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the quarter were 1.9 million compared to 1.7 million at the end of fiscal '23 and borrowings on our revolver at the end of the quarter were 9.8 million compared to 12.7 million at the end of fiscal '23.  And finally, we paid our regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share and declared our next dividend which will be paid in January. On an annualized basis, our shares currently offer a 7.6% yield based on yesterday's closing price.  And now, I'll turn the call back over to Olivia for additional comments.\nOlivia Elliott: Thank you, Craig. Since we acquired Manhattan Toy in March, its sales have followed their historical trend with the September quarter outpacing June and we expect the upcoming holiday quarter to be their largest sales quarter representing between 35% to 40% of its annual sales. We continue to find ways to reduce cost, which should lead to better margins for Manhattan Toy.  We're encouraged by the favorable response we received at last month's New York Toy Fair, where we introduce new toy designs. We will continue to proactively manage our business in the current challenging economic environment so that we remain in a position to capitalize on growth opportunity. We continue to be optimistic about the long-term prospects of the company and look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.  With that, I'd like to open up the line for questions. MJ?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. \n :\n :\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the call back to Olivia Elliott for closing remarks.\nOlivia Elliott: Thank you for your continued interest in our company. We will be participating in the Three Part Advisors IDEAS Conference in Dallas, tomorrow, November 16. We look forward to speaking with you again when we report our third quarter results in February. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Now I would like to turn the call over to the President and CEO of Crown Crafts, Olivia Elliott.\nOlivia Elliott: Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I would first like to thank our entire team for their resiliency as we reported another profitable quarter despite the multiple headwinds impacting our business. We also completed our first full quarter integrating Manhattan Toy, and we'll share our progress with you a little bit later. Our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 reflect the ongoing challenges facing the consumer. Food and housing costs continue to run above the overall inflation rate and gasoline prices have begun to rise again. All of these items continue to limit the amount of discretionary income available to consumers causing them to either purchase fewer items or trade down to lower-priced products. Retailers are also carrying less inventory, in some cases, going from 10 weeks of product on hand to six. Additionally, the recent closure of all Buy Buy Baby stores has left the marketplace without a national brand with brick-and-mortar locations to sell higher-end company branded infant bedding. Although some of the prior Buy Buy Baby locations are reopening under a different brand, and the Babies \"R\" Us brand has been revived. They are both in the very early stages and represent a small fraction of the locations both of these brands previously operated. As a result, we believe that specialty retailers will be a key player to fill the existing void. We are responding to these ongoing challenges by further strengthening relationships with current customers and implementing cost reduction initiatives across our business. Lastly, we paid our regular quarterly dividend, which is a testament to our long-term commitment to drive shareholder value. With that, I would like to turn it over to Craig to cover the financials in more detail.\nCraig Demarest: Thank you, Olivia. Good morning, everyone. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal '24 increased 9% to $17.1 million compared to $15.7 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily attributable to the addition of Manhattan Toy, which added $3.7 million in net sales to the current year quarter and more than offset reduced orders from our customers as a result of ongoing macroeconomic conditions as well as the closure of Buy Buy Baby stores, which accounted for approximately $1.4 million in sales in the prior year quarter. Gross margin for the quarter was 27.7% compared to 32.8% in the first quarter of fiscal '23. The margin decrease was primarily attributable to the higher lease costs for our warehouse in California. Marketing and administrative expenses were $4 million versus $3.4 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is primarily driven by expenses of Manhattan Toy, including transaction costs of approximately $116,000, which were partially offset by lower compensation costs. Net income for the quarter was $366,000 or $0.04 per diluted share compared to net income of $1.4 million or $0.14 per diluted share in the prior year quarter. Turning to our balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the first quarter were $765,000 compared to $1.7 million at the end of fiscal '23 and borrowings on our revolver decreased from $12.7 million at the end of '23 to $6.5 million at the end of the first quarter. Finally, we paid our regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share and yesterday declared our next quarterly dividend, which will be paid in October. On an annualized basis, our shares currently offer a 6.6% yield based on yesterday's closing price. Now I will turn the call back over to Olivia for additional comments.\nOlivia Elliott: Thank you, Craig. We made progress on a number of the strategic opportunities we identified last quarter with Manhattan Toy, including negotiating better pricing with vendors in China, and we have received positive initial feedback from customers on new products. As Craig mentioned, Manhattan Toy added $3.7 million in sales for the quarter. As we noted on our last call, the March and June quarters are typically the slowest period for Manhattan Toy with an increase in the September quarter, peaking in the December quarter which has historically accounted for 35% to 40% of annual sales. We believe the previously mentioned items, combined with expanding our sales channels and improved freight costs can lead Manhattan Toy to be accretive to earnings by the end of fiscal 2024. Our subsidiaries are collaborating together to share contacts and expand their reach as they pursue cross-selling and international opportunities. Finally, all of our subsidiaries will be displaying at the K+J Trade Show in Germany next month, where we will show some of our newer designs to the international markets. We will also be in attendance at the New York Toy Fair the first weekend in October. Overall, we continue to proactively manage our business to address the ongoing, macroeconomic pressures and continue the integration of Manhattan Toy. We remain optimistic about the prospects of our company and look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. With that, I'd like to open up the line for questions. Keith?\nOperator:\nOlivia Elliott: Thank you for your continued interest in our company. We will be participating in the Three Part Advisors IDEAS Conference in Chicago on August 23rd, and we look forward to speaking with you again when we report our second quarter results in November. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect your lines."
