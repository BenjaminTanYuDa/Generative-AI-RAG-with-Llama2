I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sieffert, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nMichael Sieffert: Thank you. This is Michael Sieffert, the Chief Financial Officer of GreenPower Motor Company. I would like to welcome everyone to our call to discuss GreenPower's results for the three and nine month periods ended December 31, 2023, and recent developments. I'm here today with our Chief Executive Officer, Fraser Atkinson; and our President, Brendan Riley. During today's call, we may make comments or statements about our future expectations, plans and prospects which may constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in our quarterly interim results and MD&A filed on SEDAR and on EDGAR. In addition, these forward-looking statements relate to the date on which they are made. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause the company's views to change. GreenPower disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Also, during the course of today's call, we may refer to certain non-IFRS financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures can be found in our MD&A filed on SEDAR and on EDGAR and is also located on our website at www.greenpowermotor.com. I'll now pass the call over to Fraser Atkinson, GreenPower's CEO, to discuss highlights for the quarter.\nFraser Atkinson: Good morning, and thank you for joining GreenPower's quarterly earnings call today. Our School Bus group continued to make great strides in the third quarter. We achieved a significant milestone with the delivery of 4 Type A Nano BEAST school buses that were the first all-electric purpose-built school buses manufactured in West Virginia. Immediately following that delivery, production of the Type D BEAST school bus began in the West Virginia plant, which in the immediate term, will fulfill current orders for 38 BEAST school buses in West Virginia and prepare the production team for the mix manufacturing of BEASTS and Nano BEAST at the facility to meet the projected demand. Presently, we have live orders for 102 of our Type D Mega BEAST, BEAST and Type A Nano BEAST school buses, including our first order from our dealer in the state of New York. We also have the qualified sales pipeline for 164 GreenPower school buses. On the commercial vehicle side of the business, we had deliveries this quarter that included 10 EV Star Cab and Chassis to the Canadian unit of a global retailer who will upfit the vehicle for fulfillment of their orders to customers in the Greater Toronto market. Having said that, our commercial vehicle group with EV Star Cargo and EV Star passenger vehicles is several quarters behind the school bus group in terms of its order book. We expect to achieve similar growth with live orders, purchase orders and a qualified sales pipeline by leveraging new and existing incentive programs as well as third-party relationships. We've had delays from customers with deliveries of our EV Star Cab and Chassis, with inventory ready to go, we are now working on scheduling deliveries for these. Collectively, these will create a robust commercial vehicle group, which combined with the School Bus Group, will uniquely position GreenPower in the medium and heavy-duty EV sector. Over the past few years, we've maintained significant levels of finished goods inventory. We don't need to maintain these levels due to stocking orders from dealers who could provide demonstrations and Ride and Drives to their customers, along with a reduced competitive landscape. This is allowing us to shift from fulfilling orders from inventory to manufacturing vehicles pursuant to customer orders. How is GreenPower going to finance an increase in school bus orders and changes with our commercial vehicles, instead of a traditional facility, we needed to secure a facility focused on production financing. This morning, we announced that we've entered into a revolving loan agreement with Export Development Canada, or EDC, for up to $5 million upon all-electric vehicle production for certain customer orders, allowing for multiple advances over a 2-year period with repayments when vehicles are delivered. The revolving nature of the facility provides the flexibility to fund multiple orders and offers incremental capital in addition to GreenPower's existing $8 million operating line of credit and the guarantee of up to $5 million of standby letters of credit provided by EDC. I'll now pass the call to Michael Sieffert, GreenPower's CFO, to discuss our financial results for the quarter.\nMichael Sieffert: Thank you, Fraser. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, GreenPower generated revenue of $8.2 million, primarily from the sale and lease of 34 to all-electric vehicles, which included 13 BEAST and Nano BEAST school buses. This is a decline of 36.3% from the $12.8 million of revenue generated in the same quarter in the prior year from the sale of 101 all-electric vehicles, which included one Nano BEAST. Both quarters also included revenue from leases, parts sales and truck bodies. Gross profit was $1.4 million, and gross profit margin was 16.6% compared to $2.2 million and a gross profit of 17.4% in the prior year's quarter. The margin decline in the current quarter was primarily due to an inventory write-down of $408,000, which was included in cost of sales. The gross profit margin for the quarter would have been 21.6% without the inventory write-down. GreenPower generated a loss for the quarter of $4.6 million compared to a loss of $3.4 million in the same quarter of the prior year. For the nine months ended December 31, 2023, GreenPower generated revenue of $34.2 million, primarily from the sale of 196 vehicles in the current period, which was an increase of 40.1% from revenue of $24.4 million in the first nine months of the prior year, which was from the sale of 176 vehicles. Gross profit was $5.4 million and gross profit margin was 15.7% in the nine months ended December 31, 2023, compared to $4.9 million and a gross profit margin of 20.1% in the same period of the prior year. Inventory write-down of $408,000 included in the current year period reduced the gross profit margin by 1.2% from 16.9% to 15.7%. The GreenPower generated a loss for the 9-month period of $11.7 million compared to a loss of $11.2 million in the same period of the prior year. As at December 31, 2023, GreenPower had cash of $4 million, which was an increase of $3.4 million since the beginning of the year and working capital of $19.4 million. Improvements in the company's cash and available liquidity since March 31, 2023, were largely due to higher sales and due to focus on collections, which led to lower levels of inventory and accounts receivable. I would now like to turn the call over to GreenPower's President, Brendan Riley, to highlight some of the innovative achievements GreenPower reached during the quarter.\nBrendan Riley: Thank you, Michael, and good morning to you all. As Fraser mentioned, the continued strides are being made by our School Bus division. To this end and in our effort to help eliminate smelly polluting diesel school buses, we have been expanding our national efforts through the addition of new dealers and have hired more territory managers to support both our school bus end customers and dealerships alike. A major technical accomplishment of this division during this quarter was the introduction of the new Mega BEAST. It's our newest all-electric purpose-built school bus. We launched the Type D Mega BEAST school bus to meet the demands from school districts requiring V2G and longer range. This 40-foot, 90-passenger, Type D, zero emission school bus delivers class-leading range of up to 300 miles on a single charge. This is all due to the 387-kilowatt hour battery pack. Its V2G capabilities allow for more stable electric grid and community sustainability in areas which is deployed. I'm pleased to say that the market responded immediately to the introduction of our products and our California dealer Model 1 just placed an order for 25 Mega BEASTs for the Montebello School District just two weeks after we made the announcement of this product. Our Commercial Vehicle division has also produced a new innovative product during the quarter. GreenPower delivered its first EV Star cargo refrigerated van to UC school in California with dual batteries for increased resilience and continual eTRU cooling for the cargo area. It has diamond plate floor and an FDA spec interior area that is smooth, and allows for easier cleaning and sanitation for any of the refrigerated goods. In the next few months, we are expecting more innovation from this group from the cargo transportation space. At this point, we would like to now open up the call to any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Greg Lewis from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nGreg Lewis: Yes, thank you, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for taking my questions. Fraser, I was hoping to talk a little bit more about West Virginia and congratulations on getting some of those orders out the door. In terms of the production ramp, you mentioned the ability to go dual line BEAST and Nano. Any thoughts of how we should think about over the next few quarters, what those deliveries that delivery production profile could look like? And just as we think about the remaining all the BEAST Class D buses to West Virginia. Is that order -- do we need to get that order out of the way before we start selling buses into New York? Or is that -- are we going to expect those kind of -- to be coming off the line concurrently?\nFraser Atkinson: Well, first -- well, thanks for the multifaceted question there, Greg. First off, the -- our initial thought was that we would really only be positioned to do one of the Type A or the Type D being the Nano BEAST or the BEAST in West Virginia, but we're now at a place that having gone through the full cycle of the Nano BEAST and well into the first tranche for the Type D BEAST that we believe we can do both, and we certainly have the capacity to manage runs of both of those vehicles. So that has changed the dynamics. In terms of our expectation or the throughput, we're going to need a full cycle of the BEAST as we have done with the Nano BEAST as the first production run, you run into all of the various start-up issues and so on in terms of each of those runs. So that's what we're going through right now. And once we get this production run through and we're starting into the third, fourth runs, if you will, we'll have a much better visibility on what that throughput would be. We continue to add people and grow the production crews. So the capabilities are increasing by the month. In terms of the priorities, we've got the orders from New York, and certainly, the expectation is orders from additional states on the East Coast is that all of those or substantially all of those will be fulfilled out of West Virginia and the ordering of that will depend on really what we're focused on in terms of the production run at that point in time. So, for example, if we -- the third or the fourth production line or run is for Nano BEAST, so we have more Nano BEAST outside of the state of West Virginia, then that will end up being the mix of the deliveries and the sales for that particular period.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. Great. And then I did have a question on inventory. It was good to see that come down, and you made some comments in the prepared remarks around maybe a little bit more build to order. Is there any kind of way we should be thinking or any kind of guidance you can give us how you're thinking about inventory management and are we going to be -- maybe for the next couple of quarters, we're going to be able to kind of whittle down that -- some of that inventory with, I guess, improving our cash conversion.\nFraser Atkinson: Well, there may be a timing issue where we end up with at the end of any particular month or by extension a quarter or year-end where we have higher-than-expected finished goods simply because that's what's come off of the production line, and we haven't delivered and recognized revenue and so that's sitting in finished goods inventory. But the plan is certainly over the next few quarters that we can continue to utilize existing finished goods level and draw that down while we're moving from fulfilling customer orders from inventory to where we're into manufacturing and production pursuant to customer orders. So that's the plan over the next few quarters. And the facility we announced this morning is a big part of helping us transition or pivot to that approach.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from Craig Irwin from ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nCraig Irwin: Hi, good morning. First, I'd like to say congratulations on the strong backlog and the progress with BEAST and the Nano BEAST and the Mega BEAST. So it's nice to see everything coming together. I wanted to ask specifically if you could talk about how you're working with your customers on charging infrastructure. There's a conversation out there about the installation of charging infrastructure being a pinch point for the acceptance of these school buses about the ability to -- actually sites for some of these fleets being restricted because of utility time lines for new infrastructure and is there really maybe an advantage for the Nano BEAST as far as near-term volumes, given the complexities of adopting this technology?\nFraser Atkinson: Well, I'll let Brendan get into some of the details on your first question, but at a high level, the -- and I'm glad you mentioned the word utility because it's not just -- the perception is that the availability of chargers or the hardware side of the charging infrastructure is the pinch point. It’s really in large part the utilities and it's also the expectation of customers that are looking at vehicle to grid solutions and a broader implementation than simply acquiring and running school buses or all-electric school buses. So there's a lot of dynamics that are in play that have affected the timing on that side of our deployments. As far as the mix of products that we have brought to market is that you're quite right that the Type A Nano BEAST, which is built on our EV Star platform and by extension utilizes a lot of the same parts and components, which provides for ease of deployment, also is easier to deploy in terms of the infrastructure side as one can use a Level 2 charger or a DC fast charge. And so it really has a lot of flexibility. And that if the vehicle or the Type A Nano BEAST can be charge between a morning run and an afternoon run and still have sufficient battery capacity to do an evening event or activity run then it's a lot easier to install that Level 2 charger. But if they need to get a much faster top charge then we have the flexibility of installing Level 3 charger for that vehicle. And on that, I'll turn it to Brendan, who can provide a little bit more visibility on your first question regarding charging infrastructure.\nBrendan Riley: Yes. Thank you, Craig, for the very thoughtful question. This is Brendan Riley. The -- part of our strategy was, of course, to have the three different battery sizes from the [Betco]. We have a car size battery of the EV Star line of vehicles which the Nano BEAST has built on, that allows us to charge very easily with Level 2 overnight charging the same kind of charge you would have in your house, the same charging that I have in my house. With the BEAST, again, we've got a 200-kilowatt hour battery. You can do overnight charging on level 2, but you're really pushing it a total limit. And then the Mega BEAST was really designed for those where DC fast charging available and to have an interest in using vehicle for all of its efforts to bringing students to and from school and the V2G. So you've got really enough left over to be meaningful to the grid and have some normal access to the battery storage on vehicle. Now the marketplace has changed more slowly than we hoped, but has changed in part, there are a lot more companies able to install chargers. The utilities are trying to get ahead of the curve a lot better these days, and we do see improvements also including the availability of charging EVSE, which is electric vehicle support equipment and chargers and related equipment. But the main thing we're seeing right now is we mentioned our pipeline. Some of that pipeline are orders that the customers are waiting to figure out how they're going to do charge it. I think they've got the money and the ability to buy, but they're waiting until they have their charging figured out. So I think you're going to see kind of a fast uptake on charging capabilities, installation charging for the chargers. We are having more companies involved in that space, and I think they're becoming more efficient and better at installing the chargers.\nCraig Irwin: Thank you for that. So my second question is about working capital. You guys have done a really good job managing working capital and generated a decent amount of cash there over the last few quarters. Can you maybe describe for us how well-matched the inventory of work in process or finished goods is to anticipate near-term deliveries. Would you expect working capital to be a positive contribution to cash in this current quarter?\nFraser Atkinson: I'll turn the details over to Michael. But at a high level, our work in process is fairly well aligned with the production flow that matches the fulfillment to customer orders as opposed to production to inventory whereas we have been over the last few quarters and will continue over the next couple of quarters to realign our finished goods to match that. So at a high level, finished goods needs some work to fully align and the rest in terms of work in process and to some extent, our parts supply that we sell separately as well to customers is better aligned with where we are right now with our strategy on manufacturing.\nMichael Sieffert: Yes. Just to add a couple of very quick points. I think it really has been a focus of the company over the past nine to 12 months to focus on inventory and bringing that down to a level that is better match the sales. But I think the other thing to point out, Craig, is that with the facility that we announced this morning of $5 million, that's earmarked for funding production. And so that is really focused on funding that inventory growth. And we anticipate given our current order book that a lot of that will be used towards all-electric school bus order book fulfillment.\nCraig Irwin: Understood. So my last question, if I may. Gross margins in the quarter, the historic average is quite a bit higher. So is it fair for us to maybe consider the early production of some of these BEAST, Nano BEAST units to be maybe a lower margin because of greater man-hours to complete and other factors in there and that we could see those trend up over the next couple of quarters as far as the overall gross margin levels? Is that fair?\nBrendan Riley: That is very fair, Craig...\nFraser Atkinson: Yes, go ahead, Brendan.\nBrendan Riley: That's very fair. Training, getting employees up to speed cost money. It's an investment. And you're going to see the margins continually improve. Also, we're starting to see some stabilization of our cost as it goes from materials, raw materials and so on. So we should see a good shrinkage in our costs and an increase in our GP.\nFraser Atkinson: In terms of the short term, Craig, the -- Michael and his section commented on the onetime charges that we had made, which in part relates to your previous question that as we're realigning our business and working capital and changing the mix in terms of finished goods and work in processes we have incurred some onetime impairment costs on our inventory as we make that transition. So that we expect is a short-term proposition. And as we get into a continuous production flow where the inventory is aligned with all of that, then that's going to help the margins as well.\nCraig Irwin: Excellent. Well, congrats on the progress here. We look forward to watching the continued steps forward.\nFraser Atkinson: Thanks Craig.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next question is from John Gay from Quiet Investor. Please go ahead.\nJohn Gay: Good morning, guys. And congratulations on the continued progress. I sensify the numbers vehicles sold that Workhorse is not in the mix by much, if any. Is that true and if so, how do we look upon that so called contract?\nFraser Atkinson: Sorry, I cut out there. The -- well, we don't -- we haven't pointed out specific metrics for our customers over the last number of quarters. And we did comment in our earlier remarks that while we have not had some cab and chassis deliveries, we are currently working on schedule in terms of future deliveries for our cab and chassis. So there's been a short-term pause, and we expect to have that resume in the not-too-distant future.\nJohn Gay: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the next question is a follow-up from Greg Lewis from BTIG. Please go ahead.\nGreg Lewis: Hi, thanks, and good morning. Sorry to hop back in, but I did want to understand -- I thought it'd probably be good to understand. So congrats on the $5 million revolver. Are there different hurdle rates, i.e., that could be achieved where you could come back and expand that maybe to $8 million, $10 million just as we kind of get through as we get production going, I would think you'll probably outgrow that $5 million number. Mike, any thoughts around that?\nFraser Atkinson: Well, first go ahead, go ahead, Michael.\nMichael Sieffert: I was going to say, first of all, we are very appreciative of the support from EDC. We think this is a very efficient and well-priced facility for the company. But to answer your question, yes, there certainly is the opportunity to revisit this in terms of size over time as our business grows and we can certainly look to upsize this. But for the time being, we feel this is a good size for the company and we'll definitely be put to use given the orders we have in place. Fraser, if you have anything to add.\nFraser Atkinson: No, that's a good summary.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. And now I understood it just seems like pretty good attractive financing. So yes, hitting that -- building out on that and then expanding that would obviously be super positive for the company. All right, guys. Thank you very much.\nFraser Atkinson: Thanks Greg.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Fraser Atkinson for any closing remarks.\nFraser Atkinson: In closing, we delivered the first 4 Type A Nano BEAST school buses manufactured in West Virginia to four school districts in the state and started production of our larger Type D BEAST school buses. We delivered 10 EV Star Cab and Chassis to the Canadian unit of a global retailer who will upfit the vehicles for fulfillment of orders to their customers in Toronto. We delivered the first EV Star Cargo refrigerated van to a California University, and we launched the Mega BEAST with twice the battery capacity of the BEAST, providing a range of up to 300 miles on a single charge. We made significant progress while increasing our cash position by $3.3 million from the start of the fiscal year. Subsequent to the quarter, we secured $5 million of production financing from EDC who have also guaranteed $5 million of standby letters of credit, which vastly improves our manufacturing capabilities. Thanks for your support. This concludes the third quarter earnings call for GreenPower.\nOperator: And thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect. Take care."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the GreenPower Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Michael Sieffert, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead. \nMichael Sieffert : Thank you. This is Michael Sieffert, Chief Financial Officer of GreenPower Motor Company. I would like to welcome everyone to our call to discuss GreenPower's results for the 3- and 6-month periods ended September 30, 2023, and recent developments.  I'm here today with our Chief Executive Officer, Fraser Atkinson; our President, Brendan Riley; Vice President, Claus Tritt; and Vice President, Michael Perez.  During today's call, we may make comments or statements about our future expectations plans and prospects, which may constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in our quarterly interim results and MD&A filed on SEDAR and on EDGAR.  In addition, these forward-looking statements relate to the date on which they are made. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments may cause the company's views to change. GreenPower disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Also, during the course of today's call, we may refer to certain non-IFRS financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures can be found in our MD&A filed on SEDAR and on EDGAR. And is also located on our website at www.greenpowermotor.com.  I will now pass the call over to GreenPower's CEO, Fraser Atkinson. \nFraser Atkinson : Thank you, Michael. Over the years, we've talked about money and mandates driving fleet operators electrification strategies for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. While money in the form of boaters and incentives can have a near-term impact on sales, is our view that the longer-term growth opportunities for the medium and heavy-duty EV sector will be realized by those companies that are best positioned to take advantage of key mandates.  On today's call, the GreenPower team will talk about recent mandates that will drive demand for GreenPower's commercial vehicle and school bus groups. Earlier this year, our focus has been on making the transition from utilizing our inventory to satisfy customer needs to the production of school buses in West Virginia. And we've expanded the production capabilities with Lion Truck body, our in-house body builder to produce completed vehicles utilizing our own EV star cabin chassis.  We achieved a number of milestones in the most recent period and completed key deliverables in order for us to achieve these longer-term strategic objectives. GreenPower reported revenues of $26 million for the first half of the 2024 fiscal year, an increase of 125% over the revenue of $11.6 million for the first half of the previous fiscal year. For the quarter, we generated revenue of $8.4 million with deliveries of 31 vehicles, including a record 16 school buses, being a record for the company.  Finally, with our financial position, we increased our cash by $1.4 million from the beginning of the current fiscal year, and we've maintained a strong working capital balance.  I'll now hand it over to Michael for a discussion on the financial highlights for the quarter. \nMichael Sieffert : Thank you, Fraser. For the 3 months ended September 30, 2023, GreenPower generated revenue of $8.4 million, primarily from the sale of 16 BEAST to Nano BEAST and 15 EV Stars, which was an increase of 9.1% from $7.7 million of revenue generated in the same quarter in the prior year from the sale of 4 BEAST and 50 EV Stars. Both quarters also included revenue from leases, part sales and truck bodies.  Gross profit was $1.2 million, and gross profit margin was 14.6% compared to $1.6 million and 21% in the prior year's quarter. The margin decline was primarily due to higher parts inventory costs, lower margins at Lion Truck Body and delivery of new products.  Sales, general and administrative costs were $5.2 million compared to $4.7 million in the prior year an increase of 10.5% primarily due to expansion of the company's operations in workforce in West Virginia and California as well as an increase in allowance for credit losses which was partially offset by lower share-based payments expense and lower product development costs.  GreenPower generated a loss for the quarter of $4.3 million compared to a loss of $3.6 million in the same quarter of the prior year. For the 6 months ended September 30, 2023, GreenPower generated revenue of $26 million, primarily from the sale of 162 vehicles in the current period which was an increase of 124.5% from revenue of 11.6% in the first 6 months of the prior year, which was due to the sale of 75 vehicles and other sources.  Gross profit was $4 million and gross profit margin was 15.4% in the 6 months ended September 30, 2023 compared to $2.7 million and 23.1% in the same period of the prior year. The margin decline was primarily due to the same factors as during the recent quarter.  Sales, general and administrative costs were $10.5 million in the 6 months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $9.8 million in the prior year period, an increase of 7.1%, primarily due to expansion of the company's operations and workforce and increase in allowance for credit losses. And these factors were partially offset by lower share-based payments expense as well as lower sales and marketing costs.  GreenPower generated a loss for the 6-month period of $7 million compared to a loss of $8 million in the same period of the prior year. As at September 30, 2023, GreenPower had cash of $2 million, working capital of $24.2 million and $1.4 million available on its operating line of credit. Improvements in the company's cash and available liquidity since March 31, 2023, were largely due to higher sales and due to a focus on collections, which led to lower levels of inventory and accounts receivable. GreenPower was also able to lower its interest-bearing debt during the period as we remain focused on efficiently managing our working capital.  I'll now turn it to Brendan Riley to discuss operations. \nBrendan Riley : Thank you, Michael. In addition to sales and production, during this quarter, we have focused on the future, the future of meeting the customer demands facing our industry due to money and mandates. And in doing so, we have made preparations to ensure our customers, both school districts and commercial operators that they have product options available to meet or exceed their demands and transportation of people and goods.  The GreenPower manufacturing facility in West Virginia is in production of the Nano BEAST. It's our small school bus. And provisions have made -- have been made to start the manufacturing of the BEAST in the next quarter. The first all-electric purpose-built school buses will emerge from the West Virginia factory on December 13 with 4 Nano BEAST being delivered to schools in West Virginia under the purchase made by the state.  This is a monumental occasion that sets the foundation for the future of production for GreenPower school buses to be delivered to customers in the East Coast and the Midwest. The school bus team has also spent the quarter focusing on differing state requirements and regulations, found in the state school bus procurement contracts to ensure that GreenPower school buses are readily available and are purchasable to be bought by them.  The New York, California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, and others now have a level of requirements and incentives available to cause a transition from smelly and polluting diesel to clean and quiet electric buses. With production in California, West Virginia and with contract manufacturing, GreenPower is uniquely positioned to supply battery electric school buses in large quantities and in a timely manner.  Another goal of last quarter was to move school bus inventory, and we've done just that. All of the inventory of our B school buses have either been shipped to customers or have been allocated to orders. On the commercial side of our business, we've delivered our first airport ground support vehicle, the EV Star Hydrant Truck. This is a purpose-built, all-electric large aircraft refueling vehicle. The vehicle is operating at Vancouver Airport in Canada and is an example of how we provide our all-electric purpose-built technology in a variety of settings, from specialty vehicles like our hydrant truck, to our box truck and refrigerated trucks, which are very standard in the market. GreenPower is truly a one-stop shop for compelling zero-emission vehicles.  The last topic I wanted to touch on is mandates. One example of a strenuous mandate looming is the California Advanced Clean Truck Regulation. This regulation will require 15% of certain fleets to be all electric by the next year, that's 2024 in order to operate in California, and that percentage goes up over time. This is an example of just 1 mandate of many that exists from coast to coast here in the U.S.A. GreenPower's commitment to provide a quality product in a timely manner to our customers is what we strive for. And that's what last quarter's preparations have been all about.  Now I'd like to turn it over to our Vice President, Claus Tritt, who will discuss the activities in the Commercial Vehicle Group. Take it away, Claus. \nClaus Tritt : Thank you, Brendan. Good morning, everyone. Brendan has set the stage for what I would like to spend a few minutes to amplify. Today, GreenPower is positioned to meet the commercial needs of customers, who want to make the transition to all electric vehicles in their fleets. Whether that desire is based on mandates, economic opportunity or for environmental reasons, we have the capacity in stock to deliver a completed vehicle within 60 days, not the normal 6 to 9 months customers face when dealing with multiple vendors.  And with Lion Truck Body, GreenPower can upfit that product to meet the customers' needs in a one-stop shop experience. Box trucks, stake beds, refrigerated trucks, specialty vehicles, you name it, we are prepared to move immediately for the customer nationwide.  We have spent this last quarter preparing for this. We are prepared for the demand of box trucks and cargo vans because of the California advanced clean truck requirements. And GreenPower is positioned to help customers with grants and importantly, supply vehicles that meet the $40,000 tax credit under the inflation reduction as the tax year comes to close.  In addition to look -- in addition to looking in the future, we also completed delivery of 10 EV star passenger vans in the Boston market during the quarter. These vehicles are being used there in an innovative approach, the worker transportation providing last mile solutions to get people safely to and from work.  Our commercial dealer network continues to expand with appointments during the quarter in the triangle in North Carolina, North Texas and West Virginia. And recent trade show activity has further exposed the green power EV Star commercial line of products to new geographical locations and customers as well as dealers in other areas of the country.  I would now like to turn it over to Michael Perez to further discuss school bus activities. \nMichael Perez : Thank you, Claus. Good morning, everyone. Over this past quarter, we continue our work on completing certifications and meeting requirements for key states where we see the best opportunities to meet the demand of all electric zero-emission school buses. I was recently at the NAPT Conference and Trade Show in Ohio, where we launched our Mega BEAST Type D all electric purpose-built electric school bus, which has an industry-leading range of up to 300 miles from 387-kilowatt hour battery pack, the largest currently available in school bus transportation.  We were also engaged with several high-quality prospects had to show in new geographic territories, including Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia. This morning, we announced our first order for 25 Mega BEAST to Montebello USD in California through our dealer, Model 1, formerly creative bus sales utilizing vouchers from the HVIP School Bus Set-Aside Program and the EPA Clean School Bus Program. This first-of-a-kind order will begin production immediately with deliveries targeted in late 2024.  We also announced an order for 10 B school buses for Garden Grove that we're already working on with deliveries scheduled over the next couple of quarters. In the past month, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation requiring all new school buses in California be electric by 2035. With that action, California joined Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, and New York in mandating the switch to all electric zero-emission school buses and fleets over the next 4 to 17 years.  The new law makes California the leader in state funding for the transition to all electric school buses with the switch projected to cost roughly $5 billion. We are working with Model 1 on dozens of orders, utilizing funding from the HVIP School Bus Set-Aside program, the $1.2 billion to be added in 2024, air quality management district funding the VW Fund and, of course, the EPA Clean School Bus Program. We are also very excited to announce very soon new orders that will be the first orders in new states setting up continued momentum as we enter the new year.  And now I'll turn it back over to Fraser Atkinson. \nFraser Atkinson : Operator, at this time, if you could open the line for our Q&A session. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Craig Irwin with ROTH MKM. \nCraig Irwin : It's really nice to hear the West Virginia facility is starting to produce. You have orders already, customers are waiting for the product. Can you maybe just help us shape potential orders in this December quarter for your Type A and Type C school buses from this facility. Is there any difference in pricing versus your legacy product? And margins, I should say. And can you talk about the number of customers that are visiting this facility as you bring up production and the different school districts that are coming in for Ride and Drive before they make their final commitments? \nBrendan Riley : Yes. Craig, this is Brendan. Your first question needs to be answered, that the buses built in West Virginia are the same buses we build in California, and anywhere else. They're -- it's not a new bus. There are some specification differences, but those are really minor changes that we make could be a different option that's added to it. It could be a different color in one place or another, stickers, things of that nature. But for the most part, the vehicles, at least from a certification perspective, they're essentially the same vehicle. We -- the facility is fairly new. We've had dealers come through and do training.  Customer visits will be -- are scheduled for this quarter. And again, I don't know if I can name any of them. I would so, probably won't. But we do have customers coming out for ride and drives and to tour the facility including customers from West Virginia that are actually going to be receiving the buses under the West Virginia contract.  For the first year, we'll be producing again, first, the 41 buses from the West Virginia contract and any follow-on buses for the West Virginia contract as we've committed to the state to get those out first. As far as the pricing is concerned to the end user, the pricing is the same right now. And for margins, it is a new facility. We expect those to improve. And I don't think we're really announcing that number yet. But frankly, the market on the East Coast is just opening up for us. We've just been added to the New York State bid. And we are working on other places on the East Coast to start selling more vehicles into. \nCraig Irwin : Excellent. So EPA is slated to start releasing additional districts as far as the vouchers they're awarded in this year's funding program. Can you maybe help us understand the work you've been doing with different school districts and different dealers to support their applications to this program? And what you feel about your overall competitiveness as far as voucher awards for customers that are likely to work with GreenPower? \nFraser Atkinson : Michael Perez, did you want to lead off on that? \nMichael Perez : Yes, of course. We work with several of our existing dealer network on producing webinars, producing materials and producing any items that go to school districts within their territory to set up all of these applications that are being submitted for the EPA Clean School Bus Program. That can include demos, in-person demos, ride and drives and anything else tailored to that region and that market. \nFraser Atkinson : And I'd add to that, that Michael was that the NAPT Conference that he referenced in our opening remarks, and this past summer at SDN, which is kind of like the big annual event for the school bus industry. And within each of those, there the engagement was numbered in the hundreds in terms of contact discussions. We had a panel that -- how many people were in attendance for that, Michael? At the SDN panel? Yes. So all of that is part of the -- people are waiting until a future date. They take advantage of the ride and drive opportunities at events like that where we have our vehicles, and we're providing ride and drives at those conferences and trade shows. So that's a big part of it as well. \nBrendan Riley : One last thing. Would you provide assistance, if any, customers, dealers or fleet partners are looking to submit for a grant, we provide assistance with any of the paperwork making sure that if they need any help on how to fill it out, how to -- what all of our data is to populate those applications, we provide that whenever customers, dealers, or fleet partners need it. \nCraig Irwin : Okay. Last question, if I may, before I hop back in the queue. So your cabin chassis product, you have 1 very large customer there. And from our prior conversations, I understand that the contract size in this market is likely to be much larger, potentially much more lumpy over the next couple of years. Can you maybe update us on market developments there? You do have a number of vehicles actually rolling out in the world now and different customers taking product. How is this impacting the overall tempo of conversations and potential customer activity? \nFraser Atkinson : Well, we have a large customer you're probably referring to had paused the intake of our cabin chassis and I think that was in the August time frame. Right now, where we said we have over 50 CCs that we have available for delivery at the appropriate time. I think more importantly, part of what Claus referred to in our opening remarks is, number one, he's got a number of orders and even a greater number of quotes just on the CCs. So we've got a rapidly developing market for our EV Star cabin chassis. And we're also utilizing that for our Nano BEAST, for our production with Lion Truck Body. So it really has a broad application and 1 that has really grown over the last 2 or 3 quarters. \nCraig Irwin : Excellent. Well, congratulations on the progress, and I'll go ahead and hop back in the queue. \nFraser Atkinson : Thank you, Craig. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Tate Sullivan with Maxim. \nUnidentified Analyst : This is actually Justin Smith in for Tate Sullivan today. Kind of just following up on the last question. I was just wondering if you guys were able to provide any details you're still looking to deliver all 1,500 of those units to your larger customer in regards to the cabin chassis units? \nFraser Atkinson : Well, we don't give forecast. We don't provide any guidance in that regard. And I think the answer that we had on the previous question would be the same in that. We have vehicles or CCs ready right now. We have CCs that are in the queue that are being either completed or substantially completed that could add to that in the follow-on quarter in January and February, and that will be something that we'll be working through over the next week or 2 in terms of this quarter and next quarter. \nUnidentified Analyst : All right. Great. And then kind of following up on that as well. Are you able to provide any information on those units to start coming out if you think your gross margin for those will be better or worse than the gross margins for your electric school buses that are going out right now? \nFraser Atkinson : Well, the higher volume contracts we've had margin compression or the margin is lower due to a price that wouldn't be the same if we had a one-off or 2 off. And the reason we do those is that as we are able to get deliveries that are consistent and continually ramp up volumes related to each of the products, whether it's a Nano BEAST or a BEAST or cabin chassis is as we're able to get repeatable deliveries. That's where we're going to enjoy a higher gross profit. \nOperator: The next question comes from Greg Lewis with BTIG. \nGregory Lewis : I'm not sure if this question is more for Mike or Fraser, but clearly, you've been walking through some of the challenges on the decremental margins, and we're ramping West Virginia. Is there any kind of thoughts around what type of volume we need to be coming out of West Virginia in terms of bus sales, we think that starts to be margin accretive? \nMichael Sieffert : So maybe I... \nFraser Atkinson : Yes, go ahead Michael. \nMichael Sieffert : Yes. Just we haven't -- just to be clear, we haven't really talked through margins of school buses coming from West Virginia. I would say that the margin compression that we saw this quarter, specifically, it was, I'd say, more related to specific parts inflation as well as deliveries of new vehicles like new products -- so less to do with our school bus sales in the quarter. Our school bus sales this quarter actually generated a margin that was higher than the overall margin for the quarter, just to give you an indication.  As that facility ramps up, certainly, we would expect there to be better economies of scale. But at this point, we haven't broken that out specifically, Greg. So there's probably not a lot of additional detail I can cover. Fraser, I'm not sure if there's more you'd like to add there. \nFraser Atkinson : Well, I think the -- we're just getting organized to start the BEAST production with the first vehicles for that side of the School Bus Group coming off the line in early spring of 2024, I believe, is our target. And with -- until we get through that first and second cycle and look at how we're going to both ramp and manage our costs, we'll have a much, much better idea of where we are. The positive in that group is that, is that both at the state level like on the New York State contract that we're on that Brendan talked about, and Michael Perez talked about is -- and the California programs and the school bus program, they all have price points that are very supportive in terms of what our cost structure.  In other words, before those, the vehicles were probably be selling for a little less than what these mandates and incentives are providing. \nGregory Lewis : That's super helpful. And then just following up on that. Clearly, the initial buses rolling out of West Virginia are all going to West Virginia. As we think about that, at what point is that -- is that a back end of '24, maybe calendar year '25, that when we start selling to non-West Virginia school bus -- municipalities or customers? \nFraser Atkinson : Well, we have had -- we have had customers outside of West Virginia that are looking for the production out of West Virginia to fulfill their requirements. So we're already at a stage from a sales point of view in terms of identifying and quantifying what we're going to need to do for the East Coast. So that's why we -- initially, we're looking at South Charleston facility as being predominantly fulfilling requirements we could see in the short term with West Virginia, but that's already expanding to other markets on the East Coast. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Fraser Atkinson for any closing remarks. \nEnd of Q&A:\nFraser Atkinson : At the beginning of today's call, we talked about the importance of being positioned in the medium and heavy-duty EV space to be able to fully benefit from key mandates. GreenPower strategy is to be able to take full advantages of 2 such mandates. For the mandates in 5 states to electrify school buses, including the 2 big markets of New York and California, number one, we have the full range of all electric school buses, including the recent launch of the Mega BEAST for a second Type D along with multiple configurations for our Type A Nano BEAST, to fulfill almost all the requirements of the school districts have.  Number two, we have strong dealers in each of California and New York. Number three, we've spent the last 2 years locating a facility, tooling and commencing the school bus production in West Virginia for customers up and down the East Coast. For the California advanced clean truck regulation, that will require 15% of certain fleets to be all electric by next year.  Number one, we can build a completed box truck in 30 to 60 days compared to other outsourced body builders that take at least 6 to 9 months. And the customer has -- doesn't have to deal with multiple companies. Number two, GreenPower's innovation has brought a number of products to market, such as our refrigerated box truck. Number three, we have our own cabin chassis with the EV Star CC on hand, ready to fill customer requirements.  And as close as always says within this space, we are truly a one-stop shop. In conclusion, we positioned ourselves for not 1 but 2 generational mandates that will drive growth for our school bus and our commercial vehicle groups. This concludes our call. We thank you for your support. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to GreenPower First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note that this event is being recorded. I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Michael Sieffert, Chief Financial Officer. Go ahead.\nMichael Sieffert: Thank you. This is Michael Sieffert, the Chief Financial Officer of GreenPower Motor Company. I would like to welcome everyone to our call to discuss GreenPower's results for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. I'm here today with our Chief Executive Officer, Fraser Atkinson; our President, Brendan Riley; Vice President, Claus Tritt; and Vice President, Michael Perez. During today's call, we may make comments or statements about our future expectations, plans and prospects which may constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and applicable Canadian securities laws. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in our quarterly interim results and MD&A filed on SEDAR and on EDGAR. In addition, these forward-looking statements relate to the date on which they are made. We anticipate subsequent events and developments may cause the company's views to change. GreenPower disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Also, during the course of today's call, we may make -- we may refer to certain non-IFRS financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-IFRS measures can be found in our MD&A filed on SEDAR and on EDGAR and is also located on our website at www.greenpowermotor.com. I will now pass the call over to GreenPower's CEO, Fraser Atkinson.\nFraser Atkinson: Thanks, Michael. I want to start off with the events of a week ago when Proterra filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The origin of Proterra was manufacturing all-electric heavy-duty 35 and 40-foot low floor transit buses. Over the years, they expanded their business to become a Tier 1 OEM supplier for drivetrains and batteries to other EV OEMs. This included supplying Thomas Built school buses for their all-electric Type C Jouley, which competes with our Type D BEAST school bus. They also supply batteries for all electric type A school buses and for Class IV vehicles, which compete with our Type A school bus, the Nano BEAST, and various EV Star models, respectively. You might think that now would be a great opportunity for GreenPower with our all-electric low-floor transit style buses to aggressively pursue this transit sector. But we believe it is difficult to make money in the transit space where the sales cycle is typically over three years. GreenPower's strategy for the past number of years has been focused on accessible markets with shorter sales cycles where we can achieve economies of scale and can make money on the products we sell. On today's call, we have the leaders of our commercial vehicle and school bus groups to provide you with insight on our strategy to accomplish that. Turning to GreenPower. This was a record-setting quarter as we recorded revenues in the first quarter of $17.6 million more than four times the revenue of $3.9 million from the previous year's first quarter and delivered 131 GreenPower vehicles in the quarter, also a record. We also achieved significant operational improvements, which Michael will discuss next. I want to comment briefly on our liquidity as we significantly improved our financial position in the quarter. At the start of the quarter, we were on our line of credit, which is up to $8 million. We're on that line of credit for $6.6 million and we were able to reduce that to $162,000 at the end of the quarter, whereas our cash position increased from $600,000 at the start of the quarter to $1.5 million of cash at the end of the quarter, providing us with $9.3 million of available liquidity at the end of the quarter to grow our business. I'll now hand it back to Michael for a discussion on the financial highlights for the quarter.\nMichael Sieffert: Thank you, Fraser. The financial highlights for the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year include, we recorded revenues of $17.6 million in the first quarter, an increase of $13.7 million over the revenue of $3.9 million in the first quarter of the previous year. And our revenue was generated from the sale of vehicles, parts, finance and operating leases as well as revenue generated at Lion Truck Body. Our cost of revenues in the quarter was $14.8 million, generating a gross profit of $2.8 million or 15.9% of revenues compared to a gross profit of $1 million or 27% of revenues in the same quarter in the previous fiscal year. The company's gross profit margin reduction was primarily attributable to higher shipping costs associated with the majority of sales to customers during the quarter that were outside of the state of California as well as sales under high-volume contract. We anticipate that the company's gross profit margins will vary over time due to changes in the sales mix, including changes in both customers and in products. Inventory was $34.4 million at the end of the quarter, which was a reduction of $7.2 million from the beginning of the quarter. Our finished goods inventory consisted of EV Star Transit Pluses, EV Star Cab and Chassis, EV Stars, EV Star Cargo, as well as BEAST and Nano BEAST school buses. We remain focused on sales of finished goods inventory and efficient management of inventory -- of our inventory levels. Our deferred revenue at the end of the quarter increased to $11.4 million, which includes the current portion of $10.3 million. We finished the quarter with working capital of $26.1 million and this includes over $8 million of accounts receivable and cash of nearly $1.5 million. Moving to our SG&A. Our expenses were $5.3 million in the first quarter, which represented 30% of our revenue. This compares to $5.1 million in the same quarter of the prior year, which was 133% of that quarter's revenue. The reduction of this metric demonstrates GreenPower's effective management of expenses as well as the operational leverage in our business model, and this contributed to improvements in our bottom-line results compared to the same quarter in the prior year. I'll now turn the call over to GreenPower's President, Brendan Riley.\nBrendan Riley: Thank you, Michael. Here at GreenPower, we actually know who and what we are. And to that end, we remain focused on our core mission of manufacturing desirable and compelling all-electric purpose-built vehicles for the commercial vehicle and school bus markets. As we have shown again in this quarter, we are concentrating on the principles that put the company on a path to sustainable growth and profitability, further developing and manufacturing our all-electric school bus and purpose-built commercial products, reducing lead times and delivering the product to the customer, all on time and within budget. This work is not easy, but GreenPower plans to stay on the path that we have shared with you all in the past and not be sidetracked by investments, business activities that aren't necessarily impacting or directly impacting growth and sustainable profitability. To better understand our future, it's important to understand what our two business units are up to with some granularity. That's the reason for today's call. We've asked our executive leaders for each of these two groups to join us to provide an update on their highlighted activities. The first person I'd like to introduce is Claus Tritt, our Vice President for Commercial Vehicle sales. Claus joined GreenPower in the past December with a task of strategically and tactically advancing our commercial vehicle business unit. He came to GreenPower with almost 37 years of automotive brand building and sales experience from both the OEM and retail perspective. Most of his career was spent with the worldwide side of Daimler Mercedes Benz commercial vehicle organization. Claus to you.\nClaus Tritt: Thank you, Brendan. Good morning, everyone. Today, I would like to focus on what sets GreenPower apart from other EV OEMs in the commercial space. The key is that GreenPower prides itself on being customer-centric with a one-stop shopping philosophy. This defines the commercial group sales strategy, which is built on four fundamental pillars. Pillar number one is our purpose-built product offerings, which fulfill the needs in the commercial and passenger transportation markets relative to pure vehicle requirements such as payload, cargo and passenger capacity, range, low maintenance costs as well as usability in respective target segments. We are also leveraging the expertise and know-how of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lion Truck Body to produce and further develop lightweight truck bodies for multiple applications. This partnership was shown during the quarter with the introduction of our EV Star utility truck at ACT Expo. Working with Lion Truck Body allows GreenPower to offer a one-stop shopping approach and accelerates the ease of doing business with GreenPower for our customers. Pillar number two is GreenPower's commercial dealer network. During the quarter, we continued to develop what I call our Phase 1 build out with the appointment of HK Truck Center with two sales and service locations in the state of New Jersey. In this phase, we are enlarging our dealer network in key markets for all electric commercial vehicles. We expect to add 15 to 24 dealer points by the end of this fiscal and 30 to 35 next fiscal year to not only support sales but also enhance the service experience for our customers. Pillar number three is GreenPower's partnerships with fleet accounts and fleet management companies. These partnerships provide an opportunity to develop new geographical markets and product offerings as well as potentially new segments, which we are not represented in at this particular point in time. And pillar number four is processes and services. GreenPower is fine-tuning, further developing, and in some cases, creating new processes and services to better support the customer centricity of the company. In closing, I am happy to report that presently, the commercial vehicle group has 46 active orders in different stages of the production process and 123 signed purchase orders for various models of the EV Star lineup. Brendan, back to you.\nBrendan Riley: Thank you, Claus. Next up is Michael Perez, GreenPower's Vice President for school bus group. Michael has been an important member of the GreenPower team for five-plus years. Previously, he spent more than a decade in the automotive industry with a focus on contract management. Michael's commitment to our company and professional growth and his leadership have been critical in developing the nationwide strategy for our school bus team. Michael take it away.\nMichael Perez: Thank you, Brendan. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to update you all first with an outlook on our school bus dealer network and plans to enter new markets by bringing on additional dealerships. With the recent addition of Kingmor Supply representing the BEAST and Nano BEAST in the Commonwealth of Virginia, GreenPower currently has seven dealerships covering nine states in the District of Columbia. We will continue to broaden the dealership network by focusing on experienced well-positioned school bus dealers that can sprovide sales and service support to strengthen the GreenPower brand coast-to-coast. Key markets targeted for our next expansion efforts include Texas, Colorado, the Upper Midwest and the Southeast. As this expansion continues, we will be adding support for our dealers through our school bus team. To that end, most recently, we announced that Zach Walsh has been named the Director of Eastern US school bus sales. Our commitment to school bus innovation and safety while focusing on differing state specification compliance, continues to be a focal point of this school bus team. During the quarter, we successfully delivered the first all-electric Type A school bus in Oregon when Portland Public Schools, the largest school district in the Pacific Northwest, took possession of two Nano BEASTs. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have also delivered the Nano BEAST in the California market. These deliveries and those of the BEAST to various markets showcases GreenPower's ability to meet the evolving demands of the industry and various markets. And furthermore, GreenPower school buses have furthered integration with several school bus industry component favorites, like Zonar Systems, and First Light Safety during this quarter. The quarter also marked the completion of GreenPower's most ambitious undertakings. GreenPower partnered with the State of West Virginia to implement a real-world pilot of the BEAST and Nano BEAST school buses in West Virginia. This pilot project was conducted over nine months in 18 county school districts with more than 100 professional school bus drivers basically transporting students to and from school and extracurricular activities. During the pilot, three BEAST and one Nano BEAST traveled more than 32,000 miles in different conditions. Warm and cold weather, sun, rain, snow and ice, mountains and flat terrain and lastly, rural and urban roads. The project culminated with a remarkable presentation at the STN Reno Expo in July, where GreenPower and West Virginia officials shared the data and the findings from the pilot project. In front of a packed audience, the panel shared information about range, driver, student, and community reaction, cost savings, charging infrastructure and more. Suffice it to say that the bus was put to the test and challenged during this pilot project, and it performed in every case as it was asked. The GreenPower all-electric purpose-built school buses did exactly what they were expected to do. And the pilot clearly showed that they could successfully be operated in varying conditions with forethought, planning and the appropriate charging infrastructure. Currently, the school bus group has 87 signed purchase orders for the BEAST and Nano BEAST school buses. This includes purchase order received during the quarter for 37 BEAST and four Nano BEAST school buses from the state of West Virginia through our dealer GreenPower of West Virginia and the recently announced 15 BEAST school buses to the fifth largest school district in the nation, Park County, Nevada, through GreenPower's regional dealer RWC Group. With that, I'll turn it back to Fraser for a final word before the Q&A.\nFraser Atkinson: Thank you, Michael. To summarize, GreenPower had yet another record-setting quarter with record revenue and record deliveries. We remain focused on our core mission of producing all-electric purpose-built commercial vehicles and school buses and each of those groups within the company have developed and are implementing strategic plans to achieve those goals. With that, operator, please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question will be from Craig Irwin, ROTH MKM. Please go ahead.\nCraig Irwin: Good morning, gentlemen. Congratulations here on another strong quarter. I wanted to start off with a couple of questions about the backlog. So we added up, it's 259 units. Can you clarify for us what portion of that is made up by anticipated deliveries to Workhorse?\nFraser Atkinson: Are you referring to the numbers that Claus referenced in the commercial vehicle group?\nCraig Irwin: The commercial vehicle group, the school bus group, the EV Stars altogether add up to 259 units. So?\nFraser Atkinson: That doesn't include any for Workhorse.\nCraig Irwin: So there's none for Workhorse. So the actual backlog for delivery over the next many months, makes your largest customer. That's correct?\nFraser Atkinson: That would that -- well, it doesn't omit it’s just that, that would be in addition too. You're correct.\nCraig Irwin: Perfect. Perfect. So then my next question around the backlog would be ASPs. About a third of the units come from the BEAST and the Nano BEAST, if we're just counting individual units. And those tend to have materially higher pricing than the rest of your product portfolio. Can you maybe give us an idea what we should expect as far as ASPs in that backlog? Is this something more representative of what you had a little bit more than a year ago?\nFraser Atkinson: I'll start it off. And if Michael and Brendan want to add anything, is that we certainly expect the mix to evolve where a number of quarters ago, we had one or two school buses sold in a particular quarter. And as Michael laid out, we're now getting to a place where we'll have consistent monthly deliveries of school buses that's going to be increasing that and changing the mix, the overall mix of sales, but that's also true for the commercial vehicle group as number of the live orders and the signed purchase orders are -- also will be adding into that mix as well.\nCraig Irwin: Understood. Understood. So the gross margins had some fairly substantial quarter-over-quarter improvement versus your March quarter obviously. You did discuss on your last call how the mix of deliveries, the way that there was heavy contribution from large customers was a little bit of a headwind on margins. It seems like that headwind might be coming off as mix is becoming more favorable. Would you anticipate some of the historic margins that we've seen in the past to be available for many of your contracts that you're signing today?\nFraser Atkinson: Well, our target -- if we're doing a one-off sale or just one or two units sale, the team looks at a margin or gross profit approaching 30%. But where we have volumes where we -- with larger commercial customers, where we have initial deployments, those margins get compressed and in some cases, compressed significantly. So that -- the mix is going to help improve that overall margin in terms of getting us into the low 20s or the mid-20s as a blend between the larger volume sales and the one-offs. So that -- longer term, that's still the target for the company. But in the shorter term, we do have compression from those larger volume sales as well as some of the initial sales that we're making in new markets and new sectors.\nCraig Irwin: Understood. That makes complete sense. So my last question then would be about inventory. You generated a little over $8 million in cash from inventory in the quarter. Can you maybe give us the finished goods inventory, what the approximate breakdown is as far as the different units in there? And what would you see as an ideal inventory level for the company, given that you're looking to facilitate rapid delivery to your customers over the next number of quarters?\nFraser Atkinson: Well, I don't think we have a -- or we've laid out our finished goods with a precise allocation in terms of, say, school buses being the BEAST or the Nano BEAST and then various models of the EV Star. In terms of the global number, you're quite right. The team did a great job of really monetizing and managing the inventory. And this goes back to probably our call of a year, 1.5 years ago where we talked about how we had to put up inventory out, we had to make investments in order to secure certain transactions and especially for example, in the school bus space that without the ability to show that we could deliver in a timely fashion. It was challenging for us as a new entrant in the marketplace to be able to secure that level of orders. Now we're in a place where those orders are coming in, we've got the signed purchase orders that we can deliver. Now we're able to deliver out of inventory rather than telling customers that they can get their vehicles a year, 1.5 years from now. So all of that has allowed us to monetize what we have there. In terms of an ongoing or ideal target, we're probably pretty close as a ratio in that. This quarter, our inventory as measured by our cost of goods sold, was I think, just over 2.2 times, 2.3 times. That's likely around an ideal target for us to get below 2 times where we have the sales cycle in each of the commercial vehicle and school bus groups would be -- that would be an absolute top end goal. But where we're operating right now is likely an ideal type of [runway] (ph).\nCraig Irwin: Perfect. Well, congratulations on the success here, and thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Next question will be from Greg Lewis, BTIG. Please go ahead.\nGreg Lewis: Yeah. Hi, thank you, and good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Fraser or Mike, I was hoping for a little more color, it's great to see the gross profitability and it's interesting is you guys definitely get very granular in the SG&A. So thank you for that. I guess as I think about moving more towards like an EBITDA profitability, I mean it looks like most of the loaded SG&A, it's probably trending higher as we continue to build out the business as sales channels kind of continue to ramp. So any kind of color how you're thinking about, I guess, meeting in the middle in terms of profitability, in terms of how we should be thinking about SG&A? And really, this is going to be about driving more sales. And just kind of how you're thinking about that in terms of run rates as we kind of walk towards that level?\nFraser Atkinson: Well, we have achieved the -- that's actually one metric that we do monitor and follow, which is our SG&A as a percent of revenue and a year ago, that was over 100% in terms of our SG&A as a percent of revenue. At the -- our year-end of March 31, it was 36% and in the most recent quarter, it was 30%. So we've seen a very steady decline in that metric as a measure of revenue and that trend continuing into the 20s is what shows our path to profitability.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. Great. And then just as I think about the acceptance of what you've been able to accomplish in West Virginia in a very short time, we're pretty bullish on the school bus market. It seems like everywhere we look, it seems like that continues to gain momentum. Do we think there could be opportunities to kind of replicate what we did in West Virginia maybe, I don't know, in another regional part of the US? And is that something that -- is that something that we could see here in the next couple of years or is that more maybe with the West Virginia facility in production, maybe now we're going to kind of pivot it back to looking to more ramp up the EV Star business?\nFraser Atkinson: Well, that's got a lot of good questions in it. The West Virginia opportunity, I'll call it, came about as a result of us looking up and down the Eastern seaboard for a suitable property and a partnership with all levels of government in that the state, the county, the city and South Charleston, West Virginia was exactly that kind of partnership that we were seeking, along with a great facility that was pretty close to production ready. And we've got a number of people in our team that have extensive experience in the manufacturing space. So they likewise felt that, wow, this is great for what we're doing. So that allowed us to expand from sort of a West Coast focus to also serving the East Coast. And we're now at a stage where we can look more holistically at a national approach in terms of what do we need to do to accomplish that next step. So it is something that we've been looking at and thinking about sort of post West Virginia. We still have a lot of work to do in West Virginia in order to fully utilize that facility and to build great products that can help service the type of orders that we're securing and the national approach that we're now undertaking. So that long term, if there is an opportunity to expand the business in a similar fashion as we're able to accomplish in West Virginia, that is on our radar screen to look at accomplishing. But in the near term, we've got our hands full in terms of ramping up production in order to fulfill the orders that we have and the orders that are coming in from the commercial vehicle and the school bus group.\nGreg Lewis: Okay. And I -- Fraser, I did want to talk a little bit more around the West Virginia and the ramp there and the ability to find qualified hires to kind of staff the facility and continue to ramp. I mean, is that -- is there anything that GreenPower can do on the ground in terms of like, I don't know, like education, partnering with a community college or technical university to kind of get the people in a position where they're able to start up a GreenPower ready-to-work. It seems like everywhere across the US, it's hard to find technical qualified people. Is that something that we're looking at? Or we just think it's timing and we'll get there without GreenPower maybe having to take more of an active approach?\nFraser Atkinson: I'm going to let Brendan cover this because he spent a considerable amount of time in West Virginia, not just South Charleston, but yes, we have spent -- well, I'll just turn it right over to Brendan and let him outline what we're doing in the state.\nBrendan Riley: Great. Good morning, Greg, and thanks, Fraser. Currently, Greg, we have a partnership with the BridgeValley College there in West Virginia. They're literally a stone's throw up the -- really up the hill from GreenPower South Charleston facility. And with that partnership, we actually have a training program that allows for new employees and existing employees to not just provide continuing education in areas of EV manufacturing and technology, but also initial -- we find applicants that might have interest in certain aspects of what we're doing at GreenPower, they can enroll in the college and really start working on a program that we've developed with them. The other thing that we've got is, there is a very, very critical program by the state of West Virginia that actually helps offset these employees' salary. So they can start working at GreenPower. The state of West Virginia will pay half of their salary, while they're enrolled in this program, learning the skills to be highly developed GreenPower employees. But yes, we've actually done a lot of work hand in hand with the school, we've gone to some of our suppliers around the world. We have Constellium as a supplier where they supply us the material for the bodies that we built. We've actually traveled to various spots that actually integrate, build up the kit, do all this stuff. And this is critically important in our long-term strategy to make sure we've got not only employees that are capable and willing to work at GreenPower, but really employees that are trained from day one as real experts in building our products. And also there's technology if they want to work in other areas of the company besides manufacturing, there's courses to bring people up to speed on the state-of-the-art technology that we deploy.\nGreg Lewis: Okay, great. That’s super helpful, everybody. Thanks for the time.\nFraser Atkinson: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Next question will be from Tate Sullivan, Maxim Group. Please go ahead.\nTate Sullivan: Hi, thank you all. Brendan, I -- just to follow up something from the press release -- mentioned in the press release, Nano BEAST is now at full production rate and then BEAST entering full production in 3Q or what was that language referring to? And what are those monthly production rates, if you can share?\nBrendan Riley: Well, when we say full production rate, we mean build -- right now, we can build a full vehicle and go. The rates are right now, since we're early days, they're going to be a little slower. But at the South Charleston facility, we can build with the existing facility, the way it's built out about a bus a day. So that would be either a Nano BEAST or a BEAST. And we've just completed validating the line, setting up the line for the Nano BEAST which is done and those vehicles are in final prep stages before we get them ready for delivery. And then the BEAST should be at that point here by, let's say, October, November, we'll have vehicles coming off the line, just like the Nano BEAST. So currently, it's a vehicle a day, is what we target as full production for that capacity.\nTate Sullivan: And active orders or signed purchase orders that you mentioned for the BEAST and going back -- are some of those already in finished goods inventory? Or is that separate?\nBrendan Riley: Separate. Yes. Yes. Actually half of those, I believe, are in finished goods.\nTate Sullivan: And then Fraser, thanks for starting off the call with comments on Proterra. I mean -- and probably brings the point of how you manage your supply chain, too. I mean do you have any exposure historically to Proterra in terms of battery packs or cells, I don't think you do, but if you could comment?\nFraser Atkinson: No, we don't have any direct exposure, whether it's drivetrains, systems or even their energy group, with their behind-the-meter battery storage for any of that aspect. And certainly not the batteries. So no, we don't have any direct exposure. But having said that, is this -- in talking to some stakeholders over the past week, this isn't a positive thing for the EV sector because everybody will be held under a greater level of scrutiny and certainly our supply chain doesn't need to be any more nervous about EV OEMs than they already were. So it just requires us to be on top of our own supply chain and make sure that they're comfortable with what we're doing and how we're interacting with each other.\nTate Sullivan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. Now I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Fraser Atkinson for closing remarks.\nFraser Atkinson: In closing, we are facing a number of challenges, including managing our supply chain, infrastructure requirements, principally around charging, timing of various funding programs, to name a few. At GreenPower, we have a first-class team who have the subject matter expertise and drive to address these challenges every day. We appreciate your support and look forward to providing you with further updates on our progress. Thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
