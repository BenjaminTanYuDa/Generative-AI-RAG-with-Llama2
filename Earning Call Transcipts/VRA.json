        "content": "Operator: Greetings. Welcome to Vera Bradley's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Mark Dely, Chief Administrative Officer. Thank you, you may begin.\nMark Dely: Good morning and welcome everyone.

Investors should not assume that the statements made during the call will remain operative at a later time. We undertake no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call. I will now turn over the call over to Vera Bradley's CEO, Jackie Ardrey. Jackie?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on today's call. I want to start with some comments on the quarter. We're pleased with the completion of the first full year of our turnaround story. We've successfully pivoted the organization towards a bright future and effectively managed both the existing business as well as the turnaround efforts through Project Restoration, which will begin to bear fruit in the coming year. Our teams continued to carefully manage both gross margin and expenses in the fourth quarter consistent with efforts earlier in the year. We've improved discipline around gross margin management and cost control, a part of our go-forward DNA. In addition to this discipline, our strategic efforts are focused on stabilizing and growing our sales base. Our recent sales results demonstrate the need for change in our branding, product assortments and store environments, the exact areas that Project Restoration is addressing to position Vera Bradley Inc. for long-term profitable growth. After a year of foundational work, we're very excited about the customer facing changes through Project Restoration that we will unveil this year. For the fourth quarter, Vera Bradley brand revenues fell 6.1% with soft sales in all direct channels. Sales were also negatively impacted by store closures. Customers responded to some of our latest product collaborations and to our newer product offerings like leather, but overall they continued to be more discriminating with their discretionary spending in light of the macroeconomic environment. A bright spot was the November transformation of our online outlet from a flash-sale model to an everyday extension of our outlet stores. This brought new customers to the brand and helped offset weakness in the outlet store channel. On the Indirect side, our wholesale partners were cautious with inventory buys in the fourth quarter. Pura Vida year-over-year fourth quarter sales declined 21.6%, primarily due to decreases in ecommerce and wholesale revenues, as external marketing costs continued to rise and marketing effectiveness remained challenging. Our holiday gifts, like our annual Advent Box, and engraving categories performed best for the quarter. While we are actively addressing revenue stabilization and marketing effectiveness at Pura Vida, our key focus is managing the business for profitability. As a result, we drove meaningful year-over-year operating margin improvement for the fourth quarter and full year. As I'm sure everyone listening understands, a strong balance sheet is incredibly important in retail and especially for Vera Bradley as Project Restoration enters an implementation stage. We continued to strengthen our already strong balance sheet, adding to our year-over-year cash position while strategically reducing our inventory levels. We ended the fiscal year with consolidated revenues of approximately $471 million. We generated GAAP net income of $7.8 million or $0.25 per diluted share, a return to profitability from a sizable loss last year. Excluding charges on a non-GAAP basis, net income for the fiscal year totaled $17.2 million or $0.55 per diluted share. This improved profitability was primarily driven by gross margin performance and disciplined expense control. Now let me turn to Project Restoration. A little over a year ago, we began a comprehensive review of the consumer, brand, product, and channel components for both of our brands. This work culminated in our long-term strategic plan, Project Restoration, which addresses each of these four pillars. Through Project Restoration, we are taking targeted and prudent actions to stabilize revenues, while remaining focused on strong financial discipline. We believe execution of this companywide comprehensive initiative will drive long-term profitable growth and deliver value to our shareholders. At Vera Bradley, Project New Day launches in mid-July, and is the first manifestation of our Project Restoration work and a full pivot from where we are today. It includes, among other things, the reveal of our new and elevated full-line branding and marketing, product, store design, and website. Our work on this initiative was informed by consumer research and current perceptions of the brand from both buyers and non-buyers. We believe we have the ability to attract new customers while keeping our current fans through product innovations and new marketing campaigns designed to inspire joy and connection. Our new assortment has broad appeal and uses new, higher quality, and softer fabrics and styles designed to not only look great, but feel great. I’d like to give you some more details on the progress within each pillar. For the consumer, we are focusing on restoring brand relevance, targeting casual and feminine 35 to 54-year-old women who value both fashion and function. Our focus on the 35 to 54-year-old led us in search of data to understand where and how she shops. We are using this data to inform product design development and will continue to use this data to target new customers and embark on new partnerships, licensing deals, and collaborations to extend our reach. We've created a multiyear customer product growth plan with a focus on this core consumer target along with an appropriate level of marketing investment to acquire new customers as we launch new product and our refreshed brand vision midyear. For the brand, we are strategically marketing our distinctive and unique position as a feminine fashionable brand that connects with consumers on a deep, emotional level. Vera Bradley is a strong brand with tremendous brand recognition and we're going to make it even stronger by telling a new story about it. We are refocusing our marketing efforts and shifting more marketing dollars to increase reach in a more precise way through the right media mix. Our initiatives will include more creative campaigns, enhanced digital reach, increased public relations and innovative store efforts to drive interest and gain new customers. We're also very excited about our new celebrity partner or Chief Joy Officer, who we will announce this summer and we are continuing to shift our focus from channel-specific customer acquisition to an omnichannel perspective for increased media effectiveness. For product, we're refocusing our core categories and items we are best at by innovating and expanding within our core products. We are elevating our colorful feminine heritage, keeping it distinctive, but more trend-right and modern through updated prints, colors, styles and designs. And we will continue to enter into strategic adjacent lifestyle item introductions that make sense for our customers. We have the benefit of a strong brand with high brand recognition and will be offering something new in the full line accessory space under a good, better, best Halo [ph] model. These changes were derived carefully after extensive customer data analysis. There is more attention to key items like travel bags and these smaller items that fit inside bags like wallets and pouches that allow her to customize her look and personalize her organization. Products are curated to meet the needs of our customers, offering superior quality in fabrication, components and overall craftsmanship. We've improved the quality of most of our fabrics while keeping our commitment to increased use of preferred fibers and our retail price structure is unchanged. Although the assortment will look new, it is unmistakably Vera Bradley and our existing customers will still recognize their favorite styles and our distinctive colors, patterns and quilting. The reception from our wholesale customers who have seen our new products at the Dallas, Atlanta and New York markets has been extremely positive. I just mentioned leather. Our revamped leather collection of bags, wallets and wristlets and other accessories debuted last fall. Leather performed well and the initial collection mostly sold out. We've built on this success and developed a major expansion as part of New Day. Our outlet stores and outlet website will get new made for outlet styles, prints and collaborations, as well as the benefit of select merchandise transferred from full-line stores throughout the third quarter. Product collaborations will always be an important part of our brand expression. We continue to see strong response from partnerships with Disney, Hello Kitty and Peanuts, and those will continue in all channels. And then finally for the channel, we're building a balanced footprint that more clearly differentiates our full-line and outlet assortments and experience. We will accelerate our digital-first focus and online reach while maintaining brand-right wholesale relationships and exploring partnerships that will help us acquire new customers. Delivering growth in our ecommerce channels is a key priority. We will accelerate this digital-first focus and elevate our online presence to include more consumer focused features, storytelling and personalized experiences. We are improving our online shopping experience and elevating creative, while offering our outlet assortment online on verabradleyoutlet.com. for the first time ever. We are doing a deep dive into our real estate strategy. Our full-line fleet is 80% in malls and not all of them are A malls. Traffic is declining in some locations and we need to adjust our strategy to optimize the fleet of both full-line and outlet stores. We will explore opening new formats, entering new markets, relocating stores where needed and increasing penetration in existing markets. We have already taken several expense disciplined steps to improve the profitability of our full-line stores. We will update our entire existing full-line store fleet with new branding and an improved shopping experience. The stores will reflect a more modern, less cluttered and easier to shop experience with new fixturing and lighting, allowing the product to shine. Our current year capital budget of $12 million to $14 million is triple of last year's spending, and much of this is attributable to these remodels. In addition, we plan to open two full-line stores this year and are in the process of identifying prudent, modest store expansion plans for the future. We are also exploring new full-line formats with a focus on lifestyle centers. We're also taking a comprehensive approach to addressing the trends in Vera Bradley's outlet channel. We are reviewing all aspects of the outlet operating model for changes and improvements. Keep in mind that the outlet channel remains highly profitable and we will open one new outlet store this year. Maintaining brand-right wholesale relationships are important and we are actively working with new specialty retailers where we know our customer is shopping. As you can see, there's a lot going on at Vera Bradley. Now let me turn to Pura Vida where we are shifting our focus to delivering profitability and balancing the ecommerce business with wholesale and retail stores. Pura Vida's revenues have declined the last two quarters, largely as a result of increased digital media costs that led to new to lower customer acquisition. We diversified our marketing spend and are making additional efforts to retain customers while continuing to work on each pillar of Project Restoration. For the consumer we're sharpening our focus on the 18 to 24-year-old collegiate girl. We will shift our marketing strategy to increased appeal to Gen Z based on our most recent research. For the brand we are recentering our brand ethos on living life to the fullest, sharing real moments, places and faces in our marketing campaigns and sharpening our focus on Gen Z. We are more analytical, using our newly implemented comprehensive customer data platform to more strategically target customers and potential customers with a focus on acquisition, but especially on repeat purchases and retention. This significantly enhanced customer reporting and increased analytics have made us smarter in analyzing challenges and we are investing in new tools to AB test and improve the site experience and conversion. For product we are focused on delivering unique, fun, playful designs that are affordable and accessible with a dominant emphasis on bracelets and jewelry as well as other strategic adjacent categories. We will continue to innovate around string bracelets and our other jewelry and accessory categories. Our custom bracelets, from Harper Charms to engravable items to building your own bracelets, are popular and continue to be a big growth opportunity. We will continue to pursue high profile collaborations like Hello Kitty, Shark Week and Harry Potter, which are always fan favorites and bring new customers to the brand. Social responsibility is important to the Pura Vida customer and we back this through our charity program which supports dozens of causes. And finally, for channel we continue to have strong focus on restoring ecommerce growth with a greater focus on repeat purchases as well as strategic growth of wholesale. Additionally, our success in retail stores has driven us to find new store locations for this year and beyond. We expect to open at least two new additional stores this year. Now let me turn the call over to CFO, Michael Schwindle to review the financial results. Michael?\nMichael Schwindle: Thank you Jackie and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Before we open for questions, I have a few highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year to cover. For the sake of clarity, the numbers I am discussing today are all non-GAAP in nature and exclude the charges outlined in today's press release. A complete detail of items excluded from the non-GAAP numbers, as well as a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP can also be found in the release. Beginning with our fourth quarter, consolidated net revenues totaled $133.3 million compared to $147.1 million in the prior year. Consolidated net income totaled $3.5 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $1 million, or $0.03 per diluted share last year. The current year fourth quarter consisted of 14 weeks compared to 13 weeks in the prior year fourth quarter. The full year fiscal 2024 consisted of 53 weeks compared to 52 weeks in the prior fiscal year. Comparable sales discussed by Jackie and myself during this call were calculated based on 13 weeks in each of the fourth quarters and 52 weeks in each of the fiscal years. The additional week contributed approximately $6 million in net revenues and increased earnings per share by approximately one penny for both, the current year fourth quarter and the fiscal 2024 year. Current year fourth quarter Vera Bradley direct segment revenues totaled $93 million, a 6.6% decrease from $99.5 million in the prior year fourth quarter. Comparable sales decreased 10% from the prior year, largely driven by weakness in the outlet and full-line channels. Total revenues were also impacted by store closures over the last twelve months, including eight full-line stores and one outlet store, while we also opened three outlet stores over the last twelve months. Vera Bradley Indirect segment revenues totaled $16.1 million, a 3.7% decrease over $16.7 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The decrease was primarily related to lower sales to certain specialty partners and key accounts. Pura Vida segment revenues totaled $24.2 million, a 21.6% decrease from $30.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter, primarily a result of declines in ecommerce and wholesale sales. Fourth quarter gross margin totaled $69.6 million or 52.3% of net revenues compared to $60.7 million or 41.3% of net revenues. The current year gross margin rate compared to the prior year rate was favorably impacted by lower year-over-year inventory reserve charges, lower inbound and outbound freight expense, lower supply chain costs and sell-through of previously reserved inventory, partially offset by increased promotional activity. Prior year gross margin was materially impacted by inventory reserve charges and high inbound and outbound freight expense as well as overhead costs. SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter totaled $65.7 million, or 49.3% of net revenues compared to $64.4 million or 43.8% of net revenues in the prior year fourth quarter. Vera Bradley's current year non-GAAP SG&A expenses were higher than the prior year quarter, primarily due to incremental marketing expenses in the quarter, partially offset by savings from companywide cost reduction initiatives. Fourth quarter consolidated operating income totaled $4.1 million or 3.1% of net revenues, compared to a consolidated net operating loss of $3.5 million or 2.4% of net revenues in the prior year. Now, turning to the full year results, our consolidated net revenues for the year totaled $470.8 million compared to $500 million last year. Consolidated net income totaled $17.2 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $3.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share last year. Vera Bradley Direct segment revenues for the current fiscal year totaled $309.9 million, a 5.6% decrease from $328.2 million in the prior year. Comparable sales for the year declined by 7.1%. Vera Bradley Indirect segment revenues for the fiscal year totaled $73.8 million, a 0.7% increase over 73.3 million in the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in certain key account orders partially offset by a decline in certain specialty department revenues. Current year Pura Vida segment revenues totaled $87.1 million, an 11.5% decrease from $98.4 million in the prior year, reflecting declines in ecommerce and wholesale sales, partially offset by growth in retail store sales. Gross margin for the current fiscal year totaled $256.4 million, or 54.5% of net revenues compared to $240.5 million, or 48.1% of net revenues last year. The current year gross profit rate compared to the prior year was favorably impacted again by year-over-year inventory reserve charges, lower year-over-year inbound and outbound freight expense, lower supply chain costs and sell-through of previously reserved inventory, partially offset by increase in promotional activity. For the fiscal year, SG&A expense totaled $234.7 million, or 49.9% of net revenues compared to $245.3 million or 49.1% of net revenues in the prior year. The decline in the current year expenses was driven by companywide cost reduction initiatives. For the fiscal year, the company's consolidated operating income totaled $22.6 million, or 4.8% of net revenues compared to consolidated operating loss of $4.4 million, or 0.9% of net revenues in the prior year. Now, turning to the balance sheet, our fiscal year end cash and cash equivalents totaled $77.3 million compared to $46.6 million at the end of the last fiscal year. We continued to have no borrowings on our $75 million ABL facility at year end. Total fiscal yearend inventory was $118.3 million compared to 142.3 million last year. We have taken strategic actions to reduce our inventory levels and believe we are appropriately positioned as we head into spring and prepare for our new product launches in July. In fiscal 2024, we purchased approximately 360,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $6.10 per share for an aggregate of approximately $2.2 million. $25.5 million remains under our $50 million repurchase authorization and that expires in December of 2024. Now looking forward to our guidance for fiscal 2025, our estimates for fiscal 2025 are based on current macroeconomic trends and expectations as we begin to unveil the results of Project Restoration and the launch of New Day midyear. As a result of this timing, we expect to continue to experience some revenue challenges in the first half of the fiscal year and see improving sales and profitability trends in the second half of the year. We expect to continue to take advantage of gross margin improvement opportunities and will manage our expense structure diligently. As a reminder, all forward looking guidance numbers are on a non-GAAP basis. For the full year fiscal 2025, we expect consolidated net revenues of $460 million to $480 million. As a reminder, net revenues totaled $470.8 million in fiscal 2024. We expect Vera Bradley brand sales to grow by low single digits for the year, with accelerating sales in the second half as we launch new products, branding and marketing. We anticipate Pura Vida brand sales will decline in the mid-teen range as we continue to manage the business for profitability by addressing marketing efficiencies impacting ecommerce sales, which will be partially offset by increased retail sales. We also expect consolidated gross margin of 54% to 55% compared to 54.5% in fiscal 2024. The fiscal 2025 gross profit rate is expected to be relatively flat to last year due to product margin improvements and lower supply chain costs offset by increased shipping costs. Consolidated SG&A expense is expected to range from $229 million to $239 million compared to $234.7 million last year. Year-over-year SG&A expenses are expected to be relatively flat to last year, driven by incremental marketing investments associated with the New Day launch offset by companywide expense reductions and lower Pura Vida expenses. This results in anticipated consolidated operating income of $21 million to $24.5 million compared to $22.6 million in fiscal 2024 along with diluted earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.62 compared to $0.55 last year. We also expect a net capital spending of approximately $12 million to $14 million versus $3.8 million last year. This spend reflects investments associated with new and remodeled stores as well as technology and logistics enhancements. As a result, our free cash flow is anticipated to be approximately $10 million in fiscal 2025 compared to $44.2 million in fiscal 2024. And that concludes our formal remarks. So Sherry, we'd like to open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Joe Gomes with Noble Capital Markets. Please proceed.\nJoe Gomes: Good morning.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Good morning, Joe.\nMichael Schwindle:\nJoe Gomes: So just Jackie, you've talked about a lot of changes coming on both of the brands in calendar year 2024. You've been there for 18 months. Michael, you've been there for about a year, talked about Project Restoration for roughly a year. The challenge of turning around just that much bigger than you originally anticipated, or is there just things that are occurring that it's taken you a relatively long period of time to get your hands around it in order to come up with the changes here that you've outlined today?\nJacqueline Ardrey: That's a great question, Joe and the short answer to that is no. We are absolutely on track in terms of our efforts to turn around the business. The first thing that we really had to deal with was a very long product lifecycle. So I've been here about 15 months and our product lifecycle is roughly 18 months. So kind of getting in the seat and then hiring the team to be able to do this level of transformation. We're right really where we need to be in terms of launching all of this in the middle of the year. And I would say further to that, that it's a big change and it's the one thing over the years many people have followed the brand, and there's been a lot of things at Vera Bradley specifically that we've done. This is a different effort. This is a very comprehensive effort that's really outlined by Project Restoration. It's not just one part of the pillar, it's the entire pillar. So this was a bigger effort. And then expect to see that in the middle of the year when we launch New Day for Vera Bradley, that we'll see some really good results. On the Pura Vida side definitely different issues. We're seeing some other external issues that have really kind of caused us to say, you know what, this is a business that we're going to manage for profitability and we did that this year. We did that for the year. We did that for the quarter. So I feel our plans are really on track.\nJoe Gomes: Okay, thanks for that. I appreciate that. And in the comments today, you talked about improving the quality of the fabrics with an unchanged retail price. Does that have any margin impact, or have you got to the point where margins, that won't impact margins by improving the quality of your fabrics, but maintaining price?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Yes, that's a great question, too and we kind of expected that one today. So it’s definitely -- the short answer to that is no. We are actually expecting our product margins to be about the same or a little bit better. And that's because of mix shift for sure, is one element, and then another element is just the designs that we've just been able to design into styles that can highlight the fabrics, the new and improved fabrics that we're using with less make.\nJoe Gomes: Okay, thank you. And you also talked about the new full-line format with a focus on lifestyle centers and I was wondering if you could just kind of give us what you meant by that or what you mean by that?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Sure. It's really just the alternative to our in-mall format, which is currently the majority of our fleet. We would like to mix up that ratio and be in a little more lifestyle center, so places that are -- shopping centers that are anchored with whole foods, and in places where she's going all the time. So all of this is really centered around, for Vera Bradley, centered around the customer and understanding where she shops, not only from a specialty or lifestyle retailer point of view, but where she's going every day and how do we just get more in the front of her mind and consideration set?\nJoe Gomes: Okay, one more, if I may. So fiscal 2025 is based on your guidance today, kind of going to be a replay of 2024 from a financial point of view. And I was just wondering, what do you think, or what do you see could occur that might make 2025 a better outcome from a financial point of view than 2024?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Michael, do you want to take that?\nMichael Schwindle: Let me jump in first. I think the first and the biggest of this would be customer reaction on the other side of New Day. We are being pretty diligent and judicious in our expectations, making sure that we've got an organization that's focused on delivering. So to the extent that consumer reaction is obviously better than what we had planned, that would obviously be better results as well. I think additionally, as I mentioned in my forward looking comments, we are anticipating some continued overhang, economic -- macroeconomic overhang. We saw over the course of 2024 and we talked about this on prior calls, we saw sequential declines in traffic patterns across most of the year. That continued through into the fourth quarter as well. And I think that's reflective in a lot of other retailer results that have been released over the last week or two. So we have continued to anticipate that some portion of that's going to continue to hang over into 2025. So if that outlook gets better, then of course the rising tide lifts all boats on that as well.\nJoe Gomes: Great. I appreciate you guys taking my questions and look forward to an interesting 2025.\nMichael Schwindle: Thanks, Joe.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question is from Eric Beder with SCC Research. Please proceed.\nEric Beder: Good morning.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Good morning, Eric.\nEric Beder: Good morning. So you've made tremendous progress in terms of reducing inventory levels. I gather from what I'm hearing in your guide that's going to start to level off. How should we be thinking about the inventories going forward?\nMichael Schwindle: Broadly, as we guide it broadly, we're expecting inventory to be relatively flat on a yearend over year end basis in fiscal 2025. However, given what's going on underneath the surface that will actually represent a bit of an improvement. We are doing a fairly substantial merchandise shift across our channels as part of launching New Day, which will happen midyear. Additionally, there might be some additional unit to turnover improvements that I think will be under the surface beyond that as well. And we'll see as we go forward broadly, you should start to see sales and inventory patterns run similarly on the other side of that. But we think that it'll actually, yearend flat will be actually some structural improvement under the hood.\nEric Beder: Okay. You talked about looking at the, while you're adding storage, you also talked about looking at the composition of the storage you have. What do you have in terms of lease expirations and flexibility to do that now and going forward?\nMichael Schwindle: That's a great question. Every year we have a body of stores come up for renewal. As we are approaching landlords at this juncture, we are finding a lot of receptivity to renegotiating lease terms as we move forward. Broadly, there's a couple of closures that will happen this year on the full-line side, but broadly, we're very happy with the fleet as it is and are looking to continue to extend our stays. But as Jackie mentioned, there's a body of work that we will be doing in our stores this coming year as part of New Day, so there'll be a lot of refreshing going on in our stores, so that's part of the conversation as well. We've started to have initial conversations with landlords, and I think the landlords are excited about what we're doing and the outlook on both product and store refreshes.\nEric Beder: Great. Is the goal to have the refreshes done at the start of New Day, or is that going to be an ongoing process? How should we be thinking about that?\nMichael Schwindle: I think the short answer to your question is yes. This is one of those that with all of the different refreshes across all of the different stores, it will not all exactly synchronize to the day of product arriving in the stores. But we're working very diligently as a team to make sure that everything is coordinated as tightly as possible.\nEric Beder: Okay. And when we look at, you've kind of hinted around this, what should we be thinking in terms of the categories that are going to be in the stores? Are we going to see less categories and a deeper focus? I think you've kind of implied that, but I'd like to get kind of a confirm and beyond travel, what are the key core categories that you want to be in?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Yes, that's a great question, Eric, and I think it will vary a little bit from the outlet segment to the full-line segment. So in outlet, you'll largely see that the categories remain unchanged though, we are looking obviously, we have a lot of tests that are going on right now from marketing, store merchandising, price points, discounts, everything. A lot of tests around the outlet fleet now, but largely, you won't see a lot of difference in terms of product category breadth. You will likely see some difference in offer breadth and reduction there. And then on the full-line side, really in the stores, there will be more of a focus on travel and bags. Really that's where we looked at the data, that is the place where we're really owed business is bags, but as much backpacks. I mean, backpacks we've kind of maintained our business over the years, but true handbags, belt bags, some of those little more fashionable items, we have not been as strong. So you'll definitely see our commitment to travel, which is really the core of our brand, but then some extension into bags and potentially some unproductive categories moving out of the full-line stores.\nEric Beder: Okay. And last one on Pura Vida. So you mentioned opening some more stores in Pura Vida. Obviously, the sales have been tough. Are you still seeing the strong results in the stores that you have opened to mix and I guess the surrounding areas to justify more stores? And what would be different on the stores you're opening now than the ones you did the first two or three?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Yes, that's a great question. I'll take the first part and then I'll let Michael add if there's anything. So we still see, this is a -- the Pura Vida performance is largely. It's almost three different businesses in terms of the category results or the channel results and retail is still strong and very profitable. And ecommerce really is, because so much of the business is in ecommerce. And the minute that we hit increased costs that affect our new customer acquisition rate, you definitely see challenges in the top line. So, but we still feel strongly about the stores. Some of the stores that we opened last year are really good. So we're kind of looking at how do we take that specific model and find the places that are going to produce those same results. So that's really what we're doing right now. Anything to add?\nMichael Schwindle: I would add that we've seen some really good success in tourist oriented areas. And as we look forward and are mapping out the next couple of stores, that's a bit where our focus is. I think the upside from that, from a broader branding and business perspective is it gives you a much bigger footprint nationally than it does just in the local market, because you're tapping people who are coming into that area from all over the country.\nEric Beder: Okay. All right, guys, I look forward to seeing this all in July. Thank you.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Thanks, Eric.\nMichael Schwindle: Thank you, Eric.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] With no further questions, I would like to hand the conference back over to Jackie for closing remarks.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Thank you, Sherry. Our entire team is dedicated to returning the company to profitable growth and generating strong cash flow through Project Restoration, which should deliver value to our shareholders over the long-term. We are on track with our Project Restoration initiatives. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you on our first quarter earnings call on June 12.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."

At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mark Dely, Chief Administrative Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nMark Dely: Good morning, and welcome, everyone. We'd like to thank you for joining us for today's call. Some of the statements made during our prepared remarks and response to your questions may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to and within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as amended. Such forward-looking statements are subject to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expect. Please refer to today's press release and the Company's most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC for a discussion of known risks and uncertainties. Investors should not assume that the statements made during the call will remain operative at a later time. We undertake no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call. I'll now turn the call over to Vera Bradley's CEO, Jackie Ardrey. Jackie?\nJackie Ardrey: Thank you, Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. Our efforts continue on Project Restoration as our associates across the Company work together to position Vera Bradley Inc. for long-term profitable growth. We are very pleased with the meaningful progress we have made so far. Year-over-year, third quarter non-GAAP income was essentially flat as we delivered solid gross margin expansion and carefully managed our expenses despite sales challenges. Total third quarter revenues for the Vera Bradley brand decreased 5% from last year. Vera Bradley direct revenue declines primarily resulted from continued weakness in the outlet store channel and the impact of store closures. Year-over-year, Vera Bradley indirect revenues were up to last year. Pura Vida year-over-year sales decreased 18.3% with declines in both wholesale and e-commerce revenues as prior year sales were driven by meaningfully higher levels of marketing spend along with increased liquidation and clearance activity. Store sales remain strong. With our diligent expense management and focus on profitability, Pura Vida year-over-year third quarter operating income improved. At both brands, customers have responded to our latest iconic product collaborations and to our new innovative and on-trend product offerings even as they have been more careful with their discretionary spending in the current macro environment. We continue to diligently manage our debt-free balance sheet, adding to our year-over-year cash position while strategically lowering our inventory levels. Strength in this area is important in navigating an uncertain retail environment as well as in supporting our Project Restoration initiatives. Presently, we are taking targeted and prudent actions to stabilize revenues, and we remain focused on strong financial discipline in controlling what we can control as we react both strategically and tactically to current market conditions. Simultaneously, we have made meaningful progress and are right on track with our long-term strategic plan Project Restoration, focusing on four key pillars of the business for each brand: consumer, brand, product and channel. We believe execution of Product Restoration will drive long-term profitable growth and deliver value to our shareholders. Let me give you an update on some of the initiatives we have underway related to Project Restoration. We will have additional updates in conjunction with our year-end earnings call with more rollout details in June. At Vera Bradley, for the consumer, we are focusing on restoring brand relevancy, targeting casual and feminine 35- to 54-year-old women who place prime importance on both fashion and function. We've created a multiyear customer file growth plan with a focus on this core consumer target, along with an appropriate level of marketing investment to acquire new customers as we launch new product and our refreshed brand vision next year. Our consumer research focused on this target audience, and we placed importance on her needs to inform product design and development. For the brand, we are working to strategically market our distinctive and unique position as a feminine fashionable brand that connects with consumers on a deep emotional level. Our marketing efforts this year have increased the number of reactivated customers. We are continuing to shift our focus from channel-specific customer acquisition to an omnichannel perspective for increased media effectiveness. Our updated brand vision and marketing strategy will roll out in the middle of next year. For the product, we are refocusing on core categories and items we are best at by continually innovating and expanding within our core products like travel and back to campus. By mid-next year, you will see how we have elevated our colorful feminine heritage, keeping it distinctive but more trend relevant through updated print and design, and we will continue to enter into strategic adjacent lifestyle item introductions that make sense for our customers. Our performance fabrics Featherweight Performance Twill, ReActive and Ultralight continue to trend well, appealing to our younger core customer with a higher household income. We believe performance fabrics are a big opportunity for us. Patterns will always be our signature, but coordinating solids continue to be a key opportunity for us as well. We have and will continue to expand our solid offerings. As part of this, our revamped leather collection of bags, wallets and bracelets and other accessories debuted in September. The simple clean lines, beautiful designs and exceptional functionality have been well received by our customers, and we expect to expand our collection going forward. Customers purchasing leather spent 7x more than their full price purchasing counterparts in the third quarter. Product collaborations will always be an important part of our brand expression. We continue to see strong response from Disney to Hello Kitty to Peanuts to our most recently launched Toy Story Collection. Stay tuned for more exciting collaborations next year. We are especially thrilled about our NFL collection introduced in August. We will expand to all NFL teams in fiscal 2025. For the holidays, we have a great gift-giving lineup of products featuring fan favorites and uniquely giftable items from bags to ornaments to our cosy collection, all at sharp price points. Holiday gifts also incorporate items from our favorite collaborations, including Hello Kitty, Peanuts, Disney, Toy Story and Star Wars. For the channel, we are accelerating our digital-first focus and online presence, building a more balanced store footprint and clearly differentiating the full-line assortment from our outlet assortment. We are also focused on improving full-line store profitability and have future growth plans for this channel, including remodels for existing stores in the first half of next year as well as the development of new formats. In addition, we are targeting relationships with strategically aligned wholesale partners. As part of this, our recent site rebranding and navigation changes have been successful in reducing bounce rate and driving conversion and sales. We will apply what we've learned from these changes to a full site rebrand in the middle of next year. We have taken steps via product, marketing and expense discipline to improve the profitability of our full-line stores. We are in the process of identifying prudent, modest store expansion plans for next year and beyond. We also are taking a comprehensive approach to addressing the trends in Vera Bradley's outlet channel through a thorough multipronged approach, including targeted marketing tactics designed to drive traffic and conversion pricing adjustments and testing and store contest. Now turning to Pura Vida. For the consumer, we are sharpening our focus on young women aged 18 to 24, the original target audience of the brand. For the brand, we have re-centered our brand philosophy on living life to the fullest. We have pivoted our marketing to authentically share real moments, places and faces of our customers and enthusiasts. We are more analytical using our newly implemented comprehensive customer data platform to more strategically target customers and potential customers with a keen focus on both customer acquisition and retention. Our recent live free and college mobile tours were huge successes for customer engagement. For the product, we are focusing on delivering unique fun, playful designs that are affordable and accessible with a key emphasis on bracelets and jewelry as well as other strategic adjacent categories. Innovation and newness are working. Our custom bracelets from Harper Charms to engravable items to building your own bracelets are popular and continue to be a big growth opportunity. We will continue to pursue high-profile collaborations like Hello Kitty, Shark Week and Harry Potter, which are always fan favorites and bring new customers to the brand. We recently expanded our men's collection. This collection still targets our core customer who purchases these items for the men in her life. Holiday Gifting is a huge opportunity for us, and our offerings include special holiday bracelet packs, collectible ornaments, holiday themed Harper Charms and our very popular advent boxes. Social responsibility is important to the Pura Vida customer, and we support this through our charity program, which supports a number of charities, including mental health awareness, homes for our troops, best friends, animal, society and the Trevor project. For the channel, we have a strong focus on driving e-commerce growth and strategic expansion of wholesale by pursuing bigger, more strategic partnerships and expanding larger existing accounts. Also, we are beginning to refine and develop an expansion plan for our existing store model. Based on the success of our existing Pura Vida stores, we are in the process of identifying a handful of new Pura Vida store locations for 2024. We will have firmer plans to announce in March on our year-end call. To gain both operational and strategic efficiency, we moved the Pura Vida store operations under the Vera Bradley team earlier this year. We are taking actions to stabilize and then steadily grow Pura Vida's revenues and to reverse the trends in Vera Bradley's outlet channel. Our team is focused on driving long-term revenue growth, improving gross margin and ensuring strong financial discipline and cost control, all of which we expect will drive long-term profitable growth. Now let me turn the call over to CFO, Michael Schwindle, to review the financial results. Michael?\nMichael Schwindle: Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin with some details about our third quarter and then go into a revised guidance for the year. For the sake of clarity, the numbers I am discussing today are on a non-GAAP basis and exclude charges as outlined in today's press release, a complete detail of items excluded from non-GAAP numbers as well as that reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP can be found in the release. For the third quarter, our consolidated net revenues totaled $115 million compared to $124 million in the prior year third quarter. Consolidated net income totaled $6.1 million or $0.19 per diluted share compared to $6.3 million or $0.20 per diluted share last year. Current year third quarter Vera Bradley Direct segment revenues totaled $72.3 million which is a 9.7% decrease from $80.1 million in the prior year third quarter. Comparable sales declined 8.2% in the third quarter, primarily driven by weakness in the outlet channel. Total revenues were also impacted by store closures over the last 12 months, including 15 full line and two outlet store closures. We also opened three outlet stores over the last 12 months. Vera Bradley Indirect segment revenues totaled $25 million, a 12% increase over $22.3 million in the prior year third quarter, reflecting a significant onetime key account order that did not take place in the prior year. Pura Vida segment revenues totaled $17.7 million, an 18.3% decrease from $21.7 million in the prior year, reflecting the decline in sales to wholesale accounts and a decline in e-commerce sales, partially offset by a growth in retail store sales. Third quarter gross margin totaled $63 million or 54.8% of net revenues compared to $65.6 million or 52.9% of net revenues in the prior year. The current year gross profit rate was favorably impacted by lower year-over-year inbound and outbound freight expense, lower supply chain costs and the sell-through of previously reserved inventory, partially offset by increased promotional activity. Prior year gross profit was materially impacted by high inbound and outbound freight expense as well as deleverage of overhead costs. SG&A expenses totaled $55.1 million or 48% of net revenues compared to $57.6 million or 46.4% of net revenues in the prior year. This reduction from the prior year reflects company-wide cost reduction initiatives across various areas of the organization. The expense deleverage resulted from lower revenues. Third quarter consolidated operating income totaled $8 million or 7% of net revenues compared to $8.2 million or 6.6% of net revenues last year. So now turning to the balance sheet. Quarter end cash and cash equivalents totaled $52.3 million compared to $25.2 million at the end of last year's third quarter. We continue to have no borrowings on our $75 million ABL facility. Inventory was $129.1 million at the end of the quarter compared to $178.3 million at the end of the third quarter last year. We have taken strategic actions to reduce our inventory levels, and we believe we are appropriately positioned as we enter the holiday season. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 72,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $6.76 per share or an aggregate of approximately $485,000. $25.8 million remained under our $50 million share repurchase authorization and that expires in December of 2024. Based on the performance of the first nine months of the year as well as our initiatives underway and the current macroeconomic trends and expectations, we are updating certain components of our guidance for the fiscal year, and we have adjusted our range of diluted EPS as well. As a reminder, all of these numbers are on a non-GAAP basis. We now expect consolidated net revenues of $472 million to $478 million. As a reminder, net revenues totaled $500 million last year. We also expect a consolidated gross margin percentage of 54% to 54.5% compared to 51.4% in the prior year. This year's gross margin rate is expected to be favorably impacted by lower year-over-year freight expense, cost reduction initiatives and the sell-through of previously reserved inventory, partially offset by increased promotional activity, as I mentioned -- all of which I mentioned earlier. Consolidated SG&A expense is expected to be $232.5 million to $235.5 million compared to $245.3 million last year. Decline in SG&A expenses being driven by our company-wide cost initiatives and partially offset by restoring short-term and long-term incentive compensation to more normalized levels as well as some incremental marketing investment intended to accelerate long-term customer file growth. This results in anticipated consolidated operating income of $23.3 million to $25.9 million compared to $12.3 million last year and diluted earnings per share of $0.56 to $0.62 compared to $0.24 last year. We also expect net capital spending to be approximately $4 million for the year, versus $8.2 million last year, and this reflects investments associated with Vera Bradley outlet stores as well as certain technology and logistics enhancements. And lastly, our free cash flow is anticipated to be between $40 million and $43 million compared to a cash usage last year of $21.7 million for the full year. That concludes our formal remarks. So operator, we'd like to now open up the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Joe Gomes with NOBLE Capital.\nJoe Gomes: So Jackie, and Michael, last time when we talked for the second quarter, your traffic had been down and you guys were taking some steps, including some paid media, mall takeovers, et cetera, to try and drive additional traffic. I was wondering, if you can kind of give us what the takeaways so far are? And what else are you looking at to help drive traffic?\nJackie Ardrey: Yes. Thanks for your question, Joe. So a couple of points on that. So first of all, we -- the marketing initiatives that we undertook throughout Q3 were successful in driving traffic and improving trend. They -- unfortunately, because of the conversion metrics, they weren't as -- they weren't as effective in driving sales. So, we've had several tests going and things that we've adopted for Q4. We're continually changing up our marketing mix to find those things that are working and drive those and leverage them as best as we can.\nJoe Gomes: Okay. Maybe switching gears over to Pura Vida here. We started out the year at a pretty positive environment there. Sales were actually up year-over-year. But then they declined in the second quarter. This quarter, they climbed back to that nearly 20% down. I know some of it you talked about was due to some kind of onetime events. I don't know if you break out what it would be outside of those onetime events? Or what do you think we can do here in the short term and kind of reverse that transact to what we saw earlier in the year?\nJackie Ardrey: Yes, that's a great question. So for August and September, we really were comping against some promotional activity that we did not repeat this year. And that and combined with a better focus on profitability for the brand, really caused us to pull back some marketing spend in those two months. So the first two months of the quarter were definitely more challenging. And then we had a better October. So, we're continually evaluating what's the right level of spend to drive customer acquisition. Now conversely, our retail stores did perform well in Q3 at Pura Vida. And they also had the -- the advantage of driving some more customer acquisition. So, we're looking at that very carefully to inform our plans for next year.\nJoe Gomes: Okay. Great. One last one for me on the inventory. Again, great job there. But pardon me, down basically another $10 million sequentially, just wondering, is there really more there that you think you can take out on the inventory side? Are we kind of at a level where we're going to need this as hopefully, we see the sales begin to grow?\nMichael Schwindle: Yes. Joe, I think there are several issues in play when we think about inventory, especially as you look to the end of the year and then beyond. The first is we continue to expect to see inventory down 10% to 15% year-over-year by the end of the year. There may be a little bit of slip -- more call slip and swap because the Chinese New Year cutoff is right at our year-end, where there's normally there's about a week a week of lag from our year-end to Chinese that just affects the importation of goods and the timing of that. So -- but regardless, we still expect to see 10% to 15% reduction from -- on a year-over-year basis. As we look forward to next year, we'll provide more specific guidance for next year, but there continues to be opportunities in our inventory management. They will be a little bit masked next year just due to the changeover of products as part of project restoration, which will land midyear. So, I expect that we'll continue to see improvement in our operations with some improvement in the overall level of inventory, but there will be more guidance to come at our next call.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Eric Beder with SCC Research.\nEric Beder: Congratulations on Q3. I want to talk about a few things here. First is the indirect sales channel and the opportunities for more, I guess, indirect/wholesale. This is the second quarter where this has gone up year-over-year after a long period of declining here, what is driving that in terms of your -- are you seeing more people want to take the product? Are you seeing you taking more product? What are you seeing in the indirect channel? And you brought it up for both Pure Vida and for the Vera Bradley brand, that's driving that to go forward as a positive driver here.\nJackie Ardrey: Yes, it's a great question, Eric. So I think there's a couple of things in the indirect channel that are happening. We did have -- For some of our key accounts, we did have some product that was working better and had some reorders on those products. And we -- our business with Amazon is strong. And then finally, we took advantage in third quarter to really look at our inventories and figure out where we had some opportunities for discounters or onetime orders to reduce some undesirable inventory. So really, it was those three pieces. So we do see, though, that our wholesale channel is obviously very sensitive to just customer trends right now. So when our partners are seeing better traffic and sales, we're actually benefiting from that. So, we did -- we did see some of that happen in the third quarter and actually in the second quarter.\nEric Beder: Interesting. You mentioned leather more expensive item also the customer who's buying it spent a lot more in the store. You mentioned the performance product, which is slightly more expensive to you. When we think about going forward, these are items that's probably driving new customers, younger customers. Is there an opportunity to, a, continue to expand those pieces; and b, continue to drive higher pricing from them which can drive, I guess, better returns?\nJackie Ardrey: Yes. That's a great question too, Eric. And we were able to deliver this leather collection, it had kind of a truncated time period compared to our normal supply chain lead times. So, we got this in to test informed some of our leather expansion that we're planning to do next year, and we were really pleased with the results. A lot of it sold through fairly quickly. And I would say from a new customer perspective, our existing customers were so excited to see this that we didn't really have as much opportunity to drive new customer acquisition from it because a lot of it was really sold through in the first three or four weeks. So, we're really looking forward to learning and continuing to grow that segment of our business. It used to be a very important part of our business.\nEric Beder: Okay. Last question. Is there a 53rd week in your Q4? And how big is that if it is there?\nMichael Schwindle: There is a 53rd week in this fiscal year. It's a relatively small amount of sales overall.\nEric Beder: Okay. Congratulations again, and good luck into the holiday season.\nOperator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to you.\nJackie Ardrey: Our entire team is dedicated to returning both Vera Bradley and Pura Vida to profitable growth and generating strong cash flow through Project Restoration. This should deliver value to our shareholders over the long term. We are right on track with our Project Restoration initiatives. This year, we have been diligently focusing on stabilizing sales, expanding gross margin and controlling expenses. We believe this focus at a minimum should nearly double year-over-year operating income and more than double EPS. We are excited about the opportunities for both brands. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you on our year-end earnings call on March 13.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Mark Dely, Vera Bradley's Chief Administrative Officer.\nMark Dely: Good morning, and welcome everyone. We'd like to thank you for joining us for today's call. Some of the statements made during our prepared remarks and in response to your questions, may constitute forward-looking statements made pursuant to and within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as amended. Such forward-looking statements are subject to both known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those that we expect.

Investors should not assume that the statements made during the call will remain operative at a later time. We undertake no obligation to update any information discussed on today's call. I will now turn over the call to Vera Bradley's CEO, Jackie Ardrey. Jackie?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, and thank you for joining us on today's call. We are very pleased with the meaningful year-over-year improvement in second quarter earnings driven by significant gross margin expansion and successful company-wide expense reduction efforts. As a company, we are doing a better job of being attentive to our cost structure and are being very intentional on how we invest our dollars to drive long term profitable growth. Our transformational efforts continue to bear fruit, and I'd like to thank all of our associates across the country for their contributions to this very important work. During the quarter, we carefully managed our debt-free balance sheet, adding to our cash position while continuing to strategically improve our inventory position. One of our key goals this year is to stabilize revenues. We are continuing to make progress on that front with second quarter consolidated revenues of $128.2 million, only modestly below last year. Total second quarter revenues for the Vera Bradley brand were down 1.2% from last year. Vera Bradley direct revenue declines resulted from store closures over the last year while we saw a small comparable store gain in our full-line stores. The successful return of the Vera Bradley annual outlet sale offset weakness in our factory outlet stores in addition to compensating for the elimination of one online outlet sale during the quarter. The remainder of our e-commerce sales continued to perform well. Lastly, Vera Bradley indirect revenues were up slightly to last year. Pura Vida year-over-year sales declined 3.6%, primarily related to a shortfall in wholesale revenues, which we believe should improve in the second half of the year. [Technical Difficulty] to realize the benefits of changes in our performance-based marketing program. In general, at both brands, customers have responded enthusiastically to our collaborations into product offerings when they are innovative and trend right even as they have been more selective in their discretionary spending in light of the current macro environment. We continue to make meaningful progress on Project Restoration focusing on four key pillars of the business for each brand: Consumer, Brand, Product and Channel. Through the first half of fiscal 2024, we have progressed as expected. We believe execution of Project Restoration will drive long-term profitable growth and deliver value to our shareholders. Let me give you a bit more detail on Project Restoration's four key pillars and some of the initiatives we currently have underway. First, at Vera Bradley, for the Consumer, we are focusing on restoring brand relevancy, targeting casual and feminine 35 to 54 year old women who value both fashion and function. For the Brand, we are working to strategically market our distinctive and unique position as a feminine fashionable brand that connects with consumers on a deep emotional level. For the Product, we are refocusing on core categories and items we are best at, by continually innovating and expanding within our core products. Over the next 12 months, we will elevate our colorful feminine heritage, keeping it distinctive but more trend relevant through updated print and design. And we will continue to enter into strategic adjacent lifestyle item introductions that makes sense for our customers. Our performance fabrics, Featherweight, Performance Twill, ReActive and Ultralight are trending well with the core customer being younger with a higher household income. This remains a big opportunity for us, both now and in our plans for future transformation. Patterns will always be our signature, but coordinating solids continue to be a key opportunity for us as well. We will expand our solid offerings this fall, including our reintroduction of a small collection of leather goods next month. Product collaborations are an important part of our brand expression. Our first Hello Kitty collaboration launched in June was a great success and we are also seeing strong customer response from our much anticipated Peanuts collection launched just this month. We are especially thrilled about our NFL collection introduced in August just in time for football season. Our product innovation and new pipeline is robust for next year, and I look forward to sharing more details in the months to come. And finally, for the channel, we are accelerating our digital first focus and online presence, building a balanced footprint that more clearly differentiates full line from factory outlet stores and targeting relationships with strategically aligned wholesale partners. As part of this, our recent site rebranding and navigation changes have been successful in reducing bounce rate and driving conversion and sales. We are taking a comprehensive approach to reversing the trends in Vera Bradley's factory outlet channel through a thorough multipronged approach, including potential pricing adjustments and targeted marketing initiatives aimed to drive traffic and average order size. Now turning to Pura Vida. For the consumer, we are sharpening our focus on 18 to 24 year old young women, the original target audience of the brand. For the brand, we have recentered our brand ethos on living life to the fullest. Our marketing today authentically shares real moments, places and faces. Our Live Free campaign launched in June accentuated travel, adventure, friendship and freedom and created engagement and excitement in our customer base. The campaign included a nationwide tour to adventurous U.S. destinations by several social media influencers and customers. We are utilizing our newly launched comprehensive customer data platform to more strategically target customers and potential customers with a deep focus on retention. Additionally, we have seen improved marketing efficiency this year at both brands. For the product, we are focusing on delivering unique fun, playful designs that are affordable and accessible with a key emphasis on bracelets and jewelry as well as other strategic adjacent categories. Our new summer collection, featuring both string and metal jewelry has resonated with our customers. We recently launched our men's collection with some items selling out quickly. This collection still targets our core customer, who ultimately is purchasing these items for the men in her life. Our custom bracelets from Harper charms to engravable items to building your own bracelets, are working and continue to be a growth opportunity. We will continue to pursue high-profile collaborations like Hello Kitty, Shark Week and Harry Potter that are always fan favorites and bring new customers to the brand. And we are continually adding items to our charity program that matter most to our customers, like the Hawaii Wildfires relief bracelet. Additionally, for both brands, we have terrific holiday gifting programs in place. And then finally, for the channel, we have a strong focus on driving e-commerce growth and strategic expansion of wholesale by pursuing strategic partnerships and expanding larger existing accounts. Also, we are beginning to refine and develop an expansion plan for our existing store model in both brands. To gain both operational and strategic efficiency, we moved the Pura Vida store operations under the Vera Bradley team during the quarter. We are taking actions to stabilize and then steadily grow Pura Vida's revenues and to reverse the trends in Vera Bradley's factory outlet channel. Our team is focused on generating long term revenue increases, expanding gross margin and ensuring strong financial discipline and cost control, which we expect will drive long term profitable growth. Now let me turn the call over to CFO, Michael Schwindle to review the financial results. Michael?\nMichael Schwindle: Thanks, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin with a few highlights from our second quarter but before I do, for the sake of clarity, I will discuss -- all the numbers I'm discussing today are non-GAAP and exclude the charges outlined in today's press release for a complete detail of items excluded from the non-GAAP numbers as well as a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP, please reference today's release. Our second quarter consolidated net revenues totaled $128.2 million compared to $130.4 million in the prior year second quarter. Consolidated net income totaled $10.2 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared to $2.4 million or $0.08 per diluted share last year. Vera Bradley Direct segment revenues totaled $85.7 million, a 1.5% decrease from $87 million in the prior year. We permanently closed 19 full line and two factory outlet stores and opened three factory outlet stores over the last 12 months. Our comparable sales declined 5.3%, primarily due to weakness in the factory outlet channel that Jackie noted earlier. This year, the direct segment revenues also included sales from the Vera Bradley annual outlet sale which was not held last year. Vera Bradley Indirect segment revenues totaled $17.4 million, a 0.2% increase over $17.3 million last year. Pura Vida segment revenues totaled $25.1 million, a 3.6% decrease from $26 million in the prior year, reflecting a decline in sales (ph) to wholesale count and a modest decline in e-commerce sales, partially offset by new store growth resulting in noncomparable retail store sales. Second quarter gross margin totaled $72 million or 56.2% of net revenues compared to $67.8 million or 52% of net revenues in the prior year. The current year gross margin rate was favorably impacted by lower year-over-year inbound and outbound freight expense and the sell-through of previously reserved inventory, partially offset by an increase in promotional (ph) activity. As a reminder, our prior year gross margin was materially impacted by high inbound and outbound freight expense as well as a deleverage of our revenue costs. SG&A expenses totaled $58.3 million or 45.5% of net revenues compared to $64 million or 49.1% of net revenues in the prior year. This reduction from the prior year reflects the early sets (ph) of our company wide cost reduction initiatives across various areas of the organization. Second quarter consolidated operating income totaled $14 million or 10.9% of net revenues compared to $3.9 million or 3% of net revenues last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Our quarterly (ph) cash and cash equivalents totaled $48.5 million compared to $38.3 million at the end of last year's second quarter. We continue to have no borrowings on our $75 million ABL facility. And subsequent to quarter end, we completed renegotiation of our ABL agreement and the modifications among other things, convert the interest calculation from LIBOR to SOFR as well as enhance our future ability to expand ABL, if necessary. We are confident that our access to liquidity and capital is sufficient to address our needs for the foreseeable future. Inventory was $139.3 million at the end of the quarter compared to $179.6 million at the end of the second quarter last year. We have taken strategic actions to reduce our inventory levels, and we believe we are appropriately positioned as we enter the fall selling season. During the quarter, we also repurchased approximately 120,000 shares at an average price of $5.16 per share, totaling approximately $683,000. $26.3 million remain under the $50 million share repurchase authorization that expires in December of 2024. As Jackie said earlier, we are very pleased with our performance year-to-date as well as with our progress on the transformation, I likewise thank all of our associates for their hard work and commitment to these efforts. So as we look forward, based on the first half performance as well as our initiatives underway and the current macroeconomic trends and expectations, we are updating certain components of our guidance for the fiscal year. And as a reminder, our forward-looking guidance numbers are on a non-GAAP basis. We now expect consolidated net revenues of between $490 million and $500 million for the year, as a reminder, net revenues totaled $500 million last year. We also expect a consolidated gross margin rate of 53% to 53.8% compared to 51.4% in the prior year. This year's gross margin rate is expected to be favorably impacted by lower year-over-year freight expense, cost reduction initiatives and the sell-through of previously reserved inventory, but partially offset by an increase in promotional activity. Consolidated SG&A expense is expected to be between $237 million and $243 million compared to $245.3 million last year. The decline in SG&A expense is being driven by our company-wide cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by restoring [indiscernible] long-term incentive compensation to more normalized levels. in addition to incremental marketing investment intended to accelerate customer file growth. This result in anticipated consolidated operating income of $24 million to $28 million compared to $12.3 million last year and a diluted earnings per share of $0.57 to $0.65 compared to $0.24 last year. We also continue to expect net capital spending of approximately $5 million this year versus $8.2 million last year. And this reflects investments associated with new Vera Bradley outlet stores as well as technology and logistics enhancements. As a result, our free cash flow anticipates to be between $40 million and $45 million compared to a cash usage in last year of $21.7 million. So that concludes our formal remarks. I would like to open the call to questions now.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Nick Gomes with NOBLE Capital. Your line is open.\nJoe Gomes: It's Joe Gomes, this morning. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking my questions. So I kind of wanted to start out, last quarter, you mentioned and you also this quarter about programs to drive traffic and increased the average basket size and I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color on some of the types of programs that you're working on and what the early days you're seeing out of those programs and where you think you might see that further in the second half of this year.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Sure. Thanks, Joe for your question. So overall, we were seeing a definite issue with traffic, particularly to our outlet stores earlier in the quarter, and there's a multipronged marketing approach that we've taken that includes paid media in all different ways that we're testing, and -- so that's part of the program. So it's paid media, it's mall takeovers, and it's other opportunities that we have, just nontraditional media forms that we're testing and really taking a very cautious but thorough approach to testing and learning what is driving traffic in which market. So we started out with a fairly small test and expanded it. We've expanded it twice now, and we're continuing to do that very carefully evaluating what programs are working for which markets.\nJoe Gomes: Great. Thanks for that. And also maybe give us a little more color or detail on how the collaborations with Disney, Hello Kitty -- again, I know it's really early days, NFL, are all working out?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Sure. We're very pleased with the results of these collaboration efforts, especially Hello Kitty really resonated with both existing and new customers in the quarter, and NFL initially is that we're very happy with the results there. So it will be -- it continues to be a key part of our strategy now and for the future.\nJoe Gomes: Okay. One last one for me, if I may, and I'll get back in queue. You did talk a little bit about the Pura Vida stores and kind of how you put them under the Vera Bradley retail management now. And I know you had said in the past, you kind of wanted to take a step back and evaluate the stores before committing to opening new stores, it's now been another quarter. Kind of where are you in that process or thinking about opening new Pura Vida stores?\nMichael Schwindle: Hi, Joe. This is Michael. Thanks for the questions. Really good one. Listen, we have been monitoring, especially during the summer season, which is particularly important for the Pura Vida brand. We have been very, very pleased with the stores we have in place. We opened one in Myrtle Beach last year, has done very well as well as the other stores have continued to perform very well. We've seen some nice increases as well. So we're looking at our options now as we round out the summer season and we go into the fall and we start to think about next year, we're looking at our options on that.\nJoe Gomes: Okay. Great. Thanks for that. I’ll get back in queue.\nMichael Schwindle: Thank you.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Thanks.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Eric Beder with SCC Research. Please go ahead.\nEric Beder: Good morning.\nMichael Schwindle: Good morning, Eric.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Good morning, Eric.\nEric Beder: A quick question, you've had a number -- you continue to aggressively reduce the inventory levels. Are we kind of at the normalized level here? And this is how we should be thinking about it going forward or are there other opportunities to continue to reduce the inventory and increase productivity?\nMichael Schwindle: Thanks, Eric. I think as we look at the inventory -- look at the productivity of the inventory, there's a lot of opportunities we still see in our inventory position. But at the same time, we're also thinking about that in context to next year's rollout of new lines in some of our areas. So we're having to take a relatively cautious approach. There's also a little bit of a physicians do no harm kind of perspective, we have to make sure that we don't reduce any inventories in a way that is dysfunctional or harmful in the longer term. So we're being very conservative and judicious about that, but I think we have some opportunities as we look forward.\nEric Beder: When you look at the Vera Bradley stores, one of the things you've implemented is kind of set pricing for a specific silhouette and that's changed a little bit during each month. What's been the response to that piece? I know it's kind of simplified, the shopping experience, and if that's something we're going to see more of maybe potentially in the outlet stores also?\nJacqueline Ardrey: So we've done this both in the full-line and the outlet stores. And we started it with just a style spotlight in the full-line stores, and we've extended it to outlet stores as well. We're definitely monitoring the success. It's really -- of course, it depends on the item and the price point. But the strategy is sound, and you will likely see us continue to use that -- this pricing strategy for the rest of the year.\nEric Beder: And you and your team have been there for less than nine months. How far along do you think the stores and online are to what you would envision it to be and when should we be, as investors and analysts and shoppers, thinking about, hey, this good store completely encompasses what new management thinks. How should we think about that time line?\nJacqueline Ardrey: That’s a great question. So as I remarked earlier today, we do have -- we were able to affect some of the product lines that you'll start to see mostly in full-line, but at a fairly minimal level this fall. So you'll see the introduction of leather, you'll see some more solid, maybe not quite as much in outlet. But you'll see a gradual shift over the next couple of months until mid-next year when really the culmination of all of our efforts and our supply chain time line, catches up to what we ultimately think is our go-forward result of Project Restoration.\nEric Beder: Great. Good luck for the holiday season.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Thanks, Eric.\nOperator: This concludes today's question-and-answer session. We'll now turn the floor to Jackie Ardrey for any additional or closing remarks.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Before I close, I would like to thank all of our associates once again for their collaboration and support of Project Restoration, for being resourceful and innovative and for embracing the mindset of diligent expense management. This year by focusing on stabilizing sales, expanding gross margin and controlling expenses, we believe we can, at a minimum, nearly double year-over-year operating income and more than double EPS. We are excited about the opportunities for both brands. We are also committed to returning both of our brands to profitable growth and generating strong cash flow through Project Restoration. This should deliver value to our shareholders over the long-term. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you on our third quarter call on December 6.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at any time."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be provided at that time for you to queue up for questions. As a reminder, today’s conference call is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the call over to Vera Bradley’s CEO, Jackie Ardrey. Jackie?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Thank you, Mark. Good morning and thank you for joining us on today's call. Today, I'm joined by both John Enwright, our departing CFO and Michael Schwindle, our newly appointed CFO. Before we begin, I want to express my sincere thanks to John for his nine years of service to Vera Bradley and his many contributions to our company and we wish him all the best in the future. And we welcome Michael Schwindle to our team who joined the company on May 8th. He is a retail industry veteran with over 30 years of experience, including more than 15 years in CFO roles, delivering strong results through profit improvement and by providing innovative solutions. For the three years prior to joining our company, he served as CFO for accessory and jewelry retailer Claire's. Previously he held CFO roles at specialty retailers Fleet Farm, Payless Shoe Source, Perry and David, and Musician's Friend as well as other key financial roles at Home Depot and Limited Brands. You'll hear from both John and Michael later in today's call.  Now let me turn to the quarter. We are very pleased that meaningful gross margin expansion and diligent expense control led to a significant year-over-year improvement in bottom line performance for the first quarter. On the revenue side, Vera Bradley factory stores experienced challenging traffic trends in March and April that led to weaker than expected performance for the quarter. This was partially offset however by several positive highlights in other areas of our business.  First, we delivered our first positive quarterly revenue performance in five quarters at Pura Vida, primarily driven by non-comparable retail store sales. We also saw improved year-over-year sales trends in both our Pura Vida wholesale and ecommerce channels. Second, we delivered strong Vera Bradley ecommerce performance and solid Vera Bradley full line store revenues. Vera Bradley indirect revenues declined as expected due to a non-recurring key account order that took place in last year's first quarter, but the underlying business remains healthy. We are building a collaborative team with the mindset of generating long-term revenue increases, expanding gross margin, and ensuring strong financial discipline and cost control, which we expect will drive long-term profitable growth. The team is working hard and taking strategic proactive steps to steadily grow Pura Vida's revenues and to reverse the trends in Vera Bradley's factory channel through the expansion of successfully tested targeted marketing programs designed to drive traffic and average order size.  At Pura Vida, we have a solid organizational structure in place with newly promoted General Manager, Sujay Shah leading the team with heightened discipline and focus on day-to-day execution and driving business results. Sujay was Pura Vida's former VP of Finance and is leading the team to return the ecommerce business to growth through utilization of the newly launched comprehensive customer data platform, diversification of the marketing program, improving site navigation, and focusing on customer retention.  On the product front, our custom bracelet program and new friendship packs are a big focus and are working and we will continue to pursue high profile collaborations like Sanrio, Harper Charms and Crumbl Cookies that are always fan favorites. The hard work on project restoration began in the first quarter, which is focused on four key pillars of the business for each brand, consumer, brand, product, and channel to drive the long term profitable growth we expect. To support project restoration and lay the foundation for our success, we made additional corporate changes and announced incremental cost reductions including the elimination of approximately 25 corporate positions as part of an overall plan to further right size the expense structure of the company.  Of course, Michael Schwindel's track record of driving profitable growth along with his passion for retail and operational excellence will be instrumental as the company executes project restoration. We also made several organizational changes in the marketing, ecommerce, product design, and product development areas that flattened and streamlined the organizational structure to improve execution, make faster decisions, and provide support for the four pillars of project restoration. These most recent organizational changes and non-payroll expense reductions are expected to produce annualized savings of approximately $12 million on top of our fiscal 2023 cost reductions.  Let me give you a bit more detail on project restorations four key pillars and some of the initiatives we currently have underway. At Vera Bradley for the consumer we will focus on restoring brand relevancy, targeting casual and feminine 35 to 54-year-old women who value both fashion and function. For the brand, we will strategically market our distinctive and unique position as a feminine fashionable brand that connects with consumers on a deep emotional level. For product, we will refocus on core categories and items we are best at by innovating and expanding within our core products like travel and back to campus. We will elevate our colorful feminine heritage, keeping it distinctive but more trend relevant through updated print and design.  We will also innovate into strategic adjacent lifestyle item introductions that make sense for our customers. As part of this, travel and travel accessories perform strongly across all channels in the first quarter and the travel category will continue to be a key focus of our go forward assortment. Additionally, our performance fabrics are trending well across all channels with a core customer being younger with a higher household income, this remains a big opportunity for us. Patterns will always be our signature, but coordinating solids continue to be a key opportunity for us as well. We will expand our solid collection this fall, including our foray back into a small collection of leather goods.  Finally, product collaborations are still an important part of our brand expression. Our Winnie the Pooh capsule was a huge success. Our first Hello Kitty collaboration was just launched this month and our NFL collection will be launched in August, just in time for football season. And then finally for channel, we will accelerate our digital first focus and online presence, build a balanced footprint that more clearly differentiates full line from factory stores, and target and or strengthen relationships with strategically aligned wholesale partners. As part of this, our recent site rebranding and navigation changes have been successful in reducing bounce rate and driving conversion and sales.  So turning to Pura Vida, for the consumer we will sharpen our focus on the carefree 18 to 24 year old girl who both those younger and older aspire to be. For the brand, we will re-center our brand ethos on living life to the fullest with marketing authentically, sharing real moments, places and faces. Our Live Free campaign launched this month will accentuate travel, adventure, friendship, and freedom, and will create engagement and excitement in our customer base for the entire summer.  For product, we will focus on delivering unique, fun, playful designs that are affordable and accessible with a dominant emphasis on bracelets and jewelry as well as other strategic adjacent categories. Some great examples of this are our new summer collection and our Harper Charms collection, which are both resonating with our customers. And then finally for channel, we will have a strong focus on restoring ecommerce growth, which I just talked about and growth of wholesale by pursuing larger, more strategic partnerships and expanding larger existing accounts and refining our existing store model. Now let me turn the call over to John to review the financial results. John.\nJohn Enwright: Thanks, Jackie and good morning. Let me go over a few highlights for the first quarter. The numbers I will discuss today are all non-GAAP and exclude the charges outlined in today's release. For a complete detail of items excluded from the non-GAAP numbers as well as a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP numbers, please reference today's press release. Consolidated net revenues totaled 94.4 million compared to 98.5 million in the prior year first quarter. The consolidated net loss totaled 2.6 million or $0.09 per diluted share compared to 6 million or $0.18 per diluted share last year. Vera Bradley direct segment revenues totaled to 58.9 million, a 4.4% decrease from 61.6 million in the prior year. Comparable sales declined 3.3%, primarily due to weakness in the factory channel Jackie noted earlier.  Vera Bradley indirect segment revenues totaled 15.4 million, a 9.4% decrease from 17 million last year. Prior year revenues reflected a large one-time key account order that was not repeated this year. Pura Vida segment revenues totaled 20.1 million, a 1.2% increase over 19.8 million in the prior year first quarter, primarily driven by non-comparable retail store sales. First quarter gross margin totaled 51.7 million or 54.8% of net revenues compared to 52.5 million or 53.3% of net revenues in the prior year. The current year gross margin rate was favorably impacted by lower year-over-year inbound and outbound freight expense, and the sell through of previously reserved inventory partially offset by an increase in promotional activity. SG&A expenses totaled 55.6 million or 58.9% of net revenues compared to 59.4 million or 60.3% of net revenues in the prior year. Current year expenses were lower than the prior year, primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and the reduction in variable related expenses related to lower sales volumes. The company's first quarter consolidated offering loss totaled 3.5 million or 3.7% of net revenues compared to 6.7 million or 6.8% of net revenues in the prior year.  Now let's turn to the balance sheet. Quarter end cash and cash equivalents totaled 25.3 million compared to 46.6 million at fiscal year-end with no borrowings on our 75 million credit facility at quarter end. Total quarter end inventory was 142.7 million compared to 161.8 million at the end of the first quarter last year. During the quarter, we purchased 128,100 shares at an average price of $5.71 per share for an aggregate amount of approximately $732,000. $27 million remains under the $50 million repurchase authorization that expires in December 2024. Now let me turn the call over to Michael to talk about the company's fiscal 2024 outlook.\nMichael Schwindle: Thanks, John and good morning everyone. Based on the first quarter performance, as both Jackie and John have discussed as well as our initiatives underway and the macro environment trends and expectations, we are revising our guidance for this fiscal year. As a result, all of our forward looking guidance or as a reminder, rather, all of our forward looking guidance is on a non-GAAP basis. Fiscal 2024 our updated guidance is as follows. We expect total revenues of $490 million to $510 million. As a reminder revenues totaled 500 million in fiscal 2023, and we expect both Vera Bradley and Pura Vida revenues to be approximately flat on a year-over-year basis. We also expect gross margin rates of between 52.8% and 53.8%, which compares to 51.4% for last year. Our fiscal 2024 gross margin rate is expected to be favorably impacted by lower year-over-year freight expenses, cost reduction initiatives, and the sell through of previously reserved inventory, which will be partially offset by an increase in promotional activity. Our SG&A expenses are expected to be between 237 million and 247 million compared to 245.3 million last year. The expected year-over-year decline in SG&A expense is being driven by company-wide cost reduction initiatives partially offset by restoring incentive compensation to more normalized levels and incremental marketing investment intended to accelerate customer file growth. This results in anticipated consolidated operating income of 24 million to 28 million compared to 12.3 million last year and diluted EPS of $0.57 to $0.67 based on diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 30.7 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 28%. Our diluted EPS totaled $0.24 last year.  We also expect net capital spending of approximately $5 million compared to $8.2 million last year, which reflects investments associated with new Vera Bradley factory stores, as well as technology and logistics enhancements. And as a result our free cash flow is anticipated to be between $35 million and $40 million compared to a cash usage of 21.7 million in fiscal 2023. So with that operator, we'd like to open up the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question today comes from Joe Gomes with Noble Capital.\nJoe Gomes: Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.\nMichael Schwindle: Hey Joe.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Good morning Joe. \nJohn Enwright: Good morning.\nJoe Gomes: So I wanted to start off, you talked about some lower traffic levels at Vera Bradley, I think in March and April. Maybe you could give us a little more color or detail as to what was behind that?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Sure, Joe. So, first I want to say that the traffic challenges were limited really to the factory channel and they were primarily in March. I think where we are seeing some other retailers report similar slowdowns and what we've done in the quarter is really look at some marketing programs to drive more traffic to those factory stores. And that's part of the reinvestment that we're going to make for the rest of the year as really we had some successful test results from some of those programs to help increase in targeted markets. And we're going to continue to deploy those programs. So -- but again, it was really just limited to the factory channel. Our, full line traffic was strong throughout the quarter.\nJohn Enwright: And Joe, all I would add on to that, and I think Jackie did a good job, is to say that to the point was March was really kind of the toughest month in the quarter and we saw it rebound a little. It's still down in April, but we saw it rebound in April better than March, and then in May we've seen kind of that continued progression, so.\nJoe Gomes: Okay. And, I don't know, maybe if you talked about this before or not, maybe you can give us a little bit size as to what that non-recurring account order last year was, just so we can kind of get a better idea of the year-over-year X that performance?\nJohn Enwright: Yeah, so indirect would've been down about 2%, excluding that one-time sale last year for the key account order. So it was a little bit over $1 million.\nJoe Gomes: Okay, great. And then one more if I may and I'll pass it along, Michael, congrats on joining the team. You've been there now a little over a month, early days, kind of maybe give us your first impressions and what are you kind of laying out as what your initial short-term goals would be here? Thank you.\nMichael Schwindle: Oh hey, thank you, Joe. Appreciate the question. Hey, with my days and days of experience as Jackie and others have heard me say, so this is a tremendous brand. It's got a great solid foundation here, great customer base, great brand recognition that gives a tremendous foundation from which to build upon. And so I -- Jackie and I've talked a lot about that, I'm very excited about that. Obviously initially there's a lot to learn here around all the different channels of the business as well as with the Pura Vida brand. And so, I'm a bit vertical on the learning curve as you might imagine, as I'm trying to digest and under understand all of that. In the meantime, I've already been engaged pretty deeply in a lot of the cost initiatives that Jackie referred to earlier, making sure that we've got good controls around that and making sure we have good visibility to delivering those initiatives as well as gathering additional understanding of the different areas of the business. I think one of the advantages I have been around lots of different retail organizations. I've had a lot of different operational experiences over my 35 years, and that makes it a little bit faster kind of running start for me to jump into different areas of operations and other things to kind of have a solid foundation at the onset and then look for the opportunities in the business. \nJoe Gomes: Great. Thanks for that. I look forward to working with you going into the future. Thanks for taking the questions again.\nMichael Schwindle: I do as well. Thank you.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Thanks, Joe.\nJohn Enwright: Thanks Joe.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our next question will come from Eric Beder with SCC Research.\nEric Beder: Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter.\nJohn Enwright: Thanks, Eric. \nJacqueline Ardrey: Thanks Eric. \nEric Beder: Okay. How should we be -- I know that you have this new management team join, it's a little bit tough in the near term to really change the product mix and flows. Obviously you've done a great job in controlling what you can control on the expense side. Now when should we be thinking that we'll see like what you Jackie or team envision the stores to fully be, is that back half of this year or is that really into next year?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Yeah, that's a great question, Eric and as you said, it's tough to change a product trajectory quickly. But I think the team has done a great job of really getting in and dissecting what's working and what's not working, especially as it relates to our future customer target. So we have -- one of the things we learned that I talked about today is just the balance of solids and prints in our assortment and looking at the fabrics that we currently offer, who they attract in terms of a customer level and a price point level. So you'll definitely see some product mix changes at the back half of the year and then it will steadily increase as we get closer to the middle of next year.\nEric Beder: Okay, that makes sense. How should we be thinking about stores, I mean, obviously the Pura Vida store openings that happened last year helped, historically been closing full price stores, opening outlets, what should we be thinking about this year and I guess longer term?\nJacqueline Ardrey: Yeah, it's another great question, Eric, and I have to say that we are deep in that work that's part of the channel pillar of our project restoration for both brands. Our Pura Vida stores are working pretty well so it -- but it is really about right now pausing to be sure that we can deliver the right strategic plan for the business. So that's the only reason that we haven't continued opening Pura Vida stores. But I think you'll hear more from us by the end of the year about our plans for stores. But, it's just really important that, again, right now we're focusing on the health of the overall portfolio and making sure that we're making the right strategic decisions for store openings for both brands.\nEric Beder: Sure. And last question for you, what should we be thinking about and how, in terms of inventory flows obviously Q1, you brought the inventories down significantly, is there opportunities to continue that throughout the rest of the year? Thank you.\nMichael Schwindle: Hey, Eric this is Michael, I'll jump in on that and Jackie can add some more color. As you noted, we have seen some pretty good reductions on a year-over-year basis. It's roughly flat with the end of the year. We do expect to continue to see a downward trajectory in our overall inventory through the end of the year or something in the probably down 10 ish, maybe a little bit more than 10 ish percent by the time we get to the end of the year.\nJacqueline Ardrey: And just a little color on that, we've been -- the company has been engaged in an exercise around SKU reduction. It's called the SOAR project and that has really contributed to kind of cutting off the tail of some of our unproductive inventory. And that's really contributing to some of the declines that you've seen. We're continuing that work and really I think you'll see the continued evidence as Michael mentioned within the rest of the year of those reductions.\nEric Beder: Great. Good luck for the rest of the year. Thank you.\nJohn Enwright: Thanks, Eric. \nMichael Schwindle: Thank you Eric. \nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude the question-and-answer session and I'll turn the conference back over to Jackie Ardrey for closing remarks.\nJacqueline Ardrey: Thank you. In closing, we're committed to returning both of our brands to healthy top and bottom line growth and generating strong cash flow through project restoration, which I believe will deliver value to our shareholders over the long-term. This year by focusing on stabilizing sales, expanding gross margin, and controlling expenses, we believe we can at a minimum nearly double year-over-year operating income and more than double EPS. We have an exciting future ahead. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to sharing our progress with you on our second quarter call on August 30th.\nOperator: Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. Have an excellent day."
