I will now turn the line over to Ilan Daskal, Viavi Solutions’ CFO. Please go ahead.\nIlan Daskal: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Viavi Solutions' second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. My name is Ilan Daskal, Viavi Solutions’ CFO. And with me on today's call is Oleg Khaykin, our President and CEO.  Please note this call will include forward-looking statements about the company's financial performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations and estimations. We encourage you to review our most recent annual report and SEC filings, particularly the risk factors described in those filings. The forward-looking statements, including guidance that we provide during this call, are valid only as of today. Viavi undertakes no obligation to update these statements. Please also note that unless we state otherwise, all results discussed on this call except revenue are non-GAAP. We reconcile these non-GAAP results to our preliminary GAAP financials and discuss their usefulness and limitations in today's earnings release. The release as well as our supplemental earnings slides, which include historical financial tables, are available on Viavi’s website at www.investor.viavisolutions.com. Finally, we are recording today's call and will make the recording available on our Web site by 4:30 p.m. Pacific Time this evening. Now I would like to review the results of the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Net revenue for the quarter was $254.5 million, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range of $240 million to $260 million. Revenue was up sequentially by 2.7% and on a year-over-year basis was down 10.5%. Operating margin for the second fiscal quarter was 13.2% and exceeded the high end of our guidance range of 9.6% to 12.8%. Operating margin increased 80 basis points from the prior quarter and on a year-over-year basis was down 300 basis points. EPS at $0.11 exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $0.06 to $0.10 and was up $0.02 sequentially, and on a year-over-year basis was down $0.03. Moving on to our Q2 results by business segment. NSC revenue for the second fiscal quarter came in at $179.6 million, which is above the midpoint of our guidance range of $169 million to $185 million. On a year-over-year basis, revenue was down 13.3%, primarily due to lower CapEx spent by NEMs and weaker spend by service providers. NE revenue for the quarter was $155.5 million, which is a 15.2% year-over-year decline. SE revenue was $24.1 million and grew 1.3% from the same period last year. NSC gross margin for the quarter was 63.4%, which is 100 basis points lower on a year-over-year basis. NE gross margin was 62.5%, which is a decrease of 190 basis points from the same period last year, and was primarily due to a combination of product mix and lower volume. SE gross margin was 68.9%, which is an increase of 460 basis points from the same period last year and benefited from higher margin product mix. NSC’s operating margin was 3.6%, which is an increase of 270 basis points sequentially and the decrease of 530 basis points on a year-over-year basis. NSC operating margin was above the midpoint of our guidance range of 0% to 4%. OSP revenue for the second fiscal quarter came in at $74.9 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range of $71 million to $75 million and was down 3.2% on a year-over-year basis. OSP gross margin was 52.1%, which is a decrease of 20 basis points from the same period last year, and was primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable product mix. OSP operating margin was 36.4%, which is 140 basis points lower sequentially and increased 90 basis points on a year-over-year basis. OSP operating margin exceeded the high end of our guidance range of 32.5% to 34.5%. Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Total cash and short term investments at the end of Q2 was $571.8 million compared to $489.7 million in the same period last year. Cash flow from operating activities for the quarter was $20.4 million versus $46.2 million in the same period last year. We have not purchased any shares of our stock in the second quarter as we plan to retire the outstanding balance of our March 2024 convertible notes in the amount of $96.4 million. The fully diluted share count for the quarter was 223.5 million shares, down from 227.1 million shares in the prior quarter and was -- versus 222 million shares in our guidance for the second quarter. CapEx for the quarter was $5.8 million, which is $12.3 million lower versus the same period last year when we were completing the construction of our new facility in Chandler. Moving on to our guidance. For the third fiscal quarter of 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $245 million and $253 million. Operating margin is expected to be 10.4% plus or minus 160 basis points and EPS to be between $0.05 and $0.09. We expect NSE revenue to be approximately $176 million plus or minus $3 million with an operating margin of 1.5% plus or minus 150 basis points. OSP revenue is expected to be approximately $73 million plus or minus $1 million with an operating margin of 31.8% plus or minus 200 basis points. Our tax expenses for the third quarter are expected to be around $8 million as a result of jurisdictional mix. We expect other income and expenses to reflect a net expense of approximately $3 million. And the share count is expected to be around 224.7 million shares. With that, I will turn the call over to Oleg. Oleg?\nOleg Khaykin: Thank you, Ilan, and welcome to your first earnings call with Viavi. The fiscal second quarter 2024 came in stronger than expected. Revenue was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, helped by stronger demand for 400 gig and 800 gig fiber, middle ARO and SE products. EPS came in above the high end of our guidance, driven by richer margin revenue mix and lower OpEx. In the near term, we expect stronger demand in the above product areas to help offset continued weakness in the service provider spend. Starting with NSC, the second fiscal quarter NSC revenue came in above the midpoint of our guidance range. Although, the NSC revenue declined on year-over-year basis, driven by a slowdown in 5G and fiber build outs by major service providers, there was a number of bright spots. Fiber 11 production has continued to recover, driven by strong 800 gig demand, offsetting weakness in computing and storage. Aerospace and defense products saw robust growth driven by strong demand for avionics and PNT or positioning navigation and timing products. And the new SE products continue to perform well, resulting in a slight year-over-year growth despite the decline in service provider spend. Looking ahead, we expect continued demand recovery and growth in our Fiber 11 production, aerospace and defense and SE products, compensating for the continued near term weakness in the service provider spend. Now turning to OSP. OSP declined on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by lower demand for anti-counterfeiting products. This decline was partially offset by strong 3D sensing demand. Overall, OSP results came in at higher end of our guidance range. In the March quarter, we expect OSP to be slightly down from the December quarter with a stronger demand for anti-counterfeiting products offsetting the seasonal decline in 3D sensing. Looking ahead to calendar ‘24, we expect telecom service provider spend to continue to be soft with a notable exception of the North American cable operators. We expect cable spend to ramp in the middle or second half of calendar year 2024. That said, our strategy in the past six years to diversify outside the service providers into 11 production and aerospace and defense makes it easier to ride out the telecom cycle downturn. 11 production spend is seeing a faster recovery versus service providers, driven by the demand for the new technologies such as 800 gig and Open RAN. Recently Viavi was awarded a $21.7 million grant by NTIA to create an advanced test lab to empower and accelerate the development of Open RAN technologies and components. This award reflects Viavi’s technology leadership in 5G, upcoming 6G and ORAN. Our aerospace and defense products are seeing strong demand and growth, driven by the next gen avionics and the need to protect critical infrastructure and assets against jamming, spoofing and cyber warfare. In conclusion, I'd like to thank my Viavi team for managing in this challenging environment and express my appreciation to our employees, customers and shareholders for their support. With that, I will now turn back to the operator and Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Michael Genovese from Rosenblatt.\nMichael Genovese: Oleg, first question is just on the service provider market, just to understand, make sure I heard the comments right. It sounds like you're saying all of ‘24 calendar expects to be weak there, cable getting better at the end of the year. First of all, did I hear that right? And secondly did your expectations change in the last three months, has the carrier stuff, telecom stuff gotten more pushed out or was that consistent with three months ago?\nOleg Khaykin: So let me just say, look, the reality is I don't know what the second half is going to look like from service providers. We know the demand will be somewhat stronger in the June quarter. It's always stronger. Beyond that, I just think -- I mean, clearly, it's not getting any worse, it's getting a little better. But I would still prefer to think of it as a flat to slightly recovering as the kind of modus operandi, because I think they're still pretty weak. But the point is we are seeing -- it's coming in but it's not as dramatic as I would've liked to see. Now the area that is stronger is the cable. In fact, we were expecting cable to start spending and coming in, in the first half of calendar year. But as you probably know, there were some delays, driven by technology readiness in deploying the DAA architecture by some of the vendors, and aside to the ramp is being pushed by one or two quarters. So we know it's coming, we're already seeing some orders. But the spike that we were expecting in the March quarter got pushed out, that's why we are guiding March quarter flat to slightly down. It was going to be slightly up in the absence of that slow down. I mean, let's put it this way, I feel a lot better about the environment in which we are operating than we were even a quarter or two quarters ago. I just don't want to get ahead of our skis on service provider recovery, because when I see it, I'll believe it. I mean -- so I think they still got a lot of balance sheet issues they need to address before they really start spending significantly. So just take it as abundance of caution. I mean, do I feel better about what's going on? The answer is yes. Am I seeing big dollars coming in? The answer is no. And now one thing what we did see interesting is we are seeing pretty good traction on our service enablement products with the new architecture AI op, which drive OpEx reduction and things -- capital avoidance. So there we are seeing a pretty good traction. But on the instrumentation, particularly with fiber deployment, I think there is a pause that may at least last six months. Maybe towards the second half of the year, things will get better. But at this point, I think my crystal ball is telling me I'm not seeing anything dramatic changing.\nMichael Genovese: Next question. This 800G fiber lab in production sounds very interesting, and I think you've probably had either two or three quarters of sort of measurable revenues there. So I assume that that is increasing, and any color you can give us on that? And not sure whether you would answer this question. But sort of how much of any that represents either now or what it could be in the future would be very helpful?\nOleg Khaykin: So I mean, our 11 production business, I would say on any -- let's see, if I think about the -- we have a network enablement and the SE, so network enablement is about 87%. I'd say our 11 production is, I think -- but it also includes wireless, it's about 40%. And of that, I'd say fiber lab and kind of high performance computing is roughly half of that. So maybe 20%. Now with the storage building slowdown, we saw the computing and storage was weaker. I mean, all of that business really kind of bottomed out around the June quarter. But what's really been driving the recovery of that business is the fiber production and the fiber lab demand, and it is driven by 400 and 800 gig products. So I think -- so what I'd say is it's now -- it's a recovered. First of all, it's recovered and continue to grow. I think the same players who are building telecom modules are now more recently, these AI enter data center modules are buying the equipment. I've been trying to ascertain like for so many million ports how much equipment is being bought. I think we're probably not there in terms of truly understanding how the cap expand is linked to that, because it's still early in the game. But exactly same equipment that they use on the coherent telecom module line, they're using it also on building the data center modules for the AI applications.\nMichael Genovese: Yes, sounds like going forward that'll be interesting to figure that out, that relationship, I can't wait to get an update on that. Last question for me, sorry to take so much time. But I'd like to ask a broader question, which is, can you just help me understand -- because the revenues were pretty good for the quarter, the earnings were good, the revenue guidance is good. I'm just still not seeing the reason why the EPS guidance is lower. So could you explain that to me?\nIlan Daskal: So as you know third fiscal quarter from a seasonality perspective is usually kind of slower than the second quarter. So if you think about it on a consecutive basis, then also when you have kind of the beginning of the calendar year, there's some incremental cost associated with employee related and that kind of drives kind of in terms of the OpEx. But again, as Oleg mentioned earlier, the traditional seasonality, when you think about it, is kind of building up really nicely when you think about the rest of the year, including the fourth quarter.\nOleg Khaykin: So there's a lot of statutory cost accrual that happens in the first quarter of the calendar year. And on the OSP, you notice there's a lower margin because it's cyclicality of a 3D sensing. The second half of a fiscal year is a much lower utilization, so there is more underabsorption in that respect. Now that said, the anti-counterfeiting is coming back, so it's offset some of it but not all of it. And last quarter, the 3D sensing was quite strong.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tim Savageaux from Northland Capital.\nTim Savageaux: Oleg, can you remind us of your lead times in service provider fiber test?\nOleg Khaykin: Generally, if we get an order, I'd say within two months, we can turn it around. So it's all within a quarter, more or less. Now except for some things like, if it's a -- some products are very quick, like for example, fiber scope and things like that. Other products, like where you are buying a whole bench where you have MEMS, switches and things like that, if we have them in inventory, we can turn it around within, I'd say, two to three months.\nTim Savageaux: And where would you assess your service provider customer inventories to be with your product?\nOleg Khaykin: Zero. I mean, it's all just in time.\nTim Savageaux: And I guess the reason I ask it is that throughout the early part of reports here from both some of your bigger peers, Corning, Nokia, as well as some of the bigger service providers, we have seen some early indications of project based kind of increases in plans for ‘24. And I'm just trying to reconcile what's been a pretty consistent drum beat here with what we're hearing from you. And I think there could be -- typically, you lead these things. But I don't know, might you lag at this point because of the lead times, I wonder? And are you seeing some of the same things?\nOleg Khaykin: No, I don't think so. I don't think we're looking and once they decide. So when they tell these guys they're going to do a project, they may tell it to them before they tell us, because once they're ready to start building, they just place an order and within two months they get their equipment. It's pretty quick.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Alex Henderson from Needham & Company.\nAlex Henderson: Could you give us a little bit more granularity on the size of the 3D sensing in the quarter and the expectations for the 3D sensing in the March quarter?\nOleg Khaykin: So generally, Alex, 3D sensing, half of the annual demand comes in in the September and December quarter -- two thirds comes in in the September and December quarter, and one third comes in the March and the June quarter. So I would say we ran right around $20 million, $25 million in the quarter.\nAlex Henderson: And so in the upcoming quarter, you're looking at what $10 million or so?\nOleg Khaykin: This quarter, I think maybe a little more than $10 million, but let me see. Yes, it's about it -- it is around -- it's $10 million plus minus $1.5 million.\nAlex Henderson: And can you give us an update on the plant in Phoenix? It's now fully operational. All of the benefits of the cost improvement are in the mechanics of the counterfeiting business at this point. Is that correct?\nOleg Khaykin: So what we are seeing now -- so that's when you know where people are running out of inventory. So you start seeing a lot of unforecasted spot orders popping up, like hurry up and ship as soon as you can. So we are starting to see more and more of these type of things popping up. They're not big orders but it's telling us the inventory is starting to deplete itself in the channel. So in the March quarter, we are expecting a little bit stronger demand from what we were thinking maybe even three months ago. So that's actually helping us to offset some of the 3D sensing decline quarter-on-quarter.\nIlan Daskal: Generally, it's fully operational and we still have more capacity for additional growth there. So it's not in terms of full utilization, it's not yet there in terms of the availability that we can get.\nAlex Henderson: Fully operational but not fully -- not full capacity…\nOleg Khaykin: Alex, let me give you a correction. Actually, 3D sensing is going to be closer about $16 million in this quarter. I was thinking the end of year.\nAlex Henderson: So going back to this split on the 800 gig product, just to be clear. So the ratio of ports to equipment is quite low, right? I mean, we're talking about double digit port per kind of ratio there. I assume that this is predominantly going into the production side of it. It's not going into the field deployment. And you're talking about how many products can go through a test and measurement process in any given period, but that's a sampling process. So the ratio is very high relative to the total number of ports that go across that equipment, right?\nOleg Khaykin: I mean -- and it varies. So when you start production you tend to do a lot more tests. So you have a lower number of ports per, let's say, a million dollars of equipment. As you get with experience curve, you start -- and you feel comfortable, you start de-contenting the test, so you spend less time on a tester. So yes, the equipment predominantly goes into the production line. I mean, you have all these factories in China and other places that are building these modules. So when they start, they generally use more intensive testing. And then as they get more comfortable, they start reducing and doing more of a sample testing or less extensive testing per module. So that's why it's continuously moving target. So I mean, in one case we've kind of did a one project and we have gauged, it came out to about $0.40 per module of CapEx, per module of capacity. So if you're doing a port, you need about $0.40 investment per port on the capacity line. So you build, let's say, 1.5 million units a week line so you probably -- I mean, I think it works out to about $0.40, about $300,000 for that capacity that you got to invest. But it's only one data point and other people do it differently so they spend more. So it's still very early to tell.\nAlex Henderson: So we've already seen very significant ramp in productions of both the NVLink and InfiniBand products going into the AI clusters. And from what I can tell, you really haven't seen any meaningful contribution from that at this point. So should we then think that as we move into the second and third phase of production ramping that the sampling rates actually go up and therefore, we shouldn't be looking at the rate of growth in AI as the primary driver of the overall demand curve as opposed to the sampling percentage?\nOleg Khaykin: Well, I wouldn't go that far, because remember what the first thing they did is they redeployed the same lines that were building telecom coherent business that dropped quite significantly. So they redeployed those assets to the AI data centers. And just when you also think about it, if you're just doing alignment on like, say InfiniBand, you're putting photonic integrated circuit aligning with the processor that is really more semiconductor packaging. When you are actually building the actual module with lasers and everything else, that's where you tend to use more of our optical test equipment.\nAlex Henderson: Just going back to the telecom piece for a second. There's obviously a very large inventory glut out there of telecom equipment that has to be absorbed. Has there been any build in inventory in your product areas or is that just something that didn't happen because they weren't constrained as much on those type of products?\nOleg Khaykin: So we have no inventory in the channel. I mean, pretty much the orders kind of got turned off, I'd say, December quarter of calendar 2022. So if anything, a lot of the inventory in the field is getting long in the tooth, and we know that there is a lot of wear and tear and there needs to be a replacement coming up. So we actually are already seeing signs that people saying, hey, I will need to replace, I mean, what would be the terms, what would be the lead times. So in that respect, people will kind of sweat the assets, they will swap the assets, they will cannibalize and then they'll have to do a wholesaler replacement. So when I say kind of flattish 2024 or like -- I just think -- I just don't think -- I know they need to do it, I just don't know if they can afford a massive replacement. But there could be a good chance that in the second half we'll see more and more of these type of things popping up. But I don't have that kind of visibility beyond six months.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Oleg, you mentioned kind of you were more encouraged about cable spending kind of earlier in the year. Just wanted to get a sense is that DOCSIS 4.0, is that just their networks are running hotter, just given some of the comments you just said to Alex? Just kind of what is the trigger to that investment? And then on the flip side, since you kind of think that wireless may take a little bit longer, just what do you think should be kind of the early signs of wireless resuming?\nOleg Khaykin: So if I look at -- so cable, first, I think, we know it is going to be happening. It was actually we were expecting some of the orders start popping up in the March quarter and then accelerating into June. From what we've heard, and I'm not going to name any names, but there's been a delay in some of the core technology development by leading infrastructure providers. So I think that is being pushed by one to two quarters in terms of getting the software ready and everything needs to be working. So I think that's where we are with cable. But I do see actually cable happening this year. What was your second part of your question?\nMeta Marshall: Just on the wireless side.\nOleg Khaykin: So the wireless, we all know, you've seen the Ericsson, Nokia, Samsung, and all the deployments with T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T. So that has slowed down. So the area where we are seeing less is on kind of the field equipment and a lot of the people sales related to deployment. Where we continue to see CapEx being spent is on product development. So we have not seen significant decline in the R&D CapEx for 5G, and now we seeing some of the elements of 6G popping up. It’s just, generally, I think the wireless infrastructure is a bit more muted in terms of aggressiveness, I would say, in Europe and North America. Now that said, India is doing pretty well. But it's obviously -- I wish the margins were better in India, but I think, clearly demand is -- right now, India is one of the few bright spots for infrastructure deployment.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line Ruben Roy from Stifel.\nRuben Roy: Oleg, I just had a couple of quick questions, really follow-ups. I think you talked about a little bit of this in answers to the prior questions, but just in terms of service provider. It sounded to me like you're saying that you are having conversations, right? So last quarter, I think, you've talked about not seeing any de-commits. I would imagine that that's still the case. But also -- and some of the service providers still figuring out their budgets for this year. Is that giving you a little bit of, I wouldn't call it hope, but sort of visibility I guess into thinking that you can still turn out to what should be sort of a normal seasonal year, meaning June up and then September a little bit down like usual. Is that driving that or any other detail in those conversations?\nOleg Khaykin: So I think this year, I mean, I don't want to jump too far ahead. But actually September may actually be stronger this year than normal because the cable is maybe happening in September as it gets pushed, right? But generally, I'd say what we see from service providers, there's a very healthy insurance business, things go bad and just replacements and things like that. What generally drives like another, like I'd say 20% more, which makes a big difference, is whenever they're doing build outs or upgrades to their networks. And right now what I don't see -- I mean, at least this time in terms of the insurance business, it's like orders coming in and they get released and there's no problem. So the ongoing business is going pretty well. People maintaining their network, they're just keeping things running. What I'm not seeing yet is people doing big step functions and expanding capacity or upgrading the network or extending the network. Some of these projects are a little bit more -- I mean, we know they are being planned, I know there's plans for that. I just don't know when they're going to decide to pull the ripcord and launch it. And I just -- kind of looking at the general environment in the telecom sector, I think, they prefer -- if every quarter they don't do it, they just bank more cash and retire more debt. So I think if I were kind of just looking at from competitive approach as cable guys start upgrading their networks, I think some of the service providers will see need to get back to extending their networks. So I think I just don't -- I don't want to be a killjoy, but I just don't see cash burning hole in service provider's pocket that they need to go and start digging and laying new fiber or aggressively starting deployment. The area where we do see fairly good momentum, but it's on a much smaller, like an order of magnitude, smaller scale, are these tier two, tier three primarily private equity funded fiber operators who are laying fiber in anticipation of data centers coming to the area or service providers extending 5G networks to the area or they finally needing a fiber to extend their network into some of these rural communities. So that is one piece that is ongoing. But it's an order of magnitude smaller amount of volume than somebody like AT&T, Verizon or British Telecom or Deutche Telecom would spend on an annualized basis.\nRuben Roy: And then just a quick follow up for Ilan. I might have missed this on the balance sheet discussion. Are you where you need to be then on leveraging and do you expect to come back into the markets to repurchase in the near term? I might have missed that.\nIlan Daskal: So probably for the next quarter or two, we'll be focused more obviously on the retiring of the convert. And you know it continues -- the overall, continues to be part of our capital allocation model, right? I mean, we are not deviating from the overall strategy. But probably on the buyback for the next one to two quarters we'll be more muted about it.\nOleg Khaykin: Just decided to bank some cash, so we can retire the whole convert. In the way it's a synthetic share buyback, because you are avoiding a dilution down the road.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Ilan Daskal for some final closing remarks.\nIlan Daskal: Great. Thank you. Operator. Please concludes our earnings call for today. And thank you everyone, for joining today's call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

I will now turn the line over to Pam Avent, Viavi Solutions Interim CFO. Please go ahead.\nPam Avent: Thank you, Alexis. Welcome to Viavi Solutions' First Quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call. My name is Pam Avent, Viavi Solutions Interim CFO. Also joining me on today's call is Oleg Khaykin, our President and CEO. Please note this call will include forward-looking statements about the company's financial performance. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations and estimations. We encourage you to review our most recent annual report and SEC filings, particularly the risk factors described in those filings. The forward-looking statements, including guidance we provide during this call, are valid only as of today. Viavi undertakes no obligation to update these statements. Please also note that, unless we state otherwise, all results except revenue are non-GAAP. We reconcile these non-GAAP results to our preliminary GAAP financials and discuss their usefulness and limitations in today's earnings release. The release plus our supplemental earnings slides, which include historical financial tables, are available on Viavi Solutions's website at www.investor.viavisolutions.com. Finally, we are recording today's call and will make the recording available by 4:30 p.m. Pacific Time this evening on our website. Let's start with our quarterly financial results. Fiscal Q1 revenue came in at $247.9 million, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range $240 million to $260 million. Revenue was down sequentially 6% and down 20.1% on a year-over-year basis. Operating profit margin of 12.4% was slightly below our guidance range of 12.7% to 14.2%, up by 70 basis points from the prior quarter, and down 930 basis points from the prior year. EPS at $0.09 met the low end of our guidance range of $0.09 to $0.11, down $0.01 sequentially and down $0.14 year over year. The current fully diluted share count was 224.2 million shares during the quarter, down from 230.4 million shares in the prior year. Cash flow from operations for our first quarter was $50.3 million versus $26.6 million a year ago. Now moving to our quarterly results, by business segment for Q1. Starting with NSE. NSE revenue came in at $170.4 million, above the low end of our guidance range of $167 million to $183 million, and down 22.2% year-over-year, primarily as a result of weaker spend in the service provider market. NE revenue at $150 million declined 23.7% year-over-year. SE revenue at $20.4 million declined 8.9% from last year. NSE gross profit margin at 63.6% increased a 150 basis points sequentially, and decreased by 110 basis points year-over-year. Within NSE, NE gross profit margin at 63.1% decreased 140 basis points from the prior year, primarily due to a combination of lower volume and product mix. SE gross profit margin at 67.2% increased 110 basis points from last year, driven by richer product mix. NSE's operating profit margin at 0.9% came in below our guidance range of 3% to 5%, as a result of lower volumes and less favorable product mix. Now turning to OSP. Driven by higher demand for the anti-counterfeiting and 3D sensing products, first quarter revenue came in at $77.5 million, slightly above the high end of our guidance range of $73 million to $77 million, and was down 15.1% year-over-year. Gross profit margin at 52.5% decline 420 basis points year-over-year. Operating margin at 37.8% also exceeded the high-end of our guidance range and declined 450 basis points year-over-year. Now turning to the balance sheet. The ending balance of our total cash and short-term investments was $544.5 million, up $27.4 million compared to the prior year. As previously mentioned, operating cash flows for the quarter was $50.3 million an increase of $26.8 million from the prior quarter and an increase of $23.7 million year-over-year. In addition, capital expenditures during the quarter of $6.7 million were down from the $14.8 million in the prior year when we were completing construction of our new facility in Chandler.  In addition, during fiscal Q1, we repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock for $10 million. As you may recall, in September of last year, we announced a new common stock repurchase program for up to $300 billion. At the end of fiscal Q1 2024, we had $224.8 million available into this program.  Now onto guidance, we expect our fiscal second quarter 2024 revenue to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million. Operating profit margin is expected to be 11.2%, plus or minus 160 basis points, and EPS to be $0.06 to $0.10. We expect NSC revenue to be approximately $177 million, plus or minus $8 million. With an operating profit margin of 2% plus or minus 200 basis points. OSP revenue is expected to be approximately $73 million plus or minus $2 million. With an operating profit margin of 33.5% plus or minus a hundred basis points, our tax expense is expected to be around $8 million, plus or minus half $1 million for the second quarter as a result of jurisdictional mix. We expect other income and expenses to be a net expense of approximately $3 million, and the share count is expected to be around 222 million shares.  With that, I will turn the call over to Oleg. \nOleg Khaykin : Thank you, Pam. During the September quarter, our end-market spend environment continued to be challenging, particularly with the service providers in North America. In view of these continued headwinds, our revenue came in slightly below the midpoint of our guidance with stronger OSP demand helping to offset weaker telecom service provider revenues.  Our EPS came in at the low end of our guidance range, driven by lower volume and higher taxes due to less favorable geographic revenue mix. With NSC, we saw a mixed performance. The demand for our field fiber, cable, service enablement and wireless lab products came in weaker than expected due to tight span and CapEx environment at tier-1 service providers. The demand for lab fiber avionics and op coms products was robust and continue to see good momentum. The net result was NSC revenue coming in slightly below the midpoint of our guide.  Now turning to OSP. OSP business segment results came in slightly better than expected, but both revenue and profitability exceeding our expectations. The results were driven by stronger than expected demand for both counterfeiting and 3D sensing products.  Looking ahead, at the December quarter, we expect revenue to be seasonally down, primarily due to lower anti-counterfeiting demand as our customers work to adjust their year-end inventories. We also seeing slightly softer 3D sensing demand after strong Q1 orders.  Looking into early calendar 2024, we expect the following demand dynamics for our major product areas. First is continued slow recovery in service provider spend impacting our field instruments business. The second continued weaker demand for our anti-contributing products. A tight fiscal policy slowed down the inventory consumption by major customers.  Third, beginning of recovery of wireless lab products as major wireless NEMs continue 5G product development and increase 6G investment. The fourth accelerated the recovery in our fiber lab and production product demand driven by strong optical demand by data center, optical NEMs, optical module, and semiconductor customers. Fifth, growing service enablement product demand as our new architecture against instruction and acceptance with major customers. And last but not the least, growing demand for our avionics, Mil/Aero and resilient P&T products.  Despite the near-term macroeconomic headwinds, our long-term growth strategy thesis built around 5G and 6G wireless fiber, new service enablement, product portfolio 3G sensing and emerging resilient P&T technology remains intact. In conclusion, I would like to thank my Viavi team for managing in this challenging environment and express my appreciation to our employees, customers, and shareholders for their support.  With that, I will now turn it over to operator for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. You may proceed.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my question. Oleg, do you have any plans to take additional costs out of OpEx? And if not, how do you see near term would last time -- last earning call was under the impression that your customers, at least on a wire line may be bothering, but it seems like demand has weakened. And just want to get a feel for how you are looking at the end market demand outside of the smartphone. \nOleg Khaykin: Sure, thanks. We have taken out, I'm not a believer of depth by a thousand cuts, taking out a little bit at a time. We have taken a major step earlier in the year. We've taken out about $30 million in OpEx, and we have just completed, I would say there's maybe a little bit left, but most of it has already been factored in. And in terms of the outlook, we actually see, while the service provider still continues to be a bit anemic, we actually seeing it stabilizing. And our lab and production test business is actually starting to recover.  So, I think, with that, I think we are good for now with any further OpEx reductions. The area where we have a bit of a challenge is clearly, our OSP business unit. That's the area where we have factories with a lot of fixed assets. So clearly lower loadings lead to a bit more underutilization and as a result, a bit lower margins, which puts the pressure on of the overall margins. But as the -- we are working diligently to bring the inventories under control as our customers and ourselves try to adjust inventories to the new equilibrium.  We think we are in pretty good position in managing soft lending, so to say, and to start the recovery. So, the short answer, we are not planning any further OpEx reductions. I think we have implemented all the changes we need to implement. We have a little bit more remaining to be implemented from the original plan, but that's about it for now.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Michael Genovese with Rosenblatt Securities. You may proceed.\nMichael Genovese: Thank you. Oleg, can you talk about, linearity sort of from service provider orders in the quarter and particularly how things look late in the quarter and anything you need to talk about early October?\nOleg Khaykin: Sure. I think the -- if anything, the linearity isn't pretty good. Nobody has been decommissioning. I mean, I would say, converting orders into bookings is taking a bit longer, but that's the result of lower demand, before you could get things within a quarter, and it takes you a bit more than a quarter. But, with that said, I think nobody has been canceling. Nobody been pulling back.  I mean, they are still -- once they place the orders, they take the orders. And we are seeing actually -- we are not expecting usually in the December quarter, you always have some budget flush. I don't think we are seeing any of it this year. But on the positive side, we are seeing a probably stronger than seasonal demand into the March quarter. Things are being up a lot more linear than kind a strong June kind of December quarter weak September, March quarter.  So, I think, there is less, I would say kind of budget flushing or trying to use it or lose it going on. People ordering equipment just as they needed to kind of real time, just in time. And I think the initial shock and the restructuring has been kind of worked out and everybody is getting back to within the new operating environment, deciding what they need and placing orders as necessary. I think I will say the first two-quarters of fiscal, I mean, if I look at the, December and kind of March quarter of this fiscal year, a year ago, there was a lot of order cancellation as many service providers were trying to get their CapEx under control. Now that they were able to cancel and push out big ticket items with various NEMs, they are getting back to operational optimization and, we are actually seeing more willingness to spend money on getting more out of what they have got versus just coming down completely.\nMichael Genovese: Great. I appreciate that color. I guess, the second question is, you talked about the lab business already starting to recover. Could you give more color on what's driving that? And is the newer or higher speed like, very high-speed data center business, part of that lab that you are talking about?\nOleg Khaykin: So, I would say, it is a story of two different labs. So, if you look at the wireless space, clearly, we are seeing the results of major wireless NEMs. I would say, there is still a very tight environment, but we do expect the demand to start coming back early next calendar year. Because in the end everybody's still got a lot of 5G and 6G products that they're working on, and they are will be placing orders. So, in that area, we've seen weakness. The second area of weakness has been in I'd say in the last two quarters is anything related to storage, also a storage both semiconductor and this drive providers kind of pulled back on some of the investment, but we expect that to be coming back as well as in next generation products needs to be launched. The area that's been pretty strong and actually has been up year on year is the very high speed. So, about a quarter ago people asked me about do I see any demand with related to the hyperscale data center for AI? And at that point we didn't really see it. We actually starting to see that coming now.  That's why I said between the time people talk about it and the time they start placing orders, there's always some lag. So that piece of business for us is actually doing very well and we are seeing robust demand from the system providers the data center operators and the semiconductor companies that play in that space. So, I mean, so if I say about 11 production, it's much stronger on high speed optical transport and a bit weaker in storage and wireless. But if we think storage and wireless will be coming back in the March quarter. \nMichael Genovese: And I look forward to following up on more on that offline. I guess my last question for here though would be about you already mentioned the March quarter maybe being a lit little bit more linear and less seasonal with December. But can you just talk about the second half of the year? Because you're pretty bullish on the second half of the year and made some comparisons to early ‘23, sort of exiting ‘24. And just how do you feel about that now? Because it seems like things are a little bit weaker on the telecom side. \nOleg Khaykin: Well, I mean, remember, telecom's side weakness is relative. We were the first ones to see everything go tight, which was in September and December of last year. A lot of the NAMS didn't see it happening until June, and let's say September quarter because they have non-cancelable, non-refundable orders. So, and while the service providers were working to cancel or push out a lot of the equipment spend, the first thing they did is they really tightened up on operating expenses.  Now that the big-ticket items being canceled or pushed out, it's kind of going, getting back to business and trying to get more with what they've got. So, in that respect, the dialogue we are seeing is much more constructive in that area. In particular, we are expecting to see some reasonable spend in the cable deployment, and a network upgrade and I think the initial revenue and it'll start flowing in the March quarter.  So, in that respect, the MSOs are doing in moving forward with their network upgrades. I think the big service price in North America are still a bit anemic but in Europe and Asia, I mean, we are seeing a bit better environment. So obviously, it's not as good as it was I'd say a year, year and a half ago. But it's from where I'm sitting, it's a better situation than it was a year ago where for six months it was crickets.  Nobody was doing anything. So at least we have the dialogue and things are moving forward, and I think the initial shock for a lot of 11 production, the semi companies, module companies, system companies, they kind of took a pulled back, reassessed their budgets, their CapEx, and now they're coming back. And within the areas in a high speed optical and ethernet is going to be quite strong in the -- we expect to be quite strong in the first half calendar year.  The wireless, we expect it to start recovering and coming back. And on the service enablement, our software business, we actually feeling pretty good. We are getting very good traction for our new architecture and a very nice design win in some of the most challenging areas against truly who in the space. So, I think in that particular space, we think we're going to pick up share in the coming years.  So overall, where I'm sitting, it's on the NSC side. I think the worst behind it is now we just need to determine how is it going to be kind of gradual recovery, a little bit stronger recovery in some areas, weaker in the others, it remains to be seen. On the OSP side. We saw very strong demand on 3D sensing in the September quarter. I think it's too early to tell how the December is going to come in. I think, our major customer is probably going to look at -- see how well they're selling their products. If the sales are very strong, particularly in Asia, we may see more upside to the December and March quarter.  At this point, it's too early to tell. And on the anti-counterfeiting, I think, between the inventory bills during COVID and tighter fiscal environment, I think the inventories are unwinding slower. So, we expect to see a weaker demand and as a greater level of under-utilization and some gross margin pressure in that business unit in the coming six months. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Tim Savageaux with Northland Capital Market. You may proceed.\nTimothy Savageaux: Quick question on the kind of outlook, you mentioned something about March being less seasonal, and I'm not sure how the order, the magnitude of some of the businesses, the lab businesses that you're seeing growth in. Clearly, you're going to have some headwinds seasonally on 3D sensing, and it sounds like on the currency side, but at this point, or you mean to talk about March being less seasonal? Could March be up given some of the dynamics that you're seeing? \nOleg Khaykin: I think it's a bit early till, I think in the NSC there's a chance that March will be flat to up. I mean, as I said, we expect some pretty strong cable demand to come in March quarter. And we do think we are going to see some 11-production recovery. But I think it's, at this point it's too early to tell. But the mere fact that some of the normally you see quite a bit of orders being pulled in into December quarter, because of budget flash.  We're not seeing that there as a result, people just placing orders to when they need the product versus when they have the money to spend. And in that respect, we think, the general strength that we see in December, which results in a bit weaker March, I think is largely absent. So, the March bookings are already in and there's still obviously a lot of work to be done, but there is a good chance that March will be flat, maybe even slightly up on NSE side.  On the OSP side, I think it will be, slightly down because that's usually, the weaker quarter for 3D sensing and we continue to expect more anemic demand on anti-counterfeiting. But obviously, I have been surprised in the past. I mean, we don't get much visibility from central banks around the world. And, I mean, at least our operating assumption right now is that, OSP business will be slightly down from the December quarter and the NSE business maybe conversely slightly up. So, net roughly flattish, March quarter is the early expectation. But I think it is too early to truly call it.\nTimothy Savageaux: Understood. I appreciate the color. Following up on the network enablement side, and given some of the trends you have noted in in terms of service provider spending weakness. I am going to -- it would seem to follow that, and I know you have broken this down from time to time over time about lab versus field split. But it would seem that you are more lab-heavy these days, given that field weakness. A, would you say that's right? Can you give us kind of a current estimate of where that breakdown stands? And of that lab business how material is your 800-gig high speed optical stuff relative to that total.\nOleg Khaykin: So, I think in general, we have been -- we used to be like significantly more present in the service provider. We have obviously grown our lab business a lot more in the last six years. So, I mean, while we are still not quite there, I would say, the field instruments is, let me just kind of do a quick math here. It is probably more like a 60-40 maybe 55-45. It is still about maybe, 60-40, 55-45 split between the field instruments being a little bit better, bigger, and lab being smaller. That's a big change from about 70-30 that we had a few years back.  The other thing as I mentioned earlier about how we think about March quarter. Some of the -- when you look at our EPS range for this quarter, that assumes, a higher commission because our current booking velocity. We are expecting much stronger bookings, in this quarter. So, we pay -- or at least we reserve commissions in the quarter of bookings, and that obviously, as the bookings come in much stronger than the revenue, some of it carries over as the starting backlog into the next quarter that gives us a little bit more comfort with the March quarter. But that's response to your question.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Alexander Henderson with Needham. You may proceed. \nAlexander Henderson: So, I was hoping, we could start off with a little bit of a sense of what the break is between 3D and non-3D OSP. I am assuming that, it is somewhere around $20 million, $21 million in the September quarter for 3D, is that in the ballpark? \nOleg Khaykin: It's a little bit closer to $24 million. \nAlexander Henderson: Normally that declines sequentially, if it's a little stronger. What gives you the confidence that it's not going to decline more sequentially? \nOleg Khaykin: So, we are expecting some decline into this quarter. But in the near term, I mean, looking at our current forecast, we are seeing revenue to be around maybe $3 million to $4 million down for the total OSP. And that's largely coming out of the -- some of it coming from the anti-counterfeiting and some of the other is coming out of the 3D sensing, but there's other elements of 3D sensing market that are playing into it. We already one month into December quarter.\nAlexander Henderson: Is there another piece of the business that's kicking in other than the standard customer? \nOleg Khaykin: Well, I mean the, the standard customer, there's also some industrial customers in that space. I'd say, the main customer is the main customer. \nAlexander Henderson: If we could go to the income statement, you talked about the $30 million in cost savings coming out earlier in the year is as we look at the $118 million in OpEx in the quarter, is that the right level that we should be anticipating in the December quarter, or will it step up because of commissions? And if it's not going to have a seasonal decline in the March quarter, is that again the right level for the March quarter? \nOleg Khaykin: So, this is $118 million is about on the lower end side. So, in the December quarter, as I said, we actually have a -- it is one of these things, you don't get the revenue, you get bookings, so there's a significant step up in bookings. So, a big chunk of that $4 million increased guidance for December quarter is the commissions on bookings on the revenue that'll likely land in the March quarter. And in the March quarter, it would be roughly, we expect to be about the same level as December, but for different reason, it's more of statutory accruals that you do beginning of the year, the FICA and all that stuff. And then by the June quarter, we expect it to come down a bit somewhat. So, I'd say during the year you're kind of looking between $118 million to $122 million is the range depending on the quarter. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed. \nUnidentified Analyst: This is Karan on Meta Marshall. I guess just on the telecom side and service provider side, just regionally, I know you mentioned that North America is weaker and areas like Europe is a little bit stronger. Is there anything you'd call out on this quarter in terms of trends beyond that? And I guess do you expect sort of Europe to revert back to North American trends or do you expect them to continue to outgrow and outperform? \nOleg Khaykin: Well, I mean, I'd say, telecom globally is weaker, but the difference is are you on life support or you are working wounded? And I would say relatively speaking, Europe is doing probably the best. Latin America actually continues to be fairly resilient. Asia is doing pretty well. It's North America is really the area that's struggling quite a bit. And I think a lot of it is driven by the heavy debt load that North American service providers are carrying. But generally, we've seen pullback across the world less the least in Europe than I would say, Asia than Latin America, roughly on par. And then North America is the most impacted. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, thank you. That makes sense. And then sort of on the currency side of your business, just given sort of the headwinds you outlined, are there any changes to maybe high level how you look at the run rate of that business? Has that come down a little bit or do you sort of expect it to revert back as sort of demand normalizes? \nOleg Khaykin: I think, we expect the core business to be on the lower end of the $50 million range per quarter. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. There are currently no further questions in the queue, so I'll now turn the line back to the team for any closing or additional remarks.\nPam Avent: Thank you. I think with that, we can end the call.\nOperator: That concludes the conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your line."
