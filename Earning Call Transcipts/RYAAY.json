        "content": "Michael O’Leary: Okay. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. You’re all very welcome to the Q3 results call. As you see earlier this morning on our ryanair.com website, we published our Q3 results together with an MD&A and a Q&A section with myself and CFO, Neil Sorahan. A couple of quick themes. As you see, we reported a Q3 profit after tax of €15 million. Traffic and fares were ahead of the prior year, but closing Christmas and New Year loads and yields were softer than previously expected, as we had to lower prices somewhat in response to the very sudden, but surprising but very welcome removal of flights from most of the major OTA pirate websites in early December. Profit after tax, however, for the 9 months ended 31 December was up 39% at €2.19 billion. Prior year, it was €1.58 billion. Just to touch on some brief Q3 highlights. The traffic grew 7% to 41 million. Revenue per passenger was up 9%. Average fares were up 13%, mainly due to a very strong Christmas and the October bank holiday weekend and ancillary revenues up 2%. MSCI raised their ESG rating on Ryanair from a BBB to an A in December. Our fuel bill rose €320 million in the quarter, up 35% to €1.2 billion. At the quarter end, we had 136 B737 Gamechangers in the total fleet that was significantly behind the original deliveries due to Boeing delays. More importantly, going forward, our fuel hedging, we’ve extended fuel hedging. We have 65% of our FY ‘25 fuel now hedged at $79 per barrel. This year, we are hedged at $89 per barrel. So we have already banked a saving of €450 million into FY ‘25. And as you will all be aware, we have ended the first interim dividend of €0.175 per share is payable on the February 28. I think just to touch on growth in fleet. At the end of Q3, we’ve taken delivery of 136 737 Gamechangers. We now expect to have up to 174 of these aircraft in our fleet by the end of June in time for peak summer 2024, that’s up 50 aircraft from summer 2023. That would still be 7 aircraft short of our contracted deliveries due to Boeing delivery delays. However, those new aircraft means we have a bumper summer 2024 schedule now on sale. It includes 169 new routes, our first 11 domestic routes in Morocco and our first summer with 23 routes in Albania, are in to and from Tirana, the capital city of Albania. While travel demand remains high, we expect summer ‘24 EU short-haul capacity to be behind where it was in summer ‘23 as a considerable number of our competitors ground the A320 aircraft in Europe due to the Pratt & Whitney engine issues and Boeing delivery delays constrain our growth from 57 to 50 aircraft. We are continuing to work closely with Boeing to minimize delivery delays and we have invested in additional engineering over – Ryanair engineering oversight to improve the quality control in both Wichita and Seattle. The recent MAX 9 grounding was a disappointing setback, but we welcome the ungrounding of the MAX 9 last week. Ryanair do not operate any MAX 9 variant. There are no MAX 9 aircraft in Europe, and therefore, it is largely a U.S. issue. However, Neil visited in Seattle in January, met with Boeing’s senior management and we urge them and they have agreed to increase their quality assurance resources on the ground in Wichita and Seattle. We are putting more engineers into Wichita and Seattle to run extra checks on our deliveries, but also on our recent 737 deliveries, we’ve noted improvements in the quality with fewer delivery defects on the 12 aircraft we got in the fourth quarter before Christmas. However, we do believe Boeing have more work to do to improve quality and reduce delivery delays. But – and I want to stress this, we are fully supportive of the initiatives that David Calhoun and Brian West are taking to improve Boeing’s performance and production. It is critical, we believe, to Boeing’s continued performance that we support Calhoun and West. I think they are a good team. I have concerns about the management in Seattle, but I have a lot of confidence in Calhoun and Brian West. I think they are on the right track. The MAX 9 grounding was an unfortunate event, and it does indicate that quality does need to be improved in Boeing, but we are very supportive and a lot of confidence in what Calhoun is doing under his leadership. We welcome – on the OTAs, this is a significant event in December. The timing of the OTA taking, as I said, was a bit unfortunate, because it was the first week in December. With Christmas coming, you can’t just go in and open up and dump seats to counteract that. We think historically, these OTA pirates generally account for between 10% and 15% of our volume. So a sudden removal of that meant, we saw a sudden – or a very short-term dip in our bookings. We would normally respond to that by opening up price promotions, but we didn’t want to do that in the run into Christmas. We therefore think we’ll take a hit of 1% or 2% on load factor in December and January. We will take it into hit on yields during December and January, but we think it will be short-lived and we are happy with the forward bookings, particularly out into February and March, although March is slightly – is artificially enhanced by having the first half of Easter in that. Much more important for Ryanair and our passengers is to convert these OTA pirates into what we now would call kind of approved OTA partners. The partnership agreement we signed last week with loveholidays who were our fourth largest OTA and Kiwi.com this morning, who are our largest – where our largest OTA pirates, are critical, we think to protecting customers from OTA overcharges and scams. As part of this agreement, we now give these two approved OTA direct feed of inventory from the ryanair.com website and they agree as part of the deal, no overcharging of passengers for either airfares or for any of our ancillaries. The bookings are made directly in the ryanair.com website with the customer’s actual and real e-mail address and real payment details, so that if we need to send a customer an e-mail or some flight information, it goes directly to the customer, it doesn’t get lost in some OTA pirate fake e-mail address. And whenever we have to refund to passengers, we can now make the bookings directly to the passengers. We think this is the way forward and we will continue to campaign to outlaw the illegal screen scraping and the customer overcharging and scamming being undertaken by so many others of these OTA pirates and converted them to the same system or the same mechanism that we now agree with loveholidays and Kiwi. Looking forward to the summer 2024, we expect airlines will continue to consolidate. We expect capacity will be constrained by both the consolidation by the lack of aircraft deliveries post-COVID across Europe. And I think the A320 fleet grounding this summer, we expect about 10% of Europe’s A320 fleet to be grounded for the – while they address the Pratt & Whitney engine issues and that this will mean tight supply for summer 2024. And while we still have 50 additional aircraft into that marketplace, we don’t have the original 57 we had hoped for. So we think there is going to be a reasonably strong summer pricing. Already today, our bookings are running about 5% ahead of where they were, forward bookings into the summer about 5% ahead of where they were this time last year. Pricing is up by a low single-digit percentage. Again, some of that, I think, is a factor of the fact that the first half of Easter has moved into March. So, Q4 is strong. But therefore, there is less of an impact of Easter pricing in April. But much work remains to be done, but we are very pleased with where we are for summer 2024. In terms of outlook, we are targeting 183.5 million passengers in the current year. That will still be a monumental achievement. The original budget was 185 million. But if you take the ATC – it’s been over 60 days of ATC strikes, that’s cost us over 1 million seats. The Tel Aviv cancellations, which have been running since the end of – since the end of November, that’s cost us about another 600,000 seats and the Boeing delivery delays have meant we’ve had to truncate both the summer 2024 – summer ‘23 schedule and our winter ‘24 schedule. So, it will still be a very strong performance. However, as a result of these lower load factors, particularly in Q3 and the kicking in of some higher productivity pay agreements with pilot unions across Belgium, Italy and in the UK, these are productivity enhancements that we intend to rollout to most of the other by agreement with the other pilot unions and groups between now and summer 2024, which will significantly improve our operational resilience and reduce pilot attrition. We now expect full year ‘24 ex-fuel unit cost to rise by about €2.50. That would still leave a dramatically wider cost gap between Ryanair and our main European competitor airlines, two of whom reported last week. Q4, which is traditionally the weakest quarter will also be impacted by the partial unwind of free ETS carbon credits in the January 1, but we will benefit from a strong first half of Easter traffic falling into late March, although this is unlikely to offset the weaker than previously expected load factors and yields in late Q3 and early Q4. We are therefore this morning narrowing our full year FY ‘24 profit after tax guidance to a range of between €1.85 billion to €1.95 billion. It was previously €1.85 billion to €2.05 billion. So we think the number will come in just under €2 billion for the full year. However, this guidance and the full year results still remains heavily dependent upon avoiding unforeseen adverse events in Q4, such as the Ukraine war, the Israel Hamas conflict and any further Boeing delivery delays, which might damage us in the run into Easter. We have also given you a full update or we have attached to the release, a full update on the OTA pirate situation. I think this has been one of the most dramatic victories for Ryanair in recent years. And I would always be happy to take a short-term pain if it’s getting rid of OTA pirate scamming and overcharging our customers and moving those into a more cooperative working with us. It also, I think the new agreement this morning with loveholidays and with Kiwi exposes the falsehood of some of these OTA claims that Ryanair is just trying to eliminate OTA. We are not – we have, for many years, worked with OTAs like Google Flight who just – who are an honest price transparency website, but who send passengers directly to Ryanair to make the booking. The reason we have a problem with the OTA pirates is the illegal screen scraping of our digital – of our data and then using that to scam customers for excessive airfares, inflated ancillary services, and in some cases, charging them for non-existing services such as refund insurance and/or change fees, while it’s a non-changeable ticket. But I think it’s been a very good month or 2 months work and is long-term very much in Ryanair’s interest and in the interest of our consumers that they can get access to our low fares, our low cost ancillary services without being scammed by some intermediaries. Neil, I am finished. Do you want to – anything you want to highlight in terms of the finances, the balance sheet and/or the dividend.\nNeil Sorahan: Yes. I suppose just on the balance sheet, ended the quarter very strongly with just over €2.9 billion in gross cash and importantly, net cash balance €150 million. We continue to be the most highly rated airline in the world with a BBB+ rating from Fitch and S&P. And a big advantage that we have in these markets is unencumbered Boeing 747 fleet, 546 unencumbered aircraft. And so we are generating net interest income in the business at a time when our competitors are refinancing or taking on expensive leases. So that’s a big competitive advantage that we have. You touched on the hedging, but I think we shouldn’t underestimate the benefit of the certainty that we have now in our hedging out to the end of March 2025, €450 million worth of savings being locked in and one are very volatile markets at this point in time. And then, of course, we have got our first interim dividend at the end of next month, €0.175 per share and we’ll have something similar again after AGM approval in September. And that’s pretty much all I wanted to add, Michael.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Alright. [indiscernible], then we’ll open it up to Q&A, please.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Harry Gowers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Harry. Your line is now open.\nHarry Gowers: Good morning, gents. Hi. Two questions, if I can. First one is just on the ex-fuel unit costs, maybe you could talk through the increase in the group productivity part and what impact we might see into 2025 and so any latest force directionally on ex-fuel cost per pack for March 25? And then second one, we saw some comments from United, I think last week or so and they were making plans, that doesn’t include the MAX 10 going forward potentially. I guess if other airlines start to cancel order – fair orders, would you happily take on some of those slots over the next few years or are you quite content with your current plans? Thanks a lot.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Neil, I’ll ask you give the ex-fuel unit costs. It’s a bit early yet for FY ‘25. We haven’t yet finalized the budget, but I’ll ask Neil to give more detail. United, I thought this comment out of United last week was stupid. If they want to hand over or they want to cancel some of their MAX 10 deliveries, frankly, Ryanair will take them. We would be very happy to take aircraft early. The MAX 10 is a very good aircraft. We can’t wait to get it. It offers us 20% more seats. It burns 20% less fuel. The MAX aircraft has now in Ryanair alone, we completed over 1 million flights last year, more than 20% of those on MAX aircraft, great operational reliability. This is a great aircraft. The MAX 9, the plug was an unfortunate incident. It does highlight the need for improved quality control in Boeing, but they are still making great aircraft. As by the way, our Airbus, who are making great aircraft despite the fact that they have a – the Pratt & Whitney engine is a major issue for Airbus – air operators going forward. So – but I think we have two large manufacturers they are both making great aircraft. The stupidity of the United comments last week is that their order books are full out to 2030. So if United isn’t going to take the MAX aircraft, they are not going to replace them or substitute them with Airbus aircraft. But if they want to delay or cancel any of those MAX 10 aircraft, Ryanair will be the first people into Seattle to talk to Boeing about taking those aircraft, although I suspect there will be a queue of customers waiting to take those aircraft, given how tight the OEM supply is between now and 2030. So I thought the United comments were unhelpful, stupid, but if they want to do something stupid like cancels of the MAX 10 orders, Ryanair will be very happy to take them. Neil, do you want to talk...\nNeil Sorahan: Yes. Sure. Harry thanks for the question. In the quarter, it’s sales and for this year, as you’ve seen from the commentary this morning, we are looking at about another €0.50 on unit cost ex-fuel, so €2.50 ahead of prior year. Some of that’s down to the lower load factor in Q3 in early January. The balance is kind of down to the productivity pay improvements that we are putting through for our people. Those pay improvements will obviously have to then annualize into next year. So you – we will see a little bit of cost increase as a result of that next year. But our fuel savings are going to more than offset any unit cost ex-fuel increases that we have coming through on a year-on-year basis.\nMichael O’Leary: And I think the people will over assess you on a quarterly basis, Harry, on unit costs. Actually, the key issue here is still Slide 4 in the presentation. While we are not in any way kind of relaxed about unit cost or cost control, the gap between us and other competitors with easyJet in Europe, and in particular, the other airlines in the U.S. is widening dramatically as we – but we do have to keep our pay competitive. We have fixed – we have pay agreements in place that cover basic pay and productivity pay with pilots and cabin crew that run for the next 3, 4 years. But if we are – our earnings are rising dramatically and there is some pressure on competitive pay, particularly for pilots. It’s up to us to do – to work with our unions and our pilots and keep their pay competitive, which is what we will do.\nHarry Gowers: Okay. Thanks, Michael.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Harry. Next question, please.\nOperator: Next question that comes from Stephen Furlong from Davy. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nStephen Furlong: Hi, Michael. Yes, two questions. I noticed maybe one for Neil, just maybe talk about the headwinds or tailwinds and cost into the next year or two. I saw there the EU were talking about ETS reform and the rebasing of current airline allowances, for example, maybe that’s a minor thing, but you might just talk about that and anything else on just big positives or headwinds for costs. And then on pricing, Michael, I know on the pre-record, you said pricing is strong demand, very, very strong. Anything in terms of markets where it’s – I mean, I guess it’s a function of capacity where is better than other places, that would be great? Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Stephen. Neil, do you want to take the first one, cost?\nNeil Sorahan: Yes. Okay. Stephen, the rebasing of ETFs against 2023, we are starting that at the moment, but we think it will be modestly positive for us. I haven’t got the final numbers on it, yes. As you know, we are very well hedged on carbon in any event, like we have got all of our credits hedged next year at about €76 in AUA, which is down from €81 in AUA in the current financial year. But I do think that ETS reform will be modestly positive for Ryanair.\nMichael O’Leary: And I think the pricing situation I’ll ask Eddie Wilson here, CEO of DAC. Eddie, what are you seeing generally by market or in general terms for summer ‘24?\nEddie Wilson: I think it’s very early to say. But I mean you look at our three largest markets, Italy, Spain and the UK, where we have the largest proportion of our growth. So, nothing unusual there or anything different across those markets at all and then we’ve got a lot of growth coming out of a places like Albania, Morocco and Croatia. But like you are still in very small numbers for the summer season and so it’s – there are no – I mean, like the place where we put in a larger amount of growth in places like Albania, obviously, will – but it’s only a small proportion of what we do. So – but I think it’s fair to say we’ve been very surprised at the strength of the – both the load factors and the fares in our new entry into Tirana, which is a market that was dominated by one of the other so-called low-fare airlines. And we are running 90% load factors having launched on November and the middle of the winter. I mean, the only – from my point of view, in terms of growth is a disappointment that we are going to be somewhere 7 aircraft short, maybe 10 aircraft short for summer 2024. It really is constraining our growth. We have many more airports out there, who were looking for these aircrafts. And that doesn’t even factor in things like returning to Ukraine, if or when they defeat the Russian. We see very strong growth across almost all our airport customers for additional Ryanair aircraft, particularly in markets where they are struggling to recover their pre-COVID volumes.\nMichael O’Leary: Next question please. Thanks, Stepehen.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dudley Shanley from Goodbody. Please go ahead. Dudley, your line is now open.\nDudley Shanley: Good morning, Michael. Good morning, everyone. Two questions for me as well. First of all, on the higher productivity pay for pilots. You mentioned in the statement that, that brings increased operational resilience. Can you just talk us through what it actually brings for you? And then the second question is to do with the capacity dynamics in Europe at the moment. Obviously, the GTF engine is the kind of biggest new thing this year. How long do you see that market staying as tight as it is and below kind of pre-COVID levels? Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: So just give me the second half of that again, with the GTF engines.\nDudley Shanley: Just in terms of the capacity dynamics being tight in Europe, obviously, it’s going to be tight this summer, but do you see that rolling into next year and beyond?\nMichael O’Leary: Yes. I will do the engine and maybe I give Eddie, you can talk about the productivity pay. Yes, if you take capacity generally, Eurocontrol have confirmed last year, European short haul was about 93% of pre-COVID. The question for summer ‘24 is it going to grow or is it going to decline? We think it’s not going to grow. We are not sure yet whether it declines. It depends on which markets the A320 operators ground aircraft or don’t grow. For example, if you take the likes of Weeze, are they going to kind of constrain their growth in the Middle East or are they going to constrain their growth in Europe. I suspect we are going to see more constraints on growth in Europe where they are struggling to compete with us. But – and we are still waiting to see where – those final kind of scheduled decisions haven’t yet been made or schedules haven’t yet been altered. With the backlog going engine shops around the world, I mean, it seems clear to me that the brand with the engine issue is going to run on through summer ‘24 and again in summer ‘25 may even stretch you to summer ‘26. The OEMs are not going to deliver meaningful aircraft numbers between now and then. Ryanair is very fortunate. Okay, we may get left short to aircraft this with summer by Boeing. We’ll pick them up for the summer of 2025. We are scheduled 30 aircraft in advance of summer ‘25 close whatever they leave us short this year. But really, other than that, there are very few new aircraft deliveries going into short-haul Europe. We do expect the Asian market will recover more or reopen more for summer 2024 and that will enhance demand across short-haul Europe, particularly if it builds up transfer traffic on the legacy short-haul. So all the indications are at this point in time is that demand – our capacity is going to be constrained in European short-haul for summer ‘24. I see no reason why demand won’t be strong. We are just not sure where that’s going to fall in terms of pricing. I do believe pricing in summer ‘24 will be ahead of summer ‘23. It won’t be up though. I mean, I think it won’t be up 15%, 17% we saw last summer. I think kind of mid to high single-digits, maybe low double-digits is a reasonable expectation at this point in time. But that’s capable of being derailed, if there is geopolitical issues, some adverse developments in Ukraine, etcetera things like that. But certainly, all the indications are at the moment is that summer ‘24, particularly through the school holidays, the Easter break, etcetera, is strong and pricing is slightly upwards at this point in time. Eddie, you want to give the flavor of what productivity pay, why that sales resilient?\nEddie Wilson: Yes. I mean, like if you go back to when we came out of COVID like Ryanair was the best prepared of all airlines and in Europe if not in the world for having sufficient crews, more than sufficient crews to run the schedule when many of our competitors were floundering. And it’s not a lesson that we have forgotten. And as we continue to grow, we will lean into having not just the sufficient crews, but we should build in extra resilience, because the reason we need extra resilience was primarily driven by poor ATC performance and we don’t want to be caught out by that. And that means that if we’ve got to – we have to remain competitive with our crews to attract and retain people and we’ll continue to do that. If that means that we have to adjust pay like we have, then that’s what we will do. And it gives us the comfort in the medium term as that when ATC, if it’s ever ultimately resolved to get back to the sort of operational efficiencies that we – that means that we can pair back crews in time. But at the moment, we are not going to take any risk on that whatsoever. So, it’s about having the right crewing ratios in place to run the schedule against the backdrop of a really shoddy ATC environment.\nMichael O’Leary: Yes. And I should just say as well as in terms of capacity, the Boeing being short of those aircraft from Boeing, we are finalizing our budgets at the moment, but we are walking back our full year traffic figure for FY ‘25. It’s going to come back from €205 million probably €200 million will be the working assumption. So we are going to have 2.5% less capacity out there through certainly the summer 2024 than we would wish to have at this point in time. So as I said previously, United want to walk away from any MAX 10 aircraft deliveries. We will be very happy to step into the breach in advance. Thanks for the question, Dudley. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jaime Rowbotham from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Jaime, hi.\nJaime Rowbotham: Good morning. First one for Neil, maybe. I don’t want to obsess too much on these ex-fuel unit costs. But back in November, I asked whether there were any risks on the unit cost guide and Neil, you helpfully mentioned the route charges which I thought looked a bit higher this morning. Presumably, you’ve now got visibility on the higher Eurocontrol rates for the next 12 months. I just wondered whether these were also a little bit responsible for the extra €0.50 on the cost per tax guide into ‘24. And how much of a headwind there is on route charges into ‘25? At least I guess this will be the same for everyone. And secondly, Michael, given the focus on Boeing, you mentioned fewer delivery defects on receipt of recent MAXs. Could you expand a bit on that, describe the sorts of issues you were encountering before the recent improvement? Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay, thanks.\nNeil Sorahan: Yes. On route charges, Jamie, they are going to track up a bit year-on-year. We are just getting the final numbers in at this stage, running the budget, and I’ll give you a bit more color when we come out in May. But yes, the working assumption in the budget is that we’re seeing route charges tracking up slightly year-on-year.\nMichael O’Leary: Yes. Again, I wouldn’t obsess that your unit charges in the third quarter, like the bigger driver of it on a quarterly basis was the slight slippage in load factor. We would have expected originally to grow that loan factor by maybe 1%. It’s down 1%. That will continue into January as well. So on a quarterly basis, it moves to die a little bit more. On an annualized basis, it doesn’t have that much effect. Boeing delivery defects, I mean, we’ve been jumping up and now with Boeing for about the last 18 months on the number – rate and number of defects that we are picking up. We now do about a 48-hour inspection of each aircraft on delivery here in Dublin, which again is kind of a sort of a painful process. We pick up loss of little things. And I don’t want to go into the detail, but like spanners under a floorboard stuff in the cockpit, it shouldn’t be there. Those are the kind of small quality assurances we pick up. The bigger issues were kind of over the last 12 months of the known issues, you’ve kind of issues coming out of Wichita where both into the tailing we’re putting the wrong way, holds in the forward pressure, the seal or whatever. I don’t know what it is drilled the wrong way. stuff shouldn’t be happening on a $100 million piece of cake. We wouldn’t expect them if you were taking are of our buying cars from Mercedes or Audi, and we don’t expect them when you’re taking aircraft from Boeing or from Airbus. But – and some people would say this was probably – is a consequence of the 2-year grounding of production during COVID. I think there may be a little bit in that. But it means that Boeing and Airbus both need to significantly improve quality control, both the oversight of the engines and on the airframe pure production. We are – Boeing are aware of this. I think they have significantly increased the numbers of engineers that have doing quality assurance on – the aircraft goes through the shop. And the 12 aircraft we got in the fourth quarter or in the December quarter, we found less sort of little silly things on those aircraft on delivery than we had in any of the previous Gamechangers over the previous 2 years. So we think quality is going the right way. It is very unfortunate, but you know that they had the MAX 9 door panel stuff. Boeing are getting an awful lot of unfair kind of coverage as – I mean, it was a near Canada aircraft took off last week and one of the nose wheels fell off. Like that’s nothing to do with Boeing. I mean that’s a maintenance issue within Air Canada but it’s all a pilot on 737. There are two large volume aircraft, the A320 family and the 737 family, they carry 90% of the world’s passengers on a daily basis. They are terrific aircraft. They are very safe. We are big supporters of the 737 and particularly the new variant, the Gamechanger, which is carrying 4% more passengers and burning 16% less fuel and especially the MAX 10, which will carry 20% more passengers and burn 20% less fuel. As Neil said, we expect the Gamechanger the MAX 10s to be certified, Boeing I believe in the Q4 of 2024 first delivery to the American Airlines in early 2025. We’re not pleased to get the first MAX 10 in 2027. So we are well down the list of deliveries, but we can’t wait to take them and pass on the value or the incredible value that those are – the cost reductions of those air – cost efficiencies, those aircraft will deliver for us. We then pass it on in the form of lower fares to customers. Thanks, Jamie. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sathish Sivakumar from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nMichael O’Leary: Sathish, hi.\nSathish Sivakumar: Hi, Michael. Yes, thank you. I’ve got two questions here. So firstly, on the capital allocation. Obviously, you have started the interim dividend today. And what does it mean in terms of share buyback and balance given the balance sheet strength as we go into full year results or into 2025? So that’s my first one. And then the second one, obviously, you flagged the about deep pilots being in terms of labor as such, is being under pressure in the UK. But are you seeing anywhere else in Continental Europe where the pilots are actually under pressure like in terms of availability is being under pressure? Yes. Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Satish. So quick ones on capital allocation, we will continue to pay down debt. We’ll continue to fund all of our CapEx from internally generated cash flow. However, CapEx falls steeply in the next 2 years from almost €3 billion down to just under €1 billion a year. That should – if profitability maintains where it is spring out throw off about €2 billion a year in free cash for the next 2 years. Quarter of that will be allocated to dividend payments and then I think the Board, subject to all being well with the balance sheet and the rest of the world will be looking to return the additional any spare cash to shareholders. It will be – and it will be a case-by-case basis. There will be special dividends or buybacks. And I think that the driver of that will be generally p multiples whenever we come to do it, but we won’t promise. We’re not going to borrow to do it once we generate the cash. If we have more than €3.5 billion, €3 billion, €4 billion in cash on the balance sheet, then anything surplus to that will be returned. We have two big more – two more big debt payments, but one is in ‘25 – one is in FY ‘26 and the other is in FY ‘27. So I think shareholders should support should expect more returns, but what format they would be. We don’t know if that will be amount of the Board. Pilots, we’re not seeing huge pressure on pilots across Europe. There is some pressure in the UK. There was – some of the other UK airlines were kind of paying out panic pay increases last year because they came out of COVID short of pilot. That does seem to settle down. We are not seeing significant pilot attrition, but I think we did have a gap between our pilot pay and that competitor for the last year, again, as a result of these kind of panic pay increases that some other particularly 737 airlines in Europe and in the UK, were paying. We intend and plan to keep our pilot pay competitive. We will never be the best payer, but we certainly will keep it competitive and the rapidity of Ryanair’s growth and the rate of promotion like you’ll go from being a cadet here to caption on the 737 typically within a period of 4 or 5 years if you’re up to the job. And that is what drives very rapid increase in pilot pay. UK, we think we’re okay at this point in time. The market is tight because of the inflexibility of UK labor post Brexit and we don’t have – we have some growth in the UK, but not a lot. But we believe that the pay deals we’ve now agreed with the unions, pilot unions, and we’re extending out the camera units as well, leaves us well positioned with ample pilot and cabin crew resources for summer 2024 but that’s heavily dependent upon there are not being another meltdown in European ATC. And the things like a repeat of the 60 days of ATC strikes, which we suffered in summer 2023 they really do eat up an awful lot of crew hours at peak period. And it’s something that we’re building in slightly higher crewing ratios to improve our resilience and that, in turn, reduces some of the productivity elements of pilot pay. Ed, if wants to comment on that point.\nEddie Wilson: Yes. I mean it’s – if you look at the UK, it’s primarily really a licensing issue as Michael says, a particular tightness in that market that you don’t have the fluidity of moving pilots around from different parts of Europe that you had pre-Brexit. But what we’ve done over the last number of years because we don’t take people from other airlines, we’ve been growing sort of our input of Cadet into the UK system. So that, coupled with the pay issues that we have dealt with there, that should sort that out. This isn’t just – it’s not – it’s the same for engineers as well because it is primarily driven by Brexit until the supply issues are sorted.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay, thanks, Eddy. Thanks, Sathish. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question will come from Alex Irving from Bernstein. Please go ahead Alex, your line is open.\nMichael O’Leary: Alex, hi.\nAlex Irving: Hi, good morning, gentlemen. Two for me, please. First, on the OTAs. Can you please tell me what’s your typical level of ancillary spend per passenger is on an OTA booking versus direct booking. Is there a revenue opportunity here from the new deals or a greater share of pirate bookings? Also, is there any cost saving opportunities from the OTA change with the reduction in the level of manual post-sales servicing. Second question is on unit cost. It will be maintenance. You saw maintenance costs up 40% this capacity up 89% year-on-year. What’s driving that please? And are there any one-offs we should be aware of? Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. I’m going to have Tracy Malloy here. We’re going to get hard that maintenance cost question, Neil. And then just so on the OTA, look, I don’t think there’s any particular upside on ancillaries. There’s a lot of kind of misguided coverage here we want to take these bookings direct so we can maximize our ancillaries. The big issue with the OTAs is one, we don’t want anybody illegally scraping our website. That is digital piracy. It’s our data, and we are a bit like music piracy or film piracy, it should be outlook. We wouldn’t have such a big issue with it if they weren’t scamming customers. And so we have, for a number of years, been chasing down some of these pirate to some overtime. And what they don’t do is they don’t – we get less of an issue with them if they suddenly said to each customer, we are the OTA and here is an OTA fee of €5 per the OTA. I think then the customer could decide whether they want to make the bookings to that OTA and pay the fiber or come directly to Ryanair instead. They’ve been scamming and inflating our airfares. They’re scamming and inflating the ancillaries. I think there might be a slightly better conversion of ancillaries if we are able to communicate directly with the passenger or the bookings made directly in the website. And in some cases, we released this on a monthly basis, our OTA pirate service. Some of these OTAs are inflating our ancillaries, the bag charges, the sea charged by 300% and 400%, so I think there might be a slightly better conversion of ancillaries if every customer has access to our ancillaries at the published prices on our website. But there’s no big jump in ancillaries as a result of getting rid of the OTAs. I think there may be – what we’re trying to do is to protect consumers from being overcharged by these intermediaries and over the longer-term, we don’t want a booking.com or some other third party to be able to insert themselves between us and our customer, capture a huge amount of customers as they have done, for example, in hotel distribution, I then turn around to us and reimpose on us what we had 30 years ago when we had to pay 20% for distribution through travel agents and global GDS. We do not want – we cannot afford to pay kind of extravagant commissions for distribution, particularly where there’s no cost of distribution through the Internet because that would simply inflate the airfares, which would be not in the consumer interest. So we will continue to battle intermediaries, particularly those who are engaged in digital piracy who want to insert themselves between us and our consumer, overcharge the consumer are at some point in time in the future turnaround and try and overcharge us in a manner that would inflate the cost of air charge for consumers. But I don’t foresee, Alex, if there’s any immediate upside in ancillaries, although probably a little bit of a jump in conversion by not overcharging consumers for ancillaries. Tracy, maintenance costs.\nUnidentified Company Representative: For maintenance costs, we the timing of the check. So we brought forward more checks following Q4 into Q3. So we don’t see that we see a drop in Q4. We also have late growing increases in our perfect maintenance facilities, driving the club coming out from A320 and [indiscernible]. And again, we brought forward some of the maintenance of the A320, just in anticipation that the MRO shops may fold with the GTF issues that face in the next few months.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Tracy. Well done. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from James Hollins from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead, James.\nMichael O’Leary: James, hi.\nJames Hollins: Thanks. Two for me on the OTAs. The first one is, would you expect to do deals with all the OTAs or be some off limits like Booking.com given your history of toss them and are they coming to you for deals? And secondly, you – thank you for quantifying 10% to 15% tickets historically sold through OTA pirates, your words don’t mind. I was wondering how that normalizes so quickly, and that’s higher than I thought it would be, and you seem to be implying that this is kind of a December, January issue rather than anything longer than that enlightening as to what that would be. Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. I’m not sure. I mean, look – if you take – there’s about 7 or 8 OTAs account for, we think, more than 50% of OTA pirate bookings. We’re never quite sure what the number is. So I give you 10% to 15% because the only we can track these is where we think there’s a fake credit card or there’s a fake e-mail address that’s how we chase them down. So we’re not entirely sure ourselves. A number of them have come to us since December. In fact, with Love Holidays were the first ones to come to us. And we were – I mean, we have offered them in essence. And are the same offers on the table. We’ve given them the same terms that were on offer through the GDSs. Where we signed up deals with the GDS last year, so of the travel agents had visibility on our pairs. And the great thing again was that we would have the booking made directly in ryanair.com and no overcharging, no scamming of consumer for fair ancillary. I think that gives the business more OTA business model a lot of flexibility. But what we’re not willing to count is that people taking our digital – or sorry, they also agreed not to screen scrape our website because we give them a direct feed. There’s no need to screen scrape our website. Do I think all of them will come on board? Frankly, I don’t know and I don’t particularly care. I do think the majority will. We have a number of others who are – we’re in active discussions with almost all I would say of the top eight, top 10 booking are not in our top eight or top 10, they’re reasonably small. But I do expect – I don’t know that Julius going ask if you want. We do expect the case of Booking.com to roll on. We’re not particularly minded to settle with them. And I think – but we have so many examples of egregious overcharges by booking on airfares and on ancillaries. We are – believe it will be very difficult for Booking.com to go into core in the state eventually. We’re going to drive it that way. We thought it was remarkable that they wanted all of the Ryanair management deposed and we’ve all been deposed and yet none of the booking management want to be deposed, they’re kind of contorting in regaling every which way they can to avoid being deposed because the first question you want to ask them, of course, is why you overcharge you, why are you illegally screen scraping and overcharging customers, but they are reasonably small in terms of volumes, but we’re not about to allow any of these people to try and engage in digital piracy or to overcharge consumers. They all want to have approved partnership deals where we give them direct access to our inventory and they agree not to screen scrape, not to overcharge. Then we’d be very happy to work with. Why do we think it’s a December, January issue? Well, one, because once they come off sale, there is an immediate drop off in our bookings and it took us a number of a week or two in December to spot this, but passenger certainly find a way they find other ways on the Internet back to the Ryanair low fares and also the passenger still mistakenly believe that they’re booking in Ryanair, when they’re actually booking the eDreams or Sky, or eDreams or booking or Opodo are key real-people – they don’t really realize that they’re not making the booking in the Ryanair website. They don’t be realized they’re getting scammed and overcharged. And if Ryanair comes offset on some of these OTA pirate websites, people simply find a way Around. I’ll go back to Google Flight or somebody else or some of the other price comparison websites to find the Ryanair price. It does look – and then of course, we always have the ability to open up a bit more cheap seats or a bit more price stimulus, which we’re happy to do during January and February. We weren’t happy to do it in December because we thought we would trash the close-in bookings over the Christmas, New Year period. And I have always been of the view that if we can eliminate these sizes or at least remove the overcharging and the scamming and at least protect ourselves for the long-term risk that these guys would try to become or would have so much of our volume that they try to become a new GDS or a new intermediary charging either us or customers a percentage of revenues, then that’s a fact that’s well worth taking on. We’re much more vocal about this because we have the cheapest airfares in every market. Therefore, we’re much more of a target for these guys than the other higher fare airline. I think the other higher fare airlines are grateful for whatever bookings they get from these OTAs, whereas in our case, because we have such a price advantage, it gives them more latitude for scamming or overcharging passengers. Julie, anything you want to add on the Booking.com center on the OTA side?\nJuliusz Komorek: On Booking.com, maybe bookings themselves are in trouble with competition authorities throughout the world and likely to be harder as a gatekeeper under the EU, the supermarket as this year and I think they should consider seriously where they stand in respect to consumers on transparency and the extent of charges that they impose. I think ultimately, they will – how to come to terms with the fact that the age of overcharging consumers with in this is over and they have to work with us.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay, thanks. Next question. Thanks, James. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Savanthi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nMichael O’Leary: Savi, hi.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good morning. Just first question for me on the GDS side of things, you’ve been adding more kind of corporate relationships there. I was wondering if you can kind of give an update on where you – there’s a lot more opportunity there. And if you’re seeing any an improvement in the kind of the mix of business travel or just any kind of color on how business is recovering. And just Secondly, just with the aircraft delivery delays, is there – are you needing to change? And just given how constrained the environment is? Are you changing anything in the way you kind of load schedules in the way you book up schedules given kind of your historical kind of yield passive load factor active strategy?\nMichael O’Leary: Okay, Eddy, maybe you take the GDS point, and then I’ll do the aircraft deliveries and loading schedules.\nEddie Wilson: Yes. I think the GDSs came back, but primarily driven by business travelers. Like as we’ve grown our base network in particular. Particularly post COVID where corporates became much more price sensitive that we weren’t available on a lot of the platforms, but we’ve done a recent deal with Concur, which was a SaaS-based product for people to – for corporates to manage their expense management. And we fit naturally into that. And that will go live, I think, probably from when we signed the deal, it will go live and the APIs now will be working from early April. So it’s just another channel. GDS is growing, not spectacularly. People still go for the naturally gravitated towards our low spares. You look at the recent OTAs that have come through, you can argue they’re a channel, one of them as a channel for our dose who want to have a package channel not material in what we do, but we will continue to develop those channels. But it’s not necessarily going to move to trial. But the one that I really, I suppose I’m excited about is Concur because that will get those small and medium-sized businesses and Ryanair will be presented. And obviously, we’ll have the lowest fares.\nMichael O’Leary: And I think it’s fair to say we’re also – I mean, I wouldn’t underplay never what underplayed the significance of the OTA deals last week we loveholidays and with Kiwi this morning. I mean these deals now give them direct access into Ryanair’s inventory. They are favorable to moving a significant volume of seat and the fact that they are now doing that without screen scraping, but giving their customers the Ryanair airfares and the Ryanair – the real Ryanair ancillary prices, I think, could result in a significant boost in their volumes or that volume of bookings. Turning to aircraft delivery delays is very frustrating. We have been very slow to launch the summer 2024 schedule. I think it’s fair to say, typically at Christmas, we would have about 85% of the summer schedule launch. This demonstrates that we won about 75% of it launch. We have some – and most of that is uncertainty over aircraft. There is still some – we are still negotiating with some airports as well. Eddie and Jason, their team made a major breakthrough last weekend with a new base in Northern Italy where the [indiscernible] region or the test region scrap the municipal attack, which is the first time one of the big Italian regions as strap the municipal tax 650 per departing passenger. These are major advances on behalf of consumers and in terms of our comp. So it’s fair to say that summer ‘24 or schedule – our summer schedule launch has been delayed. We are still at this point in time – we have only launched with the core summer, we’re also late with the some of the summer schedules that we would have ideally have launched in April and May, don’t get launched until June and July because of the Boeing delivery delays. We were supposed to have 57 aircraft from Boeing at the end of April. We will be lucky to get 50 aircraft by the end of June. And that in itself means a lot of the summer business that we would want to do in May and June has been delayed. And even today, we are still holding back about 15 aircraft. We have only – what’s on sale at the moment is about 35 of the 50 aircraft that we have from Boeing. We need more certainty and more confidence that Boeing will deliver those aircraft to us. And there are still a number of announcements to be made on some new routes and maybe one or two bases. We’re in the final part of negotiation. So – and overall, Savi, to answer your question, the aircraft delivery delays in delaying the summer schedule, it is constraining our growth. I mean, it would add another 1 million or 2 million passengers, and we were able to launch these summer routes in May and June as opposed to launching them only at the end of June or in July. That’s still enough to hit the summer peak, but it is very frustrating, which is why I think the next year instead of 205 million passengers, we’ll probably be running around 200 million will be the number for the full year. Next question please.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay, thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Savi.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. On the ETS credits that are expiring, can you just help us think about the magnitude of that relative to the €450 million in fuel savings F ‘25 over F ‘24. In other words, that €450 million, how – what should we subtract from that for the sort of change in the ETS credit recognition?\nThomas Fowler: Yes, Duane, it’s Thomas here. So, we will lose about 20% of the free allowances during next year. So, like we had about just under €4 million free allowances, so about 20% below line in FY ‘24.\nMichael O’Leary: What’s that in financial terms over the years?\nThomas Fowler: It’s about €65 a ton today, so it’s probably about €50 million, €60 million.\nMichael O’Leary: So the fuel hedging savings are about €450 million and the ETS depending on cost of about €60 million, €70 million. Is it?\nThomas Fowler: Yes.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. And the second question, Duane?\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Yes. Just with respect to a tighter OEM market and these lingering constraints, where would you estimate the value of your unencumbered fleet today? Thanks for taking the questions.\nMichael O’Leary: That’s a big question above my pay grade. I mean the value of our existing unencumbered is dramatically higher than anything in the big gift in us and some of our competitors in Europe. Remember, we add all of our aircraft at the net purchase price to the balance sheet. And so you get the benefit in lower depreciation – significantly lower depreciation charges over the next 20 years. I heard one of our competitors last week can talk in themselves trying to explain how they’re doing sale and leasebacks, recognizing a profit upfront, but it doesn’t make a lot of difference over time between us and Ryanair. When the actuated the aircraft ownership costs for that airline are more than double that of Ryanair on a per passenger basis, like just complete note [indiscernible]. The fact is – and I would say also, by the way, the – our delivery book of aircraft, which we priced. I mean the last of the, we still have more than 60 or just over 60 Gamechanger to take delivery of over the next 2 years, we could – they are worth, I would say, probably not far off double what we have been paying for them over the next 2 years and even the MAX 10 Gamechanger, I would say the market is still constrained. I read a story this morning that Airbus are out trying to buyback some of the delivery slots from some of their A320s from the lessors and some of their customers offensively to provide aircraft to United in the States. So, I hope they are very successful, and I hope therefore as a result, you and I could walk away from a load of MAX 10 because we will be the first ones out there looking for additional MAX 10 for delivery in ‘26 to ‘27, if we could get them. But I think it’s the reality for all airlines is that we are all short of aircraft. The OEMs cannot – I mean the more significant thing why we welcome the MAX 9s going back into the air last week, just so that you just take that as the issue of I thought that the most significant intervention by the FAA was Boeing not to increase monthly production. That does represent a challenge for Boeing. It will leave some dissatisfied customers going forward for deliveries in 2020 – remainder ‘24, ‘25 and ‘26. We will still get in, get out 40 aircraft next winter. But I think it is inevitable given the quality challenges facing both Boeing and Airbus, that some of this capacity ramp-up needs to be slowed down. And we still haven’t even taken account of some of the orders that are still out there from the Chinese airlines, the Middle Eastern airlines, some Indian airlines for additional aircraft. Therefore, I think the world is going to be challenged for certainly short-haul aircraft for the next 5 years, 7 years out to 2030. Ryanair is one of the few airlines that has a secured a pipeline of reasonably low-cost new aircraft deliveries over that period of time. And these are new aircraft deliveries that will transform our operating costs because they offer significantly more seats, but at a significantly reduced fuel consumption. So, I don’t think I have ever been more excited about our growth and the possible profitability of our growth in Europe in the next 3 years to 5 years where our capacity is going to be meaningfully constrained. And I think if you look at the pricing of air travel across North America compared to where it is in Europe at the moment, it’s clear that the pricing in Europe has some considerable way to go to catch up in North America. Will it get all the way to North America, I don’t know. Nobody really knows, but certainly, if you were at the lower end of the pricing model, as Ryanair is, I think there is – we have more headroom for price increases over the coming years to cover higher costs, although we will be using our low-cost aircraft and improve fuel consumption to keep airfares down. And I think one of the big difference between us and some of the – our competitor reported last week is we saw average airfares rise double digit in our Q3, whereas their average fare performance was significantly behind that of ours. And that’s, I think in large measure because we are expanding into a lot of their markets. And we are expanding profitably where they are unable to compete with us and reporting losses.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks Michael.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks Duane. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ruairi Cullinane from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Ruairi, hi.\nRuairi Cullinane: Good morning. Yes, the first question, Boeing delivery delays. I saw the previous expectation would be that you would be down around 10 aircraft this summer and it now sounds more likely to be down 7. So, I was wondering what potentially drove this slight improvement. And then secondly, on the modest growth in ancillary revenues per passenger, you previously explained that ancillary revenue should be more stable than fares. But is this driven by you sort of holding back on pricing, or are you seeing some take-up of ancillary products declining in the current environment? Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Neil, I will ask you through the ancillaries, you are calm [ph] here. Just in relation to Boeing, like, it’s a movable feast here. Originally, we thought we would be down five. Then it looks like we were going to be down 10. Now, we think our best guess is that by the end of June, we will be off about seven aircraft. Now, that could be nine, it could be five. We are working. We have eight aircraft deliveries due in May. There is seven due in June, and then there is about nine in July, and we are hoping that we will get some of those July’s into June. I mean I think it’s fair to say we would also take some deliveries to the first 7 days or 10 days of July, but we have said to Boeing that under no circumstance that we have take an aircraft after there is a weekend there a 13, 14 in July. We are not taking aircraft because, frankly, if we are not certain to get them before that, we can’t put them on sale. And so I think we are working well with the team in Seattle. There is a big focus on those aircraft deliveries in June and – or in May, June and the first couple of weeks of July. And we think there is a reasonable prospect that we will get 50 aircraft might be 52, it could be 48. The big driver, though, it’s certainly not going to be 57, and we accept that. And what we have said to Boeing if we don’t get them by that second, we get that second we get in July. We are not taking them until October, which is why, again, our number for next year has moved back from kind of originally 205 million towards 200 million. But it’s movable. We would be hopeful that Boeing will do slightly better. But if they have other unforeseen events like the MAX 9 issue, it might move slightly back the other way. Ancillaries and modest growth, Neil?\nNeil Sorahan: Yes. Ruairi, we are very much on track to what we said we would do this year. And we said we would be up €0.50 to €0.60 on a per passenger basis. That’s exactly where we are going with €23 per passenger in the quarter just end this. And remember, there is a big step-up in ancillaries after COVID, where we have jumped from about €18 a passenger to €23 a passenger today. Longer term, we think we will track ahead of the growth in passenger numbers. So, a couple of percent, 2% to 3% per passenger increase in spend for the next 2 years or 3 years. So, we are bang on where we thought we would be.\nMichael O’Leary: And certainly, I mean again, and I come back to the OTA point, if we can convert a number of the OTAs into partners who are no longer charging for ancillaries, you might see actually an increase in ancillary conversion and some pricing improvement because the people were originally paying €20 or €30 for a €10 bag. They may well – we may convert more and with yields we might get €11 or €12 on average for those bags. Thanks Ruairi. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Gerald Khoo from Liberum. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Gerald, hi.\nGerald Khoo: More than two, if I can. Firstly, on the balance sheet, looking at current assets and the other assets line which sits just below €1.2 billion, I was just wondering what that line relates to? And how and when that might convert into cash? And secondly, on the MAX 10, I know you are first in it where you saw 2 years after the first ones. At what point do you get concerned about certification delays impacting that sort of early 2027 delivery date for yourselves?\nMichael O’Leary: We have got to take the MAX 10. I am going to ask maybe Tracey McCann here, would you that current as the rest of the issue. MAX 10 deliveries, the first delivery – the North American airlines are scheduled to take place at the end of calendar ‘24, early calendar ‘25. I don’t think we would be concerned about our first delivery that we only take 17 aircraft in the first half of 2027. So, I think we will begin to get concerned if they miss the summer ‘25, if the first deliveries of the MAX 10 run into the winter of ‘25, spring of ‘26, I think at that stage, we will start to get a little bit concerned. We don’t honestly foresee there being that kind of a significant delay. These aircraft are – there are kind of adoption slots there in Seattle, in which tone in Seattle for them. I think the issue is more certification. They are still hopeful that the MAX 7 will be certified in the current quarter and delivered – the first one delivered. They are already built and the first delivered to Southwest for summer of 2024. So, I wouldn’t want to be complacent, but I mean I am reasonably happy that we are not the lead customer for the MAX 10. But given that we are taking our first aircraft 2 years after the first scheduled deliveries to the American Airlines, I would be reasonably relaxed. And Tracey, do you want to take that point on the other assets.\nTracey McCann: For the prepayment, payment for the other assets, prepayments of 53 payments from airport tariff is due to [Technical Difficulty].\nMichael O’Leary: And I will just add to that, Gerald, over many years, we have got significant discounts from large suppliers by giving them prepayments and so that will be reflected in the non-current asset line as well as I think you might have been referring to.\nGerald Khoo: Okay. Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks guys. Thanks Gerald. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Conor Dwyer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Conor, your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Conor, hi.\nConor Dwyer: Hi guys. Thanks very much. First question is on pricing commentary. So, if you are currently running low-single digits ahead initially for the summer, and you think you can get to mid to high, is that just as the impact from a late Easter hurdling April and May dissipating, or you think you can get more in the late yields? And then secondly, assuming certification does happen on the MAX 10 later this year and United doesn’t actually take them. How confident are you that you would be able to actually take them and run that capacity? What kind of lead in time would you need for that? Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. On pricing, look, I think the biggest driver at this point in time on pricing is that the first half of Easter is in March and not in April. Easter is still a big driver of forward bookings at this time of the year. Q4 is materially stronger than Q4 was this time last year. We are still expecting a loss in Q4. But bookings through the summer are running ahead of where they were this time last year, both in terms of volumes and pricing. But I would believe – I mean this time last year, we were in a – very straight. We had a very, very strong January, but an awful of that was still post-COVID recovery, people getting out there and booking early. So, we had a very, very strong first quarter. And then pricing softened into the second quarter and third quarter of last year. I am not sure this year, we won’t see pricing at the moment is sort of modestly up. But I would expect it to strengthen further as we go through into calendar Q2 and calendar Q3. I might be wrong, it might, I might be calling that wrong, but that’s the way it feels to me. And I think what we need to see, like we monitor closely some of our A320 competitors, and they haven’t yet in the case of Weeze taken out as far as we can tell, the 40 – or ground in 40, 45 aircraft same with the Valaris [indiscernible]. I don’t think they have finalized where the capacity is coming out yet. So, there may be more to go on that, we don’t know. But I think pricing will continue to drift upwards into the summer of 2024. But we haven’t – there is more to run on that. And I think we won’t have a better feel for that until we get to May and where on the full year results road show. Second point, MAX 10s, I mean if we were to – I mean I would be very happy to start looking at Boeing and the – clearly, we would want to negotiate the price of them. I would be very happy to take MAX 10 deliveries in – for summer in advance of summer ‘26. I am not sure we would be in a position to take in advance of summer ‘25, but I am not sure they can manufacture or deliver in summer ‘25. But someone like United want to walk away from those deliveries over the winter of ‘25 into ‘26 or we could take more aircraft for summer ‘26 and the increased we have 17 aircraft MAX 10 deliveries in the spring of ‘27, I would be very happy to take that up from 7 to 30, 40 aircraft over the winter of ‘26, spring of ‘27. We have more than sufficient demand across Europe for these aircraft and the operating performance of these aircraft is dramatic. But I don’t foresee despite all of that, what I was kind of nonsense commentary on United last week, I don’t see any chances of not taking the MAX 10s. And I am sure there will be a queue not least of rapacious aviation lessors out there and others looking to get those aircraft if United or somebody else walked away from them. So, I mean we are still expecting a number of very large orders coming out of the Middle East and China might also step up to the plate as well. So, if somebody wants to walk away from MAX 10s, I think there will be a queue of people will take them. But to answer to your question, we have to be very keen on taking MAX 10s for summer ‘26, not summer ‘25, that would be too early for us.\nConor Dwyer: Great. Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks very much Conor. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Muneeba Kayani from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Muneeba, hi.\nMuneeba Kayani: Good morning. I just wanted to clarify on pricing for Q4, so fares were up 13% year-over-year in Q3 and kind of what’s in your guidance for Q4? And then secondly, just on capital return and the share buyback. Given the share ownership issues post-Brexit, like, how does that impact your ability to do a share buyback this year? Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Sorry, give me let’s say the second piece of that again, Muneeba, do share buybacks…\nMuneeba Kayani: Just in terms of your ownership post-Brexit. And how do we factor that into a potential share buyback?\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. I wouldn’t get into pricing on Q4. We would never break it down on a quarterly basis. But you can work it back from our full year guidance. Yes, we have narrowed the range slightly, but more to reflect their behavior in Q3. We are still somewhere between €1.85 billion and €1.95 billion. But detail on Q4 pricing and our cost, we wouldn’t get into at this point in time, Muneeba. On EU share ownership, we continue – we are the only airline that is very close to 50-50 EU ownership. Other competitors like easyJet and Weeze are way below 50%, but that’s a matter for the EU commission not for us. I do believe, though, that if we did a share buyback, I think we would probably be looking at trying to buy ADRs and ordinaries, I think it would be in our interest to do both. Although it is – in the past, we have found it easier to buy ordinaries in Europe. It has been very difficult for us to buy ADRs. One of the challenges we faced with the ADRs is they tend to be quite tightly held by a number of very large institutions in the U.S. And when we come looking to do share backs, they all go buy somebody else’s ADRs. But if we are unsuccessful in executing share buybacks of ADRs, we would simply buy more ordinaries and then over a period of time, as we have done in the last 2 years since it continue to use the fairly draconian powers we have to dis-apply non-EU buyers of the ordinary shares. But I would think the working theory – my working assumption would be, if we are returning cash to shareholders by way of further share buybacks, we would probably split that 50-50 between the ADRs and the ordinary set, so that we balance the EU ownership rules. Thanks Muneeba. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Paterson from Peel Hunt. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Alex, hi.\nAlex Paterson: Good morning everyone. I just wondered if you could give any more color on the commercial agreement you have got with the GDSs and now with two OTAs. Are they paying exactly what a customer would pay if they book directly on your website, or are there any fees in between like an API fee or anything else?\nMichael O’Leary: And is there a second one?\nAlex Paterson: No, that was it – for everybody else.\nMichael O’Leary: So, I mean what we are trying to do, there is no – we don’t charge them anything. We are very willing to give people direct access into the GDSs and the OTAs. They – I mean the critical thing for us is to eliminate the kind of illegal screen scraping. And if we can kind of eliminate the illegal screen scraping, that makes it much more difficult for these kind of OTA pirates to exist. They get direct access to our fares and ancillary prices in our website. They undertake, so what we do – I think what we do is we feed them from the cost of the inter-digital piracy by giving them the direct fee. And they in return agreed that the booking will be made on the – in our website, directly in our website. So, we have the contact with the customer, both the e-mail contact and the payment details. And they agree that they will not levy any fees or charges on our underlying airfares or ancillary. That does not necessarily preclude them from charging some kind of fee for their services as many travel agents now do, but it has to be an identifiable fee for say, the loveholidays, for example, they made that they generally do package holidays, they may take something or they may make their money out and what the other elements of the package they sell. But the customer booking with them on Ryanair is paying the underlying Ryanair airfare and the underlying Ryanair ancillary prices without any inflation, price inflation or price distortion. And we don’t, at the end of the day, have a difficulty if – as with the GDS distribution of travel agencies want to levy a fee for what they serve. As long as the customer knows that that’s the travel agent fee, we don’t have a problem with it. We think ultimately, over time, it would be difficult, consumers will certainly move away from travel agency fees if the fees are unreasonable, and we will just increasingly book directly in the ryanair.com website. But critical to all of this is protecting the consumer from overcharges and then not having some OTA in a position like Booking.com is with the hotels where they control hotel distribution, and they charge them 15%, 20% of revenues for the distribution. It may work for the hotels, but that certainly wouldn’t work in a low-margin industry like airline industry for us. Eddie, do you want to add anything to that?\nEddie Wilson: Yes. I mean it’s just like when the APIs are fully functioning out there, you will see that people – it will be absolutely clear in the case of somebody buying a package of the elements that they are buying. And they will see that they are getting the Ryanair price, the Ryanair ancillaries, and there is no ability within that flow to add on extra charges. So, in that sense, it will be very transparent for air consumers because some of the most egregious complaints we get here are from consumers who buy through pirate screen scrapers. They don’t get adding of that, what you guys don’t get any emails to service emails and they are the ones that turn up at the desk and didn’t realize they can get any of the three or four emails the time had to check in online beforehand. So, when these things are up and fully functioning, we have done the deals and while we are working on them in the background and the APIs are up there, you will see how transparent it is.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Thanks Eddie. Thanks guys. Next question, please.\nOperator: Our final question we have time for today is from Neil Glynn from AIR Control Tower. Please go ahead, Neil. Your line is now open.\nNeil Glynn: Good morning.\nMichael O’Leary: Neil, hi.\nNeil Glynn: Just two quick ones then. The first one, crew rostering, I mentioned a number of times. And I just wanted to check, I think you are up running at 5.8 at the moment versus 5.4 historically. Should that 5.8 continue into this summer, or is it likely to be higher? And then the second question, more big picture. Pre-COVID, the fourth quarter was generally profitable. And I appreciate this clearly a range of factors driving a heavy loss this year. But to what extent do you think the seasonality of your earnings has structurally changed? And if that’s the case, might it have any ramifications for how you deal with unregulated airport contracts, for example?\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Eddie, maybe you want to take…\nEddie Wilson: Yes. I mean the crew rostering isn’t – the crews per aircraft is just one of the inputs there. I mean where we have made very large inroads is on the support systems that we have here in terms of computerized systems that we have in the operations control center that helps us particularly on meltdown days, which manages hours properly and then spread them more evenly. So, the crewing ratio, like I mean, is there – there is no significant increase. We are keeping it at the same levels that we have, which would be – it would be in the range of 5.4 to 5.8. But it’s – I wouldn’t see it going beyond that. There is no need to hit anywhere near 6 or anything like that. But some of this is a function of the number of smaller bases that you have. We are getting much better at managing hours, particularly in the peak. So, don’t see any sort of more upside that on crewing. But that will be traditionally higher than where we would have been. And if we didn’t have this ATC environment, French ATC strikes and that we would probably – we should be able to pull that back. But that’s some distance away.\nMichael O’Leary: I think it’s something we are working towards. We are pushing hard with the European Commission. I guess the European Commission may want to protect overflight particularly overflights over France. It would dramatically transform both on-time performance and the ATC disruptions across Europe. And with European elections coming up this year, it’s very depressing and that Europe hasn’t moved on this. They are great for talking about the single market in order of underline depending what you are doing to protect the single market, and yet the French shutdown the single market for air travels 57 days last year, complaining about Macron’s pension reforms that didn’t even apply to them. So, we are continuing to campaign for that. Seasonality, look, it’s a seasonal business, and I don’t think you are going to ever get away from that. We make – the vast majority of our profit in the first two quarters, the first half of our year, which is the June and September quarter. I don’t see any reason why the third quarter or fourth quarter shouldn’t be kind of breakeven or why they should be see – where they should be loss-making. But there are a number of issues there at the moment. And we are – one of the challenges is that we gear up for a lot of summer growth. And with most of that gear-up takes place at the end of Q3 and Q4. We have to start the recruitment of pilots and cabin crew, training of pilots and cabin crew, we tend to take a lot of the aircraft deliveries from Boeing in the first three months or four months of the year without having being able to deploy those aircraft or use those aircraft in service. So, there is a disproportionate weighting of cost into that fourth quarter without if you like, the commensurate revenues. And that’s why – but Q1 and Q2 then tend to be very significantly profitable. I mean again, I would try not to get lost in the short-term or in the quarterly stuff. I think the key message here is, even with the – on this morning’s numbers, and we are back at where we are at the end of January, we are on track for it to make over €10 net profit per passenger for the first time since a number of years. I think that €10 net profit per passenger will be the kind of baseline going forward. I think there is a reasonable prospect plus or minus uncertainty in geopolitical events that, that number might move upwards from €10 towards €11, €12, or €13 over the next couple of years. Particularly as we get more and more game change for MAX 10 aircraft into the system where we are carrying materially more passengers per flight, but burning significantly less oil. And I think what’s really – my key take-away from this year’s numbers is we are about to make €10 profit – net profit per passenger in a year when our oil bill went up 30%, 40%, we went from being hedged at $65 a barrel in FY ‘23 to $89 a barrel in FY ‘24 and yet our customers were willing to pay modestly higher airfares, better performance than ancillaries at a time when most of our competitors are still losing money or reporting reasonably modest profitability for the full year. So, this is a very impressive model. The costs are heavily controlled. We are widening – hugely widening the gap between us and our principal competitors in Europe on airport and handling costs, aircraft and ownership costs. And I think that will continue for the next couple of years. So, I have – I think we have a reasonable expectation that the – despite the kind of the surprise or the sudden impact of the OTA on the Q3 numbers we will have a strong year of profitability. And I think realistic prospects of strong pricing through summer ‘24, which will deliver another year of strong profitability in the year ended March ‘25. Neil, I think that’s as much I can add on the seasonality. Any other questions?\nOperator: We have no other questions. That does conclude our Q&A session for today.\nMichael O’Leary: Great. Okay. Thanks very much, everybody, for participating in the call. Neil is going to do – is going to have a roadshow date through London today, France and our Platinion in Frankfurt, trying to persuade more. Neil?\nNeil Sorahan: That’s correct, yes.\nMichael O’Leary: Yes. I would try to encourage more European share ownership here. It’s not that we don’t love the Americans, we do. But we are going to need more Europeans on the share register. In the meantime, we will continue to try to execute and deliver. And thank you, we are not doing a roadshow on the Q3. If you are in Paris and Frankfurt want to meet with Neil or me, other than that if anybody wants to come see us here in Dublin over the next coming months, please feel free to do so. And other than that, we will see you at the full year results roadshow in May. Thanks very much everybody. Good to talk to you. Bye-bye."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Ryanair Holdings plc H1 FY’24 Earnings Call. My name is Maxine and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions] I'll now hand you over to your host, Michael O’Leary, Group CEO, to begin. Michael, please go ahead when you are ready.\nMichael O’Leary: Good morning, everybody, and welcome to the Ryanair half one results analyst call. You have seen this morning on our website, we loaded the half one results, there's a full MD&A, and a Q&A with myself and CFO, Neil Sorahan. But just to focus on some highlight pieces, obviously we've had a very strong Easter and record summer traffic that resulted in a very strong half year profit rising at EUR2.18 billion and we expect over the full year now that a profit after tax of about EUR10 per passenger is likely to be achieved and we've declared our first ordinary dividend, it's not a first dividend, but it's certainly our first ordinary dividend has been declared this morning. Highlights of the half one traffic grew 11% to EUR105 million. We maintain a very strong 95% load factor through the summer period. Again, I keep coming back to the point, we're operating in a constrained market in Europe, and that is good for traffic. It's good for load factors, and it's certainly been good for average fares. Revenue per passenger is up 17%, that's a combination of average fares up 24% and ancillary revenues up 3%. We opened three new bases and 194 new routes in summer 2023. We've now, the fleet of Gamechangers is now up to 124 aircraft. The total fleet at the end of September is 563 aircraft. Our fuel bill rose sharply because we were so well-hedged in the prior year. So, in the half year, our fuel bill rose EUR600 million, that's up 29% to EUR2.8 billion. However, we've continued to judiciously extend our fuel hedging program. We remain 85% hedged for FY24 at about $89 per barrel, well below the current spot. And, but we're happy to report that we're now about 53% hedged for FY25 at about $79 per barrel, locking in a saving of about $300 million on the first half of the fuel we need for FY25. Net cash at the half year-end stood at EUR840 million, that was up from EUR560 million at the 31st March, despite the fact that we repaid over a EUR1 billion in debt during the six month period. We remain committed to Boeing the new 300 Boeing MAX-10 order will we believe underpin low fare profitable growth for a decade to 300 million passengers by FY34. And this morning, the Board has announced a EUR400 million maiden ordinary dividends and has also rolled out a dividend policy, which I'll ask Neil just to comment on further in this call. Turning a briefly to growth in fleet this winter, we'll operate six new bases, Athens, Belfast, Copenhagen, Barcelona Girona, Lanzarote and Tenerife were returning to base in the Canary Island. We will operate over 60 new routes including our first 17 routes to Tirana in Albania which opened last week with some success, high load factors and strong customer impact. To-date over 90% of our summer 24 capacity is already on sale including over 180 new routes. While Boeing are suffering delivery problems particularly with their fuselage supplier Spirit, we continue to work with them to minimize these delivery delays ahead of 2024. Boeing have contracted to deliver us 57 Boeing MAX aircraft between now and the end of April, we're not sure they'll deliver all 57, but we're certainly confident that we get about 45 to 50 of those aircraft by the end of June which will be in time for the summer peak in 2024. And that will be critical to our traffic growth next year. We continue to see a constrained supply situation across Europe. And I think that's fundamental, not just Ryanair’s strong results in this half year, but also a very strong result reported by many of our competitors in recent weeks. Eurocontrol have confirmed about the Europe is operating short-haul, Europe into Europe is operating about 94% of its pre-COVID capacity. We see no danger that it will return to a 100% of its pre-COVID capacity for the next two or three years. Consolidation continues to be a theme in Europe. We see the Lufthansa closing in on the takeover of ITA. TAP in Portugal is now up for sale. And the SAS refinancing sale is already underway and it looks like Air France KLM will take a 20% stake in a refinance SAS leaving fewer and fewer independent players out there. I continue to believe that Europe is inexorably moving toward the situation that has prevailed in North America aid of having probably four large airline groups, each of them capable of carrying about 200 million passengers a year, and three of the big legacy guys Lufthansa, Air France and a KLM and IAG and Ryanair being the large low fare point-to-point carrier much like southwestern state. Now, added to that capacity constraints story though with the continuing inability of the OEMs to manufacture both Airbus and the Boeing to accelerate deliveries. They remain challenged on their existing deliveries, both Airbus and Boeing are running maturity behind because supply chain challenges going also with their production issues with Spirit. And, I think also the Pratt & Whitney engine issue is a large and as yes, not well, factored into capacity story for summer 2024. Europe is the home of A320 Ryanair is the only significant to 737 operator across Europe, and the fact in which the engine is fundamentally an A320 issue. We expect there to be material groundings of competitor capacity through the summer of 2024, and we think that would run into 2025 as well, due again because of the pressure on engine. So we see a very little prospect of Europe returning to its pre-COVID capacity between 2024 and 2026, and we think therefore that will continue to show up as you underpin strong pricing, even if a consumer demand is challenged there will be less capacity than there was pre-COVID, and I think the price of that capacity will be higher. We've certainly seen that amongst the legacy airlines in Europe, Lufthansa, Air France, KLM and IAG materially increasing airfares. They're already high airfares, and that will say quite a high ceiling over which, Ryanair is seeing a passengers trade down towards Ryanair but at higher fares. And that's reflected in our outlook and guidance where in the third quarter, for example, the end of December, we are seeing average airfares currently running as mid-double -- the mid-teen ahead of prior year. We're clearly growing strongly. We're carrying out of traffic. Cost is well under control and that takes the -- and our cash generation is strong. I mean, the Board has now begun to again look at capital allocation policy. We set out a clear policy since COVID but as we recovered from COVID, the first priority was pay restoration and multiyear pay increases for our people. That's now been done. Secondly, we set out pay down our remaining debt, and we paid down two bonds of over a EUR2 billion over the last two years. We have two bonds left in 2025 and 2026 of about EUR2 billion that we intend to pay those down in their entirely, which will make Ryanair remarkably a debt-free company in Europe in the next two years at a time when the higher for longer interest rates, the bond yields looks like it's going to drive up financing costs for our competitors. Most of whom have very significant net debt positions in Europe. Once that's done, we also then want to continue to fund our aggressive CapEx program, and we're taking delivery of 50, we hope 57 aircraft between now and summer 2024, and that will lead us then to another 30 aircraft in time for summer 2025. The plan is to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade rating. The MAX-10 order book will deliver annual traffic growth to EUR300 million. We think we'll do that largely out internally generated cash flows, but we will continue to be opportunistic. I think it's interesting that between FY08 and FY20, Ryanair has returned EUR6.74 billion to shareholders via buybacks and special dividends, and we're turning now to an ordinary dividend policy as well as today returning the EUR400 million by way of dividends to our shareholders, which is the EUR400 million they invested in Ryanair during the peak of the COVID crisis. I'll ask Neil just to comment on the dividend policy in his remarks. In terms of outlook, we continue to target approximately 183.5 million passengers in the year to March ‘24, that's up 9%. The final figure might vary a little bit. It depends on Boeing meeting some are most delivery commitments between now and the end of April and they are running behind. And we had hoped to have 20 of these aircraft delivery for Christmas. We are now thinking it looks like we'll only get ahead of them. As previously guided, ex-fuel unit costs will increase by about EUR2 this year, but that still means that we will have a materially wider cost gap between Ryanair and competitive airlines across Europe. Forward bookings, both traffic and fares are robust over late October midterms and into the peak Christmas travel period, and with the benefit of this constrained EU capacity this winter, we currently expect average, Q3 average fares to be ahead of the prior Q3 by about a mid-teens percent. Unhedged fuel costs will be significantly higher, but that's only 15% of our fuel for the remainder of this year. As is normal this time of year, we are very limited to Q4 visibility, Q4 is traditionally the weakest quarter and this year will be impacted by the partial unwind of free ETS carbon credits from January although it will benefit from the first half of the Easter period at the end of March. Despite uncertainty over Boeing delivery, significantly higher fuel bill very limited Q4 visibility and the risk of weaker consumer spending over the coming months, we now expect that full year ‘24 the profit after tax will finish in a range of between EUR1.85 billion to EUR2.05 billion, assuming modest loss us over the second half winter period. This guidance obviously remains hugely dependent on the absence of unforeseen adverse events for example, such as the war in Ukraine or in Gaza between now and the end of March 2024. As I said, I think we're on-track to return to what we believe is our normal profit after tax of about EUR10 per passenger carrying a 183 million or 103.5 million passengers. This is a very strong performance but while the number looks big a profit of EUR10 per passenger is reasonably modest given the capital and the human resources that go into delivering an exceptional service to our customers, high on-time performance, and a very low cost base, which will enable us to continue to pass on markedly lower airfare to our customers at a time when huge capacity constraints in Europe, our competitors are all pricing upwards very aggressively. Neil, do you want to add some remarks on dividend and take us through the MD&A, please?\nNeil Sorahan: Yes, sure. Thanks, Michael. Well, as you pointed out there, we're well along the road on our path to achieving all of our capital allocation priorities. The next step is to look at some form of a dividend in the past. As Michael said, we engaged in kind of ad-hoc distributions, buybacks, and ad-hoc one-off dividends. We're now at a size and scale and I think a maturity where we can sustain an ongoing dividend policy and the Board have this morning agreed that the first maiden dividend will be EUR400 million, which is marginally above our long-term prior year payout ratio, but reflective of the EUR400 million, which our shareholders contributed in the depths of COVID, which enabled us to raise that EUR850 million bond and come out of COVID strongly. So that's approximately EUR0.35 per share. Half of that will be paid in February as an interim dividend, the balance we paid after our AGM in September. And then when we look into next year FY25 onwards, what we're looking at a payout ratio of approximately 25% of prior year profit after tax, again, a bit roughly 50-50 interim final dividends in February or March of each year and after the AGM each year. So, I think that underpins the Board's commitments to return funds to our shareholders, but they've also left the door open. So, to the extent that we continue to have a very strong balance sheet lots of liquidity, and we're meeting all of our other commitments, if the reserve is cash, then the door is left open to look at other forms of distributions be that buybacks and/or ad-hoc dividends depending on where the markets are at that point in time. Just to briefly build on a couple of the other points that Michael touched on. Balance sheet is in phenomenal shape, BBB plus rates over 530 aircraft unencumbered at period end, which gives us a huge flexibility in what we do. And importantly, thanks to the strong cash in the business, we're in a unique position where we're paying down debt rapidly, we paid down a EUR1 billion alone in August just gone a EUR750 million maturing bond and EUR260 million are revolving credit facility. So, that gives a huge competitive advantage over everybody else when they're extending leases at high lease rate due to the Pratt & Whitney GTF issue and indeed refinancing themselves into rising interest rate environments. We're paying out of our own cash resources of balance sheet in great shape and has enabled the Board this morning to engage in that dividend policy. I've nothing further really to add, Michael.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Thanks, Neil. Maxine, we can open up to Q&A now. If you can ask everybody to just confine themselves to two questions. And what I'll try and do is pass it direct questions around to members of the team so we can get as many of the management team on the call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Jaime Rowbotham from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Jamie, Hi, good morning.\nJaime Rowbotham: Hi, Michael. Good morning. Thanks for the presentation. Two questions. So, very encouraging to hear that you're third quarter fares could be up in the mid-teens. I know the visibility is limited for Q4, but could you give us a feel for the range of outcomes you've considered in coming up with the full year profit guide in terms of fourth quarter fares, please? And then on the non-fuel unit costs per passenger, which I calculate were up about EUR2.5 in the quarter. I know this still leaves you a country mile below your peers, which is the critical thing. But could you perhaps just talk about where there might be any flex, any risks up or down to unit cost rising by around EUR2 year-on-year in the second half, please? Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Thanks. And as for the first part, Neil, you might do the non-fuel unit cost. It doesn't, at this point in time, I think the very fact that we've given you full year guidance this morning separates from the rest of the industry, despite the fact that we're six months out. We are seeing strong pricing at the moment in Q3, but it's very fragile. That pricing is largely driven by a very strong midterm break at start of October and strong forward bookings into Christmas. We are and have cut out significant midweek loss making capacity. I think we are flexing that trajectory. It worked well for us in the last two years and we continue again this year. It is just too early to focus on Q4. Our yield ambitions are modest. We do expect that Q4 will be a loss, I think we lost about EUR150 million in Q4 of last year, the prior year. And I think we're looking at something maybe similar, maybe slightly bigger. We have the unwinding ETS will be a bit of a penalty in Q4. And a lot of Q4 will depend on the strength of the Easter traffic. We get the first half of Easter in the last seven days of March. But if there are adverse developments in Ukraine, there are adverse developments in Gaza and the situation in the Middle East is very fragile. All of these forecasts could be thrown off kilter. So, I think the very fact that we've given you a range of full year guidance is a strong signal today that we think we're in good shape for the winter, but we recognize that it could be thrown off by some adverse developments. Neil, non-fuel unit cost, do you want to take that?\nNeil Sorahan: Jamie, how are you doing? We're still fairly close to the two year guidance on a full year basis since we come out in May. Happy to stick with that despite the fact that we're going to be a few aircraft shy of where we thought we would have been to spread the costs over more passengers. Where are the risks, there's a risk that you could see higher spike ups in the likes of route charges in the first quarter of calendar 2024 than we're anticipating. There's a risk that we get left significantly shy on aircraft and then we're handling more crews over less aircraft. But I think we're comfortable with the EUR2 that we have, I think we'll be give or take a couple of cents either side close to that number on a full year basis. It's fact been to the increase in the crews that we would typically have in Q4 ahead of the peak summer. It factors in the inflation we would have seen in some of the handling and maintenance side of stuff over the course of the year. And then of course, it factors in the lower cost Gamechangers, coming into the fleet over the next number of months and the airport deal. So, I'm fairly comfortable that will be close to that, that EUR2 on a full year basis.\nJaime Rowbotham: Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Jamie, as you recall from slides four of our presentation, as you're right to say, it is a country mile ahead of the gap that's getting ever wider between other competitors, many of whom are in a net debt situation facing rising finance hospitalizing aircraft leasing costs. Next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jarrod Castle from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Jarrod, hi.\nJarrod Castle: Hi. Good morning, Michael, Neil. Michael, do I say you sound rather proud of Ryanair's performance over the summer and indeed over the last few years. And you're now speaking about a small loss over winter, but if you made a small profit, I mean, effectively you could achieve your incentive scheme target. Now, I guess besides being very incensed by the share price, I mean, do you think the Board needs to then look at a new scheme, or do you think existing schemes are for purpose for yourself and senior management? And then just secondly, you spoke about new routes opening up over winter. Can you talk a little bit about how much of that's been impacted by your thinking around your exposure to MENA and moving capacity around given the current situation and potential for people to chase the winter sun elsewhere? Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. I might ask Andy Wilson just to do the new routes for the winter commentary. Just looking at the various share option schemes and the health tips from winter. I'd come back and think there's a possibility we could get close to the enhanced profit target this year. At the moment, I think we'll fall into a short but who knows. But I think those teams have been appropriate, like even if we hit the target this year, myself and the rest of senior management team still we have to remain in full time response to finances. I think it's 2028 [after those ahead] (ph). I think it is important that somewhere, I mean during the previous five years, the management team weren't able to hit the share options through the combination of COVID and the war in Ukraine. And it is important I think for management and not just me, but the wider management team that the share options or assets are achievable. They're working their asses off to deliver these kind of numbers. And I think it's important that there's some we've said the board is a very ambitious target that's a profit of factor $2.2 billion or a share charge price of EUR21, but even if we hit those, management team will still have to remain in full time employment 2028 for those -- for them to benefit from it. So, not alone, is it important they're achievable, but they also mean that we're tying into management we get medium long-term commitment from the senior management team to continue to deliver the impressive performance and results. Adding new routes for the winter. Do you want to give it a comment beyond kind of new routes and maybe Jason McGuinness might comment on that as well?\nJason McGuinness: Yes. I mean, I think like our growth is demonstrated by the agility that we have in terms of what has happened in the Middle East. For example, we would add just north of 100 weekly frequencies into Israel working very closely down there. I mean the airspace is well managed. But obviously tensions are the conflict has escalated there. So most of the European carriers aren't flying in there. But we're able flipped out in terms of 95% of that capacity, we can reallocate because it comes from 23 different basis. So it's relatively straightforward for us to do that. There is some softness in places like Jordan, but again, we've got the ability to flip that capacity around. But on the other side, of course, we continue to grow strongly in the canaries. We have two new bases there from winter on winter. It's a new base, but we've had it there since summer of this year, both Lanzarote and in Tenerife, both going up by one aircraft. And then you look at what we're doing in Morocco, you'll have seen our recent release where we're meeting with the head of government down there who have seen Ryanair in terms of developing not just summer sun, but certainly year round traffic into that market, which is a mixture of VFO and also winter sun. And we continue to grow strongly in Southern Europe where people still go to Malaga, Alicante, Seville, Southern Italy, Sicily and Sardinia. So, we take a very conservative approach in terms of how we spread those routes. And we always have the ability, as opposed to reverse routes and reallocate capacity as we did at the start of the conflict in the Ukraine.\nMichael O’Leary: And Jason, we're opening 17 new routes into Savannah and now they knew during in November the winter will be mad?\nJason McGuinness: Yes. So they started last week. They've all started very strongly. I've been very surprised how quickly all the seats are filling and we'll certainly be growing in China in summer 2024. Like, I think we would be close to 2 million, 2.5 million passengers in Toronto over the next 12 months. And it's certainly a base candidate over the next 12 to 18 months, Tarana is trying out for a low-cost carrier, and we've seen that in terms of reaction from consumers. But generally, across these winter demand, the strong across CEE, Scandinavia, Italian domestics are very strong. I think that's helped by what we've done on the schedule that you alluded to earlier. 70% of our capacity now for winter 2023 is at the weekend versus 65% last year and 60% prior to COVID. So there's been a lot of work done by the revenue scheduled team to deliver that and it's paying dividends across Q3.\nJarrod Castle: Thanks very much.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Furlong from Davy. Please go ahead your line is now open.\nStephen Furlong: Good morning, Michael. Yes, two questions, please. Maybe if Thomas is there, you can talk about the, any updates on SaaS and also how the winglets are performing in terms of fuel efficiency. And then kind of in that vein, I just want to ask Neil about, I know it's the first quarter and Q4 is going to be at the unwinding of the free allowances on ETS. And can you just talk about that and that overall scheme? And obviously you've been paying ETS for 10 years, but the freelancers go over the next couple of years, that'd be great. Thank you.\nThomas Fowler: Yes. Stephen, just on the SaaS side, so obviously in recent weeks, we've added done some fuel with OMV in Vienna. We've picked up some SaaS, so it gives us more access to different feedstocks, and we're working hard with another one of our field partners to hopefully selling in MOU and with them to increase our target like our percentage target. We're at 9.5% today with this if we get this MOU over the line, we'll be above 10% of our staff will be doing through MOUs. On the winglets, we've been happy with what's installed today. We're seeing close to the 1.5% savings that we disclosed on the winglet side. So yes, it's going well and we hope to roll out another 100 over the winter to get to 130 by the end of the maintenance season this year. So we'll see more of an impact come true with more on the Margaux on the aircraft. On the ETS side Steven. So yes, as you said, the allowance to start rolling off in Q4, which is an impact. So like we have about 25% of our allowances compared to Q4 last year will be gone under ETS. This quarter which will impact on Q4 profitability and also our hedge rate has gone up from about to quarter on quarter compared to FY 2023 and FY 2024 which will have which is the impact Neil and Michael have been talking about in ETS in Q4.\nMichael O’Leary: But I would add into that too, like you also have three ETS allowances even unwinding for the legacy guys who have far more of their free their traffic covered by the free ETS. So I think again that's one reason why we're seeing some aggressive pricing from the legacy shortfall across Europe and can save market base driving up the headline fare, particularly in countries like Germany, where Lufthansa has a near monopoly, Air France, KLM, same in the Holland and in France. And I think that's driving up our airfares, the extent which competitors are dramatically increasing their airfares. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dudley Shanley from Goodbody. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nDudley Shanley: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. If I could ask two slightly longer-term questions, first of all, if we think about the problem with the GTF issue coming on top of the delivery delays from Airbus and Boeing, how do you see that playing out in terms of the outlook for fares over the medium term? And then switching to consolidation in Europe, which seems have picked up recently. Obviously, there's a lot of deals going on. Which deals do you think will happen? How do you see the end game here? How does Ryanair position to take advantage of it?\nMichael O’Leary: Let me see. We'll add that to instead of me, I mean, medium term affairs Eddie and Jason McGuinness might add on to that and then I'll come back in on the consolidation. So Eddie, Jason on medium term fares.\nEdward Wilson: We have seen already that we've guided sort of our mid-teens in terms of Q3. But I think a lot of what's going to happen at a micro level with the GTS issue is going to be where some of our competitors where our competitors are going to allocate that share, going to allocate that capacity in particular markets. And we've seen a lot of them announcements of base aircraft that just don't add up to the total fleet. With some of our competitors, we've seen a retreat in places like in the Italian domestics which Jason has said like where fares are actually becoming more robust. I wouldn't like to sort of call it as a sort of a macro level where fares are going to go to, but certainly at a micro level, it's going to be where that capacity is allocated with our competitors, but with reduced capacity and no new aircraft coming online from the OEMs I think we're still going to see -- I think we're going to see like fares continuing to rise against that backdrop where economies continue to grow. And there isn't any capacity there to match it. So I think fares still in the like certainly over the next 12 months, we're going to continue to rise, Michael.\nMichael O’Leary: Jason?\nJason McGuinness: Jason here. I think the -- sorry, I just didn't hear you there, Michael.\nMichael O’Leary: Give you a certain chance to have a fair, so I don't think that's a general trend over the next couple of years or two or three years.\nJason McGuinness: So I think the general trend is upwards over the next number of years and that's entirely based on the capacity environment. Like, if you look at this summer, the mark was recovered to 94%, 95%, but that includes Ryanair growth. Without Ryanair growth the market this summer is only recovered to 90%. And I think the market isn't going to recover our competitors that is much above 90% into S24 S35 for the issues we've outlined. So that leaves a market that hasn't grown for the last four years. And I think you're seeing that across certain countries, be it Austria, Germany, Belgium, which are all significantly below where they were prior to COVID. And that's all helping the pricing environment at the moment. And it is -- in terms of our growth then, we are growing. We are growing in the likes of Italy, UK and Spain, which is delivering solid fares. And I think they'll be solid over the next number of years.\nDudley Shanley: Okay. Thanks for that. In terms of consolidation, I have long believed Europe is moving reasonably towards four large carriers. If you look at what's going on at the moment Lufthansa Air France KLM and AET all are interested, I think longer term, it probably belongs to better in IAG. Because of the Latin American government carried, Latin American kind of influence of IAG, but Portuguese are always wary of the Spanish that they're somehow closed the EAP base and moved to Madrid. I think if you look at what IAG has done with Aer Lingus, they've demonstrated they can continue to grow Transatlantic business to Heathrow and Dublin and did it successfully. SAS is a croc but I expect to get probably stuck together with Norwegian and you've got a bigger croc up in the Scandinavia and Air France Canada, they going to take a 20% stake in that refinancing? That really needs only two sort of smaller independent players left in Europe, which is easy to get, focused around Paris, Switzerland and Gatwick. I don't believe in the next five years, there'll be an independent there. I think there will be subject to M&A activity and with probably a mix of Air France, KLM and or IAG. And at least Wizz, I would have said Lufthansa would probably buy Wizz and give it a footprint back in Central Eastern Europe. [In Greece] (ph), I think as Wizz grows in the Middle East, perhaps it may be way with Middle East and interest will be able to acquire the Middle East and we'll be able to get access to aircraft. But I think if we return in five years' time, I think you're going to see a European market that looks remarkably similar to North America today with four large substantial airline competitors three legacy guys, Lufthansa, Air France KLM, IAG, and one very large low-cost point to point. Ryanair will be the southwest of the US, except that Ryanair fares will be materially lower than those in Southwest after 10 years of consolidation in North America. Southwest average fare last year was about $140. Ryanair's average fare across Europe was about -- was under EUR50, which does show we are materially lower, cheaper and lower cost in Southwest, but it gives us significant headroom for us to grow our business and I think modestly grow airfares in a consolidated capacity constrained market over the next three to five years. In a manner that will enable us to pay down our debt refund our aggressive CapEx and be able continue to put in place multiyear pay deals for our people. Next question please, I think.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from James Hollins from ExaneBNP Paribas. Please go ahead, James. Your line is now open.\nJames Hollins: Hi, guys. Good morning and many thanks. Just a couple for me. On the unit cost, I need it not to work for year 25, but Neil, perhaps the way you're thinking about unit cost, so this will give us some indications on trends. And I'll probably be mainly thinking about wages and whether the pilots in particular start agitating for a bit more from their deals. And then secondly, what is it you know that the rest of the airlines don't know that [indiscernible] is pretty sanguine about their Pratt Whitney issues, but you're calling it out as very significant for them. Just run us through your thinking on why percent of share bigger than some of the airlines are letting on? Thank you. And I might ask maybe [Neal Mcmahon] (ph) to come in on the what we are – gives our update on what we think we need about the Pratt & Whitney issues.\nNeil Sorahan: Okay, James. It's a bit early to be talking about FY25 unit costs and that we haven't done our budget at this stage, but what I am sure about is that we'll continue to keep the gap that exists between ourselves and everybody else on the unit cost. We have multi-year agreements in place with our unions. There is modest inflation coming through on the back of those, but that's something that we will cover through other areas of the business. For example, we've already locked in about 300 million worth of savings on our fuel bill based on the hedging that we have into next year, but it'll be likely May before I start to give you color on unit costs for FY25. I need to get the budget over the line with the board first.\nMichael O’Leary: And Neil, what we got on the Pratt & Whitney issue [indiscernible]?\nNeil Sorahan: Yeah, so we know that Pratt & Whitney have significant issues with the GTF engines which will affect over 20% for Wizz and kind of 5% to 10% for other carriers around Europe. The reason why we think this is significant is we know that MRO slots are already full for this winter. This is an unexpected issue that wasn't planned into the maintenance schedule for the engine, for the engine shops. And therefore, we're likely to see delays or our competitors are likely to see delays for engines to come out of the shops. This will increase the lease costs. We already know engine lease costs have increased. So airlines who are looking to lease in engines are seeing prices soar because there's the scarcity of lease engines. And we think that this is going to have a significant impact on capacity for S24 might not be baked into other airlines numbers yet, but I think as we go through the winter, they're going to see that the turnaround times for engines are going to be significantly slower that's going to materially impact capacity for S24.\nMichael O’Leary: I mean, we take the view, James, about there's anything between 5% and 10% of the European short haul A320 fleet is going to get grounded through most of next summer, which again will further constrain capacity. Some competitors, [indiscernible] will be more affected than others or they have some new deliveries, some deliveries, new aircraft deliveries. This is an issue that affects the Lufthansa, Air France, IAG, short haul fleet. And if Europe is operating at 94% of pre-COVID capacity today, there's consolidation continuing, which will mean more capacity will be taken out. The OEMs are running behind both Airbus and Boeing are running behind on their deliveries. I mean Boeing is likely to leave us up to 10 aircraft short of our 57 deliveries before the summer of 2024 and you add this Pratt & Whitney issue on top. Again, I think there's going to be a real challenge on inter European capacity next summer. We will add maybe 40, 45, 47 aircraft. But overall, there's no chance that Europe returning to its pre COVID capacity next summer. We will see more Asian visitors, I would hope next summer. I think that under -- gives us a reasonable prospect of another strong summer of profit and pricing, and that's already reflected in strong forward bookings. Forward bookings already for winter -- summer 2024, either this early date are running significantly ahead of where they were this time last year. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alexander Irving from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nAlex Irving: Good morning, gentlemen. Two for me, please. First, on capital structure. So how much liquidity do you see is required on an ongoing basis? Think about this, the reference to the announced dividends, which suggests your net cash position will continue to grow. Is that in line with your expectations? Second, drilling into cost a little bit more. So your airport and handling cost per passenger was up 11% year-on-year in Q1. 13% in Q2. What's driving that please? And should we take the current levels per passenger as rough indication of what's stable? Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Alex. May Tracey, maybe you might take the second part of that question. As you look at capital structure and Neil come in if there's anything you want to add. I mean, I think we're historically, we want to be in zero net debt position as we pay down debt aggressively. I think the board is of a view that we should keep a reasonably size of a chunk of cash far the inevitable crises that this industry and whenever we think we can do aircraft deals. So I think moving forward over the next number of years, we'd want to keep $3 billion to $4 billion of gross cash on the balance sheet, which is the number we've been operating at for about the last five or six years. We will though pay down the last $2 billion of debt in 2025, 2026. We haven't -- we are going to go through a two or three year period through 2025, 2026, 2027, where there's a material dip in CapEx because of the gap between the last of our max game changer deliveries with the last, which is due in December 2024 for summer 2025 and in the first of the [Mac10] (ph) is not used to deliver until the spring of 2027. So there's likely to be a strong upward pressure on free cash flow over the next two or three years. As long as trading isn't disrupted by adverse events and again, I think our comments this morning is that we intend firstly to use that to on employee pay, secondly pay down debt, third, fund CapEx. And then anything that's fair or leftover will be returned to shareholders. We're setting out this morning an ordinary dividend policy that would be 25% of net profit after tax. So for example, this year, we're now guiding somewhere just under $2 billion in net profit We would hope to be carrying a dividend of somewhere close just under $500 million for next year. But if there's a surplus over that over the next two or three years will be opportunistic. There might be special dividends, there might be share buybacks, but we have to be conscious of the fact that we will start to reference CapEx again through FY 2025 into 2026 and the start of 2027. Peak CapEx will be around on the [Mac10] (ph) order will be around 28, 29, but hopefully traffic will continue to be strong. Profitability with very low cost base and widening cost gap between us and competition. We continue to be strong I think capacity constraints in Europe means that pricing will be strong. And that should leave us in a position to be able to fund modest, a reasonable shareholder returns. Tracey, will you talk to in terms of airport and handling cost please?\nTracey McCann: Yes. So there's two things right in the airport and handling. So higher ATC costs 72s and that so local air traffic control costs at airport, you've seen an increase. And after termination of some of the COVID reliefs that we were getting the benefit of last year and probably the other driver in that is handling in that. So a little bit of labor inflation in the handling costs across Europe.\nMichael O’Leary: Cost degrees, Alex, is, so is less than half of the airport and handling cost increase. Some of our competitors have been reporting in recent weeks. So there's materially more airport and handling cost inflation at the main airports that are being operated out by our competitors? Therefore, widening the gap again. Next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harry Gowers from JP Morgan. Please go ahead Harry. Your line is now open.\nHarry Gowers: Just two questions. I mean, average fares up 15% in Q3 looks very strong. So are you somewhat surprised by the strength of the fares given concerns over the health of the consumer more widely. And I was wondering if there was any potential one off benefits in there in Q3, for example, from maybe the Rugby World Cup. And then just any comments as well on Q3 on where you expect the ancillaries per pax just in absolute terms or year on year? Thanks a lot.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Neil, I ask you to comment on the ancillaries. On repairs, Harry, they're strong in Q3. Again, I think that the critical driver of fares here is not individual events like the Rugby World Cup, which were nice, but not materially across -- we're carrying almost 500,000 passengers a day. The Rugby World Cup is that [indiscernible]. What's really driving air fares here is the consolidation, capacity constrained story in Europe, the material -- the dramatic increase in pricing that is being leveraged by the life of competitors Like Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG, who are starting with average fares that are 4, 5 and 6 times those of Ryanair, particularly if you take the German market where Lufthansa is [received] (ph) as the national champion has seen off a lot of capacity easyJet and ourselves have removed a lot of capacity from the German market in the last few years in the face of ludicrous airport cost increases, man, German, government taxation, security charges, et cetera. Lufthansa -- the German market is the one that is weakest, it has recovered only about 80% pre-COVID. But short-haul airfares in Germany have more than doubled. And everywhere you go in Germany, people complaining about Lufthansa's pricing. But that's what you get when you get a national champion like Lufthansa, you get screwed. And I think that is going to continue to play itself out. Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, IAG, are going to -- are losing more in percentage terms. Their free ETF reduction from January next year is much more meaningful on their short-haul traffic than ours. There's much greater upward pressure on their cost and their ability to increase air fares. And this capacity constrained story which has largely been playing out in North America over the last decade is beginning to roll out across Europe again. Europe is entering a period where airfares are going to be modestly higher, the combination of government imposing ludicrous environmental taxation. We have our own ADS transport minister in Ireland, has just nothing to push back and get the ETS. So nothing to push back against French ATC strike. Yet happily rings his hands despite the fact that we're in Ireland, the property of Europe. So airfares across Europe are moving, I think, upwards and the really dramatic but not well-understood capacity-constrained story, I think we'll continue to play that much as this is through December of 2024 and into December 2025 as well. We see no easement in these capacity constraints. And what really drives Ryanair fares is the extent with Lufthansa, Air France-KLM and IAG are driving up their air fares, and they are driving up their air fares to an eye-watering extent at the moment. And Neil, ancillary.\nNeil Sorahan: Yes. Harry, as we've been kind of saying all year, we expect on a full year basis, ancillaries are up kind of EUR0.50, EUR0.60 per passenger year-on-year. So you're probably looking at similar to the first half, about a 3% increase over the second half. And then thereafter, it's kind of 3% to 5% per annum growth area, depending on John sitting here beside me what he can do for me on dynamic pricing and other things. But we've had a phenomenal step up from EUR19.70 per passenger pre-COVID to EUR23.70 per passenger now, and it's growing at a relatively steady state of kind of 3% to 5%.\nHarry Gowers: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question comes from Savanthi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead Savanthi.\nMichael O’Leary: Savanthi hi.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good morning. In terms of investing for resiliency, I would imagine that you're kind of keeping the buffers that you put in place currently. But as you kind of head into summer 2024, are you planning on kind of making any additional investments or additional buffers? And then secondly, just kind of curious on the MAX – with the MAX delivery delays, I'm guessing you're not going to be able to take advantage of this. But what are the kind of the -- what does the NG pricing look like these days in case you wanted flexibility?\nMichael O’Leary: Sorry, Savanthi, you broke up at the start. It's the first half of that question and I missed the second half was MAX delivery delays but I wasn't sure what the question was. Can you repeat it again, please?\nSavanthi Syth: Sorry. Yes. Just on the -- more so on kind of NG pricing. Like what are you seeing today if you want to take advantage of it, not that you probably can given the delays?\nMichael O’Leary: Sorry, is that NG pricing? Is it?\nNeil Sorahan: Yes, I can take that, Michael.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay, Neil. Sorry, I didn't hear it again. If you heard her say, will you answer please, and the first half as well, December, 2024.\nNeil Sorahan: Okay. Well, just on resilience, Savi, I don't think air traffic control are going to be more to improve, but I'll ask Eddie to deal with that. I'll talk about NGs first. I mean, the market for NG is very hot at the moment. The phone is ringing off the hook of people trying to buy NG of us, the leasing companies, lease rate factors have increased quite significantly. So it wouldn't be minded to go out and try and lease anything from them. So I think we're very happy just to operate what we have and to continue to work with Boeing to accelerate and speed up the pace that we're getting the MAXs into the fleet. But yes, NG is holding values very well. I think Eddie is going to answer the question on resilience.\nEdward Wilson: Yes. Just I think what, [indiscernible] on operational resilience is coming out post-COVID where we were just better prepared than all of our competitors by keeping everybody employed and keeping everyone current our crews and our aircraft current. And we've tried to work really, really hard to sustain that advantage. And you can see that, I think in a lot of the recovery or lack of recovery from our competitors who appear reluctant to get back to full recovery. Some of that, I suspect is driven by sort of meltdown days where ATC dropped everybody in it. And what we've tried to do is have additional crews built into the system and that gives us -- I mean, we're able to lean into that because we're still a growing airline as ATC hopefully will recover in terms of its capacity over the next number of years, we'll be able to pair back crewing levels to what you would need in a normal busy season. But those of you who are at the Capital Markets Day will have seen what John's team, along with Neil's team and Darryl as well in terms of building IT solutions to make best use of those crews so that we can get through those parts of the like on meltdown days, that are happening more frequently. But it's something that we're not crowing about. There's a lot of hard paddling under the surface here to keep that operation going. And we've invested heavily in technology, heavily in manning not just in terms of crews per aircraft, but also in our ops control center. But we have to continue to invest. We're not being complacent in any way about that.\nSavanthi Syth: Eddie, just to clarify, so just the incremental investment won't be that much greater than what you're seeing today, right? I mean it's not going to be another big headwind into the next year.\nEdward Wilson: No. I think what you're -- like we have to look at all of these things on a sort of a micro level, don't forget we're spread over 93 separate basis, and there's always room for improvement as to how you grow that. And given the data that we have now, that will inform our decision. But I don't see a step up. But my instincts would be to have -- to increase that slightly, but I don't think it's anything material just because we're going to get into -- we're on a long-term growth trajectory here and that means then that you're going to -- we sort of fine-tune your accruing ratios as you take delivery of aircraft as well. So I'd rather have slightly more than slightly less but not material.\nSavanthi Syth: Okay. Thank you.\nMichael O'Leary: Thanks, Eddie. Savi, I'm sorry, I couldn't hear the question probably. Next question please Maxi?\nOperator: Next question comes from Ruairi Cullinane from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead your line is now open.\nRuairi Cullinane: Good morning. It looks like relative to Q1, your hedging position on fuel is advanced, but not so much on FX. So I was just wondering if hedging was paused or what drove that? And then secondly, a longer-term question. And you've got two years of slower fleet growth around 2025, 2026. Do you think that could be a more difficult period to restrain unit costs? And as a result, is there silver lining to Boeing delivery delays? Thank you.\nMichael O'Leary: Neil, you want to take the question on hedging. I mean you or Thomas can do the hedging, and I'll do the two years of slower fleet growth.\nNeil Sorahan: Yes. On hedging, we're very pleased with the level of hedging that we have in place just under 89% for the second half of this year at about $890 a metric ton and well hedged into next year, over 50%, and in fact, close to about 56% in the first half of the year at savings of $790 a metric ton. What's changed in our hedging policy, not a huge loss. We're possibly not going out with a higher percentage as we would have done in the past, but that's a factor of our competitors' balance sheets not being as strong, and they've not been able to get access to hedging line. So that's why we had a number of options this year where we effectively capped out the worst case scenario and then had downside participation. So you may, over time, see us doing a little bit more on auctions. But we continue to have a kind of 12 to 18 month rolling policy. We're well hedged out to now at the end of March 2025, and we'll continue just to build up on that over the next number of months. Similarly, on the currency side, we continue to run a very active OpEx book, we were hedged at $108, the current year in euro dollar, we're hedged at about $111, $112 into next year. And again, we'll continue to build that over time. So no, we're continuing to execute on us. We continue to have huge hedge lines with our counterparties and the treasury team have never been busier. So we're pushing on.\nMichael O'Leary: Okay. And two years of slower fleet growth. I mean if anything we're facing almost three years of slower fleet growth, we will take -- if Boeing can meet their delivery commitment, we get 57 aircraft for summer 2024. We get another 30 aircraft for summer 2025. I think they'll miss some of the summer 2024 and therefore, it will even itself out. We'll pick those up for summer 2025. We will have nothing new for summer 2026, very little for summer of 2027. I think we take 17 aircraft from January to May of summer 2027. So it's not by choice, but I think the two or three years of slower fleet growth don't have -- it gives us a bit of a pause in the organization before we start a decade of aggressive growth. It does take some of the pressure off recruitment and training over that period of time. It may create some challenges, but I think we're facing challenges, I think, on the labor front anyway in the next year or a couple of years, I think we've reflected that in what has been the pay restoration and generous pay -- already generous pay agreements in place with [indiscernible] across Europe. But that inevitably, the upside of the silver lining of that is, it further constrains capacity. I mean the only airline delivery material capacity growth across Europe is December of 2022, December 2023, December 2024 is Ryanair. And we ourselves will be capacity constrained through the summer of 2025, 2026 and 2027. Now I think we'll continue to see significant churn of our operations during that period. We will continue to do aggressive growth deals with ambitious airports. And therefore, we will churn more aircraft out of expensive airport at Dublin, for example, where again they're planning to build EUR250 million on a total to going nowhere is just, again regulatory game playing. They just want to desperately weight CapEx on some of the airlines there. Neil is right. None of us want a stupid that only goes across to where the cargo aircraft are parked. And even this, their government is spending EUR230 million out of time when they admit themselves, that Dublin Airport has a planning restriction of traffic cap of 32 million passengers. So the [indiscernible] Dublin Airport have done nothing about this planning cap for the last decade, while traffic is rising to 32 million passengers. And so Dublin is now capacity constrained. We may well have to take aircraft churn aircraft out of Dublin. But Dublin is kind of exploited by coming up, and they're looking for about a 17% cost increase over the next year or two in passenger charges. So airports like that, that are badly run badly managed and are inflating on justifying the inflating cost, we'll see I think we've churned some capacity out of places like Dublin and put them into other much more growth incentive markets like Spain, Italy, across Central Europe at the moment in Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Czech Republic, the Baltic states, we're seeing ambitious airports putting in place very enlightened discount schemes for growth, Morocco, as Eddie said, Albania are going to be areas of significance. So there will be more churn in our business over those couple of years. And I think that's good for the business. It keeps us on our feet, it will keep us aggressive and it will also help us to keep -- put pressure on mismanaged airports like Dublin, who continue to exploit the regulatory regime to unjustifiably increased comp at a time where they should be lowering fees and trying to drive growth. Next question Maxi.\nOperator: The next question comes from Muneeba Kayani from Bank of America. Please go ahead Muneeba, your line is now open.\nMuneeba Kayani: Two follow-up questions, please. The first one, just on the dividend for this year. Can you talk about why you have a EUR400 million dividend instead of a payout for fiscal 2024. And just to clarify, so in the scenario that you think there is surplus cash, could there be a specialty or share buyback even for next year? That's the first question. And then secondly, on your pricing comments for fiscal 3Q, do you think that your pricing trends are better than the overall market? Do you think the market is also seeing similar mid-teen pricing and/or you're benefiting from the trade down that you talked about earlier? Thank you.\nMichael O'Leary: Okay. Dividend this year for EUR400 million. Well, if we paid out 25% of last year's profits [indiscernible], it would have been about EUR350 million, EUR360 million. And the Board felt that it sent a strong signal to the market and also to shareholders. But if we rounded that up to EUR400 million, it would repay the shareholders, including myself, I might add who put her hands in our pockets during the depth of COVID and invested EUR400 million at a time when nobody was able to raise equity in the airline industry. And I think that's an effective signal. The shareholders who stood by us during COVID and who wrote those difficult checks during the very difficult COVID period are seeing that return. Is there a prospect of special dividends or share buybacks next year. I mean the answer is yes, but it all depends on trading. It all depends on how the cash flows develop. And it will depend on what the Board decides to do. I mean we will continue to be conservative and judicious, but you have our assurance is that excess cash will be returned to shareholders whenever we're confident that we can meet our payroll commitment, our debt repayment commitment and our CapEx commitment. Do I think Q3 will be better than the overall market? Yes. I think what's driving the overall market across Europe is very aggressive price increases by Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, IAG, easyJet and others and they're all pricing materially above Ryanair, and average airfares are in the case of easyJet double Ryanair in the case of the legacy, they're 3, 4, 5 times higher than ours. And if they're going up, seeing average fares rise by a high single digit this winter and I think they are because of the capacity constraints. They are driving more and more people, more and more customers and their families in the direction of Ryanair taking low fare air travel, and we're seeing strong forward bookings and strong pricing. And I think that's why off a much lower base we're seeing a strong and I think that would continue off a much lower base. We see stronger pricing in the Ryanair model as Europe consolidates or continues to consolidate over the next through two, three, four years as capacity continues to be materially constrained. And I think in the summer 2024, as many of our competitors will be grounding aircraft because they know probably with the engines operate them. I don't know, Eddie, you want to add anything on the Q3 better than the overall market?\nEdward Wilson: Not really. I think you sort of covered it off there. I mean like it's what we've seen before where I hate to use the phrase but sort of trade down. But as people become more price sensitive, they -- I think you're quite wise on what you're saying, that migration of people. And in a lot of cases, given our size and scale, we have more frequencies and two more airports as well. That gives us that a little bit extra, I suppose, in terms of uplift. Yes, nothing really to add on that.\nMichael O'Leary: Yes. I continue to be amazed. I mean the amount of the handwringing going on, particularly in the analyst community, consumers under pressure, and they are under pressure, speaking very frankly. People don't stop flying. In other sectors, people trade down to little and all the -- they buy their furniture in IKEA not in some department store. And as there are very strong performance over the last two years, and we're now carrying 22%, 23% more traffic than we did pre-COVID in an industry across Europe, that's operating at about 94% pre-COVID capacity. People are trading to the lowest cost provider, which in every market in Europe is Ryanair. We're also happen to be probably the best on-time performance. So we're delivering great service at lower prices. We're now doing that on aircraft like the Boeing MAX where we can carry more passengers but burning less fuel and delivering very material operating cost efficiency. So I think this is now a time for our expansion. We were desperately working with Boeing to try to get as many of those 57 aircraft we can in time of December 2024 because if we don't keep that expansion going, then consumers across Europe really will be screwed by the Lufthansa, Air France and the high fare national champion, all of whom received billions of subsidies during COVID from Europe taxpayers and they're -- and gratitude [indiscernible] scalping those taxpayers for extraordinary eyewatering airfares. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Sathish Sivakumar from Citi. Please go ahead your line is now open.\nSathish Sivakumar: I got two questions here. So firstly, on the forward booking and you pointed out that saying it's actually much better than last year. How does it like evolved as we went into this quarter for the Christmas period as well as into the Easter next year. And then the second one, any update on the potential risk from the Italian government on the price gap, that will be helpful. Thank you.\nMichael O'Leary: I missed -- I didn't get the second half of that, Sathish. I got the first half, I'll deal with. Look, we see, at the moment, all of the forward bookings into the Christmas is strong, the February school midterm break. Ski is running, bookings and fares are running ahead of the prior year, and we have the first half of Easter in the last week of March. So I think we remain reasonably optimistic on pricing for the second half of the year and into Q4, although we always have to qualify that we have availability to Q4 visibility. And I didn't get the second half of the question, if Neil or Eddie did, please feel free to answer it.\nNeil Sorahan: Yes, we might get Juliusz because he wants to answer this one on the price cap.\nJuliusz Komorek: Sathish, on the pricing I think I got your question, but you can correct me if I answer a different one. I think we've had pretty much pricing in Europe guaranteed an EU law since 1997 and all governments recognize that it's there and that it's an integral part of the success that European Aviation has enjoyed over the last nearly four decades. What the Italian government has done over the summer, I would not take it too seriously as a serious well-considered step. It was part of a decree, which was passed, I think, on the last day before the government checked out for the summer break. At the same decree talked about a tax on Italian banks, which the government then had to walk back from and some measures about the taxi industry, which apparently is a mass in Italy today. The European Commission, which we often criticize in those calls were maybe not being quick enough in terms of sorting out ATC in Europe or air traffic control strikes and so on. It was actually incredibly helpful in the context of this Italian situation. They stepped in and put a lot of pressure on the Italian government to reverse that decree when it comes to attempted control prices between mainland Italy and the Italian Island. And I think this is a very good lesson for all the other governments that might have ideas of similar sorts feeding populous agendas, don't go there because you will end up before the EU court and not prosecuted by airlines by the European Commission.\nSathish Sivakumar: That’s helpful. Thank you.\nMichael O'Leary: Thanks, Satish. Next question please Maxi.\nOperator: The next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead, Duane, your line is now open.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Good morning. It's been a very comprehensive call. Just one from me. So air traffic control constraints are really not new in Europe. It's something you've been dealing with for several years even pre-COVID. We're hearing much more about these issues in the US. And so just curious, how do you design your network to achieve high utilization, low unit costs despite the constraints that you live with. I mean if there was a moment maybe five, 10 years ago where you said, look we have to operate differently because of this, what are the changes you made from a network design, network planning perspective?\nMichael O'Leary: I mean I think Duane, to answer that question, ATC has been a much greater problem challenge for the industry in Europe than it is in the US. Europe's ATCs are fundamentally mismanaged, underproductive and ridiculously expensive compared to North America. The biggest challenge continues to be not just the cost of that, but the environmental impact of flight delays, long flight plan. We've been campaigning aggressively for now two or three years at least the simple issue is during ATC strikes, which you tend not to have in North America [indiscernible]. But in Europe, we'll be dealing with particularly the French 64 days of ATC strike this year so far. We're calling for the protection of overflight because of the geographic location of France, if they -- France uses minimum service legislation to protect its domestic flights and cancels all the overflights. And we think it should be reversed the other way. Europe should be protecting the overflights and cancel French domestic flights. That one initiative would probably remove some 70%, 80% of the impact of ATC strike and not just [EC] (ph) strike and would have a very significant impact on the environmental impact or the environmental damage done by European ATC today. I think we're seeing some movements on that. Europe itself has spent billions over the last 30 years on a single European skies project. They have made not 1 millimetre of progress on it. It's a complete waste of time. I personally believe Europe could deregulate air to air traffic control each individual like they did with the airlines. They should allow the air traffic control providers to compete against each other to provide service. That will be a much more efficient way, force them to compete against each other. But as long as very small ATC unions have a disproportionate power and you have weak European governments who are willing to stand up to these with the way Reagan did with the American aircraft [indiscernible] day back in 1980, I think we will continue to be bedevilled by ATC delays, inefficiency and screwups in Europe. I don't know, Eddie, you want to add anything further on that or Neil, maybe on finance?\nEdward Wilson: Go ahead, Neil.\nNeil Sorahan: Sorry, Eddie, just in terms of design, so there's been no fundamental change in design, but it has resulted in, we've had to increase resilience, so crew and resilient because we have to now factor in, there's going to be more ATC delays than there would have been five, 10 years ago. And if we just use the example of the UK, the NASS collapsed on the 28th of August, which resulted in the closure of UK airspace and widespread cancellations because of the increased resilience we had by -- that was on the Monday. And by lunchtime on Tuesday, our operation was fully back to normal despite having 20 aircraft in the wrong position the night before. So I think that's where we're seeing, there's an increased resilience, higher accruing ratios to factor in rather than an aerospace redesign or a network redesign.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Thanks, Ed. Next question Maxine, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Patterson from Peel Hunt. Please go ahead, Alex. Your line is now open.\nAlex Patterson: Good morning, everyone. And, two quick questions, please. Firstly, just on your October traffic, your load factor was slightly lower than the prior year. That's the first down year for a long time, were there any anomalies in that month anything to cause that? And secondly, just on the 737 MAX-10, obviously there's been delays to the back, say there's been problems with various engines and so on. What if that isn't certified bill delivered on time what would you do run existing fleet for longer? Are there any other levers you can pull? Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Thanks, Alex. October 5, it was off 1% is a rounding issue. There's nothing material in there. We could have engaged in seat sales that would have artificially driven it back up just to the sake of it. I think that's the wrong thing to do. We're happy to let the load factor go up 1%, fall 1%. We hit our target for the month. The only thing I would point to do is that there was a very steep falloff in loads on the flights to Jordan and also obviously the Israel, the situation, the Israeli Hamas conflict. At the start of the month, we were operated by [Stewart] (ph) from Israel. There was a dramatic increase in no shows and a collapse in bookings. Much the same way we had in into Central and Eastern Europe when Russia invaded Ukraine in February of 2022. I know there's anything untoward in that. There's nothing we would call out that we expect to we're running slightly ahead we are year-to-date on load factor and expect to hit the full year load factor targets. On 737, MAX-10, remember, our first delivery are until January 2027. It's Boeing expect the MAX-7 to be certified either this side of Christmas our early first quarter of 2024. We think that then rolls on. They expect that will roll on, but the FAA will certify, I think, the MAX-10 sometime towards second half of 2024. It might slip into early ‘25 but we are a long way behind the lead customers on that. So, I don't think there's any particular risk to our first deliveries of MAX-10 aircraft in January ‘27 given that it'll be three or four years behind the original transportation aircraft. If what would happen yes, we would simply I mean, again, it would further constrain capacity if there's any delays to our MAX-10 deliveries in 2027. It would further constrain capacity across Europe where, again, Airbus and Boeing to be challenged on their delivery positions. But I would be reasonably confident that we get those deliveries on-time in the first half of 2027. Neil, anything do you want to add on the Boeing side?\nNeil Sorahan: We'll just add that if there was a delay and I don't anticipate because as Michael said, they're on-track to hopefully deliver the first seven out of ten of the lead customers next year. But, if there was a delay, we'd sell less of the NGs. We've penciled in 150 NGs due to exit the fleet as the 10s come in. So, we just manage that within the business, but with every expectation that we'll be getting the 10s in an early 2027.\nAlex Patterson: Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Alex. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gerald Khoo from Liberum. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nGerald Khoo: Good morning, everyone. Two for me, if I can. You've talked about 90% of summer 2024, capacity being on sale. I was just wondering why is it 90% are you holding some back for potential Boeing delays or is there another reason for that? And secondly, there's a big gap between the increase in average fares and the increase in ancillary revenue per passenger. I was wondering why you're taking so much of the current strength in demand in fares rather than ancillary? Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. The summer 24, Jason, you might have added some comments on this, like we're at 20%. That's about normal time of the year. In fact, it's more normal. We don't need about 80% of summer 24%. Top of things happen there, but we're not sure about the last of the Boeing 10 aircrafts delivery. Things are still airport negotiations ongoing about new basis, new routes and we're still paying off. So we haven't yet finalized those allocations of the existing fleet. So, that's 90% already I'll say that's higher than it would have been in previous year. Is there a big gap between average fares than ancillary. Yes. We're priced active load factor active, what's driving the strong growth in average fares is the strong upward pricing being, that's being delivered by our competitors across Europe in a constrained market. When again, I would point Lufthansa, maybe Germany is only recovered to 80% of the pre-COVID compared to others. If the two are not the same ancillary, we will tend to get over [balanced] (ph) well advanced ancillary revenue business. It does tend to clip up a couple of percentage points ahead of traffic growth. It's up 3% per passenger in the half year, but it is something to far less pricing fluctuation or pricing volatility than underlying airfare. In a crisis or a downturn, average airfare like that I expect would fall in a capacity constrained consolidated market like Europe I think the rest of the year underlying air fares will rise but I'm pleased we'll continue to turn them along doing what they do and it's a much more reliable source of income, as well as we use the average fares to make sure that we hit the low prices and fill all our flights. Jason, anything you want to cover on 90%, summer 24 sale?\nJason McGuinness : No, like you covered off there, 90% we're actually ahead of where we would have been previously. So more capacity percentage wise on sales for ‘24 than we would have previously. And like there's two other factors at play. There's the potential for two or three new basis next year, but that will depend on how the negotiation progress over the next number of weeks. And likewise, where we feel there's unjustified cost increases into 2024, we're keeping some of that capacity off sale while we negotiate for airport. So, we will not be accepting unjustified airport cost increases into next year. So, that covers off the 10%, Gerald.\nGerald Khoo: Thanks very much.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Thanks, Gerald. Next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Conor Dwyer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, Conor. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Hi.\nConor Dwyer: Thanks very much. Hi, guys. So, the first question is regarding the excess cash and how best to give it to shareholders. So, before you expressed the preference for the special dividends, but this morning seems to be a bit more of a balance between these and buybacks. So, I'm just wondering if that is just because the decision has been made officially yet or if cheap valuation is making a buyback a bit more attractive now? And the second question is just around pricing growth, it’s a very strong through this period and sounds as though it's benefiting from the headroom you've built up over the last few years. So, I'm just thinking, do you think that can extend beyond this period and that you can probably pace market fair growth over the next few years because you're already talking about an overall market environment to a fare growth should be pretty, pretty attractive? Thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: I mean, I think you're asking on the pricing growth over the next few years, I think we are the Board, we had a meeting last week. I think we are slightly changing dynamic. I had expected we'd be looking to return surplus cash through, special dividends for the next year or two. We had surplus cash. But the way our PE has de-rated historically, we've been on a 15 times PE most, but we're now down under 10%, at 8% or 9%. I think, I look across the states as I've witnessed at 15 times PE, but with less profit, higher cost, less growth but it is what it is. But I think if, if, our multiple continues to be as insipid as it is or has to have derated over the last number of over the last 12 months. I think it's incumbent on the Board to reassess that we returned cash to fair cash by dividends or share buybacks. And I would be very strongly in favor, restarting share buyback if our PE multiple continues in single digits. I think we're vastly undervalued for the performance we're delivering in a market in Europe is consolidating and maybe near pricing for the next few years.\nNeil Sorahan: Yes. Well, I think in fairness, Jason and Eddie covered it fairly well recently, but capacity is going to be the key driver of our pricing for the next couple of years. The market remains constrained, likely to remain constrained for a various number of issues, including the Pratt & Whitney engines, the lack of availability of new orders this side of 2030 and the consolidation play. So look, I mean, nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, but I think there's more risk to the upside on the downside as we look out over the next year or two.\nConor Dwyer: Great. Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Conor. Maxine, I think it gets pretty fast. We've done an hour in 20 minutes, and I have to go there to a TV issue in 10 minutes. So we do two more questions, please I then going to cut it off.\nOperator: That does conclude our Q&A sessions for today. So, I'll hand back over to Michael for any closing remarks.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Thank you very much everybody. I think we've done an hour and 20 minutes and which is very exhaustive coverage of the results. Thanks to the team for what I think has been a very strong six month performance. Thanks to our customers who continue to support here as we continue to do as far as the path on lower orders and exceptional on time performance in the European market phase which will continue to be challenged by capacity constraints for the next couple of years, consolidation, OEM delivery delays and I think the Pratt & Whitney engine will become a much bigger and more challenging issue for our competitors in the next in summer 2025. And I think we've had extensive roadshow, I think about 12 or 14 different teams on the road. I'm in the state, Neil, I think it's also in the state for the rest of the week. Eddie and the rest of the team are covering off Europe. If you'd like a meeting or please feel free, contact [indiscernible] Citi. And we'd be happy to try and fit in a meeting if anybody wants to come and see us in Dublin, over the coming weeks, please feel free to do so. Peter Larkin, head of Investor Relations would be happy to take the call to set that up. With that, thank you so much everybody for joining us this morning. Look forward to seeing you over the next week, and let's hope that there would be a peaceful outcome of the current situation in Gaza and in the Ukraine and that we can all get back to at carrying more passengers at lower fares than our competitors across Europe and hopefully rewarding shareholders for their support during the very difficult period. Thanks very much, everybody. Hope to see you later on this week. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

        "date": "2023-07-24 21:19:08",
        "content": "Operator: Hello. Welcome to the Ryanair Holdings plc Q1 FY'24 Earnings Release Call. My name is Maxine, and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to your host, Michael O'Leary, Group CEO, to begin. Michael, please go ahead when you are ready.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome to the Q1 results conference call. As usual, this morning, we posted the results release, an extensive MD&A and a video Q&A with myself and Neil Sorahan and that went up on the ryanair.com website at 7 O' Clock this morning. So I refer you to that, and I'll take it as read. I'll give you a couple of comments on the results and a few thoughts and then we'll open it up -- I'll ask Neil just to give his couple of comments on the MD&A and then we'll open it up for Q&A. So you've seen this morning, we reported a Q1 profit of EUR663 million. The number is materially distorted because of -- it's compared to Ukraine affected prior year Q1 PAT of EUR170 million last year. Last year, you'll all recollect Russia invaded Ukraine on the 24th of February, it caused a significant collapse in traffic through March and into Easter. And it also meant if you recollect, we aggressively dumped prices in the Q1 of last year. Prices we reported this time last year, average fares this time last year were down 4% on pre-COVID, as we were aggressively kind of trying to restore load factors through Q1 so that we could kind of underpin Q2. And I think that's important, and it's something I want to stress a couple of times today. So we had a very -- we very aggressively dumped prices in Q1 last year. And so the kind of the growth of EUR170 million to EUR663 million is a function of the very weak prior year comps. This year's Q1 was helped by a very strong Easter, strong demand, good pricing. We had a second UK bank holiday in May, so we were the beneficiary of that. So over the quarter one, traffic rose 11% to 50 million passengers. Revenue per passenger was up 27%, as again, that kind of average fares were up 42%, but that's distorted by the fact that average fares were down 4% in the prior year Q1. Ancillary revenues were up 4% on a per passenger basis. We took, at the end of the quarter, we're operating 119 Boeing 737-8200 Gamechangers. The total fleet at June was 558 aircraft. We've opened three new bases and 190 new routes for the summer '23, three new bases in Belfast, Lanzarote, and Tenerife all of them performing well. We've extended our fuel hedging. We're 75% hedged for FY'24 at $89 per barrel, a little bit above current spot rates. We're 27% hedged for FY'25 at $74 a barrel. If we were able or willing to extend that hedges, if we could hedge all of FY'25 at $74 a barrel that would be a saving of almost EUR1 billion into next year's earnings FY'25 earnings. Net cash at the quarter end was strong at just under EUR1 billion, up from the EUR0.5 billion at 31st of March and again, thanks to the excellent work that Neil and the team have been doing, our rating has been upgraded by both Standard & Poor's and Fitch to -- from BBB to BBB+. The big development in the quarter was obviously the 300 MAX 10 aircraft order, which we signed with Boeing in May. This order gives us a decade of further growth in Europe in a marketplace where capacity is constrained. The industry is consolidating, Ryanair has access to another 400 very low-cost aircraft. Another 100 MAX or Gamechangers to then 300 MAX 10 which will enable us to renew the fleet, but also grow traffic at a more controlled rate at 300 million passengers by FY'34. Just in terms of growth, again, I think we and the rest of our competitors continue to be a beneficiary of structural EU capacity reductions following COVID. There was numerous EU airline failures or fleet reductions during COVID. We continue this summer to see volatile oil prices and higher interest rates, which is discouraging weaker unhedged airlines from adding capacity. There is a shortage of aircraft, both new and lease that I think will run on until the end of this decade out to 2030. This summer in Europe, there's no doubt we're seeing the benefit of a very strong influx of American visitors to Europe helped by the strong dollar. We're starting to see a meaningful return of the Asian traffic to Europe, which means that European short-haul capacity remains constrained, but demand is high. And so through H1 this year, we're seeing strong demand, load factors high, airfares which were very strong in Q1. They would be modestly up in Q2, but not by what we had and what we saw in Q1. Remember, Q2 last year, we had a very strong Q2. We reported after -- profit after tax in Q2 last year of EUR1.2 billion. And we expect average fares will be up, but it will be a small double-digit percent, something in the mid-teens. European airlines will continue to consolidate over the next two or three years. Lufthansa are moving to take over ITA in Italy. The sale of TAP in Portugal is now actively underway. There's a large backlog of aircraft manufacturer, OEM aircraft delivery. And we believe that's going to continue to constrain capacity growth in Europe for at least the next three or four years and will assist us as we continue to expand our fleet. I think will mean we'll see growth with strong traffic demand. And I would hope to see modest airfare rises over the next two or three years. But I suspect they'll be modest compared to the very strong pricing we saw in Q1. The critical thing here is in Ryanair, our unit cost advantage over all EU competitors, our fuel hedging, our strong balance sheet and our low-cost aircraft orders, which now will run out to 2020 -- 2033, a decade coupled with our industry-leading operational resilience will create very significant growth opportunities, and I think there will be profitable growth opportunities for Ryanair over the coming years as we grow to 300 million passengers by FY'34. In terms of fleet, the Gamechanger fleet stood at 119 aircraft at the quarter end. It will rise to 124 at the end of July. We've already taken the first four of those July deliveries. Boeing hope to deliver the last aircraft either on the -- we think Friday, the 27th or Monday, the 31st of July, so we will just have all 51 aircraft in for the peak August travel period. Boeing has suffered multiple supply chain challenges, which has caused repeated delivery delays. We had hoped to be out of these at the end of July. But already, we're seeing, they've notified us of delivery delays in the autumn deliveries, which have been hit by the strike in Spirits in Wichita, the collapse of the bridge over the Yellowstone River. We already have agreed to Boeing that some deliveries will be delayed. Our last delivery for FY'24 -- for summer '24, which were to have been in April '24 will now be delayed to June 2024. But hopefully, we can take all those aircraft by the end of June '24 and therefore benefit with that continuing growth through the peak months of July and August. In May, we signed the order with Boeing to purchase 300 Boeing MAX 10 aircraft. These aircraft are astonishingly efficient. The order is subject to shareholder approval at our September AGM, but these aircraft offer us 39 more seats, 228 seats versus the 189 on the 737 NG fleet, but delivered 20% lower fuel consumption, 20% less CO2 emissions and they're 50% quieter. These aircraft will transform Ryanair's operating cost, will further widen our already considerable unit cost advantage over all competitor airlines in Europe and will materially, I think, incent will materially improve our growth for the next decade. We think about half of this order will be used to replace older NGs, which will start hitting 24, 25 in 2028 and 2029. But half of the order will allow us to sustain controlled, although more modest growth into the early 2030s than we have delivered over the past 10 or 15 years. Just in terms of outlook. Therefore, we expect FY'24 traffic to grow to approximately 183.5 million passengers. We've had to step that down 1 million from the original 185 million forecast because of these Boeing delivery delays through May and June. And what it also looks like we're going to suffer some delivery delays in September and October as we start gearing up for maintenance, we'll be short some aircraft, and we'll have to pare back some schedules. However, having said that, the cost gap between Ryanair and all of our competitors continues to widen materially in Europe. As previously guided, we expect to see a modest increase in our ex-fuel unit cost this year of about EUR2. This is due to the full year impact of annualized crew pay restoration, higher crew ratios, which is material this summer, where we're suffering the challenge of really lamentable ATC provision across Europe. We know that some competitors have already been canceling flights through the peak travel months of July and August. We're not canceling flights. We expect to complete our entire operation, but we need more standby crews to be able to make up the amount of ATC delays we're suffering. The route charges and the impact of the Gamechanger delivery delays will also impact unit costs this year. Q2 bookings are strong. We expect to run through Q2 with load factors at 95%, 96%. The fare increase in Q2 will be much lower than it was in Q1. The average fare in Q1 was up just over 40%. We expect in Q2 that, it will be more modest because of a much tougher prior year Q2 pricing, we think low double-digits, something in the low teens, and again, that's partly because peak summer travel snapped back very strongly in Q2 last year following the Ukraine invasion. We have noticed in the recent couple of weeks, a slight softening in the closed-in fares in late June and early July, nothing that I would be overly worried about at the moment, but I think there's either a degree of customer resistance to the higher fares but we are filling our aircraft fares that are marginally higher than they were in Q2 last year. But the final H1 outcome, therefore, is highly dependent on these -- the trends in close-in bookings for the remaining seats in August and September. As is usual this time of the year, we have no Q3 or Q4 visibility. We are cautious though that we enjoyed a bumper Christmas and New Year travel period last year. That was the first kind of full Christmas period for that wasn't affected by COVID for three years. And we're conscious that this winter, we are looking to grow. We're operating at 125% of our pre-COVID capacity and I would allow for the fact that we may have to engage in some price stimulation as we move into October, November, but we're not seeing that this summer, but we are expecting it later on this year. So I think we're right to be cautious. We've had a very strong Q1. We think Q2 will be modestly ahead of where Q2 was last year. Therefore, we'll have a strong H1, but I would be cautious into the second half of the year. Consumers are facing challenges out there across Europe, higher interest rates, highest -- higher mortgage payments, consumer price inflation is high, you won't have the benefit of the Asian and the American traffic in the second half of the year. And we are pushing 25% capacity growth in a market which this summer in Europe is operating at only 93% of pre-COVID capacity. We think that gets closer to a 100% of pre-COVID capacity into the second half of the year. So I think we're right to be cautious. We are well crewed. We're getting through the summer well. Load factors are high, but pricing might just be at that kind of inflection point where it begins to soften a little bit. I would welcome a softening in pricing. We've had a very strong recovery over the last two summers, but with Ryanair's much lower cost base, I think you're going to see us continue to take market share from competitors. We may need to do that this winter based on price. However, given the uncertainty we have over the H2 Boeing delivery that have been accentuated by the collapse the Yellowstone River bridge in Montana. Our significantly higher fuel bill this year, our fuel bill will be up EUR1 billion over last year. The continued volatility of unhedged oil prices, very limited H2 visibility and our expectation that the risk of tighter consumer spending in the second half of the year, we still remain cautiously optimistic that full year profit after tax will be modestly ahead of last year. It is, however, still too early to provide any meaningful FY'24 -- guidance. And we don't think that will change until we get to the H1 results in November. I would -- two other -- couple of other closing points. We look at the very strong growth profile we have here. We're very excited by our entry into the Albanian market this winter. Albania is a market that is, I think, ripe for exploitation. It's been hampered in recent years by only having one high fare carrier in the market and I think our arrival into Tirana in Albania, with very low, materially lower fares than the incumbent carrier will mean a pretty dramatic growth in that marketplace. We were pleased and delighted last week. Eddie Wilson, Jason McGuinness, our Director of Commercial and myself. We spent Wednesday, Thursday in Ukraine where we met with all the main airports Boryspil and Kyiv, Lviv, Odessa. We have -- we're, I think, inspired was the right word by the state of readiness of those airports. They really have -- they've kept their people employed. The airports are ready to rock and roll the minute it is safe to do so. They're hoping to reopen some air routes into the main airports in Lviv and Kyiv. Maybe by the end of this year, they're looking at a kind of Israeli type Iron Dome solution over Lviv and Kyiv and if they could achieve that, we'd be hopeful that the European authorities would allow a limited flight resumption. I think it's important for Ukraine and the people of Ukraine, I mean, we endured a 10-hour train journey from Poland into Ukraine in and out. The one thing that's missing in Ukraine Kyiv is remarkably normal, but what they're missing is air travel. And we -- I think it's incumbent on all of us in Europe to support Ukraine as best we can. And I think the best way we can support Ukraine is by leading the return to air travel. So we continue to work closely with the IASA, the FAA to encourage them to reopen at least even if it's only on a limited basis, the return of fights into Kyiv and Lviv. Once the war ends, and we all hope it will be sooner rather than later, we will charge back into Ukraine. We've committed to basing up to 30 aircraft in Kyiv, Lviv and Odessa. Kherson, Kharkiv will be later because those airports have suffered significant damage, but we intend to return back in there within four to six weeks of being allowed to do so. We expect to be connecting Kyiv and Lviv with up to 25 or 30 European cities. Ukraine was a big and growing market for Ryanair prior to the invasion. And after they have successfully repulsed the Russians, we expect to be -- Ryanair will be the number one airline in Ukraine. And in reasonably short order, we'll be the number one airline in Albania as well. I think this underscores the strength of the growth that is still ahead of us -- in front of us in Ryanair, not just in Western Europe, but in Central and Eastern Europe, where the more we push into those markets, the more we take market share from our high-fare competitors. One last thought, there is, I think, a slightly over optimistic. We are looking forward to we're holding a Capital Markets Day on the first week of September. The purpose of that day is to take everybody through the MAX 10 aircraft order, a detailed drill down into the very exciting growth opportunities we have all over Europe for the next and in those countries close to Europe for the next decade. We will not be updating profitability. We will not be discussing dividends or anything else. We really want to have a drill down into just the growth, the MAX 10 and what it will do for our costs. We will be sometime before the middle end of August, issuing the Class 1 document together with the AGM notice for the MAX 10 order. And that will -- so that will limit what we are any commentary we will have between it and the AGM when we hope shareholders will back our vision and support the order for the MAX 10 aircraft. So I just want to make sure that we have punctured any irrational expectation that the Capital Markets Day would be some dramatic reveal, it won't, but there will be very exciting, I think, news and communications on our decade of growth which rolls out before us in a marketplace in Europe where capacity is constrained and where all of our incumbent competitors have seen are emerging out of COVID with materially higher unit costs than Ryanair is. I'm astonished, never cease to be amazed. I looked at the numbers last week. Our PE multiple currently is 11. The PE multiples of Wizz and easyJet who are -- can either match our profitability, our growth, our unit costs are also 10 and 11. So either they're materially overvalued or we're materially undervalued, but I'm sure the market will work it out in due course. We look forward to seeing you all here at the Capital Markets Day in September. I think we have a very exciting story to tell on our new aircraft order on growth for the next decade, but that would be the height of it on that date. Neil, you want to take us through the MD&A or any point you want to raise on costs that I haven't heard.\nNeil Sorahan: I'll very briefly just run through within fairness, you covered off everything quite comprehensively. I think it's clear that we will continue to have the unit cost advantage over everybody else, although there is a bit of price inflation coming through in the first quarter as we annualize the pay restoration and the pay increases that we've awarded our people. And as Michael said, we've invested very heavily in crewing ratios. This summer, we were operating up to about 5.8 set of crews per aircraft, up from 5.4 sets of crews last year. So you're seeing that coming through, an increase in local ATC charges also coming through in the airport and handling line. So I think that, that's apparent in the numbers this morning. The balance sheet's in very good shape. We finished with EUR4.84 billion gross cash. And as Michael said, just under EUR1 billion in net cash, and that was after EUR1 billion in CapEx, including a $250 million signing fee on the MAX 10, which we signed back in May. So we've got another EUR1.8 billion to go for the balance of this year. Our balance sheets became fully unencumbered last Friday when we paid off our final Exim loan. So all of the 737, 800s now fully unencumbered, which I think is unique, and that's reflected in the ratings that we got from Fitch and S&P up to BBB+. Hedging, again, as Michael said, very well hedged for the year, just under 85% hedging of which 75% is through swaps and the balance through options. So we've got about 25% of our fuel floating. And then as we look into next year, we've got about 40% of the first half of the year hedged out at approximately $75 a barrel and then some modest hedging into the second half of the year. Just some other bits and pieces, the Class 1 circular will be issued in the next couple of weeks. And this morning, we published our annual report for 2023 and our 2023 sustainability report on our website, which sets out our ambitious targets for the next decade there as well. And that's pretty much it for me, Michael.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Thanks, Neil. We'll open up to Q&A. Now I'm joined here, we're in Dublin, where Eddie Wilson, the DAC CEO; Tracy Malloy ; Tom Fowler, Peter Larkin; Juliusz Komorek and Neil is obviously joining us from London where he's doing the media. So we're going to open it up to Q&A, and I'll front-pass the questions around, so we get everybody involved in the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today from Savanthi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Savanthi, Hi.\nSavanthi Syth: Hey, good morning. If I might, on the fleet plan, it looks like there were some changes there, a little bit of MAX 10 shifting around. I was wondering if that was kind of based on what Boeing is telling you or you're making some assumptions given what you're seeing today? And then just for my second question, I was kind of curious with the investments in the operational resilience, does that get baked into the base and then we see kind of more of a normalized growth on top of that? Or how should we think about some of the investments that are being made there? And the impact on cost?\nMichael O'Leary: Yeah, I think -- thank you. You broke up once or twice there, but if I picked it up, the only change in the fleet plan is just delayed deliveries from Boeing. We've had to continue to be reasonably adaptive there. At one stage, we thought we might only get 35 aircrafts for the peak summer this year. It's now like and I think, credit to Boeing, they delivered all 51, but the last one will arrive on the 31st of July. So we are -- that's cost us about 300,000, 400,000 passengers through June, July. We've had to take about 200,000 passengers out of August and we are moving back. We're going to be seven or eight aircraft short in September, October because we start all the maintenance on the fleet. But Other than that, there isn't any -- and then we are moving some of the deliveries into summer of 2024 are moving back from February, March, April, they're moving into April, May, June. We are working closely with Spirit in Wichita and with Boeing to try to give us the most accurate figure we have on the fleet. Investment operational resilience.\nSavanthi Syth: It looks like Michael, your MAX 10 deliveries were a little bit delayed too like different than what you had in May.\nMichael O'Leary: No, no. There's no change.\nNeil Sorahan: There were some slight changes just sadly from the final aspiration from the draft to the release you now not major between the first two.\nMichael O'Leary: Yes. The numbers are still the same per year. The investment operational resilience like again I'll give you the good. There's good news and bad news. The good news is that the airport handling generally across Europe has been materially better this year than it was last year. Most airports, most handling companies are reasonably well staffed this summer. And so we're not seeing any significant changes or there's significant improvement over last year. The bad news is that ATC is a shambles. They are short staffed, particularly at weekends. We have long complained about the 60 days of French ATC strikes. And the European Commission continues to sit on its hands doing nothing. I keep writing to Ursula von der Leyen. She keeps fabbing the correspondent after DG move, which is a misdescription in terms of DG no move. Nothing is being done for Europe. We are calling the minimum. We're calling forest protection of overflights during French ATC strikes. That hasn't been delivered. Most of the ATC providers, the German, the French are short staffed inexplicably and are incapable of providing the staffing that's necessary. Remember, Europe this year is only operating at 93% of its pre-COVID capacity. And yet ATCs have less staffing than they had in 2019 and 2020. It is a mismanagement shambles but it's exactly what you expect from anything run by European government and by the European Commission. But the continuing failure of the European Commission to take some action on this is inexplicable. I think it's inevitable that we will have to maintain that, I think, improved operational resilience for the next year or two until we see Europe take some action on air traffic control. And we're still -- we would expect it to be as bad this time next year. I expect next summer Europe to be operating at about 100% of its pre-COVID short-haul capacity and ATC will still be giving us capacity restrictions at weekend, short staffing, excuses, piled upon excuses and nothing being done. So I think it is for additional -- while we've doubled up the operations capacity in Dublin and in Warsaw. But the additional crewing, I think it will be with us here for the next summer or two. I don't think it's long term. I think ultimately, something will be done about European ATC and the mismanagement of ATC but I wouldn't hold out any great hope that Ursula von der Leyen is going to do anything useful other than sit in her hands doing nothing. Eddie, you want to add to that?\nEdward Wilson: Yes. I mean I think the important thing is that what's within our control we are significantly better in terms of solving those issues. So the two main call that Michael touched on there was the increased crewing ratios, which you've got to be ahead of the curve of like six, 12 months ago to bring those people through. We're still training over 1,000 cadets a year, and we have significantly increased our cabin crew ratios. And quite rightly, like as ATC is hopefully solved over the next number of years, and we're growing, we can get growing ratios. We can sort of lean into that. But more importantly, at the operations control center level, both here and in Bratislava, labs has been particularly important to us in designing systems that allow us in this environment where you've got, what would have been five, six years ago, meltdown days versus we're able to manage that in real time in optimizing the allocation of crews. And that has been critical not just piling extra bodies in but the support and systems that we have here that are homegrown systems and are working very effectively this summer. I mean it just -- it makes you -- you're able to get through without cancellations unlike many of our competitors.\nMichael O'Leary: Thanks, Eddie. Thanks, Savi. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Muneeba Kayani from Bank of America.\nMichael O’Leary: Muneeba, Hi.\nOperator: Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMuneeba Kayani: Good morning, Michael and Neil. So just on your comments on the softening in closing fares, is there anything you would call out in terms of specific geographies? Would you say there's a change in customer booking behavior maybe and kind of what portion of the second quarter -- fiscal second quarter is booked currently? And then the second question just on uses of cash. And in the video, you talked about a potential cash return to shareholders. What are you thinking at this point within -- across like dividend or buyback? And any metrics that we should think about in terms of a potential size in March this year fiscal year?\nMichael O'Leary: Okay. Thanks, Muneeba. Again, I would draw your attention, I think it's important we say it. Partly this is, I think, is a function of the weak prior year comps in Q1 and the strong prior comps in Q2. As we went through April, May and June, the close-in fares, we were seeing continuously kind of booking up -- your fares were significantly up ahead of budget expectations. As we move into Q2, close-in fares are closer to our budget expectations. There's a kind of a leveling out. We're still running marginally ahead of our budget expectations and low to mid-double-digit ahead of Q2 last year. But I think -- what we're trying to communicate here is in the last number of weeks, the close-in stuff has softened. In some cases, we're now looking at very few seats left available to travel. We may have oversold Q2 a little bit ahead of schedule. But we're not seeing the same kind of jump up in close-in bookings that we saw in Q1. But I think that's more a factor in Q1. Our budget was kind of predicated on last year's weak prior year comps versus Q2 it's not. And again, I just -- I don't think that to be worried about here. But I do want to communicate we've had a very, very strong Q1. Q2 will not be very strong. It would be good, but not this good. And I don't want any kind of irrational exuberance building up out there. No more than that. Uses of cash, we try to be as transparent as we can. The Board has set us kind of four in sequentially, the priorities in terms of cash and profitability. One, restored the pay cuts. We did that 24 months early in December of last year. We're agreeing pay increases with the pilots, cabin crews, our ground handlers across Europe. We've done deals with almost all the cabin crews. Most of the pilot groups are now largely done, and we're working our way through the ground handlers as well. It's an ongoing process, but the Board is committed. I think the first use of funds was repay restoration and rewarding the people who stood loyally with us through COVID with pay increases. The pay increase will be modest. We are already significantly adding to the headcount here. The crewing ratios are higher. But the pilots, cabin crews and ground handlers, the people are delivering the service deserve pay increases first. Second is debt reduction. We have bonds, which -- we're looking at bonds, we're repaying bonds here where we're paying an interest rate of 1%, 1.25%. The refinancing cost of those bonds today would even for us with a BBB+ would be 4.5%, 5%. So we are committed to paying down that debt. As Neil said, we paid down the last of our Exim debt last week. We have another bond of EUR750 million to pay in August of this year. And then we have two more bonds of about EUR2 billion, one of which is due in September '25 and one in May '26. And then we will be completely debt free at that point in time. The third use of funds is going to be CapEx. As Neil said, we're in peak CapEx this year. The CapEx does begin to run off as we run through the next two years, and we have that a two-year gap between the last of the Gamechanger deliveries and the first of MAX 10 deliveries. And only and after we're confident that we can fund all of those commitments can we look at returning cash to shareholders. I think it's something we'll be focusing on at the end of this year. Maybe we'll see some light at the tunnel when we get to the half year numbers in November, but it certainly won't be before that date. I think we've communicated clearly that it's more likely to be dividends than share buybacks. And if you read the press release, I mean, in terms of scale, I think we're conscious of the fact that during the worst of the COVID crisis, the shareholders invested EUR400 million in the company. That enabled us to access the bond markets. We raised EUR1.2 billion at the time during COVID at an annual interest rate of under 1%. So I think our kind of starting position looking -- if we're looking at a dividend would be try to return as much, if not all, of that EUR400 million as we can, but we won't make any decisions on that. I think until the half year numbers in November or maybe in Q1 are in -- at the end of this year or early next year.\nMuneeba Kayani: Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Muneeba. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harry Gowers from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Harry, Hi.\nHarry Gowers: Yeah, good morning, gents. Just two questions, if I can. So the first one, just on the ex-fuel costs, I think up EUR2 in March '24. And I think, Neil, you indicated previously you don't want to keep it flat in March '25 year-on-year. So is that still the case? And then, Michael, just on the trimming of the full year pax guidance, do you think there's a possibility you can actually make up the EUR1.5 million over the rest of the year? Or is there probably a heightened risk further today is actually lower than the back guidance further? Thanks.\nMichael O'Leary: Okay, Neil, you can take the ex-fuel cost costs, and I'll ask Tracey if she has any comments on that, and then I'll deal with the full year pax guidance.\nNeil Sorahan: Okay, Harry, thanks for the question. On FY'25, we would be hopeful that we'll be up at about just over 33-year-old passenger at the end of this year on an ex-fuel basis, we would be hopeful that we would maintain something along those lines, into the following year. We're a 5.8 sets of crews per aircraft. We would hope we wouldn't have to go any higher than that for operational resilience into the following year. We do have some modest pay increase coming through, but we can observe that in the numbers that we have. So, yes, I mean the hope and the plan is that we will be broadly in line with the 33 into FY'25.\nMichael O'Leary: Tracey, do you want to add anything on the cost?\nTracey McCann: Yes. Probably what Neil has said the two main drivers of the staff and then we see airports and handling and staff is increased growing rate, pay restoration and modest pay increases and the airport and handling as we previously indicated it increased local ATC, and then we're seeing some wage inflation on the self-handling and handling side of things there. They are really the two main drivers in the EUR2 cost increase.\nMichael O'Leary: Okay. And on the trimming of FY, we could -- if we were in the old days, I think we would have gone balls out it's 185 million, and we're just going to dump lots of capacity into the winter. I don't think the marketplace requires that now and nor would we. I think we operated quite successfully last winter by trimming out a lot of loss-making midweek capacity. We're running the full schedule of weekends. That's the way the winter profile looks except in those new markets like Albania and/or Ukraine, if we can get in there this winter. But generally speaking, no, I would not be minded in current markets, particularly where there is capacity is still constrained in Europe to be artificially dumping prices or artificially growing mid-week capacity during the winter season, just to hit some target of 185 million. If as a result of the Boeing delivery delays, we only have capacity for 183.5 million, then I think we will aim for the 183.5 million. We'll try to manage the yields as best we can during the winter. The yields in the winter will be lower than they were in the summer. The narrative that the era of low fares is over and is never coming back is not a correct one. There is still lots of low-fare availability. Our average fare in the first quarter was EUR49, which I think by any measure of means is a low fare in Europe. It's certainly far lower than any other airline in Europe can provide but no, we will not run additional midweek capacities with just scraping another 1.5 million additional passengers. Eddie, anything else you would have on that commercial.\nEdward Wilson: Yes. I mean, I would agree there. I mean as we look through to the winter, we've gone back again like compared with winter '22 in terms of mid-week capacity of 30% and we're up to 70% for weekend. So that's evidence of that sort of trimming that's going on midweek. In terms of the review of what happened last winter, also looking at, I mean, Easter will be slightly earlier this year as well. And putting in Christmas extras and looking at sort of those troughs and activity beyond the 10th of January as well. So we continue to do that as evidenced by the numbers. We've got to look at the basis that we opened this summer to make sure that they go through into the wintertime, given support in the Canaries again, are particularly strong. So and leisure routes began in spaces like from Winter soon into or Morocco, Jordan, places like us, so it's -- that's where we'll be concentrating the efforts rather than chasing passenger numbers. So you'd ask me unlikely to make that as we would have done in the old days.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay, Thanks, Eddie. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from James Hollins from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: James, Hi.\nJames Hollins: Hi, Mike. You're going to hate this question, but I'm going to come back on the pricing. You talked about low double-digit, then you talked about mid-teens and then low double to mid-teens. If you were lucky enough to be an analyst, would you be thinking about mid-teens is what you currently sold at, but the management of Ryanair have been quite cautious on that close-in. And then the second one is just on your pilots. Are you seeing any sort of -- I think everywhere except for Belgians, they're done on contracts. Are you seeing any of them sort of coming back and saying that performance is good, sum is good, we want a higher pay increase? Thanks.\nMichael O'Leary: I'll ask Eddie to come back on the pilot negotiate. Sorry, if I may, I mean I would have guarded mid-teens as low to low double-digits like we expect that the yield number -- the average fare in Q1 was up 42%. We expect the -- at the moment, our best guess is that the yield performance in Q2 is going to be somewhere in the -- between, I would say, 10% and 15%. At the moment, it's running at the upper end of that range. But we're -- I'm a little bit cautious just in the closing stuff has been a little bit weaker for the last four or five weeks. I don't see a reason why at the back end of August or the September bookings at the moment will be dramatically different. So I would be picking if I was lucky enough to be an analyst, if I'd only worked harder in school and got a job as an analyst, I would be pitching it very much at the -- in that 10% to 15% range. It still will demonstrate a reasonably strong Q2. The H1 numbers will be strong for the year, given that last year's H2 was EUR1.2 billion PAT, but this is a long winter. And I'm slightly cautious in that there is still significant pent-up demand for holiday bookings this summer. There's still constrained capacity supply. You still have lots of competitors who have much higher unit cost who will then drive up pricing. But into the winter, the higher interest rate, higher mortgage rates, consumer price inflation, has to feed back into air travel at some point in time. And I would be expecting that this winter. So I'd be a little bit more bearish in the second half of the year, but we still do -- I mean, we're heading for a very strong and very profitable year overall. I would just be cautious into the second half of the year. And then we're looking at next year where if oil prices continue as they are, we could pick up anything up to EUR1 billion in terms of additional savings on our numbers. So the medium-term outlook here is very strong. The aircraft order means we can grow 300 million passengers within Europe over the next decade. I would just be cautious on -- we've had a very strong Q1. Q2 is not going to be that strong, but then with a much tougher prior year comp. And I would be cautious into the winter. And that's a message we're communicating with our unions as well. There's lots of silly wage demands out there from ground handlers and airports, it's not that good out there. People are -- I think, there was still a lot of pent-up travel demand this summer, I think capacity will rise again into next summer, mainly because Ryanair will add another 50 aircraft for next summer as well. I would just be cautious. Strong Q1 reasonably good Q2, and then I would hold my breath to see what happens in the second half of the year. Eddie, do you want to give us an update on where we are with the kind of the pilots or wage settlements into our rising kind of profits.\nEdward Wilson: Yes. I mean I'll just add just on to the fare side there that like don't forget like last year, there are like after the Ukraine invasion by Russia like when we came into the summer into Q2, there were exceptional close-in fares last year as well, which are not going to be repeated. Just on the pilots, yes. I mean, our commitment was to stick with our people who were with us all the way through COVID when we were doing zero flying. And we put in emergency agreements at that stage. And we had pay reductions. Those pay reductions were restored earlier. You'll recall, towards the end of calendar year '22. In the case of pilots, what we get with other groups, there was -- with those extension of those deals, there was no pay increase in April and we had revisited that with a number of our pilot groups, and those agreements are now, in some cases, extended with a pay increase this April, obviously, which is feeding into the restoration where a year was brought forward. So like look at those. I'd echo what Michael said there outside of the sort of the pilot groups, particularly with third-party handlers and particularly in the UK where you've got inflation is at much higher rates and hitting people on those lower salaries, so there has been some good news on inflation recently. But again, we're growing, and we will always look to our competitive position in the market, and we've reacted twice by doing restoration early and also that flowed into April this year where we reengaged with unions in the major markets and have come to agreements with them.\nMichael O'Leary: I should say as well, we did have a strike by, I'd say, about 60% of our -- the Belgian pilots last weekend. We still run about 60% of our Belgian operations through both days. Now we would have preferred not, if they hadn't gone on strike, but if they want to go on strike, they're free to go and strike, it's important, I think, too, that they understand that we can still run about 60% of our Belgian operations about -- on aircraft that are based outside of Belgium. We were heartened by the fact that about 1/3 of the Belgian pilots turned up for work, and we ran a significant proportion of the Belgian base schedule. There was no strike this weekend, they called another strike for next weekend. But as we said to them all, look, you can have exactly the same kind of increase that we've agreed with the Italian pilots, the Spanish pilot unions, but you can't have something stupid. And they seem to have a kind of a view of life that Belgium and Belgium is somehow different. It isn't. We will and are doing our best to be fair and work with our union partners and our people, both pilots, cabin crew, engineers, ground handlers. But we're not minded and nor are we going to fall over and concede some ludicrous pay increases just because we've had a strong Q1. Q2 is okay, and this winter could well be tough and challenging. So as we have always done, if we have to take strikes, we'll take them. We'll try to avoid them as best we can, but again a disproportion amount to kind of PR coverage. I mean, the Belgian pilot strike is far less impactful to us than a French ATC strike. We cancelled more flights on the day of a French ATC strike that we do on a Belgian pilot strike. So we are meeting with the Belgian pilot union again this week. We would hope to make some progress with them. But if they want to go on strike again next weekend, they can go on strike next weekend. We will work our way and manage our way around it. As we are with the -- I should also say the -- with the fires enrolled in Greece this weekend, it's important again to put that in some context, there have been forest fires that they were in the Algarve this time last year. Forest fires are a known phenomenon. They do appear to be getting worse. But in the case of Rhodes, there to the south of the island, most of the resorts and the airports are in the north of the island. We've seen no demand for passengers over the weekend seeking to cancel the flights to Rhodes. In fact, all of the passengers that were on Rhodes have return flights scheduled today, tomorrow, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. So the kind of stupidity you get out of some of the media this weekend, are you cancelling your fight to Rhodes? No, of course, we're not. A, because Rhodes Airport is open and B, because we have a lots of passengers who are in Rhodes who wants to return from their holidays and there are more passengers who're still going out of the Rhodes. So it is the silly season the media tend to latch on to pictures of forest fires. But when you're flying to 260 airports across Europe, are we seeing any changes in demand patterns, no. In fact, if anything, over the last two or three weeks, we've seen stronger demand ex-Ireland than ex-UK. People trying to get the hell away from the unseasonably high rainfall we've had in Ireland and the UK, which if anything, gives me even more confidence for sustained growth in Mediterranean holidays over the next decades as we grow into 300 million passengers a year. And James, I hope that answered the question. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Jarrod Castle from UBS.\nMichael O’Leary: Jarrod, Hi.\nOperator: Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nJarrod Castle: Hi, everyone. Good morning. I just want to question firstly on ancillaries. They were up 4% per pax. Obviously, inflation is running higher than that. So are you sacrificing volume? Is there a mix impact or you're just not pricing as aggressively as maybe you can at the moment? And I guess linked on to that, you've said something about fair pricing during the current quarter, anything on ancillary pricing? And then just looking a little bit further ahead, you've got a number of environmental headwinds coming under that for 55. You've obviously got the ETS step down in free credit next year. And then you've got SAF of which I'd probably say you must be best of breed at 12.5% versus what the EU saying by 2030. But I guess, looking at that, are you worried about the cost advantage, especially given that you've also committed so much more than EU is asking under SAF even if it is the right thing to do for the environment. Thanks.\nMichael O'Leary: Thanks, Jarrod. I'm going to ask Tracey to take the ancillary question. Neil, you might come in with some comments after. And then I'm going to ask Tom Fowler, our Director of Sustainability to deal with the environmental measures. So Tracey, over to you on ancillaries.\nTracey McCann: Yes. We've seen ancillaries increased by 4% from as you look over '23 Europe pretty much as we thought. We have done a lot -- but the two main drivers is on seats and priority boarding, where we've done a lot of work with labs, where we've introduced dynamic pricing. So I think we're very happy with what we see at the moment. So roughly that's 32% of total revenue. So pretty much obviously EUR0.50, EUR0.60 increase in ancillaries on the year.\nMichael O'Leary: And Neil, anything you want to add to that?\nNeil Sorahan: No, just Jarrod, we were quite clear. We made a big jump from 19-year-old passenger to just on the 23-year-old passenger. We'd indicated EUR0.50, EUR0.60 increase, as Tracey just said there, we're pleased that we're achieving that some areas where we'd like to make a bit more. We're working further with Labs on the pricing models around seating and priority boarding, sees more we can do there. We're looking at a more detailed level on the onboard spend to see if there's more we can do on that. But we're pleased with how we're developing. It's in line with what we had indicated we would do. And this is growth on top of a significant step-up over the past couple of years. And there's another year or two to go in the growth in ancillaries.\nMichael O'Leary: And Thomas, do you want to touch on environmental measures and their impact over the next two to three years?\nThomas Fowler: Yeah, look, obviously the ETF is available little than the free allowances, but it will impact everyone the same deployed into EU will lose their allowance in tariff. But what we are doing honestly, we've taken in the current Gamechanger aircraft, which is 16% more fuel efficient. And we've also locked in the MAX 10 deal, which will replace some of the 800 NGs will be 20% more fuel efficient. So I think on ETF soil, we'll obviously still give any cost advantage around fleet because revenue will be hit the same with that exposure into you. And then on the SAF soil, we set the 12.5% target, it is aggressive at twice the European mandate book, but the cost isn't on all at the moment. We need to see production rise and at what front half of the field floor as we won't see the premium we see today as we see production have to increase. So I don't think that the cost disadvantage will be that significant, as you may look at it today. So it's just going to be as we see a follow-up and production ramp up.\nMichael O'Leary: Yes. And I would add to that, just if you take the environmental measure impact or James, over the -- Jarrod, over the next five years, we'll take delivery of another 100 Gamechangers, 4% more seats, 20% less -- 16% less fuel. And in that period, we'll take in the first two years of deliveries of the MAX 10, 28% more seats and 20% less fuel. Like, the technological revolution that's going on with the engines and their fuel consumption will more than fund any kind of environmental costs, the fuel savings here at gargantuan, particularly in marketplace in Europe where capacity will continue to be constrained over that four or five year period. I think the real underlying story here that we should keep tacking back to is that the market in Europe has changed. Capacity is now constrained. It will remain constrained for another four or five years, if not out to 2030. The reason I wouldn't be quite as -- if there will be another crisis between now and 2030. I just don't know where -- when -- what it will be and where it will come from, but capacity is going to be meaningfully constrained. Europe is consolidating. Remember, that consolidation is being led by airlines like Lufthansa, IAG, whose average air fare is north of short-haul airfare is EUR200. We're still continuing to expand our capacity in a marketplace that's constrained with aircraft that burn between 16% to 20% less fuel per seat with an average fare that in Q1 this year was only EUR49. So I think we will -- fares will continue, I think, to modestly rise for the next two or three years in a constrained capacity environment. Our competitors will be under considerably more cost pressure than we are. They will drive fares up harder and faster. You only need to look at the German market this year where Germany is the market that has recovered least post-COVID. It's only operating at about 75% to 80% of pre-COVID capacity and airfares have almost doubled in the German domestic marketplace, which is largely now a Lufthansa monopoly. So I think what we're seeing in North America, which has been five, 10 years of consolidated airlines with a reasonable pricing power and upward trend in fares is about to be repeated in Europe for the next decade. Next question please.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Sathish Sivakumar from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Sathish, Hi. Sathish, go ahead.\nSathish Sivakumar: Yeah, I'm sorry. I was on mute. Yeah, thanks, Michael. I've got two questions here. So first is on the operational resilience. Obviously, you have invested in the resilience into this summer. So out of the KPL sector per day compared to this year versus last year? And do you see further scope for improvement as we go into the rest of the summer? And then the second one is on the winter schedule. If I say you did flag that last year, you optimized your winter schedule with more weekends or taking some of the week day booking out and would you expect a similar profile to be followed this year in terms of your winter schedule, excluding the new markets that you're likely to launch? Thank you.\nMichael O'Leary: You broke up slightly on the words, so you want a commentary on scope for improvement? Is it our long time performance is it?\nSathish Sivakumar: No, it's more about the operational resilience. Do you see more like do you see further need to invest to improve like in terms of sector per day term?\nMichael O'Leary: You are asking, do we need to invest further in ops resilience. Is that the question? Question\nSathish Sivakumar: Yes, yes, that's right. Yeah, sorry.\nMichael O'Leary: Yes. Okay. I mean no, I don't. Like we have doubled up the ops control capacity and the 2 ops centers in Dublin and Warsaw. We now think we have ops capacity here for close to 300 million passengers a year. That has been significantly helpful, particularly on those weekends when we suffered significant French ATC strikes or disruptions we're able to recover much faster. We manage the crews much better. We call in the sand much better. So that has been significantly improved. I don't see any further requirement for operating in that, although I would come back to what I said in an earlier question, I think that those heightened crew ratios will remain with us certainly for the next two or three years until we see European -- the European Commission take some action on improving ATC performance around Europe. And I would -- instead of that complete 20-year shambles of the single European Sky, we need more competition between ATC providers. We should let the efficient ones provide services where the inefficient ones can't. I think maybe I'll ask Eddie to comment on the optimization of the winter schedule in our plan for this year vis-a-vis last year, Eddie.\nEdward Wilson: Yes. I mean if you look at the sort of proportion of what we did midweek, back in winter '19, it was 37% 35% winter '22, it will be 30% this winter. So that's probably as far as we're going to go on that. But that can -- and we're still growing sort of capacity just short of 10% there. But like we continue to sort of shake out that mid-week capacity as we continuously review route profitability. And there's only so much which you can optimize where you can't go much below 30% given the five, four roster that we have for pilot. So -- but like that's continuous dropping from 37% to 30% this winter.\nMichael O'Leary: I think the only exception that would be obviously Albania where we're going to be very aggressive on pricing and capacity additions there. We're working closely with the Albanian government and the Albanian airports who I think feel a bit less down by the high fare incumbent who hasn't delivered any growth until we showed up and then obviously, if there's any opportunity or opportunity to return or reopen some air travel into Ukraine that we would add that capacity to the width. So that's not in our current plans, but we would add that almost regardless of the airfares. We are determined to be first and back into Ukraine, and we will invest heavily in the recovery of Ukrainian air travel once it's safe to do so, we're declared safe to do so. Next question please\nSathish Sivakumar: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Simpson from Goodbody. Please go ahead Mark.\nMichael O’Leary: Mark, Hi.\nMark Simpson: Yes, good morning. Two questions. One for Neil on the balance sheet and managing the cash accumulation. I'm just wondering if you can take us through your thinking in terms of how you maximize returns or maybe match cash flow for future CapEx. And that's obviously going to be an increasing feature in the next couple of years. And then the other question for Tom, just on sustainability. You mentioned the sustainability report, the retrofitting of the 409 NG fleet. I'm just wondering how that is going in terms of the completion of that program.\nNeil Sorahan: Yes. Well, Mark, as you rightly pointed out there for the first time in a long time, our treasurer has now become a cost, sorry, a profit center for us. We're operating net interest positive at the moment and likely to do so on a full year basis. So last year, I think we were negative about EUR34 million on interest this year we will be positive, possibly up as high as EUR30 million on interest this year. So we're managing our cash in a very conservative basis. We don't put it anywhere where we're not going to have sleepless nights in relation to it. So very conservatively managed. We obviously found a home for EUR750 million of our cash in the middle of August, where we're paying down a maturing bond and that will obviously go ahead in the next couple of weeks. CapEx with another EUR1.8 billion to go this year. And again, the assumption is that we will finance that out of our cash resources. Thereafter, it depends really on what's the cheapest form of financing for the group. I think for the next couple of years, cash will remain the cheapest form of financing, but we'll remain flexible whether that's going back to the bond markets, whether it's doing some job codes, which we haven't done for a number of years or visiting our friends in the unsecured or secured banking market. But cash is clearly the cheapest form of funding ourselves at the moment, and we're making a turn on the cash in the meantime as well.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Neil. Thomas? Sorry, go ahead, Mark.\nMark Simpson: So I was saying I think you had to go back to December 2002 for it to be a profit center.\nNeil Sorahan: Yes. That was before I joined, Mark.\nMark Simpson: Tom. Sorry,\nThomas Fowler: And just on December covering this track, so we were 1,230 aircraft to install with yearend and the plan is we will install another 70 this winter during our maintenance program. So but hopefully by the end of this year, 100 aircraft will have the scimitar winglets on them and we'll improve that again next winter as we roll through the main season.\nMark Simpson: The year-end or quarter-end?\nThomas Fowler: 30 at year-end March-April. We do it through -- we do it through maintenance season, Mark, take a few days just to take it off and get a retrofitted reinstall, so the final chapter is winter.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Thanks, Mark. Next question please. Sorry, go on. Mark?\nNeil Sorahan: No, he's gone.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Maxine. Next question please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Stephen Furlong from Davy. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Steven, Hi.\nStephen Furlong: Hi, Michael. Most of my questions have been answered, but I just want to add two things quick. On SAF, which just kind of seems to be important. I saw overnight like IAG were investing in making an equity investment in the company. Would you consider vertically integrating or is it more just do deals or just work with your suppliers? That's the first question. Yes, I'll ask that one first.\nMichael O'Leary: Okay. Honestly, the answer is no, but look, we would never say never. I mean the problem with investing with one supplier in via one geography is you've got to get the SAF to the airport. And ultimately, that's why I'm still of the view that it will be the oil majors will be the ones who will be the only ones who actually have the capacity to produce SAF in meaningful volume and then get it to the airport. There's no point in producing SAF in Tralee or SAF in New Castle. If we need it as 27 UK airports. But we would support IAG investing in somebody producing SAFs. But ultimately, we think the people who will supply SAF in the appropriate volumes we need quickly and at the airports where we need it, will be the oil companies, which is why we've signed up SAF supply agreement now with Shell, Nestle, ONG and Repsol to cover specific geographies across Spain, Austria, Germany where else Thomas? Holland\nThomas Fowler: Holland, UK, with Shell and France, right? So I think that Michael's point going to see here when we look at the investments, they're doing it close, close to Heathrow, the main home whereas we've got 91 bases around Europe, trying to build supply chain there to keep the SAF save and just prove the challenge is on the volume book. So the MOUs are more important for us rather than an investment in the facility.\nMichael O'Leary: Yes. But we would endorse and support IAG strategy doing it. Whatever accelerates and maximizes, A, the production of SAF and B, getting it to the airports, which is where we -- the only base we can uplift it is at airport, we would very much support and endorse. Second question, Stephen.\nStephen Furlong: Yes. I was just wondering in EU are they doing anything in the context. It's more kind of regulatory stuff. But for example, I know you talked about overflight but things like either ownership rules or another thing would be the imbalance in terms of long-haul, short-haul, which obviously long-haul's not part of ETFs. I know they have of course here, but I mean -- do you see any chance that over the next couple of years? Is there any movement in those two items?\nMichael O'Leary: Juliusz, do you want to take this give us an update on the regulatory developments, please?\nJuliusz Komorek: Yes. Thanks, Stephen. Hi, everyone. Stephen on ownership and control, my sense today is that we are not going to see a significant improvement in that area for the next 12 to 18 months. I think we need to wait for the new commission in Brussels in the autumn of '24 and then a further improvement in the relationship between the EU and the UK On overflight, I see increased appetite for action in this area. You may have seen in the media that Michael personally delivered over 1 million signatures under our petition to President of European Commission Ms. von der Leyen and she unfortunately wasn't able to be in her office at morning, but maybe next time when we bring her, the next million signatures, perhaps she will be there. But on the first of June, the day after the petition was delivered, there was a transport counsel in Brussels and transport ministers from Italy, Spain and a few other countries spoke very strongly about the need to protect the overflights. And clearly, those comments were addressed at the representative of France. We didn't have much to say on the day but that to me was a significant milestone in terms of that particular difficult issue. When it comes to other regulatory issues, I mean, obviously, on the environment, you have actually highlighted the significant imbalance in the treatment of short-haul versus long-haul operations. But it is important to remember that ETF is only restricted to intra-European flights until 2026. And after that, it would automatically extend to flights that go outside of Europe, and a specific decision will be required of the European Parliament and the Council to continue the restriction to intra EU and I just can't imagine in the context of the incremental debate that's ongoing in Brussels that the parliament, the same parliament, which wants to be seen to be greener and greener every year, will continue to vote for the restriction of the ETF to enter Ukraine flights only. My sense is that ETFs will have to, in the next few years be extended to apply to extra EU flights also.\nMichael O'Leary: Thanks, Juliusz. Next question please.\nNeil Sorahan: Thanks, Juliusz\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Ruairi Cullinane from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Ruairi, Hi.\nRuairi Cullinane: Good morning. Yes, I was wondering if there's anything you could share about your limited Q3 visibility in terms of how well you're booked in terms of load factors or fares? And then secondly, you made some interesting comments about potential impact of consolidation earlier in the call and clearly some parts of Europe become more consolidated over the pandemic. Are you seeing any better pricing power or anything like that in those markets now?\nMichael O'Leary: Okay, thanks. Your line wasn't great, but I'll try. Q3 visibility. Look, we have very little. At the moment, our forward books in Q3 are between 10% and 15%. So it's nothing. And that's through October, November, December. Q4 is less than 4%. So we are where we are. We're at this stage every year. It's a bit unfortunate that our year-end runs to the end of the winter season, but it is what it is that we have effectively zero Q3 visibility. And as I've said repeated before, I would expect some -- the impact of rising interest rates, consumer price inflation to be hitting consumer spending and the kind of discretionaries of the city break, the Christmas market might be a little bit weaker this winter. And again, that feeds back to why we won't blindly chase only 185 million passengers. We're going to cut the midweek capacities, we'll run the weekend, stuff through the winter. And in fact, we finished up at 183 million passengers or we finished up at 183.2 million passengers, it will be what it will be. The impact of consolidation, I think you're seeing pricing power around the piece, generally. If you look at all of the reporting from the airlines from Lufthansa to Air France to easyJet last to us today we're all seeing -- reporting a similar situation, strong Q1 pricing, all I would highlighted in our case, it was due to a very weak Q1 pricing last year. Q2 is well booked. We think Q2 fares are up by a double-digit percentage, although in my case, it will be low double-digits. That is the reflection of pricing power. Now I think it's -- that's not so much consolidation. I would drive -- a lot of that is down to that Alitalia emerged out of COVID were only 50% of the capacity they had going into it. GAP of only 60% of the capacity they had pre-COVID. Lufthansa are still only operating at about 85% of their pre-COVID capacity. So you have all of the legacy guys across Europe constraining short-haul capacity. And there is no doubt this summer that the transatlantic inbound has been very strong, and you're seeing the Asian traffic begin to recover. I think next summer, but in S '24, we'll be closer to 100% of the pre-COVID short-haul capacity, but you'll still have another year of recovery of the Asian inbound. Maybe the transatlantic will be quite as strong in S '24 as it was in S '23. But generally speaking, it is very difficult must to foresee there continue to be constrained short-haul capacity in Europe and meaningfully -- some degree of meaningful pricing power in the system, particularly during the two peak -- during the two summer quarters. I think the winter quarters will always be a bit more difficult and a bit harder to predict. But that consolidation will continue. I think when they've taken out Alitalia, what's left of ITA when TAP has been consolidated somebody will turn to, I think there's -- easyJet is key -- clearly a target for, I would say consolidation. The Scandinavian Airlines which are loss making, heroically loss making SAS and Norwegian may well be a target for consolidation and ultimately then somebody will have a look at Wizz, if it's not Lufthansa reestablishing some eastward east -- about eastward operations, their expansion into the Middle East may well encourage an investment from Middle East ownership who are all talking a big story about growth -- an airline growth but constrained by capacity where Wizz at least has access to aircraft. They're not very cheap and the pricing is very expensive, but at least it does have access to aircraft and they will be far better deployed in the Middle East where at least they're competing with similar high fare airlines rather than employing their brains out trying to compete here in Europe or in Central and Eastern Europe with a really low-fare airline like Ryanair whereas they only masqueraded the low-fare airline. Next question please.\nRuairi Cullinane: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Conor Dwyer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is now open, Conor.\nMichael O’Leary: Conor, Hi.\nConor Dwyer: Hi, guys, thanks very much. And so the first question, just back to the passenger numbers, could you give some color maybe on phasing of the seat growth that gets you back down to that 183.5, so scheduled date, as you're going to see in Q2 at around 11% but that seems a bit high now maybe closer to high single digits in the September quarter? And then maybe down to mid -- mid to high single digits in H2. Interesting to get your thoughts on how you're planning to grow that there. And then, secondly, lots of talk about M&A and obviously your own growing cash balance. So I just wondering, would you ever consider doing large M&A in the space, you obviously always talk about growing organically. But it's quite a significant cash balance building up there over the next few years.\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks, Conor. I can't really help you like, look, we're going to take down the full-year numbers from 185 to 183.5, you will take a bit half every month for the next six or seven or to the end of the year, most of that did -- we lost 300,000, 400,000 passengers in April or in April, May and June. 300,000 in July and then there we will have to shave a bit off September and October. But I'm not getting down to the monthly traffic numbers here. It's not a significant movement, but it is a movement. Large scale M&A, I would say it's highly unlikely. We tend to avoid large scale M&A, you're generally inheriting somebody else's problems, I can't foresee. And also I think given our size, it is very easy for the legacy carriers like Lufthansa, Air France and BAA to mobilize or to lobby against Ryanair M&A. And given that we -- with the aircraft orders we have in place now, we can grow organically to 300 million passengers a year. Frankly, I don't really see why we would want to engage in M&A. We have in the past done two deals. We did Buzz originally back in Stansted in the early 90s, where they had access to about 10% or 15% of the slots in Stansted that we thought they were -- we wanted access to the slots. And then we did a little bit with Lauda, three or four years ago pre-COVID in Vienna, both of them were painful bloody experiences, although they been validated over the longer term by building up very strong positions in Stansted and in Vienna Airport. But when you run a very efficient, highly profitable low cost operation, we don't have management resources to deploy into large scale M&A. We might do some smaller stuff kind of add-on, but they will be very small and I will say insignificant. Eddie or Neil, Eddie anything you want to give your personal opinions on that going forward.\nEddie Wilson: I would echo that more compared to on a personal level grow at organically for lots of reasons both, yeah, I mean, I remember the Buzz integration, the original sort of KLM offshoot back in 2003 and now they are obviously to a lesser extent but it take significant management time with the large aircraft order we have two years or 18 months to sort of fill a gap between there to gear up for the next and it's just better from a management perspective to be doing that in a linear fashion rather than deploying resources.\nMichael O’Leary: But we would ultimately encourage competitors throughout key consolidating because of POS. I mean, I think the real challenge and they will all deny it, but the real challenge for easyJet and Wizz and some of these others is actually as Ryanair continues to expand into those marketplaces, there is less and less of an ability for those guys to compete with us. And if you're not going to grow, you're going to have to find M&A is the only way forward. I mean, I continue to believe that in the medium to longer term, Europe would consolidate into four very large airline groups, which will Lufthansa, Air France-KLM, IAG, and us and Neil, sorry, to cut across you. I don't know if Tracey has got anything on the phasing of the half number, Neil?\nNeil Sorahan: I was just going to say that on the M&A, where we play a role, Conor is -- is actually on the remedies. So as that consolidation that Mike was talking about, takes place, we will be in there where the competition overlaps and we will operate on that basis. As long as we can continue to buy aircraft at very attractive levels and we've locked away a decade of growth with our latest aircraft order. I think that's the best way for Ryanair to deliver value to our shareholders.\nMichael O’Leary: Tracey, anything on passenger numbers or?\nTracey McCann: Yes on the passenger numbers, that question is probably more weighted towards the second half of the year because we had significant growth in H2 last year as well.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay, thanks. Okay. Next question please.\nConor Dwyer: Thanks very much all.\nNeil Sorahan: Thanks, Conor.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Patterson from Peel Hunt. Please go ahead Alex. Your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Alex, Hi.\nAlex Patterson: Hi, good morning, everyone. You won a lawsuit last week in Ireland against on the beach, if I remember correctly, your objection to OTA selling seats has been running for many years. I think the legal cases date back to 2010, at least, but they continue to sell your seats. So I don't know if you can say what -- what's your sort of objective, is it to stop them selling seats. Is it to only let them do so through a commercial agreement and what are the financial implications for you of achieving that?\nMichael O’Leary: Eddie, and again Eddie maybe you can answer this, we might give a historical couple of examples of why we object to the non-licensed screen scrapers and we already licensed screen scrapers.\nEddie Wilson: I mean you have to sort of complete disconnect out there that you -- screen scrappers are out there saying they are providing a service. All right they are not providing any service and what they do is that in the vast majority of cases, scraper website does fares and a lot of cases like huge mark ups not just on the fares but on ancillary. And flip that payment methods and then flip the contact addresses, meaning that we're not able to contact us, not able to process refunds and then the OTAs disappear over the horizon, no customer service whatsoever and people cut in the middle and they cut in the middle because they're not able to access our bookings because nowadays, you need to have even access your booking, you need your email address, you need your reference number. So like this is just like highway robbery abandonment of customers and the difficulty in trying to actually provide the service to them particularly in times of disruption and of course it's the sharp end when it comes to the disruption. So they don't provide the service at all. And then sort of dump all the customer service fulfillment on without the customer having any information in order to access their booking, so we continuously from a technological point of view, try to find a way to identify these bookings in advance, so that they take it through. But like there is no agreement with them, so we're not running a charity anytime soon. And the only way that these companies remain in business is by putting on supplemental charges and then abandoning those customers.\nMichael O’Leary: I mean is the only still -- seems to be the only form of Internet piracy that hasn't yet contracted by the consumer agencies and we are astonished that the failure of the Italian consumer agency, the Spanish consumer agency, the UK consumer agencies will not tackle this issue. Their business models can only survive if they somehow scam a consumer for either a hidden charge or to persuade them into buying a handling fee or some sort of fees, other than that just scraping our inventory and we have a very good example the last week, with passengers now calling us up, asking about what's the rules. We don't know who they are, they have a booking made through some screen scraper, you people enrolled that are calling the airline what the -- we don't have any of your details. We've a fake -- we have a fake email address, we have a fake payment account. And the only reason we have a fake payment address and our email address and a fake payment account is because these Internet pirates don't want us to communicate with the passenger because the passenger will find out that they've been overcharge will be overcharged, but it is extraordinary that the consumer agencies continue to sit on their asses and fail to deal with it. If any airline behaved or priced or behave the way these OTAs or the consumer agencies be all over them like a rash and we continue -- go on\nAlex Patterson: So you want to stop them selling your seats entirely.\nMichael O’Leary: No, no, no. No. We want them to stop with miss selling our seats entirety. We already licenses that -- we licensed a significant number of OTAs on our travel agents where they sign up an agreement in which they've promised that they will only quote out their fares, that known fares will be quoted will have the correct account of customer email, the booking will be made directly on ryanair.com and will have direct access, but we're trying to stop is the misselling the anti-consumer pricing and the abandonment of the consumers, which is what happens with all these guys when the shit hits the fan like it does in Rhodes or during COVID.\nAlex Patterson: Understood. And does this lawsuit win help you to do that?\nMichael O’Leary: Yes. Juliusz, you want to add.\nJuliusz Komorek: Yeah. Look, this win last week was on a procedural issue on appeal. So the case is -- it's not open, the case will continue for another two years maybe three with appeals, it was an important win, but it's not over.\nMichael O’Leary: I mean we have numbers of case here where we get, we have an injunction on probably get described, but I won't name them. But we have an injunction to get our -- our core feature against one OTA. And they stop selling through say a Swedish kind of website and next day they open up an Austrian website and then we go up against the Austrian website and they open up a Polish website and claim that it's something different. That was that the injunctions only get -- like they are bunch of tuck-in pirates. It wouldn't be tolerated in any other consumer-facing industry. And yet the useless consumer agencies all across Europe and the European Commission and we brought it, we have submitted a dossier of overcharging of missselling, of mismanagement and nothing happens. So we will keep fighting. And Ryanair is the poster child for this because in most cases, we have the lowest fares in every marketplace. So the reason they want to scrape our fares is that actually while they are levying a kind of a hit and hand be or flipping the passenger at the point of payment for a higher fares than they've quoted. The package still looks reasonably cheap compared to the higher fares of other airline. So it's also until we can get the consumer agencies to wake up and stop this Internet piracy. These guys provide absolutely no service whatsoever except misselling are charging people inflated air fares and hidden handling fees.\nAlex Patterson: Understood, thanks.\nMichael O’Leary: Next question please Maxine.\nNeil Sorahan: Sorry, Mike. So I'm just going to cut in there. Neil, here, I need to drop off at this STAGE. Okay, thanks very much everybody.\nMichael O’Leary: We'll keep going for another say 10, 15 minutes. I would just -- with only three more questions. So let's take all those. Next question please Maxine. Thanks, Neil.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Neil Glynn from Air Control tower. Please go ahead Neil. Your line is now open.\nNeil Glynn: Good morning, everybody. If I could ask firstly on Ryanair Labs. I understand the head count has been growing strongly. I'm just interested in your take Michael on how you expect Lab and contribution to evolve and helping ancillaries as well as operational performance over the next few years as you continue to grow. And then a second question. Pre-pandemic, you obviously launched the multi-AOC, the multi-airlines strategy. We're obviously quite some way along, since then now. And I'm just interested in your take in terms of how that multi-AOC strategy is actually contributing today? And what more we could expect from it in the future, because I don't think there has been too much mention of it over the recent quarters at least.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. Maybe Eddie, as is you are kind of leading the Labs contribution, you may take us through what you see with the Labs, their contribution to date. And what the headcounts were right. So and then, I'll deal with the multi-AOC strategy.\nEddie Wilson: Yeah, I think we'll be heading towards headcount of just short of a thousand in Labs and if you look at just very broad brush figures, and the most important part of what Labs assume is on infrastructure and security -- cyber security and when you take those people out on the what's left of there in my mind is broadly broken into 50% of those working on scheduled revenue development and ancillary revenue development. And then you've got the other part of the business projecting is going to come more in focus as we grow with the MAX-10 order because we're not going to be able to add people under the head office level to support that in a linear fashion and what you have is that you've got labs are developing all sorts of support systems for pilots, cabin crew and engineers like things like E-Tech Logs, where, you take all that paper off the aircraft, where you've got flight planning iPads for pilots and devices for cabin crew where you're communicating things that are happening during the day. So on an operational level, like they would have been supporting the Operations Control Center here as well in running resilience on rosters so that when you do hit -- when you do hit really bad days, they can do that in real time and it takes that sort of China Syndrome out of it where pilots and cabin crew and it didn't go out for the 15,000 people trying to contact the call center, you can never have better advanced people there, so you got to solve the problems before they happen and that's about 50% are really going to be focused on over the next three to four years. So we won't have to do that and then added on to the top of that, you've got sort of things like that are going to happen on generative AI which will just be really under sort of -- primarily under the sort of them the contact centers that we have. And there are obvious upsides on that but it's -- it's infrastructure and security first, then it's supporting a scheduled and ancillary revenue and then supporting our staff on the front line with better comps, better technology, so we don't have to hire a large amount of people as we grow to 300 million passengers.\nMichael O’Leary: Yeah, I think that's the key point with Labs like we bought a lot of kind of in the past, you'd buy bespoke systems for these big airlines like Lufthansa or Swiss Air or who at the time we were carrying 4 or 5 million passengers. They were doing 30 or 40 million passengers. The challenge for us going forward is the biggest airline in Europe -- Group in Europe, other than us is Lufthansa, it's only about 100 million passengers but nobody has developed systems for an airline that now is nearly 200 million passengers with a plan to launch 300 million passengers. So we have to do it ourselves. And Labs, you look at the successful way they've exploited ancillary revenues in recent years has been a -- really a visionary bringing that in-house and developing those systems ourselves has been I think, one of the great sea changes in our development over the last decade. If we were trying to do this now would be with the providers. They know all these tuck-in IT consultants be in here taking your watch and charge you billions to tell you what the time was. We look at some of our competitors who struggle with matching all these, tacked on systems that don't talk to each other, it creates very significant challenges for our airline groupings whereas in ours, the systems are much simpler. Multi-AOC strategy. You're right, it hasn't developed much, remember you go back to where we were in 2017. The reason for the multi AOC strategy was originally to get people off the Irish AOC. The Irish government had this ridiculous taxing claim on all pilots, all cabin crew operating on Irish registered aircraft. They were all paying high personal taxes here in Ireland, as we recognize the EU in 2017, the unions and our people wanted local taxation, local employment contracts and the AOCs facilitated that. Lauda was simply one that we have bought, an Austrian AOC, it was an air -- an Airbus operation. We did move it to Malta but it's an -- it's a separate more AOC. Buzz was set up as a charter airline in Poland, it needed the ability therefore, the benefit of a Polish AOC, so it could fly outside of the European Union to places like Egypt and Turkey, places like that, which and so, the really the only significant development in that in the last number of years has been post Brexit, the setup of Ryanair UK. So we today operate with five AOC to Ryanair DAC on the Irish AOC, Malta Air on the Maltese AOC, Lauda on the Maltese AOC, Buzz on the Polish AOC and Ryanair UK with the UK AOC. It is -- it has a little bit of complexity, particularly at the management side, but I think, it's a sensible way forward. We run a similar type -- well not a similar, but we run a group of airlines in most the same way that Lufthansa operators a group of airlines that has a Germany AOC, an Austria AOC, a Swiss AOC, a Belgian AOC and shortly, I presume an italian AOC, and IAG likewise has a UK AOC, Spanish AOC, a couple of Spanish AOCs within the Group. So -- but it's not something that we would advocate, but I think, if you're going to grow to 200, 300 million passengers and increasingly, I think we will want to fly to certain countries, third party countries like for example, Morocco from the UK, you need to have those AOCs because they're not hard in open skies well the UK is not yet an open sky. But it's not something, I think we would have done by choice. But I think, it was a practical response to a number of issues and challenges we were facing primarily post unionization in 2017. Next question please, Maxine.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Johannes Braun from Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Johannes, hi. Johannes, go ahead please. No. Next question please Maxine. Do we have another one?\nOperator: Our final question today comes from, Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead your line is now open.\nMichael O’Leary: Duane, Hi.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, good morning, thanks for the extensive call here. Just on --\nMichael O’Leary: Thanks for waiting.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Seasonal -- no problem. Just on seasonality. Europe has always had a more exaggerated peak leisure period than the US. I'm curious if there are any behavioral changes you guys are observing post COVID, any changes you see in the underlying seasonality going forward. And then certainly appreciate Ryanair is primarily a leisure airline, but how would you characterize the level of corporate recovery in Europe versus the 80%, 85% recovered in the US. Thank you.\nMichael O’Leary: Eddie, you want to the seasonality and I'll come back on the leisure airline business travel.\nEddie Wilson: Yeah, I mean as we've expanded into markets, we opened two bases in the Canaries, Spain continues to grow, Italy continues to grow, Greece continues to grow, Portugal, these are all I suppose leisure countries that extend -- we've been particularly successful in extending the seasonal lot of those countries. We now added on Morocco is growing strongly, Jordan is growing strongly. So that sort of leisure sort of characteristic is extending itself out as you get away from them, normal perception of the sort of bucket and spade type holiday as opposed to sort of specialist interest of people going traveling to those countries. It's not all about just going to the -- going to the coast. So like, we've been very judicious as they say in how we -- which I've referred to two previous questions which was in cutting back some of that midweek capacity, it's in towards the weekends. But I've been very encouraged by what we can see on -- we are looking at this time last year, where city -- cities have recovered, domestics have recovered, ethnic traffic has recovered as well, but the standard is still same -- are still the leisure which Mike will talk about now in the Canaries.\nMichael O’Leary: Yeah, I just, I mean, I would -- don't overestimate these entries -- we are a leisure airline. We've seen a very strong recovery in our business travel historically where 40% of our passengers were traveling for leisure reasons, about 30% with business and 30% with VFR visiting friends and relatives. Business has recovered very strongly in our -- we see business they already are very short stay outback, same day or next day. We ascribe that to two things. One, the very significant push we've made into the domestic markets in those big countries like Spain, Portugal, Italy, and as you have a bigger percentage in the domestic market, you tend to see more business travel. We've seen a lot of business travel into Central and Eastern Europe, Morocco, Portugal people repairing kind of supply chain, there's been a lot of small and medium-sized businesses repairing supply chains, or they are replacing their Asian supply chain that were badly disrupted during COVID with supply chains that are based in lower cost economies but closer to Europe, so Morocco, Portugal and Central Eastern Europe. We think that will be accentuated too if there's a reopening in Ukraine, there'll be a lot of business travel in and out of Ukraine as that economy recovers. So don't get too distracted by we're all bucket and spade operation it's a chartered, it isn't. We do have a large leisure component, but a very strong visiting friends and relative piece and a very strong and growing business piece as well.\nMichael O’Leary: Okay. I think that's the end of all the questions we had today. Thank you everybody for participating in the call. Thanks to all the team here for what has been a strong Q1. I said, our focus is on continuing to deliver excellent on-time performance during what is a challenging Q2, we're going to continue to mobilize some campaign for ATs -- effective action on the ATC front, we expect shortly, that our passenger protection will hit 1.5 million signatories. We'll be going back out to Brussels to represent that to Mrs. von der Leyen. I'm sure, she will be absent or missing on the day we manage to present the updated petition, but we're not stopping until we get some action out of the useless European Commission on ATC reform and protecting overflights. And then we will continue to campaign heavily for improved staffing at the National ATC providers so that hopefully next year, we'll have a more reliable or at least a -- an ATC service that's more fit for the capacity that Europe requires. I have nothing else to add other than we will keep you updated with monthly traffic load factors that our next sort of big day will be the Capital Markets Day here in the first week of September, we'll have the AGM in the third week of September where hopefully our shareholders will approve our MAX-10 order and then I think our minds will focus on the half-year results, which will be accompanied by an extensive roadshow. I think it's in the middle of November, end of November. Second week of November. Okay, everybody, thank you very much. Thanks, Maxine. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. This now concludes our conference call. Thank you all for attending. You may now disconnect your lines."
