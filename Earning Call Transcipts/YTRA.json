All participants will be in a listen-only mode. There will be a Q&A on today's call. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Manish Hemrajani, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nManish Hemrajani: Thank you, Drew. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Yatra's fiscal third quarter 2024 financial results for the period ended December 31, 2023. I am pleased to be joined on the call today by Yatra's CEO and Co-Founder, Dhruv Shringi, and CFO Rohan Mittal. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management views as of today, February 14, 2024. We don't undertake any obligation to update or revise the information. Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that certain statements made on today's call may constitute forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a description of these risks, please refer to our filings with the SEC and our press release filed earlier this morning. These filings are available from the SEC and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Dhruv. Dhruv, please go ahead.\nDhruv Shringi: Thank you, Manish, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call. We are proud to report strong December quarter results. Yatra's air passenger segment recorded a robust 26% year-over-year growth, nearly tripling the industry benchmark of 9%. This makes it the fourth quarter in a row of share gains for Yatra. In the air travel sector our strong brand recognition and successful strategies in capturing market share has enabled us to grow both our domestic and international air business. As we move forward, we remain optimistic and committed to leveraging these positive trends to drive further growth and success. We fortified our market leadership in the corporate travel sector by finding 26 new corporate customers in the December quarter with an annual billing potential of INR2.2 billion, which is approximately USD27 million. This underlines the capability and leadership of our corporate travel SaaS platform. I would like to highlight here one specific deal that we signed in the December quarter with Aramco Asia India, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the global energy leader Aramco. Yatra's user friendly platform will facilitate effortless bookings for flights, hotels, trains and other ancillary services for Aramco's Asia personnel. This integrated travel solution extends to Aramco's subsidiaries in key Asian and oceanic markets, including India, Japan, Korea, Singapore and Australia. This multiproduct and multi-region deal highlights the capabilities and strengths of our platform and the ability to handle any level of complexity with our cutting edge technology. In alignment with our commitment to shareholder returns, I'm also pleased to report the repurchase of approximately 280,000 shares under the share buyback program authorized by our Board, and we continue to be active on the buyback front in the current quarter. This move underlines our confidence in Yatra's promising future and our unwavering dedication to maximizing shareholder value. Now, let me provide some color on the macro picture. India's economic landscape remains particularly robust, buoyed by a significant public capital expenditure initiative and a strong domestic economy. The Indian economy is poised for consistent growth, with projections now revised upwards estimating 7% GDP growth in FY '24. Travel, as you know, tends to be closely linked to growth in GDP, and over the past decade in the developing economies, we've seen travel growing closer to 1.5x to 2x of GDP growth. Domestic air passenger traffic continued on its coaching growth pace in India and continues to remain the fastest growing air market globally. December '23 saw a total of 13.8 million passengers travel domestically in India, the highest ever monthly passenger traffic number, clearly underscoring the robustness of the Indian aviation sector. Religious travel is one of the biggest segments of tourism in India. Several popular religious centers attract annual tourists in the range of 10 million to 30 million despite the existing infrastructural bottlenecks. On this front, the government has done significant amount of work to improve the infrastructure and we expect that this improvement in infrastructure will continue to drive upward growth in traffic numbers to these destinations. A recent Jefferies report highlighted that the Holy City of Ayodhya could see as many as an influx of up to 50 million visitors each year as a result of the new rebuilt temple. As per the report, tourism in India contributed USD194 billion to FY '19 GDP and is expected to grow at an 8% CAGR to USD$443 billion by FY '33. Tourism to GDP ratio in India sits at 6.8% of GDP, well below most of the large economies. For example, in comparison, China is at 11.6% of GDP. This points to significant headroom for growth in the Indian travel market. Now, let me provide you with some more details of our third quarter. For the quarter ended December 31, 2023, we reported revenues of INR1.1 billion, which is approximately USD13.4 million, marking a substantial increase of 23% over the last year. Our adjusted margin from air ticketing rose to INR1.1 billion, which is USD13.4 million, a 10.2% year-over-year growth. Furthermore, our adjusted EBITDA saw an improvement of 24% year-over-year, reaching INR44.5 million or approximately USD 500,000. Moving on to further details of the quarter, the corporate segment continues to be somewhat impacted with softness and travel spends in the IT/ITES sector. We are confident, however, of the recovery in the near-term from our largest contributing sector, especially as AI related software developments take root globally. In addition, we expect that the new business that we have won over the last few quarters is more than likely to offset the drop that we have seen on account of softness in the IT/ITES sector in the coming quarters. On the hotel front, revenue from our hotels and packages business was INR449 million, which is approximately USD5.4 million. In the three months ended December 31, 2023, this reflected an increase of 17% year-over-year. The increase in revenue is attributable to a recovery in domestic travel, with a higher number of holiday packages sold as a result. From a competitive standpoint, the intensity has remained stable from the last quarter and remains manageable overall. As some of you may recall, we had launched our Yatra Prime membership program in the middle of 2023. We are taking that a step further and as a gratitude to our Indian shareholders, we have offered that subscription free to our shareholders in India, expanding the shareholder base and the base for our Prime customers. With the positive macro backdrop, and given the ongoing recovery in corporate and leisure travel, and the rise in discretionary spending and now a significantly bolstered balance sheet, we believe we are well poised for the strong FY '24 and '25. Aside from seasonality and some softness that I touched upon earlier in the ITES sector, we expect our results to benefit from accelerating growth in both our corporate business and consumer business as we continue to add to a formidable blue chip customer base and leverage the strength of our brand. Given our stronger balance sheet following the IPO, we've already begun to see early signs of improving supplier margins and expect this to gain further momentum in the quarters ahead and have a meaningful positive impact on our operating performance going forward. With that, let me hand it over to Rohan to walk you through the details of the financial performance. Rohan?\nRohan Mittal: Thank you, Dhruv. I will now review our quarter three numbers for the quarter ending December 31, 2023. Our gross booking for the quarter was INR18.6 million, which is roughly USD224 million, up by 18% YoY, with air up by 22%, and the hotels and packages up by 4% YoY. For the December quarter, our total revenue grew by 23% to INR1.1 billion, which is roughly USD13.4 million on account of sustained travel demand. Adjusted margins were up across air, hotel, package and other services, with the air ticketing business up by 10% YoY to INR1.1 billion, while the hotel and package business adjusted margin was up by 4% YoY to INR264 million, which is roughly USD3.2 million. Adjusted margin from other services was also up by 49% YoY. Moving to the expenses, quarter three marketing and sales promotion expenses, including consumer promotions and loyalty program costs increased by 8% on a YoY basis to INR884, which is roughly USD10.6 million. The marketing increase lacked the overall gross bookings growth of 18%, which shows a strong boundary call of Yatra. Our personal expenses, excluding share based payment expenses, increased by 8% YoY to INR279 million which was roughly USD3.4 million. Payment gateway costs as a percentage of the total gross bookings remained [indiscernible], while other expenses increased by about 13% on YoY basis. On an overall basis, adjusted EBITDA stands at INR44.5 million as compared to USD36 million in the quarter ended December '22. Lastly, as of 31st December 2023, balance of cash and cash equivalents and term deposits on our books was a little above INR5 billion, which is roughly USD60.7. Our gross debt, as on 31st December '23 was INR 852. We've reduced this by almost 51% at a gross level on a quarter-on-quarter basis. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks. Now I'd like to hand it over to the moderator for Q&A. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Scott Beck from HC Wainwright. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nScott Beck: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I may have missed it in the prepared remarks drew, but can you comment a little bit on some of those pricing headwinds that you saw in the second quarter and how they impacted the third quarter and maybe what the outlook is for the fourth quarter on those?\nRohan Mittal:\nPratt: So there is a little bit of pricing headwind which is there, and we expect this to carry on till about the summer months and it is only around the July-August time frame that we see the capacity beginning to come back into the ecosystem. So for the next two quarters, there is going to be a bit of pricing increase, which we will see, and that may have a slight bit of softening or that may result in a slight bit of softening in demand.\nWhitney engines: So there is a little bit of pricing headwind which is there, and we expect this to carry on till about the summer months and it is only around the July-August time frame that we see the capacity beginning to come back into the ecosystem. So for the next two quarters, there is going to be a bit of pricing increase, which we will see, and that may have a slight bit of softening or that may result in a slight bit of softening in demand.\nScott Beck: Great, that's helpful. And my second, hoping you'd give us a little bit more of an update or a little more color around international travel and the trends you're seeing there. I mean, it seems like that's been a bit of a laggard versus corporate and leisure travel just in catching up since COVID.\nRohan Mittal: Yes. Certainly International travel actually improved quite meaningfully in the last quarter. It was just a little bit ahead of our weighted average growth rate of 26% that we saw. So we've seen strong recovery happening on the international side in the last quarter, and there is more capacity expansion that's happening on the international front. We've seen some of the airlines, like Air India, deploy more capacity on the international routes. We've also seen some of the international airlines bring back a little bit of their capacity into the Indian market on the back of the demand, which is there. So we should continue to see good momentum on international travel. So while in the first half of our fiscal year of last year, international travel lagged behind in the last quarter, which is the December quarter, international travel has gained momentum and is carrying forward that same momentum into the current quarter.\nScott Beck: Great, that's helpful. And then last one from me. I'm just curious given the severe dislocation between where the U.S. shares trade and where the local shares are valued, what kind of fungibility, if anything, is there between the shares? Maybe you could help kind of walk us through that a little bit.\nDhruv Shringi: As of today, Scott, there are two separate entities. One is a holding company and the other is the operating company. So, on account of that, these two shares today at least, are not fungible. But we'll continue to work with our council to see if there is any way for us to make them fungible. But it's a bit too early to state on that categorically as to what shape would that take. But having said that, I think, like you pointed out, I think there is a large arbitrage opportunity that exists today between the prices of the two indexes. India, being the home market is trading at a very different price point compared to where the US is trading. But in terms of fungibility, I think that's all unfortunately that I can share at the moment.\nScott Beck: Thank you. I appreciate the added color and congrats on the results, guys.\nDhruv Shringi: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have no further questions in the queue, so I will hand back over for any closing remarks.\nManish Hemrajani: Thanks Drew. Thank you, everyone for joining the call today and as always, we are available for follow-ups. Thank you.\nOperator: That concludes today's Yatra Online, Inc.'s fiscal third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your line."

During the presentation all participants will be on mute however at the end of today's presentation there'll be an opportunity to ask a question. [Operator Instructions] I’d now like to turn the call over to Manish Hemrajani, Vice President of Corporate Development and IR to begin. Please go ahead whenever you are ready.\nManish Hemrajani: Thank you, Allen. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Yatra's fiscal second quarter 2024 financial results for the year ended September 30 2023. I’m pleased to be joined on the call today by Yatra CEO and Co-Founder, Dhruv Shringi, and Group CFO Rohan Mittal. The following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management views as of today, November 17, 2023. We don't undertake any obligation to update or revise the information. Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that certain statements made on today's call may constitute forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. For a description of these risks, please refer to our filings with the SEC and our press release filed earlier this morning. These filings are available from the SEC and also on the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Dhruv. Dhruv, please go ahead.\nDhruv Shringi: Thank you, Manish, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. It is my pleasure to share that for the third consecutive quarter, we have expanded our market share in the air travel sector. In the second quarter of 2024, our air passenger bookings surged by 31.2% year-over-year, far outpacing the industry's growth rate of 22.7%. This not only underscores the Yatra brand's resilience, but also highlights our competitive edge in capturing market share. International travel has also shown a steady improvement during the quarter ended September 30, 2023, reaching approximately 90% of the pre-COVID levels. As we move forward, we remain optimistic and committed to leveraging these positive trends to drive further growth and success. In the corporate travel sector, we further strengthened our position by securing 13 new corporate accounts in the quarter. These accounts carry a potential annual billing of about INR813 million an hour, which is roughly $10 million, reflecting our platform's capability and leadership in the market. Beyond the quarter, we have continued our momentum in closing deals with significant clients like [Indiscernible] and a major multinational corporation, wherein we will manage their travel needs across various regions in Africa, in Asia, further expanding our influence and operational footprint. Additionally, as some of you may have seen in our press release this morning, I would also like to share that the board has authorized the share repurchase of up to $5 billion of our NASDAQ listed YTRA shares, underscoring our confidence in Yatra's future and our steady-fast commitment to delivering shareholder value. This authorization represents approximately 5% of Yatra Online Inc's market capitalization based on the current share price. Now let me provide some more color on the macro picture. According to the International Monetary Fund, global inflation is projected to gradually decrease from 8.7% in 2022 to 6.9% in 2023 and further to 5.8% in 2024. This trend is attributed to the implementation of tighter monetary policy and the stabilization of international commodity prices. Amidst this backdrop of softening inflation, India's economic landscape remains particularly robust, void by a significant public capital expenditure initiative and a strong domestic economy. The Indian economy is poised for consistent growth with projections estimating 6.3% increase over 2023 and 2024. This positive trajectory underscores the resilience and dynamic nature of our economy. Travel does tend to be closely linked to the growth in GDP and over the past decade we have seen travel growing anywhere between 1.5 times to 2 times of GDP growth. India’s per capita GDP has also witnessed an extraordinary growth trajectory. Increase in GDP per capita has required four decades from 1960 to 2000 to achieve a five-fold increase, but the same five-fold increase has been achieved in just the last two decades. This is growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 25%. The surge in per capita income is a key driver for heightened discretionary spend, with travel and dining out emerging as the primary beneficiaries. Amidst this landscape of an accelerating rise in discretionary income, we are confident in our potential to surpass market growth rates. Our strategy to capture a greater share in the corporate travel market, coupled with the sustained strength of our consumer brand, positions us well for continued expansion and success. Now let me provide you with some more details on our second quarter. Our revenue for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, was reported at INR947.6 million, approximately $11.4 million, up 14% year-over-year. Adjusted margins from air ticketing of $12.3 million were down by 4.8% year-over-year, largely on account of almost 15% decline in air ticket prices year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reached INR35 million, approximately $400,000. This is lower versus the September 2022 quarter at INR77.7 million or approximately $900,000. We incurred IPO-related listing fees during the quarter of INR68.2 million or $0.8 million, which are one-time in nature. Moving on to further details of the quarter. The corporate segment was somewhat impacted in the September quarter with softness and travel space in the IT and ITEA sectors. We are confident, however, of the recovery in the near-term from our largest contributing sector. We expect that the new business that we have won is likely to offset the drop that we have seen on account of the softness in the IT, ITEA segment by the first quarter of calendar year 2024. On the hotel front, revenue from our hotel and packages business was INR366 million, which is approximately $4.4 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023, as compared to INR267 million or $3.2 million in the three months ended September 30, 2022. This reflects a 37% increase year-over-year. The increase in revenue is attributable to recovery in domestic travel, along with the addition of new distribution partners and the focus on selling better quality hotels aimed at business travelers. From a competitive standpoint, the intensity has remained stable from the last quarter and remains manageable overall. With the positive micro backdrop and given the ongoing recovery in corporate and ledger travel and the rise in discretionary spend and now a significantly bolstered balance sheet, we believe we are poised for a strong FY ‘24 and FY ‘25. Aside from seasonality, we expect our results to benefit from accelerating growth in both our corporate business and consumer business as we continue to act to our formidable blue chip customer base and leverage the strength of our brand. Just to reiterate, today, Yatra India serves one out of every four of the top 100 listed companies in India, three out of the big four accounting firms, and three of the top five technology companies in India. In addition, as part of the IPO, we have also earmarked INR1.5 billion, approximately $19 million towards M&A, and are evaluating opportunities in the B2B space that allow us to expand our product platform for our business travel customers. Given our stronger balance sheet following the IPO, we've already begun to see early signs of improving supplier margins in the current quarter and expect this to gain further momentum in the quarters ahead and have a meaningful positive impact on our operating performance going forward. In addition, we have also seen the positive impact from the IPO in a stronger balance sheet in one of our large corporate customer contract discussions, which has had a favorable outcome for Yatra, and we expect to see more of these in the quarter to come. With these positive tailwinds, we expect our operating performance to continue to improve quarter-on-quarter in the near-term. With that, let me hand it over to Rohan to walk you through the details of the financial performance. Rohan?\nRohan Mittal: Thank you, Dhruv. I will now review our quarter two numbers for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Our gross booking for quarter two was INR17.5 billion, which is roughly $211 million. This was up by 10% on a Y-o-Y basis. Our two main segments, air and hotels & packages, both grew by 12% on a Y-o-Y basis during this period. For this quarter, our revenue grew by 14% to INR948 million, which is about $11.4 million, on account of sustained elevated travel demand. Our adjusted margin from the air ticket business reduced by 5% Y-o-Y to INR1 billion, due to limited access to airline deals in quarter two. The adjusted margin from hotel & package business increased by 16% Y-o-Y to INR278 million, which is about $3.3 million. The increase is on account of recovery in the domestic travel, along with addition of new distribution partners. Adjusted margin from other services increased by 21% on a Y-o-Y basis to INR50 million. This increase in adjusted margin is due to the increase in revenue from our other B2C services. The total adjusted margin for all the three segments put together remained flattish. Our other revenue increased by 43% on a Y-o-Y basis to INR144 million, primarily on account of increase in advertisement revenue. Moving to the expenses, our quarter two marketing and sales promotion expenses, including the consumer promotion loyalty program costs, increased by 4% on a Y-o-Y basis to INR832 million, which is about $10 million. This marketing increase lagged the overall gross booking growth of 10%, which is a positive sign. Our personal expenses, excluding the share-based payment expenses, increased by 11% Y-o-Y to INR279 million, which is roughly $3.4 million, primarily on account of the annual appraisal cycle. Payment gateway costs as a percentage of the total gross bookings remain [Indiscernible]. Other expenses excluding payment gateway reduced by 16% on a Y-o-Y basis. In quarter two, we have completed the cost accounting of IPO expenses and taken a one-time charge of INR68 million, which is a little below a million dollars. Adjusted EBITDA profit stands at INR35 million, as compared to INR78 million in the quarter ended September 2022. Lastly, as of September 30, the balance of cash and cash equivalents and term deposits on our balance sheet was INR7.1 billion, which is roughly $86.4 million. This reflects the proceeds from our recently concluded IPO, while our gross debt was INR1.74 billion. With this, we come to the closure of our prepared remarks. I'd like to hand it back to the moderator for opening the questions-and-answers. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Scott Buck from H.C. Wainwright. Scott, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nScott Buck: Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Dhruv, can you give us a little bit more color on what's driving the softening in air ticket prices? And you know, it sounds like that's kind of dragged a little bit here through the fiscal third quarter as well, correct?\nDhruv Shringi: Hi, Scott, good morning. Yes, you're right that, you know, air ticket prices have softened significantly, especially on the international travel front. Here we've seen a lot more deployment of capacity. So last year as we were coming out of COVID, capacity was really limited in terms of airlines deploying aircrafts on the India route. We've seen a significant expansion of that playing out during the last 12-months. And that incremental supply is what's resulting in prices rationalizing and coming closer and closer towards where they were in the pre-COVID environment. On the domestic front as well, we've seen supply expansion play out. In fact, even going forward, it's expected that over the next six months, Air India will add more than an aircraft a week. So we will continue to see more capacity expansion happening. The good thing about that is that while on the one hand, it does depress air ticket prices, it does stimulate demand. So if you look at from an overall perspective, the industry grew almost 23% year-over-year. We grew 31%, so from a volume growth perspective, this is actually a great sign that prices are rationalizing. Going forward, we expect prices to remain range-bound because the vast majority of the incremental capacity that had to be deployed on the international routes is already in place, and from here on, it's going to be a more gradual expansion of capacity as opposed to the large-scale expansion in supply that we saw over the last 12-months.\nScott Buck: Great that's really helpful color. And then I want to dig in a little bit on the M&A strategy. Are you looking to do one large deal, multiple small deals? Could you give us just a little bit more color on that? And what does the timing look like there?\nDhruv Shringi: Sure, so as we've called it out in our own IPO prospectus as well in India, our endeavor would be to look at opportunities which allow us to expand the products and services that we can cross-sell into our corporate customer base. These could be anything ranging from multiple other products and services related to travel or other ancillary travel and technology related offerings that organizations use. So from that perspective, it could be either. So it could be a -- one which has a meaningful size and scale, or it could be technologies and products that could dovetail into our offering. The latter would be the more likely route that we will adopt, right? But I can't rule out the former either. The strategy would be to look at things which can fit into our platform and then help scale up the revenue from those incremental services within our existing corporate customer base.\nScott Buck: Great, I appreciate that. And then last one for me, just on OpEx, I'm curious given the growth projections over the next 12-months or so, how do you feel, or are you comfortable with the current cost basis, or do you have to do a fair amount of hiring or additional investment in OpEx to support that growth?\nDhruv Shringi: See, on the OpEx side, we've pretty much got all the main ingredients in place. There might be a little bit of incremental investment that comes in on the technology side, but it's going to be fairly marginal in the overall scheme of things. So we don't expect our cost structure to change significantly, especially if you were to look at this as a percentage of total transaction value we don't see that changing much.\nScott Buck: Great appreciate the time guys thank you again.\nDhruv Shringi: Sure, thank you. Thanks, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Okay, currently no further questions on the line, so I'd like to hand back to the management team for any closing remarks.\nManish Hemrajani: Thank you, Allen. Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As always we’re available for follow-ups. Please feel free to reach out to us and wish you all a happy Thanksgiving.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference call, everybody. Thanks very much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great rest of your day."

[Operator Instructions] It's my pleasure to now hand you over to your host, Manish Hemrajani, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nManish Hemrajani: Thank you, Lydia. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Yatra's fiscal first quarter 2024 financial [Technical Difficulty]. We have on the call today Yatra’s CEO and Co-Founder, Dhruv Shringi, and CFO, Rohan Mittal. Following discussion, including responses to your questions, reflects management views as of today, October 16th, 2023. We don't undertake any obligation to update or revise the information. Before we begin our formal remarks, let me remind you that certain statements made on today's call may constitute forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to several risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.

With that, let me turn the call over to Dhruv. Dhruv, please go ahead.\nDhruv Shringi: Thank you, Manish. Good morning to all, and I appreciate your presence on our Q1 earnings call for fiscal ‘24. I am delighted to announce a significant milestone for Yatra Online Limited. We successfully concluded our Indian IPO of INR7.75 billion, which is approximately $93 million, and proudly made our debut on the Indian stock exchanges on the 28th of September. This achievement holds special significance for all of us at Yatra. The funds generated from the IPO are earmarked for strategic investments, acquisitions, inorganic growth, technology advancement, bolstering customer acquisition and retention, and other initiatives pivotal to our organic growth and corporate endeavors. Furthermore, Yatra Online, Inc. also benefited from an additional capital of approximately $21 million as the selling shareholder, THCL, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Yatra Online, Inc. sold these many shares in the open market. The capital not only enables us to settle the MAK debt, but also provides us the flexibility to potentially allocate a part of the residual funds for future Yatra share buybacks. The recent IPO in tandem with these developments offers us strategic leverage, enhancing our market visibility, diversifying our shareholder base, and consequently strengthening the Yatra brand. The IPO was based on a pre-money valuation of INR16 billion which is approximately $193 million which equates to, again, approximately $3.03 per YTRA share that trades on NASDAQ. This is based on a share count of 63.6 million shares outstanding currently. The current market cap of the India entity is approximately INR23.15 billion, which is approximately $280 million. And post the IPO, Yatra Online, Inc. owned about 65% of its Indian subsidiary, which on a consolidated basis, as I mentioned above, equates to an approximate share price of YTRA shares of $3.03. Now moving on to the June quarter results. I'm pleased to report that we had our strongest quarter on the air front since the advent of COVID with the highest number of air passengers booked since pre-COVID in December 2019. This was up 41.5% year-over-year, far outpacing the domestic air passenger industry growth of 14.8%. Moreover, our sequential growth has been twice the pace of the industry, faster than our peers, demonstrating our ability to gain share and the inherent strength of the Yatra brand. International travel has also shown a steady improvement during the quarter, reaching approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels. As we move forward, we remain optimistic and committed to leveraging these positive trends to drive further growth and success. We further fortified our leadership in the corporate travel sector by signing 19 new corporate customers in the June quarter. These customers have an annual billing potential of INR1.5 billion, which is approximately $18.2 million. This underlines the capabilities and leadership of our Corporate Travel SaaS platform. As for the IMF, India's economic growth remains robust, given by a large public capital expenditure push and the resilient domestic demand. The economy is expected to grow by 6.3% in both 2023 and 2024. As it relates to Yatra, looking at how the travel industry has unfolded over the last several years, we see that travel trends to grow at a multiple of 1.5x to 2.0x of GDP. We believe that we should be able to achieve growth rates above market rates as we continue to take share in the corporate travel market and as the consumer market continues to remain robust. Both the expansion of the travel industry and the macro conditions continuing to be favorable allow us to do so. The Indian aviation industry is witnessing unprecedented expansion of its fleet. The fleet is expected to almost double over the next five years and the aviation ministry is forecasting more than doubling in air passengers to approximately 400 million annual air passengers in the next decade. Regarding inflation, again, India is faring relatively well. CPI-based inflation stood at 5.02% in September as compared with 6.83% in August, according to data from the Ministry of Statistics. Core inflation fell to 4.6% in September from 4.8% in August, and this was the lowest since April 2020. Now, let me provide you with some more details on our first quarter results. Our revenue for the quarter ended 30th of June, 2023, was reported at INR1.106 billion, which is approximately $13.5 million. This was up 23% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reached INR115.4 million, which is approximately $1.4 million, marginally lower versus the June '22 quarter at about $1.5 million. India's domestic passenger traffic saw a sequential growth of 3% in the quarter ended June 30, 2023. Compared to this, our domestic passenger traffic grew 6%, faster than peers, reflecting strong market share gains from both our consumer and corporate businesses. This positive momentum has carried over into subsequent months as well with the recently concluded September month up 18.3% year-over-year and up 7% versus pre-COVID, marking seven consecutive months of above pre-COVID levels on the domestic air passenger traffic front. So the market has firmly recovered from the pre-COVID levels. Year-to-date, from January to September 2023, Indian domestic market has registered a growth of 29.1% with 112.8 million passengers flying during this period. International travel has also continued to show resiliency and steady improvement during the quarter and has now surpassed 90% of its pre-COVID levels. As we move forward, we remain optimistic and committed to leveraging these positive trends to drive further growth and success. Moving on to further details of the quarter. Our consumer business gained further traction on the back of strong brand recall that the yatra.com brand continues to enjoy in the market. We launched our Yatra Prime offering during the quarter, and the initial sign-ups have been encouraging with positive response to this offering continuing in the subsequent months. During the quarter, we closed 19 new corporate consumer accounts. While the number is lower Q-on-Q, partly due to seasonality, what was encouraging was that the average billing potential of the customers that we closed during this quarter trended higher than in the past. International travel also continues to improve gradually, and we are optimistic in the outlook for a sustained recovery in near-shore international travel. On the hotels front, revenue from our hotels and packages business was INR452.6 million, which is approximately $5.5 million in the three months ended [June 20, 2023] (ph) as compared to INR390.7 million or $4.8 million in the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting an increase of almost 16%. The increase in revenue is on account of recovery in domestic travel, along with additions of new distribution partners. From a competitive standpoint, the intensity has remained stable from last quarter and remains manageable overall. From a macro standpoint, the Indian government remains strongly committed to the growth of airport infrastructure in India, an investment of almost $12 billion has been earmarked for the enhancement of 41 existing airports in India. Additionally, under the greenfield airport policy, out of the 21 new airports that were sanctioned, 12 have already come online. So, with a positive macro backdrop and given the ongoing recovery in corporate and leisure travel, and our continued success in signing new large and medium-sized enterprise customers, and now a significantly bolstered balance sheet, we believe we are poised for a strong back half of FY '24. Aside from seasonality, we expect our results to benefit from accelerating growth in both our corporate business and consumer business as we continue to add to our formidable blue chip customer base and leverage the strength of our brand. Just to reiterate, today, Yatra India serves one of four -- one out of every four of the top 100 listed companies in India. It also services three out of the big four accounting firms and three of the top five technology companies in India. Finally, I would like to express my deepest appreciation of our dedicated employees and the shareholders for their unveiling support. With that, let me hand it over to Rohan to walk you through the details of the financial performance. Rohan, over to you.\nRohan Mittal: Thank you, Dhruv. I will now review our quarter one numbers for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. For the June quarter, we continue to witness strong tailwinds, and we were able to grow our gross bookings to INR19.8 billion, which is about $241 million in quarter one, registering a Y-o-Y growth of 11%. The revenue from Air Ticketing business increased by 30% year-on-year to INR490 million, which is about $6 million. The adjusted margin also increased by almost 46% Y-o-Y to INR1.2 billion, which is roughly $14 million. The strong growth was driven by sustained travel demand in the country as well as an accrual of special bonus of previous contracts. Revenue from Hotel and Packages business increased by almost 16% year-on-year to INR452 million, which translates into about $5.5 million and the adjusted margin increased by 1.6% year-on-year to INR307 million, which is roughly $4.8 million. The increase in revenue and adjusted margin is on account of recovery in domestic travel as well as addition of new distribution partners. Revenue from the Other Services decreased by 43.8% year-on-year to INR26.7 million. The decrease was primarily due to a relook at the freight business. The total adjusted margin from all the segments combined, increased by 30.5% year-on-year to INR1.5 billion, which is roughly $18.3 million, and the total income increased by 22.6% year-on-year to INR1.1 billion, approximately $13.5 million. Moving on to the expenses. Our quarter one marketing, sales promotion, consumer promotion, loyalty program costs increased by 72% on a year-on-year basis to INR880 million, which is roughly $10.7 million. Our personnel expenses increased by 2.2% year-on-year to INR275 million. Excluding share-based expenses, the total expense cost increased by 11%, which is in line with the increase in head count as well as appraisals. Other operating expenses increased by 3.6% to INR396 million, which is roughly $4.8 million, primarily due to increase in commission, legal, professional charges, payment gateway charges, et cetera. Due to all of the above factors, our adjusted EBITDA profit for the quarter ended June '23 stands at INR115.4 million -- INR115.4 million, which translates into about $1.4 million as compared to INR123.5 million in quarter ended June '22. Our gross debt increased by INR43 million from the March quarter to the June quarter and we ended the quarter at a gross debt of INR1.7 billion -- sorry, my apologies, of INR2.4 billion, which translates into about $29 million. Lastly, as of June 30, we were carrying cash and cash equivalents and term deposits on a balance sheet worth INR1.1 billion, which is $13.5 million. With this, we conclude our prepared remarks and hand it back to the organizers -- to the moderator. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Scott Buck of H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open.\nScott Buck: Hi, everybody. Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the IPO. Dhruv, my first question, could you give us a little more color on the acquisition environment and maybe what could potentially make sense for you guys from a strategic perspective?\nDhruv Shringi: Sure. Hi, good morning, Scott. Scott, in terms of the acquisitions, we've looked at a couple of areas in the past. And I think those areas will continue to remain areas of interest for us. One is offline businesses on the corporate travel side, where we can acquire entities at a reasonably low price and then take out costs from those businesses by putting in place our technology solutions and improve the operating margin significantly. So that would be one area that we would look at. The other area is also, again, in the corporate space where we would look at other products and services, especially SaaS-based technology solutions like an expense management for example, that can be cross-sold to our existing large corporate customer base. So it's about -- our thought process is how do we either grow our base on the corporate side or add more products and services to leverage the existing base. So those would be the key areas that we would look at.\nScott Buck: Great. That's helpful. And second, can you give us an indication of where your market share position is today in corporate travel versus where it was pre-COVID?\nDhruv Shringi: So, versus pre-COVID, obviously, we've expanded our customer base by about close to 15%. So my sense is that in terms of market share because the number of companies in that top segment would not have grown by 15%, right, would have grown by a much smaller number. So we will only have gained market share over the course of the last 1.5 years.\nScott Buck: Yeah. That's helpful. And then last one for me. Just on how we should be thinking about operating expenses moving forward. Do you have a meaningful amount of, kind of, catch-up that you need to do on OpEx now that you have some additional cash to play with? Or should we expect OpEx levels to remain kind of largely consistent with what we've seen in the past few quarters?\nDhruv Shringi: Yeah. So, OpEx levels will not change very significantly, right? We would see maybe low single-digit to mid-single-digit kind of increase, but nothing significantly beyond that, at least on the fixed cost.\nScott Buck: Right. That’s perfect. Well, I appreciate the time guys. Thank you very much.\nDhruv Shringi: Not at all. Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have a question from Cobb Sadler of Catamount. Your line is open.\nCobb Sadler: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just had a question on the new corporate customers. I believe what you said was -- I have the number right in front of me, [$18 million] (ph) incremental associated with those accounts. When do you think you might hit that run rate with those accounts? And what -- that seems to be bigger than a traditional customers that you've added. So are they bigger? Why? And when we hit the $18 million, if that's the right number? Thanks. One more question.\nDhruv Shringi: Sure. Sure, Scott. Sorry, Cobb. So in terms of getting to that run rate cost, we're looking at a six-month kind of timeline to get to that full run rate by the time the new customers get implemented. So if you look at from where we were, right, this is numbers as of 30th of June, so we would expect the full thing to come into play by the Jan to March quarter of 2024, right? So that's what we are looking at with regards to these customers. They should all be live in that kind of time frame. In terms of why are they -- or are they larger? Yes, we've had some good wins in this quarter, which have pulled up the average. There are a couple of customers who are larger than the traditional average customer that we would sign -- and that's part of the reason why the average has gone up per customer. There are some other conversations like this also which are going on, and we remain very positive about the strength of our value proposition to our large corporate customers.\nRohan Mittal: And, Cobb, the number is 19, not…\nCobb Sadler: Okay. And so, in that -- so roughly, yes -- 18 -- okay, 19. So $4.5 million to $5 million a quarter and -- I'm sorry, Manish, go ahead.\nManish Hemrajani: No, I was just saying that number was 19 customers signed.\nCobb Sadler: Okay. Got you. 19 customers signed. Did you give an amount of which those might contribute -- like the revenue associated with the 19?\nDhruv Shringi: Yeah. So, Cobb, the $18 million number that you were referring to, sorry, Manish, let me just address that. So Cobb, it's 19 customers with an annual billing potential of $18 million. So which is the $4.5 million a quarter that you were referring to.\nCobb Sadler: Got you. That's right. Okay. Got you. And that -- you think that no crystal ball, you think that might happen six months out, maybe, if -- some things take longer than expected, like, six to nine months out probably. That $4.5 million is incremental…\nDhruv Shringi: That’s right.\nCobb Sadler: …to the current revenue base. That's $4.5 million a quarter. Okay. And then the other question was on...\nDhruv Shringi: Sorry, Cobb, can I just interrupt you. This is gross billing potential, not revenue potential, right? So the revenue number will be approximately 5% to 6% of this. [indiscernible] That’s right. Yeah.\nCobb Sadler: Okay. That makes more sense. It sounded abnormally big. So -- okay. So -- but still -- and you've got 800 customers. So this is another 19, and that sounds about right. Okay. The other thing was on your buybacks. So what are the parameters by which you buy back stock? I mean, is there a valuation level? I guess you are trading -- I mean, the shares are trading at a 50% discount now? Are there -- yeah, 50% discount now roughly. And so when might you start buying back shares? What do you have to do to do that? You have to have a Board meeting or could you do it now if you wanted to? I guess, I am looking for timing and then what are the triggers for you?\nDhruv Shringi: So, Cobb, this is something that the Board is carefully considering with counsel, and we'll go through this process. And in the relatively near term, we'll come back and update our shareholders with our thought process around this.\nCobb Sadler: Okay. All right, sounds good. Thank you. Congrats on the IPO.\nDhruv Shringi: Thank you so much. Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions in the queue. So I'll turn the call back to Manish Hemrajani for any closing remarks.\nManish Hemrajani: Thank you, Lydia. Thank you all for joining the call today. As always, we are available for follow-up. Please feel free to reach out to us. Thank you. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."
