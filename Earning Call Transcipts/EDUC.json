At this time, all lines are in listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, January 11th of 2024. Before beginning the call, we would like to remind you that some of the statements made today will be forward-looking and are protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied due to a variety of factors. We refer you to Educational Development Corporation's recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the company's financial condition. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steven Hooser, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSteven Hooser: Thank you, Alan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for Educational Development Corporation's third quarter earnings call. On the call with me today are Craig White, President and Chief Executive Officer; Heather Cobb, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; and Dan O'Keefe, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed this afternoon, the company issued a press release announcing its results for the fiscal third quarter. The release is available on the company's website at www.edcpub.com. Additionally, as the operator noted, today's conference call and prepared remarks are being recorded and there are forward-looking statements. With that, I would now like to turn the call over to Craig White, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer. Craig?\nCraig White: Thank you, Steven. Welcome, everyone, to the call. I will start today's call with some general comments regarding the quarter, then I will pass the call over to Dan and Heather to run through the financials and provide an update on sales and marketing. Finally, I will wrap up the call with some comments on strategy and fiscal 2024 outlook. We are encouraged, as we have seen our active brand partner count, stabilize this summer and remain at consistent levels through our fiscal third quarter, which is traditionally our largest sales quarter of the year. During the third quarter, our sales within our PaperPie division decreased approximately 30% from third quarter last year, primarily due to the lower active brand partner levels. The sales in our Publishing division were also lower this quarter due to the stoppage of selling Usborne products. As a reminder, this was in part due to our new distribution agreement with Usborne Publishing that we entered into May of last year. However, the decrease in Usborne sales were partially offset by strong orders for our new product line, SmartLab Toys, along with increased sales of Kane Miller books and Learning Wrap-Ups products. We continue to be excited about the demand for all of our products and especially when we look at the growth opportunities within SmartLab Toys, where we have only introduced 25 initial products through the third quarter. During the quarter, we offered sales promotions and strategically reduced freight charges to increase demand and make it easier for our brand partners to engage new customers. These changes impacted our third quarter operating profits that were aligned with our goals to intentionally reduce our excess inventory levels and improve long-term brand partner success. Brand partner success generates future brand partners success and that continues to be our number one focus. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dan O'Keefe to provide a brief overview of our financials. Dan?\nDan O'Keefe: Thank you, Craig. To our fiscal third quarter results compared to the third quarter last year, net revenues for the third quarter totaled $16.9 million, a decrease of $13.4 million or 44% compared to $30.3 million in the third quarter last year. Average active PaperPie brand partners for the quarter totaled 16,400 compared to 27,100 in the third quarter last year, a decrease of 10,700 or 39%. Earnings before income taxes totaled $2.7 million compared to a breakeven level of earnings before taxes in the third quarter last year. After-tax income totaled $2 million compared to breakeven last year. Income per share for the quarter totaled $0.24. To update everyone on our inventory and working capital levels, net inventories decreased $6.3 million from $64.3 million at November 30th, 2022 compared to $57.9 million at November 30th, 2023. Now for a working capital update. Our working capital line of credit borrowed was $5 million at the end of the quarter on November 30th 2023. During the quarter, the company met the line of credit step-down requirements from $13.5 million in August to $5 million in November, as outlined in the company's credit agreement with our bank. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the company executed the fourth amendment to its credit agreement with increased borrowing availability to $8 million and enables us to purchase new inventory of $2.1 million between December 1st 2023 and March 31st 2024. The line of credit maturity was also extended from January 31st to May 31st 2024, which is the expected sale period of our recently listed Hilti Complex, which Craig will touch on briefly. The proceeds from the sale of the Hilti Complex will be used to pay down the line of credit and term loans with our bank. Also during the third quarter, the company switched our credit card processor from PayPal to Nexio, which released a majority of the increased reserves of cash held during the quarter. That concludes the financial update, and I'll now turn the call over to Heather Cobb to talk about sales and marketing opportunities in further detail. Heather?\nHeather Cobb: Thank you, Dan. As Craig mentioned earlier, we continue to make changes to bring new success to our brand partners. As an example, during the third quarter, we ran several promotions, including site-wide sales and sent marketing communications to previous customers, making them aware of the ability to purchase products from their brand partners at discounted pricing from 10% to 30% off retail prices. In addition, as Craig mentioned, in September, we began offering $5 flat rate shipping on our e-commerce orders with free shipping taking effect at $30. This change in shipping charges has been well received from our customers and brand partners alike. On January 3th of this year, we celebrated the first anniversary of the reveal of PaperPie, marking the rebrand of our direct sales division. This milestone is important as it provides an opportunity for reflection, assessment and celebration and marks the completion of the introduction of this new brand. Not just the outward marks like our name, colors and logo, but also more intrinsically, our mission of gathering for good around literacy and learning are more recognizable in communities around the country. This anniversary also provides a foundation for us to build momentum and sustain the positive changes initiated by this rebrand. Another significant upcoming improvement will be the launch of our new e-commerce platform later this month for PaperPie. We are thrilled with the opportunity to share with our brand partners and our customers a more intuitive, efficient and visually stunning platform, allowing for a mobile-friendly experience. Our retail sales team continues to focus on opening new accounts and selling to our established customers. As Craig stated earlier, the addition of the SmartLab Toys line has provided some sales momentum for us alongside our Kane Miller and Learning Wrap-Ups line of products. We are continuing to introduce new SmartLab Toys in fiscal 2025, which we expect will continue to have a positive impact on the sales within this division. This concludes our sales and marketing update. I will turn the call back over to Craig for closing remarks. Craig?\nCraig White: Thank you, both Heather and Dan. Now I'd like to talk about some recent changes before opening the call up for questions. During the second quarter, we received $3.8 million in funds from the employee retention credit. These funds were part of the government-sponsored CARES Act offered to employers who maintain employees during COVID. During the third quarter, we listed and sold our old headquarters building, which is primarily used for warehousing for $5.1 million. The funds received from the sale were used to pay down our term loans with our bank. Paying down our existing debts has been the primary focus for excess cash flow as this will reduce our interest expense and improve our overall financial performance. To continue this focus of improving our financial profile, we have recently listed our current headquarters consisting of approximately 402,000 square feet of office and warehouse space for $40 million. The proceeds from this sale are expected to pay all of our line of credit and term loans with our bank. As part of the listing, we have agreed to lease back the property to continue our normal business operations. The terminal leaseback will be contingent on the offers received and are proposing a leaseback period of approximately seven years. We believe selling this building and executing a leaseback is in the best interest of our long-term shareholders and strategic direction. Repaying our bank debts and removing future interest expense is the fastest path to restoring our long history of profitability. We also expect to generate a significant amount of cash from reducing our excess inventory levels. As of November 30th 2023, we have approximately $30 million of excess inventory. Selling this inventory through our existing sales channels will have a significant impact on our overall liquidity and profitability. During the quarter, we also continued our focus on reducing costs. While there is no magic wand to cut our way to profitability, we look for every opportunity and are laser-focused on improving our bottom line results. Once we return to profitability, we plan to reinstate our past practice of paying quarterly dividends to our shareholders. This has been and continues to be a top priority for myself and our shareholders. Now that we have provided a summary of some recent activity, I'll turn the call back over to the operator for question-and-answers. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Paul Carter of Capstone Asset Management. Your line is already open.\nPaul Carter: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. So it looks like your inventory just for the quarter was down about $4 million. So what was your cash flow from operations for the quarter, if you have that?\nDan O'Keefe: Well, the cash flow from operations, I don't have that in front of me. It will be published -- we're publishing the queue later today at 4 O'clock. So the overall profitability for the quarter was driven from the sale of our old headquarters building, which generated a gain of approximately $4 million. So from an operational viewpoint, we were not profitable for the quarter, but at a profitability before tax line, we were profitable.\nPaul Carter: Right, but I'm thinking if your inventory came down $4 million, that would have, there might have been some positive cash flow from operations to offset the operating loss?\nDan O'Keefe: With inventory dropping $4 million in operational losses of $1 million in cash flow from the inventory reduction, we would have generated $3 million, $4 million of cash flow. That was all used to pay down the line of credit. And that, as I mentioned in the call, Paul, we reduced our line of credit with our bank from $13.5 million down to $5 million at the end of November.\nPaul Carter: Okay. Great. And then you've -- you're launching your new e-commerce platform later this month. And I imagine there's other sort of CapEx items. What's kind of the CapEx that you're running at right now? I know it's been pretty low recently, but just thinking about sort of cash flow, what is your kind of ongoing CapEx looking like?\nDan O'Keefe: Our ongoing CapEx is primarily tied to our IT development of our internal systems. Our non-IT CapEx is less than a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year. But our IT CapEx, we spent a significant amount in the last year, but that's been reduced significantly as we're now getting ready to launch our new e-commerce platform. So we, right now, our CapEx -- we don't have a budget for next year, but it will be greatly reduced from or we're expecting it to be greatly reduced from what our CapEx was this year.\nPaul Carter: Okay. Great. And just sort of bigger picture. So your third quarter net revenue was like $17 million. I know third quarter is a good quarter for you typically. So seasonally adjusted, it means that right now, you're running at an annual kind of run rate of somewhere in the neighbourhood of like $40 million of net revenue, give or take. So if you stabilize that net revenue at the $40 million level, you'll be doing something like, I don't know, $27 million, $28 million in gross profits depending on a lot of different factors, of course. But are you confident that you can get to consistent sort of operating profitability at that level? If you like, I guess, just assume no growth, even with the increase in the rent expense that you're going to have to take on going forward once you sell your building?\nCraig White: Yes. We do feel confident that we can -- we've reduced expenses a great deal just in the last eight months. We anticipate that selling the building, the net from our lease payments and our interest expense will still be a positive. So that's the biggest expense. But I will also say in the last six months, we've had to do things kind of in a short-term strategy to generate cash to pay back the bank. Some of those things were not as profitable as our historical levels. So we'll have to evaluate that going forward, whether that will still remain to be necessary or we can kind of get back to normal operations. Now addressing the normalized $40 million. We're not happy with that level of sales, and we're doing everything we can to increase sales. There's only so much we can do to cut costs. Personnel is a big expense, but we're kind of about as low as we're going to be. So there's not much more cutting that we can do. We need to increase sales at this point.\nPaul Carter: Yeah, I guess, that was sort of the gist of my question is, I mean, I know you want to increase sales, but the question is, do you need to? Like if you don't, just because of macro issues or whatever kids are on their computers rather than looking at books or what have you. If that just sort of stabilizes at $40 million, I mean, is EDC able to get to operating profitability?\nCraig White: Yes, we can.\nPaul Carter: Okay. Great. And then I know you mentioned and you've mentioned in the past, reinstating your quarterly dividend is a pretty big priority for you and the Board. So I know even if you get to kind of -- you don't even have to get to like operating profitability or net GAAP profitability. If you're working down your inventory, you're going to be free cash flow positive, would you consider starting up the dividend before you get to operating profitability if you can see sort of profitability on the horizon?\nCraig White: That's a good question. There is some -- there's some hurdles in the way right now. I would say anything is possible, but we would definitely want to be confident that profitability is on the horizon before we reinstate it. So I don't anticipate it this quarter or maybe even next quarter, but it's something we're always looking at.\nPaul Carter: Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just shifting gears a little bit. So I know a couple of months ago, John Clerico resigned from the Board. It looks like it was kind of abruptly after, I think you've been on the board for almost 20 years. Since he was your lead Independent Director and Chairman of all your committees, that's obviously a pretty big deal. Can you -- it's been a couple of months now. Can you discuss the circumstances around that at all?\nCraig White: Yes, sure. He is kind of somewhat personal. He had some health issues back in the summer, and he's 82 years old. He was just looking to spend his time in other ways. There was no disagreement. There was no -- there was no fight in it in the circumstances around why he left. So it was just time for him.\nPaul Carter: Okay. Because it just, I mean the timing of it was right sort of pretty closely aligned to the decision to sell the healthy headquarters. And I was wondering if that had anything to do with it.\nDan O'Keefe: Yeah, no, he had no discrepancies or disagreements with management. That was just a coincidence. He did not disagree with our decision to sell the building.\nPaul Carter: Okay. Great.\nDan O'Keefe: He agreed. It was a unanimous vote on the consent to list the building for sale. So he agreed to that before he resigned from the Board. And I will say further that as Craig mentioned, his age is not necessarily in NASDAQ guidelines for an ideal Board of Director and his replacement in the Audit Committee Chair, Brad Stoots, is a financial expert, has a long history in public accounting and is a partner in public accounting. And so we're very happy with the replacement for the Audit Committee and the addition of the new board member last year.\nPaul Carter: Okay. So I know you're not on side with NASDAQ right now. You need to add another independent director. Where are you in the process of that?\nCraig White: Yeah, good question. We have until our next Annual Shareholders Meeting, which is in July. I've got some candidates that I'm going to start interviewing in the next couple of weeks. Very solid candidates from the MLM industry. So we're very -- feel very positive about our possibilities there.\nPaul Carter: Okay. And then just sort of last question, really big picture. But I mean, obviously, you're a publicly traded company, public company costs are extremely high, I would think, relative to kind of the size of your company. Have you thought of any either sort of no longer being public or doing a going dark transaction to just kind of reduce costs? Because I sort of wonder from an investor point of view like doing a going dark transaction probably wouldn't hurt you at this point and conversely being a large shareholder in the company doing like a take private transaction or something might be palatable. Is that something you guys have considered?\nDan O'Keefe: All right. Not anything that we've discussed with the Board or made any kind of management recommendations in that direction. There's always what the future holds is what the future holds, right? But from a management recommendation or from an outside approach. We've not been approached by anybody nor have we made any recommendations to our Board to go private?\nPaul Carter: Okay. All right. Well, that's it for me. I'll pass the floor over to others. So thank you very much.\nDan O'Keefe: Thank you, Paul.\nCraig White: Thanks, Paul. Good to have you back, by the way. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Philip Smith, Private Investor. Your line is already open.\nPhilip Smith: Thank you. Craig, I just had a quick question regarding the status of the contractually required purchases from Usborne book.\nCraig White: Good question. We have not met the contractual agreement, but they have not -- they have not given us any indication that they're going to take any action. They understand where we are, what the environment holds, many, many, many publishers in this space are kind of facing the same thing. So they're not pressing right now for that. So I don't anticipate that's going to be a concern in the short-term future.\nPhilip Smith: Okay. So Nicola isn't pushing back and making any demand at this point?\nCraig White: Not at this point. She's, yeah, she understands the environment.\nPhilip Smith: Okay. Thank you very much.\nCraig White: Thank you, Phil.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Daniel Balchin, Private Investor. Your line is already open.\nDaniel Balchin: Hi Craig.\nCraig White: Hello.\nDaniel Balchin: Hi. I've just got a short question. Do you have -- does the Board have some sort of valuation in mind for how much the business is worth just in terms of how they look at -- how you guys look at it, how you value the company, how you value the different parts of it, like SmartLab Toys, Learning Wrap-Ups, that sort of stuff. Do you have like a sort of figure that the Board thinks is a fair value for the company at the moment?\nDan O'Keefe: Well, there's lots of ways to look at that. Certainly, the management team doesn't feel that the trading value is reflective of what our real value is. We have a book value of $5 a share. So I mean -- and we have no goodwill on our books. And so I think that we're trying to get back to that level first. I mean the book value is all in inventory and buildings. And the buildings are -- the carrying value of the buildings don't reflect the actual value because we're carrying the building less than $20 million, and we're looking at selling it for $40 million.\nDaniel Balchin: Yes. And is the -- is there sort of like a net present value that you've got on that inventory? Because obviously there's $57.9 million on the books. But after all of those sort of costs and everything, do you have like a sort of net present value of what that inventory is sort of worth in today's money?\nDan O'Keefe: Well, we believe it's worth the carrying value for sure because otherwise, we'd have to write it down. So I mean our carrying value of our books are typically about 25% of the retail value that we sell them for.\nDaniel Balchin: Right.\nDan O'Keefe: So we believe the inventory is definitely worth the carrying value of $57 million.\nDaniel Balchin: Yes. And in terms of just sort of like the Learning Wrap-Ups business, SmartLab Toys, what's the sort of growth trajectory within that? Could that sort of be a separate business to the selling of the Usborne books, that sort of thing?\nDan O'Keefe: Can you repeat that question one more time?\nDaniel Balchin: The question is on weather Learning Wrap-Ups and SmartLab Toys is something that investors should treat separately to the other part of the business in selling Usborne products?\nDan O'Keefe: No, it's just another product line or another couple of product lines that we sell. I mean the cost of goods between Usborne and some of our other books versus Learning Wrap-Ups and SmartLab is different. But they're not significantly different. SmartLab, we kind of focused a few times in this presentation just because it's new. We're very excited. Sales are going very well. We have a great release plan over the next 18 months. So we're excited about that. But they shouldn't be treated differently than anything else we sell.\nDaniel Balchin: Okay. Thank you. That's all from me.\nDan O'Keefe: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I would hand over the call to Craig White. Please proceed.\nCraig White: Thank you. So a little bit of late breaking news, no one asked me about them, a little bit surprised. While we don't have final confirmation from NASDAQ itself, today does mark the 10th day above a $1 threshold and thus we expect to regain compliance. So we don't anticipate that, that's something that we will have to worry about again in the near future. So that's a good piece of news there. Anyway, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your continued support. We look forward to providing an additional update in January of 2024. Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."

At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, October 12, 2023.  Before beginning the call, we would like to remind you that some of the statements made today will be forward-looking and are protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied due to a variety of factors. We refer use Educational Development Corporation's recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the company's financial condition. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steven Hooser, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSteven Hooser: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for Educational Development Corporation's second quarter earnings call.  On the call with me today are Craig White, President and Chief Executive Officer; Heather Cobb, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer; and Dan O'Keefe, Chief Financial Officer.  After the market close this afternoon, the company issued a press release announcing its results for the fiscal second quarter. The release is available on the company's website at www.edcpub.com. As the operator mentioned, today, we will make forward-looking statements and offer that you should look at the company's SEC filings for more details on those forward-looking statements. With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Craig White, the company's President and Chief Executive Officer. Craig?\nCraig White : Thank you, Steven, and welcome everyone to the call. I will start today's call with some general comments regarding the quarter, then I will pass the call over to Dan and Heather to run through the financials and provide an update on sales and marketing. Finally, I will wrap up the call with some comments on strategy and fiscal 2024 outlook.  During the second quarter, our sales continued to be impacted by high inflation, which directly impacts our active brand partners. As I have said before, this is our key indicator that reflects current sales levels and where we expect them to trend in the future. I am delighted to see that, as expected, our brand partner levels stabilized during the second quarter.  The ripple effect of the rebrand process that we rolled out in January of this year has diminished, and every active brand partners through the end of August has either joined as a PaperPie brand partner or made a sale this calendar year as a PaperPie brand partner. We expect this summer to be an inflection point for our brand partner head count as we have already seen an increase in brand partner count starting in August.  The sales in our Publishing division were also lower this quarter due to the stoppage of selling Usborne products. Under our previously announced updated distribution agreement with this vendor, sales to retail customers are being supplied by another distributor. The decrease in Usborne sales was partially offset by strong orders of our Kane Miller books and from our Learning Wrap-Ups and Smart Lab Toys product lines. We are excited about the continued growth opportunities of these product lines with our existing and new retail customers.  We have also made several changes recently in the PaperPie division that Heather will talk further about later in the call, to not only make our brand partners more successful, but also entice new brand partners to join PaperPie. Brand partner success generates additional brand partners, and that continues to be our number one focus. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dan O'Keefe to provide a brief overview of the financials.\nDan O’Keefe : Thank you, Craig. Our fiscal second quarter results compared to the second quarter of last year. Net revenues of $10.6 million, a decrease of $8.8 million or 45% compared to $19.4 million. Average active PaperPie brand partners for the quarter totaled 18,100 compared to 26,800 in the second quarter last year, a decrease of 8,700, or 33%.  Earnings before income taxes totaled $1.5 million, an increase of $2.6 million compared to a pretax loss of $600,000 in the second quarter last year. After tax income totaled $1.1 million compared to an after tax loss of $800,000 in the second quarter last year. Income per share for the quarter was $0.13 compared to a loss per share of $0.10 on a fully diluted basis. To update everyone on our inventory and working capital levels, net inventories decreased $5.7 million from $67.6 million at August 31, 2022, compared to $61.9 million on August 31, 2023. Now for our working capital update. Our borrowings on our working capital line of credit totaled $9.7 million at the end of August. During the quarter, the company extended the working capital line of credit agreement and amended the company's credit agreement with our banks. Under the terms of the new agreement, the fixed charge covenant ratio was removed, along with the debt acceleration with default resulting in the company re-classing our existing mortgage secured term loans back to long-term debt. Under the terms of the new agreement, the line of credit includes monthly step-downs from $10.5 million at August 31, 2023, to $4 million at maturity on January 31, 2024. Also during August, our credit card processor that processes our payments from our customers began to hold a cash reserve. The reserve held at the end of August was $1 million and is listed as restricted cash on our balance sheet. The cash reserve was increased to $1.5 million in September and is scheduled to increase again to approximately $2 million in October. That concludes the financial update, and I'll now turn the call over to Heather Cobb, to talk about sales and marketing opportunities in further detail. Heather?\nHeather Cobb : Thank you, Dan. As Craig mentioned earlier, we continue to make changes to bring new success to our brand partners. As an example, during June and July, we offered bonus sales commission opportunities to our brand partners to help them spur sales. In August, we implemented a 30-day site-wide sale on our e-commerce site with products being offered at 10%, up to 30% off for their customers.  The promotions that we have offered are receiving positive feedback and were greatly appreciated during the summer months, which are typically our softest selling months of the year. We continue to make strategic changes to adapt to this challenging period when families have limited disposable income by offering different types of promotions.  Starting in September, we began offering $5 flat rate shipping on our e-commerce orders with free shipping taking effect at $30 orders. This change in shipping charges has been well received from our customers and brand partners alike. An unexpected positive impact from this change was that our average order size of approximately $70 has remained unchanged.  We have additional promotions and incentives to roll out in the coming months to assist brand partners as they build their business, especially during this fall selling season, which is typically our largest selling period of the year. Our retail sales team continues to focus on opening new accounts and selling to our established customers. As Craig stated earlier, the addition of the Smart Lab toys line has provided some sales momentum for us alongside our Kane Miller and Learning Wrap-Ups lines of products. While we have not previously had the opportunity to sell into foreign countries, we are doing so with both the Learning Wrap-Ups and Smart Lab Toy product lines opening new doors to new customers. This concludes our sales and marketing update. I will turn the call back over to Craig for closing remarks. Craig?\nCraig White : Thank you both Heather and Dan. Now I would like to talk about some recent changes before opening the call up for questions. During the quarter, we received $3.8 million in funds from the Employee Retention Credit. These funds were part of the government-sponsored CARES Act offered to employers who maintained employees during COVID. While this cash infusion was very timely and positively impacted our quarter, the funds have been primarily absorbed with paydowns in our line of credit with our bank and cash reserves held by our credit card processor.  Our primary focus continues to be paying down our debts and reducing our interest expense, which will improve our overall financial performance. To this end, we have recently listed and contracted for sale our old building for $5.1 million, which is primarily used for excess inventory storage. The proceeds from this sale will be used to pay down our term loans with our bank. We have agreed to lease back the building for three years, after which we plan to consolidate our reduced inventory levels into our headquarters, further improving profitability.  We are also continuing to turn inventory into cash, which will be most evidenced in this third quarter, our strongest selling quarter of the year. Cash generated from the reduction in inventory will be used to meet the required step downs in our line of credit. I have had questions recently and some of you on the call may have this question as to why don't we sell the [indiscernible] building, our current headquarters. That is absolutely an option. We're evaluating what that would look like, but we're evaluating other short-term solutions in the meantime.  During the quarter, we reduced costs from lower employee levels and other operating cost reductions, and we continue to look for every opportunity to improve bottom line performance. We will continue on this path until we reach profitability. Once we return to profitability, we plan to reinstate our past practice of paying quarterly dividends to our shareholders. This has been and continues to be a top priority for myself and our shareholders. Now that we have provided a summary of some recent activity, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions and answers.\nOperator: Thank you, Craig. Ladies and gentlemen, our Q&A session is now open. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Edward Norcini [ph]. Your line is open. Edward Norcini, your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. This question is for Dan. How are you? Last time we spoke, the company had a conflict with Usborne about the discount of $1 million because you didn't send them, I believe, a letter of credit. Has that discount conflict been resolved, or can you update me on that?\nDan O’Keefe : Sure. It's unresolved. Usborne at the end of last year, at the end of December, beginning of January, Usborne disputed the rebate because we didn't give them the letter of credit. So at that point, we reversed all of the accrual on the financial of that rebate. And so we took it off our financial statements. But we're still in a position where we're hoping for the best. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Secondly, Craig, today, your stock closed at $1.03. I read somewhere that NASDAQ if their stock falls below $1 for 28 days, the stock, your company's stock will be delisted. Can you give me any assurance that won't happen?\nCraig White : Can I? \nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah.\nCraig White : All I can assure you is that we're exhausting all options to increase sales, reduce debt and try to return back to profitability. What happens with the stock price is more or less up to you all.\nDan O’Keefe : Yeah. Ed, I'll also say that when that does happen to companies and their stock does go below the minimum limit for the -- they typically will do a reverse stock split to bring it back above. So if that were to happen for an extended period of time we wouldn't go off of NASDAQ. We would most probably do a shareholder action to reverse the stock split and do reverse stock split and reduce number of shares and increase the value, and continue trading on NASDAQ.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's something in your planning book?\nDan O’Keefe : In the company -- a reverse stock. What companies do to maintain their listings on NASDAQ or New York Stock Exchange if their share price goes below the minimum business level?\nUnidentified Analyst: I see. Okay. Well, that's a fear of any investor if you'd be delisted from the NASDAQ, then you're not allowed -- we won't be allowed to trade or buy or sell your company. Okay. That's it for me. Good luck, what you're -- and also that that money you got from the government. I read somewhere that they are auditing employment retention credits. Is that money free and clear? Or is that up in the air?\nDan O’Keefe : We'll still be audited, but we received the money and deposited in that. Fortunately, the government's checks cleared the bank. So I think we've got it now. \nUnidentified Analyst: That's great. Okay, that's it for me. Thanks. \nDan O’Keefe : Thank you, Edward. \nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Richard Denis [ph], Private Investor. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah. Good afternoon, everybody. A couple of quick questions for you. The sale leaseback of the warehouse facility, is that still scheduled to close in October?\nCraig White : Yes, that's the plan. We have a few minor issues that we need to resolve, but there's -- I don't anticipate that would cause us to delay closing. \nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. And the brand partner levels that started to climb in August, have those trends continued in September and October?\nDan O’Keefe : Well, it's not something we report. So August is a period that we're reporting. So we saw them stabilize over the summer, as Craig mentioned, and we saw a little uptick in August. So that's what we communicate through our earnings calls.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. But you can't discuss anything that's happened since?\nDan O’Keefe : We typically don't get into monthly reporting of our active brand partner count, no. We're satisfied with the way it's trending.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, very good. That’s all I've got. Thank you. \nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Randy Freed from R L Capital, LLC. Your line is open.\nRandy Freed: Hello, can you hear me?\nDan O’Keefe : Yes. Yes, Randy.\nRandy Freed: Hi. I got two questions. The first one is for Dan. And I am somewhat familiar with the employee retention credit because I'm a CPA also. So I want to expand a little bit on that other gentleman's question. My question to you is, that was part of The CARES Act. We know a lot of people have been applying for that. My question for you is how confident -- I'm not sure who you consulted with and thereby got that $3.8 million credit. But how confident are you that you met all the criteria and that if you do, in fact, get audited that they're not going to be able to claw that back? Are you super confident that you actually qualified for it? Or are you like hoping you don't get audited? That's my first question Thank you.\nDan O’Keefe : Well, nobody -- and I'll concur with you. I don't think we want to be audited there. Nobody wants to be audited. But we did use a nationally Tier 1 consulting firm to help us with our application process and documentation process. They've processed -- I believe they're -- one of their advertisements is they are the largest processor of not only employment retention credits, but also other credits. We use the same firm to do our research and development tax credit that we file for annually as well. But they are a very large nationally recognized firm that does this.\nRandy Freed: Okay. Thank you for that. My next question is for all three of you, but any of you can answer. There's a little website I check that shows about open market purchases or sales of company shares by the officers. And I haven't seen anything really on there for any of you three. Have any of you three bought any shares in the open market recently. I'm not talking about the shares you get through that plan, which is a little confusing. I'm not sure if they're sort of free, maybe they are free. But just in the open market if any of these three buy any shares and do you have any plans to do so?\nDan O’Keefe : Yeah. So we filed Form 4s, I believe, last week, identifying the shares that we've acquired in the last quarter. We buy these shares with payroll withholdings. So they're bought in the open market with our personal dollars. \nRandy Freed: Okay. So you're all three are you're doing that buying a few shares through payroll withholdings. I haven't looked at that site for a couple of weeks, but is that where those few shares come from that are sort of showing up every once in a while on that site, all three through payroll withholding?\nDan O’Keefe : Yes. And it's through our 401(k) plan. We have our stock as an investment option in our 401(k) plan. And so when we have payroll, we have our payroll withholdings that go into our 401(k) plan and our company stock is an investment option. And then our 401(k) firm goes out to the market every payroll period and buys those shares for us. \nRandy Freed: It's in your 401(k) plans. It's not in your like personal account, you're not using some of your own money that's not going into the 401(k) plan for open market purchases right now?\nDan O’Keefe : Yeah. Let me be real clear, Randy. We are taking our payroll dollars that were -- payroll that we get paid with instead of taking that cash and putting it in our bank account, we're taking that cash and investing it in company stock. So we are buying shares. Yes, we are buying shares with our personal cash.\nRandy Freed: Got you. Okay. Thank you very much. \nDan O’Keefe : Thank you. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to Craig White for closing remarks.\nCraig White : Thanks, everyone for joining us on our call today. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to providing an additional update in January of 2024. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Educational Development Corporation's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. At this time, all lines are in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded on Thursday, the 13th of July, 2023. Before beginning the call, we would like to remind you that some of the statements made today will be forward-looking and are protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied due to variety of factors. We refer you to the Educational Development Corporation's recent filings with the SEC for a more detailed discussion of the company's financial condition. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jean Marie Young from Three Part Advisors. Please go ahead.\nJean Marie Young: Thank you, JP. And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for Educational Development Corporation's fiscal first quarter earnings call. On the call with us today are Craig White, President and Chief Executive Officer; Heather Cobb, Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, and Dan O'Keefe, Chief Financial Officer. After the market closed this afternoon, the company issued a press release announcing its results for the fiscal first quarter. The release is available on the company's website at www.edcpub.com. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Craig White, the company's President and CEO. Craig?\nCraig White: Thank you, Jean, and welcome everyone to the call. I will start today's call with some general comments in regards to quarter, then I will pass the call off to Dan and Heather to run through the financials and provide an update on our sales and marketing. Finally, I will wrap up the call with some comments on strategy and fiscal 2024 outlook. During the first quarter, our sales continued to be impacted by high inflation, which we will likely face for the remainder of the year. As we have said on previous calls, our sales results are primarily driven by our active brand partners. This is our key indicator that reflects current sales levels and where we expect them to trend in the future. Our brand partner levels decreased again this quarter. We believe this is for a variety of reasons like we mentioned, economy, rebrand, et cetera. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter earnings call, some of this was carryover from rebranding, which takes some time to work through our entire network of sales partners. We are still making additional changes to improve our sales to not only make our brand partners more successful, but also entice new brand partners to join PaperPie. I will let Heather talk further about that later in the call. On a more positive note, our brand partners at leadership levels remain higher than pre-pandemic numbers and they are primary drivers for new recruiting and overall sales growth. Brand partners success generates additional branding partners and that continues to be our number one focus. We will be looking at numbers of our active brand partner count from this summer as an indicator for the future. This is due to the fact that by the end of the summer, based on our definition of active, which hasn't changed, that each of our brand partners will either have joined under the new PaperPie brand and/or made a sale under this new brand. As you will hear Heather discuss a bit more, our marketing, promotions and programs are focused on building this number back up to higher levels. Another positive from the first quarter was the continued results from our SmartLab Toys product line. We introduced 13 new SmartLab Toys to our publishing and PaperPie customers, and our sales have exceeded expectations. Not only have we received great reception from our retail customers but we have also picked up some nice international orders as well. Our PaperPie division continues to drive the total sales for our company and the sales of SmartLab Toys from this division are exceeding our original expectations. During the quarter, our gross sales of SmartLab Toys products exceeded $1.4 million. We introduced 10 new products in June and have another 15 or so over the next 12 months. Some of these, our customers have never seen before. So we’ve started new development since we've owned them. With that, I will now turn the call over to Dan to provide a brief overview of the financials. Dan?\nDan O'Keefe: Thank you, Craig. To our fiscal first quarter results compared to the first quarter last year, net revenues of $14.5 million, a decrease of $8.7 million or 37.5% compared to $23.2 million. Our average active PaperPie brand partners for the first quarter totaled 23,200 compared to 32,200 in the first quarter last year, a decrease of 9,000 or 28%. Loss before income taxes totaled $1.2 million, a decrease of $1.5 million compared to an income of $0.3 million in the first quarter last year. After-tax loss totaled $900,000 compared to $200,000, a decrease of $1.1 million. Loss per share for the quarter was $0.11 compared to income of $0.03 per share on a fully diluted basis. To update everyone on our inventory and working capital levels, inventories decreased $8.3 million from $70.6 million at 05/31/2022 compared to $62.3 million at 05/31/2023. Our working capital line of credit was $11 million at the end of May 2023. That concludes the financial update and I'll turn the call over to Heather Cobb to talk about sales and marketing opportunities in further detail. Heather?\nHeather Cobb: Thank you, Dan. As Craig mentioned earlier, we have made some recent changes to bring success to our brand partners this summer. We know that success begets success and this is true with our brand partners as well. Success with our current brand partners leads to better recruiting, which leads to more sales. The most impactful change that we have made is to reduce the freight change on outbound shipping to our customers, thus reducing hurdles that prevent them from shopping with our brand partners. Prior to this change, we saw a reduction in the number of smaller orders overall and we believe that this is a direct reflection of the impact of inflation on the economy. By reducing our freight charge to a simple flat rate structure, we expect to entice these customers to complete a purchase with a smaller order as opposed to abandoning their cart and not buying anything from their brand partner. We also expect for our number of higher dollar orders to stay approximately the same. An additional benefit from these smaller orders is that they introduce more new customers to our products. Having more customers introduced to these products gives our brand partners more opportunities to find their next party host, and possibly even recruit their next brand partner. We've heard stories from all levels of our brand partners that they join for the books, but then they turn their discount into a successful business. Because we want our brand partners to be even more successful with their business this summer, we've offered them additional cash bonuses on their sales. This is due to the fact that we have seen a direct correlation between our brand partners who sell during the summer months and then continuing to sell and have success during the fall, which is always our busiest season of the year. We have also added other promotions and specials this summer to give our brand partners reason to contact their existing and potential new customers with these new and exciting offers. The summer is normally our slowest time of the year. So we are giving our brand partners lots of reasons to stay engaged and build their businesses. This concludes our sales and marketing update for today. I'm turning the call back over to Craig now for closing remarks. Craig?\nCraig White: Thank you, both, Heather and Dan. As I have said before, EDC has decades long history of profitability. Naturally, it's easier to grow profitability when revenues are increasing and steadily outpacing expenses. However, we are in a period where we have seen our revenues decline and thus we are having to manage our costs. We are continuing to make operating adjustments each month to reduce our costs. The single most significant cost reduction this year will come from normalizing our inflated inventory levels. As we reduce inventory, it turns into free cash flow, which will be used to pay down debt, which will reduce the interest expense that hits our P&L. This will be one of the most significant improvements to profitability in fiscal 2024. To normalize inventory levels, we're executing a two-pronged approach. First and foremost, as Heather mentioned earlier, we are taking significant steps to energize our sales force. We expect to introduce new incentives and promotions, not only this summer, but throughout the rest of the year. Additionally, we will maintain a strict discipline in our purchasing. Over the past 12 months, we have made significant efforts to reduce the quantities of titles we are printing and put increased focus on ordering more frequently. We expect this two-pronged approach will normalize our inventory faster. As an example, we have purchased roughly half of what we did last year and about a quarter of what we did pre-pandemic levels. We have also reduced payroll and other operating costs and looked for every opportunity to improve our bottom-line performance. We will continue on this path until we reach profitability. Once we return to profitability and pay down debt levels, we plan to reinstate our past practice of paying quarterly dividends to our shareholders. This has been, and continues to be a top priority for myself and our shareholders. I'd like to take this opportunity also to mention, we've just come off a couple of our largest opportunities to energize our sales force and make our PaperPie division as attractive as possible. In June, we had our convention where we had a good average number of attendees. But what we kind of heard is that a lot of them were coming to just kind of see what the brand -- the rebrand was all about. And to a person, every single person left much more positive than they’d come into it. They were very impressed with what our sales and marketing teams have done with the brand. And we really, really focused on our mission, which is children's literacy and learning. So those things at convention was a very positive impact. And right now, I happen to be -- Heather and I happen to be on our sales incentive trip. So we came from Rome last week where we had roughly -- that was -- that's the highest level trip, had roughly 40 people ,that with family members and such, we brought about 125 people. And now we're in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, where we have roughly 400 people and that's not all earners, but that's including family members. So that's the biggest recruiting factor for -- one of the biggest recruiting factors for PaperPie is to see the amazing trips we take people to earn on. So anyway, we're very encouraged coming out of convention and out of these trips and we're looking forward to the fall. Now that we have provided a summary of some recent activity, I will now turn the call back over to the operator for question and answer.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of [Ed Norsini] (ph), Private Investor. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Craig, I haven't talked to you in a while. I'm on the call and I was looking at the 10-K. And that was published in February of this year, February 28. Your inventory at net level was $59 million. Today, it's $62 million. So it went up $3 million from the last quarter. It seems to me that inventory is going in the wrong direction. Do you have any plans?\nDan O’Keefe: This is Dan. Just to clarify, because I think you've got some numbers that are different. If you look at our press release, our inventory at the end of February of this year was -- if you add both the current and the long term inventory together, was $63,800,000. And at the end of May, it's [$62,300] (ph). So we dropped about $1.5 million this quarter. And just -- I just want to clarify that before the -- we actually have dropped inventory $1.5 million.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Well, Dan, my point is, and Craig also, also in that 10-K that you released, you're having problems with the bank. They need their money. Is there any plans -- do you have any plans to sell any of your assets in bulk? Like for example, sell on the Hilti complex or sell Kane Miller or maybe sell $30 million worth of this inventory back to Usborne or another distributor. Do you have any plans to get some massive amount of cash in to pay off these debts? I'm worried about it.\nCraig White: Yeah. Well, you kind of hit a bunch of points there. I was trying to keep track, so I could respond. But first of all, yeah, inventory levels, we -- I've said all along that we will continue to order new titles. We have to do that. But what we said earlier in the call was that we were reducing the quantities and potentially the number of new titles that we're ordering. So we're being very aggressive on reducing our purchases, very aggressive. Historically, aggressively low. So as we sell inventory, it’ll turn into cash and we'll pay the bank back. Another point you made is that we owe the bank a lot of money. Yes, we do. We have renewal coming up next month and there's no indication whatsoever that we will not be able to renew successfully with them. And that's for our working capital line. And another point you made is, do we have any plans to sell our assets? I -- we have engaged with a firm to look into the market for a building of our size and the market is very good. We could turn the building around and sell it within 60 to 90 days. So we know that's available to us. I want to keep that in my back pocket as a last resort. We have plans for this property once we get sales back up. So I don't want to get rid of that property just yet. Now, if we need to, we can. So again, I just want to reiterate that we have a good relationship with the bank and there's -- I've had no indication that we're not going to be able to renew the line of credit. As far as the building debt, Hilti pays their part. We pay a smaller portion of it. We've never defaulted on any payments. So again, they're not concerned about the building debt. They just want us to work down the working capital line, which we're doing by selling inventory.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That's helpful, Craig. My other main concern for right now in my mind, you have no concrete plans to sell $30 million, $40 million worth of that inventory back to Usborne or another distributor, because I've been look -- I'm looking, Craig, at your 2017 fiscal ending where you had approximately 25,000 consultants, which is probably what you have today, but you had $34,000 -- excuse me, $34 million in inventory. So it seems like to me, you're like close to $30 million over what you need, based on…\nDan O’Keefe: That's correct.\nUnidentified Analyst: …2017. Okay? So…\nDan O’Keefe: That's correct.\nUnidentified Analyst: …wouldn't it be -- wouldn't it be helpful if just had a mass sale? Just because it seems like the consultants aren't producing enough sales to reduce this inventory to normal levels.\nCraig White: Yeah, that's a good point. We are looking at options to do some mass inventory reductions. But whatever we do, we don't want to damage our brand partners' ability to continue to sell inventory. As far as selling it back to Usborne or other distributors, that's not an option. They have no incentive to buy back inventory from us. So again, we're looking at some major foundations. We're looking at some other inventory reduction sales and things like that. So…\nHeather Cobb: I'll also just add, Ed, that one of the things that we know that you look to us to do for the company is to manage not only the short-term challenges as well as successes but with long term things in mind. And so I'll just kind of reiterate what Craig said. We're looking at what all of our options are now. But one of the last things that we want to do is some sort of short-term strategy that will end up in some sort of damaging long-term effect that none of us want to see. So while, yes, we are looking at various different creative and alternative ways to reduce this inventory, we definitely want to do it in a way that will allow us to continue the business as we've done with PaperPie as well as with our retail division for the long term.\nDan O’Keefe: And, Ed, you've -- this is Dan. I'll kind of add another thought as well. You mentioned the 2017 period. If you recall during that time, we were also over-inventoried. And the over inventory issue is we have excess quantities of our best-selling items. Those are the titles that we ordered the most quantity of, the titles that are our best sellers. And so in 2017, we did, it’s just we worked through it. And through 2017 to 2018, we reduced our inventory from the high 40s down to about $30 million, [reducing by about $18 million] (ph). And so that's kind of the approach we're taking right now too. We're a little bit more aggressive on the purchasing than we were back in 2017 as Craig has explained earlier. But the excess inventory is working down and it's in our best-selling items.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, that's understood. My other question, if you don't mind, is about your relationship with Usborne. I read in the 10-K that you are in violation of the new distribution requirement. Is that correct? You're not buying enough minimum amounts from Usborne. So you're in violation, and they -- according to the 10-K, they can cut you off at any minute because you're violating the contract. What do you say to that? What kind of assurances can you say? Because they're -- you've been dealing with these people for decades. And also, they said that they're not -- they owe you $1 million from last year, and they're not paying. To me, it's like, whoa, you've been dealing with these people for decades, and they -- they're fighting you about $1 million discount rebate. To me, it's like, woah, this is not right. So what do you say to that?\nCraig White: Yeah, we have been dealing with Usborne for decades. I've just taken over and been dealing with them myself for the last two years. And recently, Nicola's father, Peter Usborne, the founder of the company passed away. So I'm dealing exclusively with Nicola at this point. There's no incentive for them to cancel the distribution agreement. That's not to say they won't, but they know that we just got to get this inventory situation back to a normal level and then we will get back to purchasing inventory at historic levels. So they have no options to replace us. They're on the PaperPie side. They're replacing us as a distributor for our retail division, but that's going to be taking years and years for them to ramp up the inventory that's necessary to service the retail division. So I really don't feel like it's in their best interest. Again, we're preparing ourselves. We are trying to protect ourselves. Whatever kind of cancellation of the distribution agreement, gives us a sell-off period. So we're just trying to get stronger financially by selling down inventory and that gives us a little bit more leverage with Usborne. So that's the approach we're taking.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Well my other question. Dan, what's the status of the employer retention credit?\nDan O’Keefe: Well, we filed for it.\nUnidentified Analyst: I know.\nDan O’Keefe: So we're waiting on the IRS to take action.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. So nothing concrete there.\nDan O’Keefe: No. It's -- go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. I just -- just wondering -- there's nothing -- there's no definitive answer from the IRS on that.\nCraig White: Not yet.\nDan O’Keefe: We meet the requirements, so I would expect that we would get it at some level, which, man, if we can get some cash from that would be outstanding. It's not necessary or required for us to continue on, but it sure will be great.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Well -- and Craig, I've been wanting to ask you this question. We're going to have to go back through the time machine. Christmas of 2016. Do you remember when you guys just moved into the Hilti Complex and you bought a software package.\nCraig White: I do.\nUnidentified Analyst: You bought a software package from a company in Florida and broke down. Actually, it was a classic nightmare. Okay? Your father and you had the grandkids up there trying to get all the packages out, customer service was going crazy. Anyway, you paid about $1 million for the software package as I recall. Did you ever get your money back for that software package?\nCraig White: No.\nUnidentified Analyst: You remember that?\nCraig White: Of course. I've been with the company for 30 years. I remember that. Of course, I do. Both sides were working in good faith and we had just determined that it was not in our best interest to continue with them. So we severed the tie and we moved on. We developed all the software programs we needed in-house. And so that's a distant memory.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Well, it almost bankrupt your company at the time if I recall. Because you were also in violation with the covenants with the bank. I think it was Midwest Bank at the time. So anyway, I kind of -- right now, I think you guys are in a pickle, and we have to get this inventory or have some cash up to get the bank because you're working on a waiver right now. It seems like from the 10-K and how generous are they going to be with the waiver? I mean, they could shut you off all this life, I think. And you might be out of business as a going concern. So, good luck.\nCraig White: No. That's highly unlikely. All right. Thank you, Ed. Appreciate it.\nUnidentified Analyst: All right. Thank you.\nDan O’Keefe: Thanks, Ed.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Frank Goodell from Gene Goodell Associates. Your line is now open.\nFrank Goodell: Yes. Am I on?\nCraig White: Yes, we can hear you.\nFrank Goodell: Yes, I had a couple of comments off of what Ed had said. I noticed the sales volumes are down quite a bit. Everything has healed, of course. I've been in business myself many years. Everything gets healed if you can increase sales. What's the outlook for the next year or so, realistically?\nDan O’Keefe: Well, we don't -- and this is Dan. Frank, we don't give guidance as far as revenue. Just to put that out there before I turn the call back over to Craig. As a small reporting company, we just -- it's -- as it's been our past practice to just be conservative and not put our guidance. Craig, I'll let you take over from there.\nCraig White: Yes, that's good. Thank you. Well, things are looking up. We're doing all kinds of things to help increase sales, retain brand partners. And it takes a little time for those things to come to fruition. The sentiment right now is more positive than it has been. We're going to be releasing some of our software projects in the next couple of months, which will be a positive impact. Our products get better and better. When we keep our brand partners, and salespeople, and customers focused on our mission of children’s literacy and learning, things always go better. So we're doing all the right things. It's just taking a little longer than we'd hoped, but we will survive this tough period and increase sales.\nFrank Goodell: Second question I had, what are the insiders within EDUC doing as far as stock retention?\nDan O’Keefe: You -- Craig, you want me to take this?\nCraig White: All three of us were buying.\nHeather Cobb: Yes. Go ahead, Dan.\nDan O’Keefe: I was going to say -- so the insiders being the -- obviously the White family, the Board and nobody has really been selling any shares. And then of course, as Craig mentioned, Heather, Craig and I continue to buy shares every quarter. And we've recently filed some Form 4s that reflect our activity for the first quarter.\nFrank Goodell: Okay. To that point. One way you obviously improve cash flow is to pay in shares rather than salaries. Obviously, people have to make a certain amount of money to maintain a standard of living. Companies I worked for in the past often did that, called them golden handcuffs, whatever, but they paid with shares when times were hard to reduce losses, I guess, you could say by having high salaries.\nDan O’Keefe: Well, and I don't know how long ago you're mentioning, but Frank, the key thing that -- I mean, it's a great idea. It's something that Craig and I've talked about in the past. But I just want to -- before Craig -- turn the call over to Craig, I just want to make sure you're aware that it's not legal underneath the SEC rules for us to issue shares to management unless we've gotten shareholder approvals to do so. So we will -- to do that, we will have to file -- we would have to file a registration statement registering the shares and have a shareholder vote. So just on -- just giving you current SEC guidance. Craig, I'll let you discuss the thoughts on that.\nCraig White: Yeah, the only thing I also was going to add is that we do have short-term and long-term incentives. The long-term incentives are shares. Now, those were earned and the first tranche was awarded this past March after a five-year vesting period. But we have other chunks of stock that our top 15 to 20 management have earned over the past several years. They're still being vested in things like that. So we do have long-term incentive plans in place. We have small cash bonuses with short-term. They've been bigger in the past. We're doing very nominal short-term cash incentives. But yeah, I like the thinking, but we're doing some of that.\nFrank Goodell: Part of where I'm going is you're highly incentivized to turn this company around rather than bailing when it gets tough and you are in a tough situation right now. So, as a stockholder, I have a lot of patience if I have hope. But if you lose hope, then your patience goes away. So…\nCraig White: Sure.\nFrank Goodell: …it's just a -- it's been tough time for EDUC and my own stock account that I have with it. Luckily, I have a lot of other assets that, it’s just a very worrisome thing when you see a company stock go down as heavily as EDUC has done in the last three years. I'm sure I'm not telling you that to giggle.\nCraig White: Right. I'm probably in the top 10 largest shareholders including institutional. So I get what you're saying. I've been through a lot of the good times, some of the bad times. And yeah, ever since I took over, it's been a little bit of a tough stretch with the pandemic and then economy and things like that, but I'm here for the long haul. I've got to look at this as a long-term turnaround and we're here for it.\nFrank Goodell: All right. That's all the comments I have. Thank you.\nCraig White: Thank you, Frank.\nDan O’Keefe: Thanks, Frank.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now hand over to Craig. Please continue.\nCraig White: Thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. We appreciate your continued support and look forward to providing an additional update when we report quarter two in October. We know it's been a tough time. We're doing everything we can to get this turned around. Things -- we're seeing positive indicators. So hang in there. Have a great day. Thank you.\nDan O'Keefe: Thank you everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
