        "content": "Operator: Good day everyone, and welcome to the American Woodmark Corporation Third Fiscal Quarter 2024 Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded February 29, 2024. During this call, the Company may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures included in our earnings release, such as adjusted net income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, net leverage, and adjusted EPS per diluted share. The earnings release, which can be found on our website, americanwoodmark.com, includes definitions of each of these non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's rationale for their usage, and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures. We also use our website to publish other information that may be important to investors, such as investor presentations. We'll begin the call by reading the Company's Safe Harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All forward-looking statements made by the Company involve material risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on factors that may be beyond the Company's control. Accordingly, the Company's future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, those described in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the annual report to shareholders. Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements, even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized. I would now like to turn the floor over to Paul Joachimczyk, Senior Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Good afternoon and welcome to American Woodmark's third fiscal quarter conference call. Thank you for taking the time today to participate. Joining me is Scott Culbreth, President and CEO. Scott will begin with a review of the quarter and I'll add additional details regarding our financial performance. After our comments, we'll be happy to answer your questions.\nScott Culbreth: Thank you, Paul, and thanks to everyone for joining us today for our third fiscal quarter earnings call. Our teams delivered net sales of $422.1 million, representing a decline of 12.2% versus the prior year. Within New Construction, our net sales declined 11% versus the prior year. Recent data points such as housing starts and NAHB's measure of builder sentiment point to improving demand as we head into the spring. We remain strategically aligned with 19 of the top 20 national builders and key regional builders. With our best-in-class direct service model, we plan to continue to grow our share with new and existing customers and benefit from the share gains our partners are realizing in the marketplace. Looking at Remodel, which includes our Home Center and Independent Dealer and Distributor businesses, revenue declined 13.1% versus the prior year. Within this, our Home Center business was down 14.1% versus the prior year. Demand trends remain under pressure due to lower in-store traffic rates and consumers choosing smaller-sized projects. With regards to our Dealer and Distributor business, we were down 10.3% versus the prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA decreased 0.7% to $50.6 million, but our adjusted EBITDA margin percentage increased 140 basis points to 12% for the quarter. Reported EPS was $1.32 and adjusted EPS was $1.66. The improvement in performance is due to product mix and improved efficiencies in the manufacturing platforms. Our team continues to drive operational excellence in our plans. Our cash balance was $97.8 million at the end of the third fiscal quarter and the company has access to an additional $322.9 million under its revolving credit facility. Leverage was reduced to 1.5 times adjusted EBITDA and the company repurchased 216,000 shares in the quarter. Our net sales outlook for fiscal year '24 remains unchanged with our expectation of a low double-digit decline with fiscal Q4 sales down high single-digits. Due to the strong fiscal third quarter performance, our adjusted EBITDA expectations for the full fiscal year is increasing and narrowing to a range of $247 million to $253 million. Our team continues to execute against our strategy that has three main pillars; growth, digital transformation and platform design. Growth will benefit from the launch of a low-skew, high-value offering in the Home Center's targeting pros and a new brand that will serve our distribution customers 1951 Cabinetry. Our made-to-order business will also benefit from the upcoming summer launch, featuring new on-trend styles and finishes. Digital transformation efforts over the last fiscal quarter include the go-live of ERP and Monterrey, the go-live of WMS in Hamlet, North Carolina, and the go-live of website enhancements for our Home Center business. The planning for the next phase of work continues and includes the CRM service module supporting our customer care organization and new construction service center operations and ERP for our made-to-stock facilities. Platform design work continues with our first shipment of components from Monterrey, Mexico in January, and shipments of bath products from our Hamlet, North Carolina location in February. We will continue equipment installations in the coming months along with the training and hiring of new teammates to support our ramp plan. In closing, I'm proud of what this team accomplished in the third fiscal quarter and look forward to their continuing contributions during fiscal year '24. I will now turn the call back over to Paul for additional details on the financial results for the quarter.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Thank you, Scott. Reviewing our third quarter results for fiscal year 2024. Net sales were $422.1 million, representing a decrease of $58.6 million or 12.2% versus prior year. Remodel net sales, which combines Home Centers and Independent Dealer and Distributors, decreased 13.1% for the third quarter versus prior year, with both Home Centers and Independent Dealer Distributors decreasing 14.1% and 10.3%, respectively. New Construction net sales decreased 11% for the quarter compared to last year. Our gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 improved 350 basis points to 19.2% in net sales versus 15.7% reported in the same period last year. Gross margin benefited from favorable product mix and pricing matching, inflationary costs impacts along with operational improvements in our manufacturing facilities combined with the stability in our supply chain. Total operating expenses, excluding any restructuring charges for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 12.6% of net sales versus 10.4% for the same period last year. The 220 basis point increase is due to increases in our incentives and profit sharing for all employees and lower sales. Adjusted net income was $26.8 million, or $1.66 per diluted share in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 versus $24.4 million, or $1.46 per diluted share last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $50.6 million, or 12% of net sales versus $51 million, or 10.6% of net sales, reported in the same period last year and represents a 140-basis-point improvement year over year. Despite facing year-to-date volume headwinds, our continued strong earnings performance this year is a direct result of the hard work and efforts our teams have put into reestablishing and maintaining our operational efficiencies, stabilizing our supply chain, and controlling overall spending. These earning gains are partially offset by increases in incentive compensation, profit sharing, and digital transformation costs. Free cash flow totaled a positive $131.7 million for the current fiscal year to date compared to $91.5 million in the prior year. The $40.2 million increase was primarily due to changes in our operating cash flows, specifically higher net income and lower inventory partially offset by increased capital expenditures. Net leverage was 1.5 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, representing a 0.76 improvement from the 1.81 times as of last year. As of January 31, 2024, the company had $97.8 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, plus access to $322.9 million of additional availability under our revolving facility. Under the current share repurchase program, the company purchased 19.6 million, or approximately 216,000 shares, in the third quarter, representing about 1.3% of outstanding shares being retired. For the first nine months, we have repurchased 71.8 million of the company's common shares and have 105.4 million of share repurchase authorization remaining. Our outlook for the fiscal year 2024 from a net sales perspective, we continue to expect low double-digit declines in net sales versus fiscal year 2023, with high single-digit declines in the fourth fiscal quarter. The change in net sales is highly dependent upon overall industry, economic growth trends, material constraints, labor impacts, interest rates, and consumer behaviors. Given our strong performance for the first nine months of the year, we are increasing and narrowing our adjusted EBITDA expectation for the full fiscal year 2024 to a range of $247 million to $253 million. The increase in our expected outlook is due to the strong operational performance and the execution we have achieved in the first nine months of our fiscal year 2024. Reiterating our outlook from the past quarter, we have begun operations in our new locations in Hamlet, North Carolina, and Monterrey, Mexico, and we'll continue to ramp up production throughout the remaining calendar year. This will negatively impact our results and we will be incurring operational expenses without the offsetting full revenue performance of those locations. The total impact of these charges is approximately $8 million to $9 million in the full fiscal year 2024, with more than half of these charges occurring in the fourth fiscal quarter. In closing, our business continues to capitalize on the strides achieved over the past year. We anticipate that these enhancements will positively impact our financials throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. This success stands as a testament to the unwavering commitment, diligence and contributions of our dedicated employees, all in alignment with our GDP strategy. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to every team member at American Woodmark. They are the driving force behind our daily accomplishments. They are the ones who make could happen daily. This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions you have at this time.\nOperator: At this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Please go ahead with your question.\nGarik Shmois: Oh, hi. Thanks. And congrats on the quarter. I was hoping you can go into a little bit more detail on what you're seeing on the Remodel side, in particular, if you can provide some detail around in-stock versus semi-custom.\nScott Culbreth: Yes, Garik. Good afternoon. So when we look at the Remodel business, we're not seeing any major differences across the categories from a sell-through rate standpoint. So in stock as well as the special order in the Home Centers performed comparably inside the period.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. Wondering if you could go into some more detail. I think you talked about an improvement in product mix. What was driving that?\nScott Culbreth: That would be mixed across our channels first and foremost. So what we sold through in each of the respective channels that we've got, we've seen really an ability to hang on to the overall mix. I know there was some speculation going into this most recent fiscal year, perhaps rotation down. We've really not experienced that across the new construction channel. We've seen a little bit of that inside Remodel, but in totality, a favorable mix equation for us inside the quarter.\nGarik Shmois: Got it. And then I know we're not in your fiscal '25 yet, but if you're able to share any thoughts on how you think, perhaps, maybe calendar '24, just maybe a longer-term view of the market. I think we heard from a competitor, you know, anticipating low single-digit market growth declines over the next, say, four quarters. Just curious if you have any similar observations or any deviation off of that.\nScott Culbreth: Sure. And you're right. We're not ready to share an outlook beyond fiscal year 2024. You know, our cycle is, we're really starting our budgetary meetings internally now. We'll be ready to give you a full fiscal year '25 outlook in our next call. With that said, what are we hearing and seeing in the market, certainly, there was a number of recent releases in the building product space, across competitors, other categories, customers, and then, of course, the show out in Vegas this week. So if I take all of those inputs together, I think what we're seeing and hearing is that the range for single-family starts is still a bit mixed. We're seeing analysts talk about low- to and mid-single-digit growth for the calendar year. I think Remodel is the one that continues to remain a bit under pressure, estimates there from low- to mid-single-digits on the negative side. Home Centers again just reported their figures for the year and their outlook on calendar year '24, both signaled negative comps in the calendar year. And certainly, for the last two quarters, they both signaled that our category was performing worse than that. So, if I was to take all of that together, I would say that in totality Repair & Remodel, call it down low to mid-single, and then New Construction up mid-single, I think is sort of the market view. Our perspective in this would be the same as it's been for many years, is that we should perform better than that in both New Construction, Repair & Remodel. So, I'm not yet ready to give you what that translates into an outlook, but that's at least the market view. And our expectation is that we'll gain share and perform better than that.\nGarik Shmois: No, that makes sense. All right. Thanks for all that. I'll pass it on.\nScott Culbreth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Ramsey from Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteven Ramsey: Hi, good evening. Wanted to think about, you know, looking out over the next 12 months and with the new facilities now up and running, curious how adaptable you are to run those and ramp production up or down as the demand profile rolls in and how that potentially impacts gross margins as going forward with the new facilities coming online.\nScott Culbreth: Yes. Specifically to the first part of the question on our ability to adapt and ramp up or ramp down production, our operations team has historically done a fantastic job of being able to do that. During COVID, our biggest barrier would have been labor. We certainly have seen a better labor environment, but our beliefs internally is that that'll continue to always be a challenge. So we've done a lot of work over this past year to make sure we've got more flexibility and capability to ramp up as needed. And of course, ramping down, quite frankly, a little bit easier in that scenario. Specific to that capacity, you know, our commercial teams are doing a great job working in the market on finding opportunities for us to be able to fill that capacity. I don't know exactly when we'll get to a full ramp from that perspective. And that'll be part of our outlook conversation that we'll share with you all again next quarter.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay. That's helpful. And then thinking about signals you're maybe looking at for Repair & Remodel and a potential recovery there. Do you look first at trends through the dealer channel, through Home Centers. Just curious if there's anything in the marketplace that you're looking for that may not be publicly stated from others in their outlook.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Nothing materially different from what you see in the marketplace. I would say that we're looking at other data points outside of those outlets first. So what's happening with existing home sales, of course, that creates an opportunity for a transaction. What's happening with consumer sentiment, their willingness to invest back in the home and spend dollars, are they going to shift away from experiences back to an investment in an asset they own? What's happening with interest rates? So the same things you're viewing are the things that we're going to look at there. Depending on the cycle, we've seen different channels come back faster. So, I don't want to point to Dealer as a leading indicator, and I don't want to point to Home Center as a leading indicator because they both have varied over the years. So we look at the outside factors and then keep our eye around both of those particular outlooks as to the type of activity and jobs they're bidding.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay. That's helpful. And then last quick one for me, the margin outlook raised, just to make sure that's from already produced results year to date, or is there anything in the Q4 outlook that helps to bolster that full-year guide?\nScott Culbreth: Steven, I'm not tracking your question. So the outlook that we're going to give for the full year does include everything that we've achieved through the first nine months of the year. And we're trying to give you a range of exactly where it's going to be within that last quarter.\nSteven Ramsey: Got you. Yes. I just wanted to make sure is there -- for the raised EBITDA outlook, is that mostly attributable to year-to-date results, or is there -- is Q4 shaping up better than what you thought from the prior outlook?\nScott Culbreth: Yes, I'd say it's a combination of both is throughout the year, we're performing a lot better. So in essence, gives us the confidence to raise our outlook for the full year.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nTim Wojs: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Maybe just to start Scott on the new -- the 1951 brand. Could you just maybe give us a little bit of color of kind of where -- you know, kind of the market strategy behind the introduction of the new brand and then maybe kind of what your three- to five-year targets might be for, you know, growth related to that business?\nScott Culbreth: Hey, good afternoon, Tim. So, yes, 1951, you know, prior to us launching that brand, our strategy when we thought about the New Construction market was to serve it with one brand, and that brand was Timberlake. And that was regardless of how that particular builder wanted to really go about obtaining their cabinetry product. So what we've done now with 1951 is we've been able to consolidate, you know, all of our various platforms that we've got underneath the Woodmark umbrella. We're able to now provide to principally distributors, but also to some dealers, a brand that will be specifically focused on their business requirements. We want to make sure we give a choice to, you know, whether it's a builder, a contractor, a remodeler, the right product, and the right service model that they want to actually utilize. So, we're excited about it. The actual go-live is March 4. So, you know, we're a week before, but it'll be live March 4. It's already up on the website and available. And our commercial team is already out preselling and talking obviously to our distributors. So, we think it'll be a great opportunity to perhaps take away from some potential channel conflict that's existed in the past and gives us an opportunity to drive more growth in that channel. As far as specific goals, I don't have a goal that I want to put out in the market today specific to that. I'll just tell you that's part of the strategy and the overall outlook that we shared in our investor relation deck. We did a refresh on that back in January and posted that on the website. So that's factored into that financial model.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. Very good. Maybe just on the startup cost, the $8 million to $9 million this year. I know you're kind of, you know, some of your -- you don't want to talk too much about next year. But is there any kind of startup cost tail we should kind of think about that leads into next year or the first half of next year?\nScott Culbreth: It's not necessarily a startup cost tail. So I would say that the startup costs go away, right? That's a lot of the costs we had prior to being ready for production and ramping. It'll now shift to being deleveraged. So we'll have some fixed costs associated with those facilities. If we're not fully utilizing absorbing those, there'll be some, you know, deleverage that would roll through the results there. But you're right, we haven't modeled that fully out yet to give you a look, but we won't have this ramp cost to get ready like we had in fiscal year '24.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. And then the last one for me just on mix. You know, there's been some other kind of building product industries and categories that have talked about, you know, some negative mix, you know, kind of impacting whether it's, you know, consumer trade down in the R&R market or maybe it's smaller homes in new construction. Are you guys seeing that? Or is it a situation where your portfolio is kind of built around, you know, some of those mixed changes, and it's actually a benefit to American Woodmark in terms of just how the markets evolved?\nScott Culbreth: Yes. You got it, Tim. It's the latter part. When you think about our portfolio and the price points that we go after. You know, we're not sitting in the semi-customer custom range, where you might see folks move down in our category or even other categories of building products. So we go after the value price point offering. That's where we've been focused as a company for decades and that's where the market is shifting. So we're not dealing with a rotation down at higher price points. We're already at the value price points. And as shared earlier in the call, we really haven't seen much rotation, even inside our portfolio down.\nTim Wojs: Okay. Okay. Very good. Good luck on the rest of the year. Thank you.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Yes. Thanks, Tim.\nScott Culbreth: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Collin Verron with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nCollin Verron: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to start on the R&R market. It looks like it'll probably be like a second-half story in calendar year '24, just based on commentary from other building product manufacturers and the sentiment at the builder show this week. But I was curious if you had any thoughts on what needs to happen for the R&R market to really come back, whether that'd be a certain mortgage rate level or some other factor. And just how quickly you think demand can snap back when that happens.\nScott Culbreth: Yes. I'll take the latter part first on the equation. So how fast it comes back? I'm not sure. We talk a lot internally about, it'll come, it'll come quicker than we probably are anticipating. We just want to make sure we're ready for it. We believe there's some pent-up demand there and when consumers get comfortable again, they're going to come back in a pretty meaningful fashion and want to do projects. We do think about the second half being stronger. What are the things that we're going to keep focused on that we think will help drive that. Interest rates are going to be at the top of the list whatsoever really going to happen? I know we've pushed out a march potential reduction to now, June. Even then I think it's a 60% somewhat estimate on actually bringing it down 25 basis points. But we're looking to see interest rates move. We think that helps new construction as well as Repair & Remodel. And then the last one be existing home sales. We need to see existing home sales numbers increase all-time lows over the last, I think, 25 years this last calendar year. We need to see those numbers move back up. As they do, that creates an opportunity on both sides of the transaction of the sale for a Remodel, and that's usually when we see our business pick up. So those would be the two big indicators we're focused on.\nCollin Verron: Great. That's a really helpful color. And then, can you just comment on how your unit costs trended in the most recent quarter? And just how you're thinking about cost inflation or deflation as you look out into calendar year '24 here?\nScott Culbreth: Yes. The two things I would, well, I guess a couple of things I'd call out for you. So one on the input costs. We have seen some of the hardware lumber start to move up, some maple as an example. Specifically, we saw that move up a little bit towards the end of the quarter. And then also particleboard has recently seen some announcements around price increases. So keeping an eye on those. Labor, of course, is always going to be an item that will continue to progress and move that's not going to stop. And then final mile delivery, you know, that's another box we've seen. So a couple of the raws and then labor and final mile would be the key ones, not too different from what we've seen the past couple of quarters.\nCollin Verron: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess just any color as how you're thinking about price mix in the current quarter? Are you seeing any more price competition or pressure from your customers to reduce pricing, just given the lower-demand environment? Just any thoughts there?\nScott Culbreth: Yes, demand is not really a driver of the pricing conversation for us. What sometimes you'll see is maybe promotional activity being factored in because of the lower demand. We've seen a little bit of an uptick in Repair & Remodel, but not a considerable increase in promotional activity, really, throughout all of our fiscal year. As far as pricing, you know, we've had conversations with folks, you know, starting last year, again, not volume-driven, but deflation-driven. So if we've seen deflation on specific input costs and it's appropriate to make adjustments, you know, we'll have these conversations.\nCollin Verron: Great. I really appreciate all the color.\nScott Culbreth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And at this time, I am not seeing any additional questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Joachimczyk for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Since there are no additional questions, this concludes our call. Thank you all for taking the time to participate.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

Joining me is Scott Culbreth, President and CEO. Scott will begin with a review of the quarter, and I'll add additional details regarding our financial performance. After our comments, we'll be happy to answer questions.\nScott Culbreth: Thank you, Paul, and thanks to everyone for joining us today for our second fiscal quarter earnings call. Our team delivered net sales of $473.9 million, representing a decline of 15.6% versus the prior year. Within new construction, our business declined 11.1% versus prior year. Macroeconomic factors, including interest rates and housing affordability continues to account for the slowdown in new construction. These short-term factors are being partially mitigated by builders through rate buydowns and shifts to ready to move in homes and build to rent homes. We are strategically aligned with top19 of the top 20 national builders and key regional builders. With our best-in-class direct service model, we plan to continue to grow our share with new and existing customers and take advantage of the share gains our partners are realizing in the marketplace. Looking at remodel, which includes our home center and independent dealer and distributor businesses, Revenue declined 18.8% versus the prior year.  Within this, our home center business was down 18.3% versus the prior year. Demand trends declined due to lower in-store traffic rates and consumers choosing smaller-sized projects. With regards to our dealer, distributor business, we were down 20% versus the prior year. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $72.3 million or 15.3% for the quarter. Reported EPS was $1.85 and adjusted EPS was $2.36. The improvement in performance is due to product mix and improved efficiencies in the manufacturing platforms. Our team continues to drive operational excellence in our plans. Our cash balance was $96.4 million at the end of the second fiscal quarter, and the company has access to an additional $323.2 million under its revolving credit facility. Leverage was reduced to 1.05 times adjusted EBITDA, and the company repurchased 394,000 shares in the quarter. Our Board has authorized a new $125 million share repurchase program that replaces our current authorization that only had $22.9 million remaining.  Our outlook for fiscal year '24 remains unchanged, and with our expectations for sales of a low double-digit decline. Due to the strong fiscal second quarter performance, our adjusted EBITDA expectation is increasing to a range of $235 million to $250 million. Our team continues to execute against our strategy that has three main pillars: growth, digital transformation, and platform design. Growth will benefit from an upcoming launch of a low SKU, high-value offering in the home centers targeting PROs and a new brand to serve our distribution customers. Digital transformation efforts over the last fiscal quarter include the final planning of ERP for Monterrey Go Live next quarter and website enhancements for our home center business to the launch in February. In addition, we completed the implementation of our CRM sales solution across the new construction channels field sales organization, and we initiated the planning for the next phase of work, which includes the CRM service module supporting our customer care organization and new construction service center operations. Platform design work continues with occupancy in monitoring Mexico in November and Hamlet, North Carolina in December.  We will continue infrastructure and equipment installations in the coming months as well as training and hiring new teammates to support the initial ramp plan. As a reminder, this expansion will deliver additional capacity in our stock kitchen and bath cabinetry product lines. In closing, I am proud of what this team accomplished in the second fiscal quarter and look forward to their continuing contributions during fiscal year '24.  I'll now turn the call back over to Paul for additional details on our financial results for the quarter.\nPaul Joachimczyk : Thank you, Scott. Reviewing our second quarter results for fiscal year 2024. Net sales were $473.9 million, representing a decrease of $87.6 million or 15.6% versus the prior year. Remodel net sales, which combines home centers and independent dealers and distributors decreased 18.8% for the second quarter versus prior year. With both home centers and dealer distributors decreasing 18.3% 20%, respectively. New construction net sales decreased 11.1% for the quarter compared to last year. Our gross profit margin for the second quarter fiscal year 2024 improved 420 basis points to 21.8% of net sales versus 17.6% reported in the same period last year. Gross margin benefited from a favorable product mix and sustained pricing matching inflationary cost impacts, continued operational improvements in our manufacturing facilities, and an increased stability in our supply chain. Total operating expenses, excluding any real restructuring charges for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 12.2% of net sales versus 10.1% for the same period last year. The 210-basis point increase is due to increases in our incentives and profit sharing for all employees. Adjusted net income was $38.8 million or $2.36 per diluted share in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 versus $37.3 million or $2.24 per diluted share last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $72.3 million or 15.3% of net sales versus $67.6 million or 12% of net sales reported in the same period last year. This represents a 330-basis point improvement year-over-year. Despite facing the year-to-date volume headwinds, our continued strong earnings performance this year is a direct result of the hard work and efforts our teams have put in to reestablish our operating efficiencies, stabilize our supply chain, and controlled spending in the SG&A functions. These earnings gains are partially offset by increases in incentive compensation, profit sharing, and our digital transformation costs. Free cash flow totaled a positive $109.9 million for the current fiscal year-to-date compared to $44.4 million in the prior year. The $65.4 million increase was primarily due to changes in our operating cash flows specifically higher net income and lower inventory, partially offset by our increased capital expenditures. Net leverage was 1.05 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of the second quarter fiscal year 2024, representing a 1.18 times improvement from the 2.23 times as of last year. As of October 31, 2023, the company had $96.4 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, plus access to $323.2 million of additional availability under our revolving facility. Under the current share repurchase program, the company purchased $30 million or 394,000 shares in the second quarter, representing about 2% of the outstanding shares being retired. The Board of Directors has approved and authorized a new $125 million share repurchase plan. We are retiring the remaining $22.9 million on the old share repurchase authorization and rolling it into this new authorization.  Our outlook for fiscal year 2024 remains unchanged from a sales perspective, and we continue to expect low double-digit declines in net sales versus fiscal year 2023. The change in net sales is highly dependent upon overall industry economic growth trends, material constraints, labor impact, interest rates, and consumer behaviors. Given our strong performance for the first half of the year, we are increasing our adjusted EBITDA expectation for the full fiscal year 2024 to a range of $235 million to $250 million. increase in our expected outlook is due to our strong operational performance and execution we have achieved in the first half of our fiscal year 2024. Reiterating our outlook from the past quarter, we are still on track for starting our new operational locations in Hamlet, North Carolina, and Monterrey, Mexico this fiscal year. This will negatively impact the results as we continue incurring the operational expenses without the offsetting full revenue performance of those locations. The total impact of these charges is approximately $8 million in the full fiscal year 2024. Our capital allocation priorities for fiscal year 2024 remain unchanged.  We will first be focused on investing back into the business for the plant expansions in Monterrey, Mexico and Hamlet, North Carolina, continuing our path forward in our digital transformation with investments in our ERP and CRM solutions, and investing in automation. Next, we will continue our share repurchasing. And given our current position, we will be deprioritizing paying down debt in fiscal year 2024. In closing, the business continues to build off the progress made throughout the past year. We fully expect these improvements to carry through the financials for the remainder of the fiscal year. This is a testament to the commitment, hard work, and efforts our employees invest in the company to achieve our results and the direct alignment to the GDP strategy. I'm grateful for what the teams have accomplished and thank all of our team members at American Woodmark for their continued efforts. They are the ones who truly make it happen daily.  This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions you have at this time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Garik Shmois from Loop Capital. Please go ahead with your question.\nGarik Shmois : Congrats on the quarter. Within R&R, I was wondering if you could go into some more color on what you were seeing on both in-stock and made-to-order categories.\nScott Culbreth: Yes. Thanks, Garik. So specifically, in R&R at the home center side, when you talk about in-stock and MTO, we've seen negative trends in both categories, but MTO has been more severely impacted overall -- when you think about the price points. We've always said that we felt the stock category would be a bit more resilient in a slowdown. But even in this environment today, we are seeing unfavorable trends, but not to the degree we see in special order.\nGarik Shmois : Got it. I think you spoke to a favorable mix. I think that was more related to R&R, but I think we were hearing from a competitor that they were seeing trade-down effects more on the new construction side, Curious to see if you were seeing the same negative trade-down pressures and just maybe speak to pricing trends more broadly.\nScott Culbreth: So yes, we're not seeing that same trend. We've also not got the high end of the price continuum, so we're not selling custom or high-end semi-custom products to trade down against in the value space that we've been, we've seen very much a maintenance mode and some positive mix depending on the customer and the product category.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steven Ramsey from Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteven Ramsey: Good evening. Maybe to start with on the raised EBITDA guidance a very strong first half. Can you clarify if any of that is the second half outlook being any better?\nPaul Joachimczyk: I guess, Stephen, I guess, maybe rephrase your question about the second-half outlook being better.\nSteven Ramsey: Sure. On the EBITDA guidance being raised, was that solely in the first half? Or does the second half of the year have anything to do with that?\nPaul Joachimczyk: Yes, it's primarily the first half performance that we've seen because there's still so much uncertainty as we think about the second half from a demand profile standpoint. And as we've signaled over the past couple of quarters, we do have those start-up costs that Paul referenced of roughly $8 million that's all back half loaded for Monrad Hamlet.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay. Helpful. And then if you think about stocking levels by channel and customer type, do you feel that they're at a healthy level? Or do you think given the slowdown broadly the big ticket, do you think that some customer channel partners have taken stock down too low?\nScott Culbreth: So yes, just as a reminder, the vast majority of our portfolio was not stocked at a retailer or at a builder or at a dealer. So, you really are only talking about our stock kitchen and bath business that sits inside the home centers. Now over the last couple of quarters, we've had some discussion around some destocking that had occurred that was impacting the business. I feel we're roughly behind that. There's always some opportunities to get better in-store positions, and we continue to pursue those with the retailers, but nothing of significance that I would highlight in that space.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay, helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from McClain Hayes from Zelman & Associates. Please go ahead with your question.\nMcClain Hayes : Was curious if you could talk a little bit about input costs and how they're trending at this point?\nScott Culbreth: Yes, certainly. When you think about the raw materials that we're purchasing, those have stabilized. So that's a positive. On the flip side, we do continue to see upward pressure in the labor markets as well as domestic transportation.\nMcClain Hayes : And has any of that relief, I guess, on the hardwood lumber side, heard a discussion around pricing rollbacks across any of your three channels?\nScott Culbreth: I certainly wouldn't use the term rollbacks when we talk about pricing. We do monitor those input costs, and we do have some arrangements that are tied to those particular indices. But our general philosophy and approach and discussion that we've shared even in this call over the last couple of quarters is that any pricing reductions would have to be driven by deflation first. But also, there being an evaluation of the profitability of that particular channel and customer because we've got to continue to deliver on our long-term profitability goals. So, I'll just say that we're always having conversations around price and has continued to be ongoing with our customers.\nMcClain Hayes : Okay. And I guess one last one. Could you just elaborate a bit on some of those website changes you alluded to in the home center channel?\nScott Culbreth: Yes. It's basically just a reskin and a refresh. More relevant content as well as ways to drive consumers through the purchase journey that ultimately helps drive them into the store. -- to ultimately make a purchase decision.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julio Romero from Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead with your question.\nJulio Romero: Can you maybe just dig a little bit more into the operational efficiencies and the stabilization of the supply chain? And how much more runway do you have for each of those?\nScott Culbreth: I think on the supply chain stability, that's pretty much secured and we kind of lapped that. So, we've had a couple of quarters of that performance being very strong. So, we're not seeing the disruptions that we were experiencing over the last couple of years. I would say that we always have ongoing opportunity in the operations side. We talk about operational excellence across the business, not just in the manufacturing facilities, but all of our functional costs’ areas, and we'll continue to drive projects to take cost out of those particular areas as we go forward.\nJulio Romero: Really helpful there. And then I guess in the second quarter, you had a very tough year-over-year comparable on the volume side. Just how would you have us think about third quarter and the fourth quarter as the year-over-year comps get a little bit easier from a volume perspective?\nScott Culbreth: Yes. I think Q3 is unfortunately going to be fairly similar to Q2. We've now got a softer demand environment that you're obviously seeing in the marketplace. We will put a couple of extra down days in around the holidays as well. But as we push into Q4, we think the comps do start to improve. At this time, I still think they're likely negative but not nearly to the rate we've seen in Q2 and Q3.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Please go ahead with your question.\nTim Wojs: Good afternoon. Maybe just the first one, Scott, just how -- when you look -- when you talk to your builder customers, where do you feel like in terms of affordability, they are in kind of adjusting kind of square footage and home sizes. And if it trends lower to try to create a more affordable product, I mean, how does that kind of impact Woodmark, if at all?\nScott Culbreth: Yes. So, the first thing I'll remark on is what are we seeing hearing from the builder customers around price points and then let's bring interest rates into that discussion. The pricing has not really been the bigger challenge. The interest rates have been the higher priority. So many builders have done body on strategies to keep those rates in sub-5 or just north of 5% rate to keep folks interested in going into the home. I do think there will be a rotation down in-home size and folks are starting to model that. We experienced that a couple of years ago. That was part of our strategy, as you recall, when we did the acquisition that allowed us to bring origins to bear and be a product offering of taking those homes from a price point standpoint. I guess when I step back and think about homes, though, as they do get spec smaller, the most important space typically defined in those homes is the kitchen. And usually, those spaces are protected. So, I don't -- I'm not alarmed or worried that trends would be unfavorable for the amount of cabinetry we would sell into a kitchen space. Where you may have some impacts is perhaps a mud room gets dropped off as space has taken out but there's certainly still going to be a space. There's still an opportunity to bring product into those areas.\nTim Wojs: That's really helpful. And then on the kind of the wallet share opportunity, -- where do you -- I know you're not going to tell us like what exactly it is. But I mean maybe just how much runway could there be from a wallet share perspective with some of your top kind of national and regional builders?\nScott Culbreth: Yes. So, it's a difficult question to answer because it is very much regional and market specific. So, there's going to be some markets where we're pretty mature with our partners and have a very high share position. So, it's definitely going to be maintain and maybe target some regionals in that space. And then we've got some markets where we think there's a much more sizable opportunity to go get share with players. So, we target those particular markets and go after those particular accounts. Sorry, I can't add a lot more detail on that.\nTim Wojs: Yes. No, but there still are opportunities. I mean, it's kind of the point for wallet share to improve.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Absolutely.\nTim Wojs: Yes. Okay. And then maybe just the last one. Kind of first half, you guys did about 15% EBITDA margins. there's a little bit of variability here. But in the back half, it's going to be something that's maybe closer to 12%. I know that you get $8 million from the start-ups, that's about 100 basis points. January seasonally weaker. Like is there anything else just to call out why there would be that kind of maybe step down first half to second half outside of those kinds of discrete items?\nScott Culbreth: Yes. The three things we talked about last quarter and be the same items that we'd hit this quarter, you hit on two of them. So MontornHamlet, we've already discussed the $8 million in the back half. Certainly, a softer demand environment as we think about back half -- and then miracycle was the other we mentioned. So, some of our fixed costs do move our timeline on that is the August-September time frame. So we'll roll through some incremental costs for that. But nothing substantial outside of those three areas.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Collin Verron from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nCollin Verron : Thank you, for taking my question. I guess, just building off of that last question on the incremental costs that you're going to see in the back half of this year. I guess, any color as to how long you expect those start-up costs to linger into bigger fiscal year '25. Should we be expecting to see some margin impression, I guess, in the first half of the year from these strong 15% margins? -- going forward because of those costs staying in the business?\nScott Culbreth: We're not yet ready to start providing an outlook specifically on our fiscal year '25. But I think you've hit the key point there. We are going to have a ramp period we're not going to open those factories and they're all of a sudden going to be full overnight. So, there's going to be a ramp period. I can't disclose necessarily how long it will take us to fill that, but there will be some continued pressure as we go into the early part.\nCollin Verron : And I don't know if you're going to be willing to comment on this either. But I guess some of the larger builders are still fairly optimistic around their ability for volumes in 2024 calendar year 2024. I guess any early read as to how you guys are feeling about the full year 2024, given the strength and what the builders are saying? And then any color about what you're feeling for the repair and remodel market more broadly?\nScott Culbreth: Yes. On the builder side, what we're seeing and hearing is a pretty wide range of expectations. There are some analysts projecting low single-digit growth in starts for calendar year '24. And we have some builders that are pretty bullish and then others that are concerned. We haven't started our official kind of budget cycle process. We'll start that at beginning of '24, and that I'll give us a better perspective, but there does seem to be some energy to perhaps some slight growth as we move into '24. I think the remodel is going to continue to be under pressure. We've certainly heard from the home centers in the last couple of weeks. Their overall results and their outlook of kind of mid-single digits down our category at both of the retailers certainly performing worse than that as they've messaged over the last couple of quarters. So, I think we'll continue to be challenged there. And then we'll just have to continue to monitor new construction. I think every builder will tell you now is not the best time to ask as we go through the winter months. But as we get into the spring selling season, that will dictate how the back half of '21 looks.\nOperator: And at this time, as I do not see that there is anyone else waiting to ask a question, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jim Check for any closing comments.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Thank you again for joining us today. That does conclude our conference. We thank you all for your participation.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

I would now like to turn the call over to Paul Joachimczyk, Senior Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Good afternoon, and welcome to American Woodmark's first fiscal quarter conference call. Thank you for taking the time today to participate. Joining me is Scott Culbreth, President and CEO. Scott will begin with a review of the quarter, and I'll add additional details regarding our financial performance. After our comments, we'll be happy to answer your questions.\nScott Culbreth: Thank you, Paul, and thanks to everyone for joining us today for our first fiscal quarter earnings call. Our teams delivered net sales of $498.3 million, representing a decline of 8.2% versus the prior year. Within new construction, our business declined 6.4% versus prior year. Builders continue to buy down rates to drive sales and are shifting to our ready-to-move-in build strategy. Cancellations are holding in more historic norms in the 14% to 16% range. [Technical Difficulty] with new and existing customers. Looking at remodel, which includes our home center and independent dealer and distributor businesses, revenue declined 9.5% versus the prior year. Within this, our home center business was down 12.8% versus the prior year. Demand trends have slowed for our made-to-order and stock kitchen business due to lower in-store traffic rates and consumers are choosing smaller-sized projects. Our stock bath business was positively impacted by a promo versus the prior year, but that was more than offset by inventory destocking efforts at our customers. With regards to our dealer/distributor business, we were up 0.1% versus the prior year. Incoming order trends improved at the end of the prior fiscal quarter, allowing for stronger shipments in the fiscal first quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA increased 33% to $75.2 million or 15.1% for the quarter. Reported EPS was $2.28, and adjusted EPS was $2.78. The improvement in performance is due to pricing, better matching inflationary impacts, mix and improved efficiencies in the manufacturing platforms. Our ops team continues to drive excellence in our plans. Our cash balance was $89.7 million at the end of the first fiscal quarter, and the company has access to an additional $323.2 million under its revolving credit facility. Leverage was reduced to 1.9 times adjusted EBITDA, and the company repurchased 328,000 shares in the quarter. Our outlook for fiscal year ‘24 assumed market declines in both new construction and repair and model. And our view has not changed, but we do view repair and model demand is softer versus our original outlook with slightly better demand in new construction. Our expectation for sales remains unchanged with a low double-digit decline. Due to the strong fiscal first quarter performance, our adjusted EBITDA expectation is increasing to a range of $225 million to $245 million. Our team continues to execute against our strategy that has 3 main pillars: growth, digital transformation and platform design. Growth is benefiting from our summer launch that included several new finishes and new door styles, enhancements to our internal organization accessories within our made-order platform. Digital transformation efforts over the last fiscal quarter include the conclusion of our global design workshops for the next implementation area of ERP and Monterrey go-live. Our CRM tool went live in August across the remodel channel and will be followed by the new construction channel in September. Platform design work is accelerating with over 70% of the wall panels installed in Monterrey, Mexico, and all of the wall panels are installed in Hamlet, North Carolina. We expect both sites to be on our roof in the next 60 days. As a reminder, this expansion will deliver additional capacity in our stock kitchen and bath cabinetry product lines. In closing, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished in the first fiscal quarter, and I look forward to their continuing contributions during fiscal year '24. I will now turn the call back over to Paul for additional details on the financial results for the quarter.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Thank you, Scott. Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 were $498.3 million, representing a decrease of 8.2% over the same period last year. The combined home center and independent dealer and distributor net sales decreased 9.5% for the first fiscal quarter, with home centers decreasing 12.8% and dealer distributor increasing 0.1%. New construction net sales decreased to 6.4% in the first fiscal quarter, compared to the prior year. The company's gross profit margin for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was 22%, of net sales versus 16% reported in the same quarter of last year, representing a 600 basis point improvement. Gross margin in the first quarter of the current fiscal year was positively impacted by our pricing, better matching inflationary impacts, operational improvements in our manufacturing facilities and stability in the supply chain, partially offset by the $4.9 million tariff charge incurred within the quarter. As we discussed in our previous earnings call, we are returning to our normal performance cycles for our fiscal Q1 and Q4 are at higher performance levels due to the seasonality of our industry. Total operating expenses exclusive of any restructuring charges was 12% of net sales in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 compared with 10.3% of net sales for the same period of fiscal year 2023. The ratio increased 170 basis points due to increases in our incentives, profit sharing and digital spend. Adjusted net income was $46.2 million or $2.78 per diluted share in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 versus $28.4 million or $1.71 per diluted share last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024 was $75.2 million or 15.1% of net sales compared to $56.5 million or 10.4% of net sales for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year, representing a 470 basis point improvement year-over-year and matching the performance gain that we had in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal year 2023. Commerce made a final determination in the plywood case and the company's 2 Vietnamese plywood suppliers were included. Within the quarter, we took a $4.9 million pretax charge. We plan to vigorously appeal the determination. However, this will take time to recover. For context, our last order with new supplier was placed in June of 2022. The strong performance this year is a direct result of the hard work and efforts our team have put into reestablishing our operating efficiencies, stabilizing our supply chain and controlled spending in the SG&A functions, offset by increases in our incentive compensation, profit sharing and the $4.9 million pretax tariff charge. Free cash flow totaled a positive $72.5 million for the current fiscal year compared to $32.7 million in the prior year. The $39.8 million increase in free cash flow was primarily due to changes in our operating cash flows, specifically higher net income and lower inventories. Net leverage was 1.09x adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter -- first fiscal quarter 2024, representing a 1.71x improvement from the 2.8x in the prior fiscal year. As of July 31, 2023, the company had $89.7 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, plus access to $323.2 million of additional availability under its revolving facility. Under the current share repurchase program, the company purchased 22.1 million or 328,000 shares in the first quarter, representing about 2% of outstanding shares being retired. The remaining share repurchasing authorization is $52.9 million. Our outlook for fiscal year 2024 remains unchanged from a net sales perspective. And we continue to expect low double-digit declines in net sales versus fiscal year 2023. The change in net sales is highly dependent upon overall industry economic growth trends material constraints, labor impacts, interest rates and consumer behaviors. Our EBITDA expectation for fiscal year 2024 is being increased $20 million from our prior outlook to a range of $225 million to $245 million. The increase in our expected outlook is due to the stabilized operational performance and the positive start we had to our fiscal year 2024. Reiterating our outlook from the past quarter, we are still on track for starting our new operational locations in Hamlet, North Carolina, and Monterrey, Mexico this fiscal year. This will negatively impact the results as we have -- as we will be incurring the operational expenses without offsetting full revenue performance of those locations. The total impact of these charges is approximately $8.1 million in the full fiscal year of 2024. Our capital allocation priorities for fiscal year 2024 remain unchanged. We will first be focused on investing back into the business for the plant expansions in Monterrey, Mexico, Hamlet, North Carolina and continuing our path on our digital transformation with investments in our ERP and CRM solutions. And lastly, investing in our automation efforts. Next, we'll continue our share repurchasing. As a reminder, we still have $52.9 million remaining. And lastly, we have our debt position at a leverage ratio we wanted to achieve, and we will be deprioritizing paying net debt in fiscal year 2024. In closing, the business continues to build off the progress made through the past fiscal year. We fully expect these improvements to read through the financials throughout this year. This is a testament to the commitment, hard work and efforts our employees invest in the company to achieve our results and the direct alignment to the GDP strategy. I'm grateful for what the team has accomplished and thank all of our team members at American Woodmark for their continued efforts. They are the ones who make it happen daily. This concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to answer any questions [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] At this time, Our first question comes from Julio Romero with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nJulio Romero: [Technical Difficulty] So I guess can you maybe start on the sales guide, you talked about a little bit better new construction outlook, but a little bit worse R&R outlook. Can you just talk about the repair and remodel side? You mentioned smaller-sized projects. Does that just mean you're selling less volume per home remodel? And maybe just talk about what's driving lower in-store traffic rates?\nScott Culbreth: Sure. I'll take just a couple of questions in there. Let's first talk about our expectations as we think about calendar year ‘23, I don't want to step into '24 yet at this point. But certainly, we're expecting to see sales decline in both channels. I would say the range for single-family starts has widened from high-single-digits to low-double-digits, depending on the source, and they're looking at starts data that just came out January to July, we averaged down 17%. Nationally with July of 10. And then remodel, it's been trending in that mid-single-digit range. Home centers just reported in the last two weeks. They shared an outlook of down mid-single digits. And in their most recent quarter showed that our particular category was performing below the average store comp. They did attribute that to two factors: one, slowing traffic in the outlets and then also just smaller jobs. So we're taking all that into consideration as we look at our business and projections going forward. We just think it's a reallocation between the two channels for us, but ultimately, the same sales guide we had last quarter.\nJulio Romero: Okay. I appreciate the color there. And then just wanted to ask about the free cash flow figure, which was pretty impressive for the first quarter. Maybe what's your sense of inventory levels today? Should they continue to trend lower? And just how do you think about free cash flow overall for the rest of the year?\nPaul Joachimczyk: Yes. Julio, really, we have our inventories kind of starting to get stabilized. We still have room for improvement in that, and we're not going to continue our efforts on those avenues free cash flow started off much stronger than we anticipated in the first part of the year, primarily due to our outperformance. But also, we have some delays still in regards to our manufacturing facilities coming online with the OEMs, not from a lack of desire to do these projects, but just timing of that. But we will have a strong free cash flows for the year.\nJulio Romero: Really helpful. Thanks a lot guys.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Adam Baumgarten with Zelman. Please go ahead.\nAdam Baumgarten: Hey, good afternoon. I guess just on the input cost side. I don't know if you guys touched on that, but just kind of what you're expecting for the balance of the fiscal year?\nScott Culbreth: Yes. On the inflation side, at this point, we are seeing relief in hardwood lumber specifically. So we've seen declines there. But we still see upward pressure on other categories from a year-over-year standpoint, such as plywood, paint and hardware. Certainly, labor, right, continues to be an increasing input cost along with domestic transportation. Don't see that changing materially between now and the end of the calendar year, even really the end of our fiscal year.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay. Got it. And then just on the softness in the on the R&R side, just kind of maybe talk about promotional activity and how that's trending.\nScott Culbreth: Yes. We've seen a slight uptick in promo activity. I think we messaged the same last quarter, again, principally in the remodel channel, so both in the dealer distributor space as well as the home center. So a slight uptick, but nothing of concern.\nAdam Baumgarten: So like kind of back to normal, is it a good way to think about it?\nScott Culbreth: I still would say it's below the historic norm.\nAdam Baumgarten: Okay, got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Steven Ramsey with Thompson Research Group. Please go ahead.\nSteven Ramsey: Hi, good evening. On gross margins being strong again for the second consecutive quarter, you called out the drivers there. Could you maybe walk through the order of magnitude on the drivers helping gross margin in the quarter? And then maybe just order of magnitude, how you see that evolving going through the rest of the year on those drivers?\nPaul Joachimczyk: Yes, Steven, good question. Really, we talked about pricing better matching inflation. So we really have caught up to that kind of commentary that's out there. So from our first from a magnitude perspective, that is the first and foremost that's out there. Then you look at the other opportunities that are out there, operational efficiencies, really matching better from we did the stability of supply chain. Those two work hand in hand, so as our supply chain really stabilized, it does allow our operations to get back to their normal operating cadences which increases our overall plant efficiencies. And those are the, I'd say, kind of stack 1 and then 2 with those two being combined together.\nScott Culbreth: Then the only thing I would add to that is just on the pricing piece, I would tell you that we've really lapped the increases that we put into the business a year ago. So we're not expecting additional gains in pricing to benefit year-over-year going forward.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay. Helpful. And then on the new facilities cost of about $8 million this year, is that a pressure that steps down or goes away completely as the markets normalize over the next year or so, or maybe kind of talk to the outlook on that spend.\nScott Culbreth: Yes. It's basically the ramp-up and start-up cost. You start paying a lease and you don't have it fully utilized. So we'll take that charge this year as an impact. And then our expectation is that we do start to better utilize and leverage both of those facilities going forward.\nSteven Ramsey: Okay, helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Collin Verron with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nCollin Verron: Great quarter and thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to start with the guide. Backing to some numbers back into a 100 basis point increase in the EBITDA margin from your previous guide. Can you just give us some more detail around what's driving the increase in the margin guide? Is it all operational improvements? Or are you seeing the -- or is it going to be lower raw material costs? Just looking for some more color on the drivers of that.\nScott Culbreth: Yes, I'd really take it back to Paul's comment a moment ago. Certainly, the impact of our first quarter being better than what we had modeled and assumed when we gave that outlook a year ago would be a contributor and as he mentioned, pricing was a key piece of that as well as how we run in the factories. As we go forward, we expect to continue to run our factories well. So we think we've got some upside for that, and we've got that factored in to the overall equation. We do expect softer demand as a bit of an offset as we go forward. But when we take all of those considerations together, we're confident with the increase that we've put out there for our range.\nCollin Verron: Okay, that's helpful. And then in terms of the margin performance through the rest of the year, any help in thinking about that as the shape of the year? And where you see EBITDA margins bottoming?\nScott Culbreth: So I don't want to get into a quarterly outlook view on really, quite frankly, sales or EBITDA. That's how we give the full-year view. The only thing I will comment on specifically is just recall that Q2 a year ago, was by far and away our strongest sales comp in the prior year. Why was that? We made considerable headway in reducing our backlog a year ago. So just as a reminder, that would be a bit of a tailwind as we think about this upcoming quarter fiscal year '24.\nCollin Verron: Great. That's helpful color. And then just the last one here for me. You talked about some destocking at the home centers. Can you just talk about how much of a headwind that was for you guys in the quarter? And where you guys think that channel is from an inventory perspective after this quarter?\nScott Culbreth: I have a specific amount that I'll call out for that, Collin, but we believe there's an opportunity at both of our key accounts to see increases in in-store inventory levels to help both the bath, kitchen, quite frankly, even storage category. So our teams work hand in hand with our customers on driving that improvement in stock rates so that we can assure that we get our in-consumers product to be able to purchase.\nCollin Verron: Great, thank you and good luck with the rest of the year.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Okay, thank you.\nScott Culbreth: Thank you, Collin.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Please go ahead.\nTim Wojs: Hey, guys. Good afternoon, [Indiscernible]. Maybe just my first question, just on that one of your last answer to Scott, did you say, are these are the tailwind? Did you mean a headwind from inventory kind of your backlog kind of conversion in the prior year last year?\nScott Culbreth: So we had a -- sorry, to clarify that comment, when you compare Q2 to prior year or specifically, prior year had the benefit of being able to chew through a pretty substantial amount of backlog. We will not have that this year. So there's a tailwind last year that doesn't repeat itself this year. Thus, it's a headwind. Sorry for not being clear that first time.\nTim Wojs: No, yes. I just want to make sure I heard that Okay. Got that. And then I guess within your builder business, I mean, is there -- are you seeing any differences in terms of kind of order activity or just kind of the confidence that your builders have based on -- based on the size of the builder. Just trying to think -- I know you do a lot of work with the larger kind of builders. But how would you kind of compare and contrast some of the larger builders to some of the smaller ones?\nScott Culbreth: Yes. All the statements you made are all accurate. So there's a wide range. And it's not only a factor of the builder specifically, Tim, but also the region. So we've seen some weakness out West as of late. That was sort of the last area of the country to start to rotate down. We expect that to come back. So it varies depending on the account, but I would say the larger builders are pretty bullish on their expectations now for the year as opposed to where they were three and six months ago.\nTim Wojs: Okay, okay. Good. And then would you think from a lead time perspective, or how we think about kind of lagging starts or kind of comparing to completion. I know with the supply chain that had kind of got out of the lag over the last couple of years. But would you kind of revert back to that kind of 90 to 100-day lag relative to starts now as we kind of think about the new construction market?\nScott Culbreth: I wouldn't go all the way back to that historic norm. We certainly saw the increase and Paul would quote that moving up, I think, roughly 30 to 60 days. Over the past couple of years, we certainly hear about that coming down you even see some of the builders report on that specifically at that time to build has shrunk. But I don't think we're back to the historic norms yet. We get still pockets of labor challenges, again, market by market, that's creating some difficulty on builders being able to get the homes to complete status. Then you get weather, things like out West and Southern California that also creates some disruptions in that cycle time.\nTim Wojs: Okay, okay, very good. Very good. Thanks for the time, guys. Good luck.\nScott Culbreth: Thank you, Tim.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] As I do not see that there is anyone else waiting to ask a question, I would like to turn the line over to Mr. Joachimczyk for any closing comments. Please go ahead, sir.\nPaul Joachimczyk: Since there are no additional questions, this concludes our call. Thank you for taking [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] You may now disconnect."
