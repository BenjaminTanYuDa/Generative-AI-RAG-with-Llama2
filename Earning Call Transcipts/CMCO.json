I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Kristy Moser, Vice President of Investor Relations and Treasurer.\nKristy Moser: Thank you, Rob. And good morning, everyone, to Columbus McKinnon's fiscal third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. The earnings release and presentation are available for download on our Investor Relations website and at investorrelations.cmco.com. On the call with me today are David Wilson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Greg Rustowicz, our Chief Financial Officer. In a moment, David and Greg will walk you through our financial and operating performance for the quarter. But before we begin our remarks, please let me remind you that we have our safe harbor statement on slide two. During the course of this call, management may make forward-looking statements in regards to our current plans, beliefs, and expectations. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results and events to differ materially from the results and events contemplated by these forward-looking statements. I'd also like to remind you that management will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures on the company's Investor Relations website and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Please see our earnings release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission for more information. Today's prepared remarks will be followed by a question and answer session. With that, let me turn it over to David.\nDavid Wilson: Thank you, Christy, and good morning, everyone. The third quarter was another quarter of strong net sales as we leveraged our playbook for growth and gained traction with commercial initiatives. In fact, we delivered over $1 billion of net sales on a trailing 12-month basis for the first time in our history. With continued category resilience and healthier supply chain dynamics, we improved operating performance in areas that matter most to our customers and reduced our lead times. This improvement in operational performance enabled us to further reduce our past two backlog levels and delivered improvements in customer experience. In the third quarter, we drove 10% top-line growth, which translated to even stronger growth in operating profit, as we expanded gross margin, benefited from leverage on our growth and remained focused on performance improvement through CMBS and our 80-20 process. Adjusted gross margin expanded by a robust 160 basis points year-over-year, even as we lapped pricing actions from the prior year. Improvements over time have been driven by progress in capacity planning, material costs, direct labor productivity, factory overhead rates, pricing, and the acquisition of Montratec. Although we delivered strong margin expansion year-over-year, it fell a bit short of our own expectations due to a few unique items that Greg will unpack shortly. While those dynamics had an impact in the third quarter, we expect to accelerate year-over-year adjusted gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter. We have line of sight to 200-plus basis points of expansion with potential upside opportunities and remain on track for our 40% gross margin target in 2027. That exceptional operating performance is all thanks to the hard work and strong execution of our 3,500 Columbus McKinnon team members. I couldn't be more proud of how our nimble and innovative team has continued to deliver on behalf of both our customers and our shareholders. More consistent and improving execution by our team, combined with our differentiated business model, has delivered a strong record of performance over time and across a variety of economic environments. While we're growing and generating cash, which provides dry powder to reinvest in our growth framework where we have multiple levers to drive scale, we also remain focused on using our significant cash flow generation coupled with adjusted EBITDA growth to naturally deleverage our business. Our net leverage ratio now sits at 2.6 times and we're on track to achieve approximately 2.3 times by the end of the fiscal year. We're off to a solid start in the fourth quarter, powered by the resilience of our differentiated business, growing momentum with our commercial initiatives, and strong track record of our execution. If you'll turn to slide four, we delivered order growth of 8% in the third quarter, positioning us to deliver on our fourth quarter sales guidance, which Greg will discuss shortly. Orders remain strong across all geographies and we saw a particular strength in EMEA as demand remained resilient despite the broader macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Underpinning our growth was strength in precision conveyance and lifting, which were up 23% and 7% respectively. Even excluding Montratec, precision conveyance was up 9%. Overall, demand for both our project and short cycle businesses remained healthy. Project orders grew double digits in Q3, reflecting our customer-centric focus, targeted end market growth initiatives, and channel diversification efforts. And on a quarter-to-date basis through last week, short cycle orders continue to expand and are up 11% versus the same period last year. We are capitalizing on megatrends within the vertical market, leading to project wins in areas related to electric and hybrid vehicle advancements, e-commerce and package delivery solutions, pharma's ship-to-home trends, and increasing demand for prepackaged meals, where we are delivering customized solutions for our customers to address their unique needs and exact specifications. As we lean into customization, an increasing proportion of our portfolio requires unique equipment and parts, creating recurring revenue streams for our business that will also be a tailwind to gross margin over time. While still early, we see a growing pipeline of project activity this quarter, and have already had wins in categories benefiting from megatrends that provide tailwinds to our business, such as pharma automation and logistics. We are not immune to the macroeconomic environment, we remain cautiously optimistic about our near-term outlook, given the resilience of our customer relationships, the visibility we have into our sales funnel, and our efforts to improve our customers' experience. Through our acquisitions and our commercial growth initiatives, we are adding new customers and expanding into new markets, markets that have attractive tailwinds. This has muted impacts from pockets of softness in industrial CapEx spending. Importantly, we remain encouraged by our funnel for both short cycle and large project orders. As I mentioned earlier, we remain highly focused on improving our operational performance and enhancing our customers' experience. As a result of these efforts, our backlog decreased by 6% from the prior quarter, driven by reductions in past due backlog, which decreased 26% in the period. Going forward, we expect backlog to further normalize from current levels. While this may impact near-term shipment flexibility, we expect to benefit from improved lead times and customer satisfaction levels, which we believe will create tailwinds to order frequency and volume over the midterm. In addition to customer experience, we continue to make significant progress on all aspects of our transformation, delivering on productivity enhancements and simplifying our business, including foundational progress with the footprint rationalization plan that we mentioned in our last investor day. As part of that effort in January, we opened our state-of-the-art manufacturing center of excellence in Monterey, Mexico, pictured on slide five. A 165,000 square foot facility that will enable productivity enhancements and growth over time; this investment is directly aligned with our 80-20 process and will cultivate a culture of innovation as we expand our R&D capabilities in the region. We expect to incur approximately $26 million of CapEx associated with this phase of the project. We also expect factory consolidation costs of approximately $2 million related to the closure of our Santiago, Mexico facility and our consolidation of that facility into Monterey in the fourth quarter. We expect to achieve productivity benefits related to this investment over the course of fiscal '25, but we anticipate that those benefits will be offset by overlapping production costs while we ramp production volume in the new factory. Pulling up on slide six, we're encouraged with the progress we're making and by the potential of our business as we advance our strategic transformation to become the global leader in intelligent motion solutions for material handling. We remain highly focused on executing our strategic plan and achieving both the near and long-term objectives we've established for the business. I remain confident in the long-term trajectory of Columbus McKinnon powered by our differentiated business model, track record of execution, an encouraging funnel of opportunities, and our acquisition strategy. We are just beginning to scratch the surface in terms of the value our precision conveyance business can deliver. The expansion of our total addressable market through our proven playbook provides a long and attractive runway for growth with a focus on targeted sectors that are benefiting from tailwinds associated with megatrends related to automation and the scarcity of labor resources, the near shoring of manufacturing capacity, infrastructure, and defense spending, as well as electrification. Our continued execution, growing momentum, and the strength of our business model give us confidence that we will remain on track to meet our long-term financial objectives. With that, I'll turn it over to Greg to take us through the financial results.\nGregory Rustowicz: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Turning to slide seven, we delivered sales in the third quarter of $254.1 million, up 10.3% from the prior year period, or 8.5% on a constant currency basis. This was at the high end of the guidance we provided last quarter, supported by strong execution from the team and continued resilience in demand. The Montrotec acquisition contributed $15.5 million to net sales, accounting for 6.7% of the net sales increase. Montrotec had a very strong quarter, reflecting the timing of several large project deliveries, namely to Airbus and a large German automotive company in the EV space. We realized pricing gains of $6.5 million, or 2.8%, which was in line with what we were anticipating as we lapped last year's November price increase. Volume decreased by $2.4 million, or 1%. This was largely in our precision conveyance platform, which was impacted by lower order rates earlier in the fiscal year. As David discussed, the funnel is healthy for this platform, and we saw strong order growth of 23.5% in Q3. Foreign currency translation was a benefit this quarter of $4.1 million, or 1.8%. We saw robust growth outside of the U.S., with sales increasing by 30%. This was the result of a combination of both Montrotec revenue and high single-digit organic growth. In the U.S., sales decreased 2% on lower volumes, primarily in our precision conveyance platform as just referenced. On slide eight, we recorded gross margin of 36.9% in the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, gross margin was 37.2%, up 160 basis points year-over-year. As expected, we saw adjusted gross margin decline sequentially by 150 basis points, which includes normal seasonality. While gross margins were the highest we ever had in a third quarter, we came in a little behind our expectations. This was primarily driven by a COVID outbreak in December in our Kunstleslau, Germany, factory that impacted labor productivity. In addition, at Montrotec, we had higher purchase components for a particular project that carried a lower margin, which we have addressed and should not repeat. Q4 margins will rebound, and we remain on our path to achieve 40% gross margins in fiscal '27. Gross profit increased $11.8 million, or 14% versus the prior year. This was driven by several factors, which you can see in the table. The largest item driving gross profit expansion were contributions from the Montrotec acquisition, which contributed $6.7 million to gross profit, and pricing net of manufacturing cost changes, including material inflation, which added $4.6 million. Montrotec was accretive to gross margins by 40 basis points this quarter, with an overall gross margin of 43%. Moving to slide 9, our SG&A expense was $59.5 million in the quarter, or 23.4% of sales. This was improved 70 basis points from a year ago. The year-over-year increase was largely from the addition of Montrotec to the portfolio and the impact of FX, which added 800,000 to the total. We continue to invest in R&D, which added $1.4 million to the total, but this was more than offset by an acquisition earn out in the prior year that did not repeat and lower selling costs as we realigned the business a year ago. Turning to slide 10, we generated operating income of $26.9 million in the quarter, or 10.6% of sales. This represents an increase of $6.7 million, or 33% over last year's third quarter. Adjusted operating income was $29.7 million, or 11.7% of sales. On an adjusted basis, operating income grew $6.3 million, or 27%. This reflects the strong operating leverage we have in the business and demonstrates our long runway for margin expansion over time. Excluding the Montrotec acquisition, which was additive to our results, our business drove 47% adjusted operating leverage. As you can see on slide 11, we recorded GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter of $0.34, down $0.8 versus the prior year. This was due to a $4.6 million non-cash pension settlement expense, which impacted EPS by $0.12 per share. We are in the process of terminating one of our U.S. pension plans. We paid lump sum payments to a certain class of current and former employees who elected the lump sum settlement. The remaining liability will be sold to an insurance company later this calendar year. When we complete that transaction, we expect another non-cash charge of approximately $28 million to $29 million that we will record. At that point, the pension plan will be off our books. We had a similar termination back in fiscal year '21. We have adjusted this out for purposes of calculating adjusted EPS. Our tax rate on a GAAP basis this quarter was 29% as we repatriated overseas cash to accelerate debt repayment, which resulted in dividend withholding taxes. Year-to-date, our tax rate was 26%, and for the year, we still expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.74 was up $0.2 from the prior year. This higher adjusted operating income more than offset the negative impact of higher interest expense and the increased tax rate year-over-year, which together impacted EPS by about $0.10 per share in the quarter. On slide 12, our adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter of 16.3% improved by 160 basis points from a year ago. On a trailing 12-month basis, our adjusted EBITDA margin was also 16.3%, a 50 basis point improvement from where we finished fiscal year '23. Our return on invested capital continues to improve and was up 30 basis points from fiscal year '23 to 7%. We expect to realize a low double-digit ROIC by fiscal year '27. Moving to slide 13, quarterly free cash flow was $23.1 million in the period. This includes cash provided by operating activities of $29.1 million and CapEx of $6 million. Year-to-date, our free cash flow is $12.3 million, which is an increase of 66% from a year ago despite the higher CapEx, largely tied to our new Monterey, Mexico facility. Q4 historically is a strong cash from operations quarter for us, and we would expect that trend to continue. Turning to slide 14, our capital structure continues to improve as our net debt leverage ratio was 2.6 times on a financial covenant basis. As we have previously discussed, we have a covenant-like credit agreement. We continue to accelerate our debt reduction plans as we pay down another $15 million of debt this quarter. We are planning to pay down an additional $15 million in Q4, which will bring the total to $55 million of debt this fiscal year, up from the $40 million discussed at the beginning of the fiscal year. We expect to report a net leverage ratio of approximately 2.3 times as we exit fiscal year '24. Turning to guidance on slide 15, on the back of solid growth and orders in Q3, we expect to continue to grow net sales between 2% and 6% to between $260 million to $270 million in Q4. We also expect roughly $60 million of our SG&A expense, $10 million of interest expense, a tax rate of 25% for the full year, diluted shares outstanding of $29.1 million. We expect to continue to be highly cash flow generative with free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full fiscal year. This is inclusive of Q4 CapEx of approximately $14 million to $19 million, which is elevated due to the opening of our Monterey facility. We expect to use our cash flow to continue to de-lever our business. As a result, we expect our net leverage ratio to improve to approximately 2.3 times by the end of the fiscal year. As I wrap up my review of our financial performance, let me emphasize that our guidance reflects the strength of our results here today, initial trends in the fourth quarter, and our ongoing confidence in our differentiated business model. Rob, we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from Matt Summerville with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. A couple questions. With respect to Monterey, the duplicative manufacturing cost, of course, you're going to have, are you able to quantify that? Is that included in the guide? Will that be one-timed out? And then can you also talk about Monterey, maybe what you're consolidating into that facility, how the ramp-up trajectory looks, timing on cost savings, quantification, all that stuff?\nDavid Wilson: Matt, let me take the first part of that, and I'll address the second question, and then I'll hand it off to Greg to address the first of your questions. So if you go back to our analyst or investor day when we talked about our strategy from a footprint simplification standpoint, we outlined a path that included an improvement to gross margin through the rationalization of our footprint over time. And what we've done is we've put in place the foundation for that work with this brand new facility that we just erected, and we started to consolidate into. And so we have announced the consolidation of our Santiago MEXO facility into that location in Monterey, and that's underway. And then over time, we'll be addressing the follow-on plans associated with that overall strategy. And obviously, for sensitivity reasons, we're not going to get into more details related to those next steps. But we have a very well-defined plan that we're actively managing and leading the business through, and expect that to deliver the benefits that were outlined at that time in our bridge to 40% gross margins.\nGregory Rustowicz: Hi, Matt. So this is Greg. So with regards to how we're going to handle the cost for Monterey, so this quarter, we pro formaed approximately $755,000, as it represented the cost of us getting a team in place, hiring new people, and some facility costs. And we haven't yet produced a single item. So we would expect as we ramp up in Q4, we will also have pro forma costs related to that that would be in excess of what we would -- the standards we set for the cost of manufacturing our product. And as we go into fiscal year '25, we will start to realize benefits from the facility, from the consolidation. But we think that, in general, that it's going to be kind of offset by the fact that we're still scaling up.\nMatt Summerville: Understood. And then, David, could you maybe talk a little bit more – provide a little bit more granularity just around some more end market specifics, where you see the most strength right now, maybe where you're seeing some weaker spots in both the U.S. and your international business?\nDavid Wilson: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Matt. So we're – we've seen nice market resilience across all geographies. And I think in the data that we talked about relative to the performance of the business in Q3, we saw an increase in Europe of 9.5% in orders, including Montratec, 4.5% year-over-year, excluding Montratec on a constant FX basis. Order rates in our conveyance business were up 23.5% globally, including Montratec, 9%, if you exclude that. Our lifting business was up 7%. So there's been a nice level of resiliency. We are seeing nice performance as it relates to the EV pipeline, life sciences, food and beverage, as well as defense opportunities. And as we look to the future, we're in active discussions with a targeted set of customers that serve the life sciences space, the EV and hybrid vehicle space. The e-commerce spaces, we're starting to gain additional traction there. We're excited about the pipeline of opportunities that exist there. And then food and beverage is starting to gain traction. What I will say is the headwind seen probably between June of 2022 and June of 2023 related to the robotics and packaging markets with higher interest rates and some of the slowdown and in-order rates there that were affecting our conveyor business, those have bottomed that, and there's a rebound there that we're able to capitalize on, and we feel good about the progress our teams are making as we're targeting markets to support growth in our precision conveyance business.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Hi, good morning, and thank you for the questions. I just wanted to drill down a little bit on that end market commentary a little bit more if you could. First, was US lifting down at all or was that all conveyance? And if it was all conveyance, was that simply the lapping of that large e-commerce and robotic customer you mentioned?\nDavid Wilson: Yeah, US lifting was up with orders in the quarter. And on a global basis, lifting was up 7%, 7.5%. But the US lifting business was also up in low single digits.\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Okay, great. And then you mentioned strength in, I guess, ordering and bottoming and recovery in the conveyance business. Is that from returns of any customers that came out or is that more broad-based as you address more of the market?\nDavid Wilson: Yeah, it's a little bit of both, actually. We've continued to gain traction with a new set of customers that we've engaged in channel diversification initiatives and business development with targeted customers. And so we're pleased with the traction we're gaining around e-commerce more broadly through both integrators and end users. But we are seeing the return of activity with customers that we've worked with for a long time and continued traction around beta developments that we're working on with them.\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Got it. And then finally, you mentioned strength in EV, which seems counter to the sentiment that maybe production is ahead of demand there. I was wondering if you could provide a little more color on what your customers are telling you and kind of how they're planning?\nDavid Wilson: Sure, yeah. So we're working with a number of participants in that space. And as we build capacity for our customers, they're focusing on both long-game benefits as they position themselves for this as a long-term trend, but also they're focusing on productivity improvements in their own factories and the advantages we can provide them with, whether that be for immediately growing demand or current demand. And there's opportunities for us through the work we do with Intelligent Motion Solutions that help them with their productivity and cost savings to sell more. And so we're seeing traction with the work we're doing there.\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Great. Greg, if I could sneak one in there, what would you expect on a gross margin basis as we head into the fourth quarter, both what would normally be a seasonal thing and kind of the one-offs that you expect this quarter?\nGregory Rustowicz: Yeah, so we think we're going to be in the 200 basis point plus from where we sit today sequentially, or from last year, sorry. So that puts it approximately at the 38% gross margin, but just the gross margin area.\nDavid Wilson: And I think we noted in our prepared come up commentary, John, that we see upside potential and we're working on that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Walter Liptak with Seaport Research. Please proceed with your question.\nWalter Liptak: Hi, thanks. Good morning, guys. I'm good quarter. Thanks. One to ask about Montratec and the sales came in a little bit stronger than I was expecting. And so I guess the question is, was there something that was pulled forward? What are we thinking now for sort of the 12-month revenue run rate for Montratec?\nDavid Wilson: Sure, sure. So as Greg indicated in his prepared commentary, we shipped two large projects to Airbus and then to a large German EV manufacturer. And those were planned. We had visibility to that demand and to those shipments in the quarter. So they were elevated. And that's not a quarterly run rate, if you will, right now for the business. But as we purchased the business, it was a $30 million business. And we had communicated that we anticipated we'd grow the business at roughly a 30% rate. And so I think that still remains intact and would anticipate that we're a year later running at more of a $40 million rate. And as a project-focused business, it's natural that that business will have a level of variability quarter-to-quarter. And so that $15 million does not repeat itself in this coming quarter. But we continue to see really robust demand for that business. And we're encouraged by the progress we're making with our integration work, the opportunities for that business, not only through their historical channel of delivery or sales to customers, but also through what we've been able to enhance that with, with the combination of our businesses. So we really feel good about the early innings for that business and the growth trajectory that we think we can achieve over time.\nWalter Liptak: Okay. That sounds great. And maybe a last one. The fourth quarter, I kind of look back at the data, tends to be a fairly big quarter. And I wonder, is there something seasonal about the order patterns where you get large project orders in your March quarter that shift during the year? And what's the funnel looking like?\nGregory Rustowicz: Yeah, so I'll take the first part of that, Walt. And so typically, from a seasonal perspective, you're absolutely right. Q4 is our strongest quarter. And to put it into perspective, Q3 is our seasonally weakest quarter with the holiday season. So typically, there's, optimism about the New Year. Our channel, in a lot of cases, has reduced their inventory levels as of the end of the calendar year. They might be year-end reporting companies. And so it's important that they have their balance sheets where they want them. But now they've got to look to the future and look at what is their expected demand and so what inventory do they need. You've got new CapEx budgets that have been approved. And so from a project perspective, we're starting to see activity where orders are going to be coming in related to those projects that we've been working on for quite a while. And so we would expect those same trends to continue in our fiscal fourth quarter this year.\nDavid Wilson: And I'd just add on relative to the funnel. We're encouraged by the funnel at this point. While we saw orders increase in Europe, as I communicated earlier, we're believing that the business resiliency is going to continue there as we've come off a low in our second quarter and have seen orders creep up in Q3. And we expect them to continue to move in the upward direction this quarter. And as I mentioned earlier, we see opportunities for our precision conveyance and lifting businesses that have sustainable trends. And we're supported by a lot of macroeconomic trends. So we feel good about the position that we're in. We, of course, remain cautiously optimistic and we're paying attention to how things are developing. But at this point, we see the trends of positive order development continuing.\nOperator: Our last question will be from Steve Ferazani with Sidoti and Company. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Ferazani: Good morning, David. Greg, appreciate all the color on the call. I just did want to get back into the sales guidance for Q4. When we think about the growth, and I think you indicated maybe not as strong for Montratec in Q4, but if I back out Montratec, it would seem at minimum at the low end of guidance, you're looking at an organic sales decline. Is that accurate year-over-year?\nDavid Wilson: So we do have an organic sales growth, Steve, year-over-year at the midpoint of guide. And I think that we expect that we'll continue to see positive developments throughout the quarter. We do have a shrinking past due backlog, as I mentioned before. And so we've been able to address those backlog challenges that we've had. And what that's done is it's driven backlog down. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that as we work with our customers and get them into a more frequent ordering pattern and we become more competitive with our lead times, we believe that there's opportunities to gain share. And that helps us to drive demand into the business. But that does have a periodic impact on this quarter. But we feel good about the progress we're making in those initiatives. And so that should trend well as we go into the next year.\nGregory Rustowicz: And just to add on, Steve, so at the midpoint, it's kind of mid-single-digit growth for the company.\nStephen Ferazani: When we think about, and I've asked you this in previous quarters, now we've seen four out of five quarters with book-to-bill under one. You're going to lap Montratec in May. How comfortable are you that you can get sales growth post-lapping Montratec, given where you are?\nDavid Wilson: I mean, we certainly feel good about the quarter that we're in. And we'll be coming back in the May timeframe with our guidance for fiscal '25. But we do remain encouraged with the momentum. And our order funnel remains really healthy. We're in active discussions with our customers. I mentioned the channel diversification initiatives, the opportunities to gain share, and the self-help work that we're doing. This isn't all about a growing macro. It's about opportunities for us to compete in the landscape that we compete within and do that effectively. And so we remain optimistic about the future.\nStephen Ferazani: Thanks for that. Last one, just on debt paydowns. I know Q4 is, and you've got sort of guiding for it being the big quarter for cash flow. Any reason you wouldn't ramp up the paydowns?\nDavid Wilson: Which we have, and we will continue to do so, Steve. So we started the year with guidance of $40 million, roughly $10 million a quarter of debt paydown. And we've ramped that up. We're going to be at $55 million for the year with what we expect to do in Q4. And if we can do more than that, we will. But I think what's an interesting fact here is that for the fiscal year, we'll have paid down about half of the purchase price of Montrotech. Right? We paid roughly $110 million for it, and we're going to pay down $55 million of debt. I think that's a very impressive number.\nStephen Ferazani: The 67% of debt's hedged. What does that mean as if we get the rate cuts in 2024? \nDavid Wilson: Yeah. So we'll benefit from the rate cuts for sure, and for a third of our debt. And, as the capital markets improve, there's always opportunities to even do better. And so we'll look to see what we can do there as well.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to David Wilson for closing comments.\nDavid Wilson: Great. Thank you, Rob. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our team is executing and delivered double-digit sales and operating income growth in a dynamic environment. This reflects the significant progress we're making with our transformation and our proven playbook for growth. We're pleased with the momentum that we have entering our fourth quarter, powered by a diversified platform and an improving competitive position. We remain a strong cash generator which enables us to reinvest in our business and de-lever the balance sheet, unlocking further cash flow potential. We're confident in our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth and enhance shareholder value. Thanks for your interest in Columbus McKinnon, and have a great day. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation."

It is now my pleasure to introduce Deborah Pawlowski, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nDeborah Pawlowski: Thank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time today and your interest in Columbus McKinnon.

These statements apply to future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties as well as other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is stated here today. These risks and uncertainties and other factors are provided in the earnings release as well as with other documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can find these documents on our website or at sec.gov.  During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these will be useful in evaluating our performance. However, you should not consider the presentation of this additional information in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have provided reconciliation of non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany today's release and slides.  So with that, please advance to Slide 3, and I will turn the call over to David to begin. David?\nDavid Wilson: Thank you, Deb, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results are a testament to the progress our team is making as an organization as we transform Columbus McKinnon into a higher growth, less cyclical enterprise with stronger earnings power. Together, we took a meaningful step forward in terms of performance in the quarter, establishing several new records.  While we are pleased with the results we are delivering, we are more encouraged with the progress we're making and by the potential of our business as we advance the strategic transformation of Columbus McKinnon. The team remains highly focused on executing our strategic plan and achieving the objectives we have established for the business.  Sales in Q2 were $258 million and at the high end of our guidance. This included $9.5 million for montratec. We are very pleased with the early performance of our montratec acquisition and the broader momentum that we are building within our precision conveyance platform. We also achieved record gross margin in the quarter. Our 38.7% represents a 120 basis point improvement over our previous record, which was established in the first quarter of last year.  Our revenue and gross margin performance in the quarter translated to record operating income and adjusted EBITDA. Our adjusted EBITDA of 17.7% represents a 90 basis point improvement over our previous record, which was established in the same period last year.  We also remain focused on reducing our interest rate exposure and are accelerating debt repayment. Greg will speak to this further, but we have upped our plans to reduce debt by an additional $10 million within the year, bringing our total debt reduction to $50 million in fiscal 2024. Year-to-date, we paid down $25 million, and our net debt leverage ratio now sits at 2.7x, and we see it dropping to approximately 2.3x by the fiscal year-end.  If you'll turn to Slide 4, you'll see the progress we're making toward our gross margin expectations and the effectiveness of the work we're doing within the company to enable stronger earnings power. We believe the performance we achieved in the quarter is underpinned by sustainable improvements and reflects the effectiveness of our strategy as we advance the operating and strategic initiatives referenced on this page.  We remain highly focused on improving our customers' experience, and our progress has been validated by recent improvements in our Net Promoter Score. Being customer-led is a foundational component of the Columbus McKinnon Business System, or CMBS, which is driving continuous improvement, discipline, communication and accountability within our business. 80/20 analysis, decision-making and actions are unlocking further value within our CMBS framework, and we are currently focused on product line simplification.  Beyond optimizing financial performance, this will result in improved product offerings, stronger market positioning and the further simplification of our factory footprint. In the period, we saw improvements in capacity planning, material costs, direct labor productivity, factory overhead rates and pricing. The acquisition of montratec served as a strategic lever for gross margin performance as well and added 70 basis points in the quarter.  We are energized by the momentum we're building within the organization and are highly encouraged with the pipeline of opportunities we are seeing in a variety of end markets. Given our progress, we now expect gross margin to expand approximately 150 basis points year-over-year. This is up from our previous expectation of 50 to 100 basis points of improvement in fiscal '24.  I'll now turn the presentation over to Greg to review our results in greater detail.\nGregory Rustowicz: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. We delivered record sales in the second quarter, up $258.4 million, up 9.1% from the prior year period on a constant currency basis. This was at the high end of the guidance we provided last quarter. In addition, we grew sales sequentially by 10%. On a year-over-year basis, we realized pricing gains of $10.6 million or 4.6%, which was in line with what we were anticipating.  We are quite pleased with the montratec acquisition, which added $9.5 million of sales. Volume increased by $1 million or 0.4%. Foreign currency translation was a benefit this quarter of $5.6 million or 2.4%. Let me provide a little color on sales by region.  For the second quarter, sales grew in the U.S. by 3.9% compared with the prior year. The increase reflected 3.5% of price improvement. montratec added 30 basis points of revenue in the U.S. and sales volume was slightly up 10 basis points. Volume was up in our automation business as it benefited from strong megatrends, but was down in our precision conveyance business due to the timing of projects, which reflects the market slowdown we saw in the second half of last year.  Outside of the U.S., sales increased by 23%. The montratec acquisition added 9.9% of growth. Pricing improved by 6.1% and sales volume increased by 0.9%. In EMEA, our largest region outside of the U.S., we saw volume decline by approximately 2% or $1.1 million. This was largely project related. The pipeline of opportunities remain solid, but we are experiencing delays with quote to orders.  Sales volume increased in APAC by a strong 46%. Keep in mind, however, APAC represents just 6% of total sales. Within APAC, we benefited from strong sales in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, especially in the energy, utility and transportation verticals. Volume declined by approximately 1% in Latin America, and in Canada, which is about 4% of total revenue, we saw volume decline by 24%.  On Slide 6, we recorded record gross margin of 38.7% in the second quarter, which is a 190 basis point increase sequentially. As David pointed out, we are quite pleased with the progression we have made with gross margin expansion and believe we have a path to achieve 40%-plus gross margins by fiscal year '27.  Gross profit increased $13.7 million or 16% versus the prior year. This was driven by several factors, which you can see in the table. The largest items driving gross profit expansion were pricing, net of material manufacturing cost changes, including material inflation, which added $5.7 million; and the montratec acquisition, which contributed $5.5 million to gross profit. montratec was accretive to gross margins by 70 basis points this quarter, with an overall gross margin of 57%.  Let me remind you that our fiscal third quarter is a seasonally softer quarter. With less shipping days, given the holiday season, we would expect approximately 100 basis point reduction in gross margin sequentially from this quarter's gross margin.  Moving to Slide 7. Our SG&A expense was $59.1 million in the quarter or 22.9% of sales. This included $800,000 of pro forma adjustments primarily related to the montratec acquisition, with the remainder related to our headquarters relocation, business realignment costs and a warehouse consolidation. Excluding these pro forma adjustments, our SG&A as a percent of sales was 22.6%.  Sequentially, our SG&A costs were higher by $800,000 as we had a full quarter of montratec costs, which added $2.6 million. We also recorded higher stock compensation costs of $1.3 million. Both items were partially offset by lower montratec acquisition deal and integration costs and headquarters relocation costs compared with the first quarter of fiscal '24.  Compared with the prior year, our SG&A costs were higher by $6.6 million. montratec accounted for $3.3 million of the increase. The remainder of the increase was in G&A, which was elevated by higher incentive compensation and stock compensation expense. We also increased our investment in R&D by $1 million. Helping to offset these expenses were lower business realignment costs of $1.1 million. For the third quarter, we expect our SG&A expense of approximately $58 million.  Turning to Slide 8. We generated record operating income of $33.4 million in the quarter or 12.9% of sales. This represented an increase of $6 million or 22% over last year's second quarter. Adjusted operating income was also a record at $34.1 million or 13.2% of sales. On an adjusted basis, operating income grew $5.5 million or 19%. This record performance demonstrates the success of our strategy and is another proof point in our transformation journey.  As you can see on Slide 9, we recorded GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter of $0.55, up $0.06 versus the prior year. Our tax rate on a GAAP basis was 24%. For the year, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%.  Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.76 was up $0.03 from the prior year as higher adjusted operating income more than offset the negative impact of higher interest expense and the increased tax rate year-over-year. For modeling purposes, interest expense is expected to be about $10 million in the third quarter, down slightly from the $10.2 million we recorded this quarter as interest rates stabilize and we accelerate our debt reduction plans.  On Slide 10, we achieved record adjusted EBITDA margin this quarter of 17.7%, demonstrating the earnings power of the company. The step-change improvement gets us closer to our stated goal of 21% EBITDA margin in fiscal year '27. With this quarter's record performance, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA is now $156.1 million, which represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16%.  We believe that while variable from quarter-to-quarter, our EBITDA margin in Q2 is sustainable given the underlying improvements in the business. Our return on invested capital improved 20 basis points to 6.8% from Q1. Our goal remains to get to a double-digit ROIC over our planning horizon.  Moving to Slide 11. Quarterly free cash flow was $11.7 million in the second quarter. This includes cash provided by operating activities of $16.7 million and CapEx of $5 million. Working capital was a use of cash in the quarter of $12.2 million. We would expect this to improve over the remainder of the year as our working capital levels continue to normalize.  We anticipate that CapEx will range between $30 million to $40 million in fiscal year '24 as we are continuing to make investments in a lower-cost center of excellence to simplify our factory footprint as well as increased capacity, productivity and throughput. For fiscal 2024, we expect free cash flow conversion will range between 90% and 100%.  Turning to Slide 12. Our capital structure is improving as our net debt leverage ratio is now 2.7x on a financial covenant basis, which is down from 2.9x that we reported last quarter. As we have previously discussed, we have a covenant-light credit agreement. With no revolver borrowings outstanding at quarter end, our financial covenant is not tested.  We are also accelerating our debt reduction plans as we paid down $15 million of debt this quarter. We are now planning to pay down $50 million of debt this fiscal year, up from $40 million. We expect our net leverage ratio to improve to approximately 2.3x by the end of this fiscal year. This once again demonstrates our ability to delever quickly after an acquisition.  Please advance to Slide 13, and I will turn it back over to David.\nDavid Wilson: Thanks, Greg. Orders were up 2% year-over-year in the quarter, driven by strength in the Americas. In EMEA, while we began to see signs of moderating demand in Germany, demand in the Middle East remained robust, and the region held up reasonably well despite the broader economic and geopolitical headwinds.  Precision conveyance orders were up 11% in the quarter, and our lifting business was up 7% year-over-year. Overall, short-cycle orders increased a robust 11% compared with last year. Project orders slowed, however, in the quarter, but visibility to project order opportunities improved throughout the quarter.  We remain encouraged by the overall quotation and order pipeline for our business. While we would caution that the first month of a quarter does not necessarily define a trend, we have realized double-digit order growth in the first month of this quarter versus the same period last quarter.  Our backlog remains quite healthy at $318 million. During the quarter, we reduced our past due backlog by 28%, and we're beginning to see backlog normalize as lead times and deliveries improve. Our orders and backlog levels continue to support our revenue expectations for the year.  Please turn to Slide 14, where I will summarize our outlook for the business. Notwithstanding a global backdrop of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty, our outlook for the business remains encouraging as we are benefiting from participation in more secular growth markets and several megatrends, including significant fiscal investments in infrastructure and defense, the near-shoring of manufacturing capacity, automation and the scarcity of labor resources, energy conservation and electrification.  We expect to deliver sales between $245 million and $255 million in Q3 and to surpass $1 billion of revenue for the year. We are also raising our full year gross margin improvement guidance and now expect approximately 150 basis points of improvement in fiscal '24.  As I mentioned earlier, we're gaining traction with our customer experience initiatives, especially in the key areas of on-time delivery, reduced lead times, overall responsiveness and communication. Our montratec acquisition is performing well, and we're encouraged by the robust level of quotation activity in the order pipeline across our precision conveyance platform.  We also continue to deliver organic growth through investments in commercial initiatives, innovation and new product development. On a year-to-date basis, our Vitality Index, or NPD rate, was 3.3% through Q2. We are executing all elements of our strategy, and our second quarter results demonstrate the progress we're making as we advance the transformation of Columbus McKinnon.  With that, Doug, we can open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.\nMatt Summerville: Maybe -- you touched on a couple of end markets, David. Can you maybe talk a little more broadly about some of your other larger end-market verticals like auto, construction, oil and gas, general industrial? And maybe in the context of your project-related comments, where you've seen that order to -- or conversion-to-order momentum start to elongate a bit?\nDavid Wilson: Thanks, Matt. Yes, so we have been encouraged by the activity across end markets in general. And I would say that, notably, aerospace and defense, electric vehicles, food and beverage have been markets that have been pretty robust for us. When you ask about the general industrial markets, they've maintained the momentum, and the Americas has been pretty strong for us overall.  The timing of projects is something that has been a bit lumpy, as you'd expect. And we're really encouraged with the activity we've seen in the pipeline and the quoting and the discussions that we've had. And those opportunities range across attractive end markets like food and beverage, electric vehicle manufacturing, the industrial markets in general.  And I feel like we're pretty well positioned as we're, in this quarter, advancing through October to see a nice uplift in year-over-year order activity based on the performance we saw quarter-over-quarter. Oil and gas is another one that I didn't mention that I think is worth noting. We've had pretty significant investments in both the Middle East as well as in Asia Pacific as it relates to that market specifically.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up. As you, Greg, take leverage down to 2.3x, do you view Columbus McKinnon as sort of being -- not that you're necessarily ever out of it, but maybe more back in the -- in M&A mode as you get into fiscal '25? And then with respect to fiscal '25, what would your thoughts be on incremental price realization?\nGregory Rustowicz: Yes. So thanks, Matt. So as you mentioned, our focus is really on paying down debt this year. And we continue to work an active pipeline because you always have to look at opportunities. But we think with where we sit today, we're on a pretty clear path to delevering to the 2.3x by the end of the fiscal year. And I think once we get into that level, I think we've got more capacity to look for the next potential acquisition that could be accretive and bring synergies to the company.  So our strategy includes M&A as part of our growth to get to the $1.5 billion. And I think we'll be in good shape next year. And -- but once again, a deal has to make sense. And it has to make sense financially, both because, obviously, the incremental costs today for interests are substantially higher than they've been in the past.  And then your second part of the question, with pricing, we would expect pricing next year to moderate somewhat. I think this year, we're just under 5% on a year-to-date basis. And we have seen inflation come down on materials. And as we think about pricing strategies for next year, I think it will be more modest than it has been the last couple of years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Tanwanteng with CJS Securities.\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Very nice quarter. I was wondering, just the incremental gross margin was 60% in the quarter over the last quarter, which is really great. Is that kind of incremental sustainable once you get back to seasonally stronger quarters? Or should we think of like deflation or some of the components you may not be repeating? Any thoughts on how that plays out as we go through the rest of the year?\nDavid Wilson: Yes, John, we feel really good about the sustainable improvements that we've put in place within the business. And we feel like what we're -- the way that we're performing now, but for the seasonal adjustment that Greg spoke of as we head into our Q3, we see the levels that we're performing at now as being sustainable. And clearly, you know what our longer-term goals are, and we intend to keep executing in a way that we expand those margins -- that results in us expanding those margins over time.  But from an operating perspective, we've driven a lot of improvements in the underlying business. We have other levers that we've been speaking to that we continue to exercise and that have more room to advance the business. And as we indicated in our prepared remarks, we are now targeting approximately 150 basis points of expansion in this fiscal year.\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Okay. Great. And then second question, just -- you mentioned that the projects in the pipeline were pretty strong, but we've seen some news, obviously, and the media saying that the EV demand hasn't been quite as strong. There's been pushouts of battery manufacturing facilities.  I know some of your future prospects are tied to that and some of your current businesses. And I'm wondering what you're seeing in the project pipeline, specifically regarding EVs and batteries, and the timing of those projects as you go forward?\nDavid Wilson: Right. Yes, actually, we are pretty encouraged with the volume of activity that we're seeing in that space, both domestically and abroad, as major customers of ours are investing and are engaged with us in pretty active discussions around opportunities that we're expecting will come to fruition here in the near future.\nGregory Rustowicz: And just to add on, John. So it's really dependent on the specific customers. And I think we're linked with 2 of the more substantial larger players in the EV market, both in the U.S. as well as in Germany.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Ferazani with Sidoti & Company.\nStephen Ferazani: Just wanted to get a sense of how much the montratec acquisition is potentially outperforming and how much that led to the more positive view on gross margin improvement this year. Can you guys give us a little bit of sense on the integration of montratec and just what you think for cross-selling opportunities now that you've had a full quarter under the belt?\nGregory Rustowicz: Yes.\nDavid Wilson: Sure. Yes, we feel really good about the opportunities for the montratec business. We've -- the business is performing well, and it's performing to expectations in the quarter. The team has been doing a great job of participating in cross-selling and integration-related activities, both in Europe and in the United States. And our teams in the United States have built up a pipeline of opportunities that they're actively pursuing as we seek to help scale that business over here in the U.S. beyond the penetration that they've had in the past.  And in the quarter, they were a good contributor to the performance. They contributed 70 basis points of margin in the quarter. That was the accretive impact of their gross margin contribution. And in general, we're really pleased with the way that the team is performing and the prospects for the business. So we remain very bullish on that piece of the business.  But I want to emphasize our bullish view on the overall precision conveyance business that we're engaged in more broadly. Obviously, we've seen some sequential declines in sales activity tied to some softness in the market that we saw over the past year and with the challenges we've seen in the e-commerce space with 1 large customer. But we do see a lot of opportunities on the horizon, and our team is very actively engaged in good discussions around the development of that business.\nStephen Ferazani: When I think about precision conveyance becoming a larger part of overall sales, but it sounds like you're still sort of guiding towards traditional fourth -- December quarter seasonality. Any reason to think -- and obviously, we look at the revenue changed last September to December, which was very minimal. Any reason to think that we have -- you're just entering years now where you're just not going to see the same traditional seasonality?\nGregory Rustowicz: Yes. So I think our core lifting business is still 60% of the mix approximately. So I think we will continue to see a seasonal impact on gross margins. I would point out, though, Steve, that last year, we saw a 160 basis point sequential decline. This year, we don't think it's going to be near that level. And that's, I would say, due to the positive impact that our precision conveyance business and the montratec acquisition, in general, will have on our overall gross margins.\nDavid Wilson: Yes. Steve, I would just add that I think your instincts are right as it relates to the mix of business shift and the opportunities we have as we continue to push the business more into that mix of business. We're leaning on a traditional view that the markets and the business has produced a seasonally adjusted result that's been lower in this upcoming quarter. And we anticipate that, that will continue this year. But our goal, over time, is to see that moderate.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Walt Liptak with Seaport Global.\nWalter Liptak: Great quarter. I wanted to ask just sort of a refining question about -- you made some comments about October. And I wonder if you could just go over those again? And how was October for short cycle versus projects?\nDavid Wilson: Yes. Walt, I don't have the short cycle versus project broken out top of mind or in front of me right now. But I know that through the first 4 weeks of October, orders are up double digits over the prior quarter's same period. So we're encouraged.  And we wanted to highlight that, obviously, with the project orders being down in the second quarter. And we are emphasizing that the pipeline is very attractive, and we're working on some exciting opportunities. And in this quarter, we're seeing orders accelerate coming out of last quarter. And so that's the bottom line.\nWalter Liptak: Okay. All right. That sounds great. And then just you mentioned the project orders being a little bit slow. And we can -- I guess, I'll kind of think about what that might be from, but what is it that you think -- why do you think the project orders were down?\nGregory Rustowicz: Yes. I think, Walt, part of it is due to rising interest rates, and companies are looking at their CapEx spend and looking at what it's going to cost to finance some of these projects. And while they're good projects, I think they're being more discerning. And I think also as we approach the end of the calendar year, there's a lot of companies that have budgets that are being used up or maybe they've reduced what their original budgets were for CapEx.  And we'd see that typically with a little bit weaker December. And so I would expect that will -- some of these projects will get let loose, if not in our fiscal third quarter, certainly, in our fiscal fourth quarter.\nDavid Wilson: Yes. and I also think that it's the nature of -- the lumpy nature of project activity. We did see the orders down 9% year-over-year in project-based business. Short-cycle business was steady and up 11%, and the pipeline of opportunities is even more encouraging than it has been.  And so it's a matter of where those projects phase and our customers' schedules and our ability to adapt and do what we can to best service them. But we're not concerned about the order rates that came through in the second quarter from a project standpoint. We're encouraged about the activity we're pursuing and the prospects for the business more broadly.\nWalter Liptak: Okay. All right. Great. And then maybe a last one for me. It was nice hearing the 80/20 is going well, and you guys are working on PLS. And I guess, in one of the prior questions, you touched on this, too. But are there any other 80/20 efforts that you guys are going after?\nDavid Wilson: Yes. For sure, Walt. Our product line and P&L segmentation work and the opportunities we have from a cost perspective as it relates to certain lines of business and a rationalization perspective as well as the factory footprint simplification opportunities coming from the CapEx investments we're making to increase capacity in key areas and develop this center of excellence that Greg has been speaking of.  And so I feel like we're in a good position to really advance the business from a performance perspective, leveraging 80/20 through those tools. And we're excited about the work that we're doing and the work that's yet to be done that will lead us to a higher-performing enterprise.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from the line of John Tanwanteng with CJS Securities.\nJonathan Tanwanteng: I think you touched on this, but I just want to -- I wondered if there's a little more clarity or color on the e-commerce business and that large customer you had there, just the split between the pipeline for those 2.\nDavid Wilson: Yes, sure. So what I would say, John, is that we have taken the opportunity with the slowdown in business in that area to do a lot of business development work with a broader base of customers. And we've been able to gain access to a number of new and attractive customers where we are growing.  We've also maintained very close connectivity with that specific customer we've mentioned in the past, and we're in great discussions regarding the development of new opportunities with them with their R&D teams. And we're encouraged by some promising prospects and potentially near-term opportunity associated with that pipeline.\nJonathan Tanwanteng: Okay. Great. And then finally, just to be clear, at a high level and from what you're seeing in October order rates and what you're seeing in your project pipeline, it doesn't seem like demand has weakened outside of your normal seasonality. Is that fair to say?\nDavid Wilson: I think that's generally fair to say. As we alluded to in the prepared remarks, there's been some softness in Germany. But that is not something that has been dramatic, and it's something that we've been working to offset with opportunities we're pursuing more broadly. And so the short answer to the question is no, we're not overly concerned about that.\nOperator: There are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to hand the call back to Mr. Wilson for closing remarks.\nDavid Wilson: Great. Thank you, Doug, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We took a meaningful step forward this quarter and established several new performance records. This is a testament to the great work being done by our global associates across Columbus McKinnon, and I thank you all.  We are pleased with our results to date and are more encouraged with the progress we're making as a team and the potential we have as a business. We're growing in attractive markets, building a higher-margin profile, generating cash and accelerating debt repayment. We now expect to exit the fiscal year with a net debt leverage ratio of approximately 2.3x. Our team remains highly focused on executing our strategy and achieving our strategic plan objectives.  Thank you for your attention, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Deborah Pawlowski, Head of Investor Relations for Columbus McKinnon. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nDeborah Pawlowski: Thank you, Keith, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate your time today and your interest in Columbus McKinnon. Joining me here for our financial results conference call are David Wilson, President and CEO; and Greg Rustowicz, Chief Financial Officer. You should have a copy of the first quarter fiscal 2024 financial results, which we released earlier this morning. We have slides as well that will accompany our conversation today. Both the slides and release are available on our website at investors.cmco.com. David and Greg are going to provide their formal remarks. After which we will open the line for questions. But right now if you will just turn to Slide 2 in the deck, I will review the Safe Harbor statement. You should be aware that we may make some forward-looking statements during the formal discussion, as well as during the Q&A session. These statements apply to future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties, as well as other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from what is stated here today. These risks and uncertainties and other factors are provided in the earnings release, as well as with other documents filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You can find these documents on our website or at sec.gov. During today's call, we will also discuss some non-GAAP financial measures. We believe these will be useful in evaluating our performance. However, you should not consider the presentation of this additional information -- isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures with comparable GAAP measures in the tables that accompany today's release and slides. So, with that, please advance to Slide 3 and I will turn the call over to David to begin. David?\nDavid Wilson: Thanks, Deb, and good morning, everyone. We started fiscal 2024 off on a strong note. Sales increased 7% with organic growth of nearly 6% and at the upper end of our expected low to mid-single-digit growth rate for the year. Montratec, the latest addition to our precision conveyance platform, contributed $2.7 million in the quarter for the one month that we own them. We are really thrilled to have them as part of this important platform for Columbus McKinnon. They bring highly advanced automation technology with modular asynchronous transport systems that we expect to serve as a growth accelerator for this business. Gross margin expanded 100 basis points sequentially to 36.9% on an adjusted basis. This is in line with our plan to expand gross margin by 50 to 100 basis points for the year and we will discuss this further on the next slide. We recorded another strong bookings quarter with orders up 5% sequentially, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 times and our precision conveyance platform achieved 28% sequential order growth in the period. The customer experience is central to all that we are doing and we are making important strides in this area and there is more opportunity ahead. We believe improvements here will lead to more business earned and market share gains. In addition, our transformation efforts have provided Columbus McKinnon with a greater opportunity set in vertical markets that are less cyclical and benefit from favorable megatrends. A significant tailwind impacting current demand is the investment that is underway in factory automation across several verticals. In fact, manufacturing capacity capital spending in the US is at an all-time high which is amplified by investments being made to support re-shoring efforts. Intelligent and automated material handling solutions are at the heart of factory automation where Columbus McKinnon solutions are being applied to address global labor shortages and productivity improvements. We successfully refinanced our debt in the quarter. Greg will cover this in more detail but the end result was a reduction in the cost of debt and the elimination of financial covenant testing. We expect to be under 2.5 times with our net leverage ratio by the end of the fiscal year. Shifting to Slide 4. I'd like to keep in front of all of us the progress that we're making and more importantly, the ground we have yet to cover with respect to gross margin expansion. Our start to fiscal 2024 is in line with our expectations to deliver 50 to 100 basis points of improvement in gross margin for the year. This performance is consistent with our expectation to deliver 21% EBITDA margin in fiscal 2027. Our plan for the remainder of the year includes additional progress with 80/20 initiatives focused on product line, process, and factory simplification. We're also advancing our transformation to a higher-margin business. Our precision conveyance platform commands higher margins and in fact, montratec, our most recent addition, has annualized gross margins approximating 50%. With that, let me turn the call over to Greg to cover the details of our financial results.\nGregory Rustowicz: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. We delivered sales in the first quarter of $235.5 million, up 6.7% from the prior year on a constant currency basis, which was within the guidance we provided last quarter. The sequential decline in sales in Q1 is consistent with what we expect after our seasonally strongest quarter. Looking at our sales bridge, we realized pricing gains of $8.5 million or 3.9%, which was in line with what we were anticipating. Volume increased by $3.7 million or 1.7%. The montratec acquisition had a $2.7 million of revenue for the month of June, which represented one month of ownership. Foreign currency translation was a small benefit this quarter. Let me provide a little color on sales by region. For the first quarter, we saw sales decline in the US of 1.9% compared with the prior year. While pricing was up 5.1%, sales volume was down 7.1%. This was due to weaker volumes in our precision conveyance business due to the canceled orders with a large e-commerce customer we discussed last quarter, as well as the phasing of our backlog. Outside of the US, pricing improved by 1.7% and sales volume increased a strong 16.5%. In addition, the montratec acquisition added 3.2% of growth outside the US. We saw volume increases in all regions. We recorded volume gains of approximately 7% in Latin America, 12% in EMEA, 24% in Canada, and 47% in Asia Pacific. EMEA, our largest region benefited from volume gains in our Lifting Solutions business as productivity continues to advance in our largest global manufacturing plant in Germany which implemented a new ERP system last year. Within APAC, we benefited from strong sales in several verticals, including general manufacturing, construction and infrastructure, utilities and transportation. On Slide 6, we expanded gross margin sequentially by 90 basis points to 36.8%. On an adjusted basis, gross margin was sequentially higher by 100 basis points. Last year's first quarter benefited from a one-time inventory revaluation, which was part of the German ERP implementation. That added approximately $2 million to gross profit in the prior year or about 100 basis points. Normalized for this one-time inventory revaluation, adjusted gross margins year-over-year would have expanded about 40 basis points. Let me also remind you that the second quarter last year also benefited from this inventory revaluation by about 50 basis points. First quarter gross profit increased $4.1 million versus the prior year, driven by several factors which you can see in the table. Pricing, net of material inflation added $6.5 million of gross profit. We are seeing material inflation decelerate from last year, which is a good trend as we progress into the second quarter. The montratec acquisition contributed $800,000 to gross profit. We had conformed their financials to US GAAP, and we expect that for the full year, the business will generate gross margins of approximately 50%. The business is largely project-based which can be lumpy, and we will see some variability in margins quarter-to-quarter. June's margin of 30% was not typical and was impacted by disruptions that occur in the first month of an acquisition. Offsetting these items was an unfavorable sales mix which reduced gross profit by $1.1 million as well as unfavorable productivity and other cost changes of $2 million. With our sequential gross margin performance and expected margin contribution for montratec, we believe we are on track to expand gross margins this year by 50 to 100 basis points. Moving to Slide 7, our SG&A expense was $58.3 million in the quarter or 24.8% of sales. This included $4.1 million of pro forma adjustments for the acquisition, headquarters relocation, a warehouse consolidation and business realignment costs. Excluding these pro forma adjustments, our SG&A as a percent of sales was 23%. Results also include $800,000 of our SG&A costs for montratec. Compared with the prior year, our SG&A costs were higher by $5.1 million. Most of the increase was in G&A, which was elevated by the pro forma items and higher stock compensation expense. Helping to offset these expenses was a reduction in selling expenses. This was driven by our restructuring efforts as we lowered our selling costs by 5% even with a 7% increase in revenue. We also increased our investment in R&D by $800,000. For the second quarter, we expect our SG&A expense to be comparable for this quarter at approximately $58 million. Turning to Slide 8, we generated operating income of $21.4 million in the quarter or 9.1% of sales, compared with the prior year GAAP operating income was impacted by net non-operating adjustments of $2.6 million as outlined on this slide. Adjusted operating income was $25.8 million or 10.9% of sales. On an adjusted basis, operating income grew $1.2 million or 5%. As you can see on Slide 9, we recorded GAAP earnings per diluted share for the quarter of $0.32, up $0.03 versus the prior year. Our tax rate on a GAAP basis was 27%. Our tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a small discrete item for equity compensation that affected the tax rate by 2 percentage points this quarter. For the year, we expect our tax rate to be between 24% and 26%. Adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.62 was down $0.07 from the prior year due to higher interest expense and the increased tax rate. As we increase volume and execute on our 80/20 initiatives, the result in operating leverage is expected to offset these headwinds. For modeling purposes, even though we are 65% hedged to interest rate exposure, interest expense is expected to increase $10 million in the second quarter with the incremental interest expense from the montratec acquisition. On Slide 10, our trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA was $149.4 million, which resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.7%. Our return on invested capital at the end of Q1 was 6.6%. ROIC for all periods shown, reflects the impact to after-tax earnings of and an increase in our effective tax rate from 22% to 25%. We expect to achieve double-digit ROIC over time as we transform the business and execute an 80/20 initiatives. Moving to Slide 11, quarterly free cash flow was negative $22.5 million. This includes cash consumed from operating activities of $17.2 million, CapEx of $5.3 million. First quarter cash generation was affected by increases in working capital, namely higher accounts receivable related to the timing of shipments at the end of the quarter and an increase in inventory levels to support our strong order growth and resulting in a record backlog. We anticipate that CapEx will range between $30 million to $40 million in fiscal year 2024 as we are making investments in a lower-cost center of excellence to simplify our factory footprint as well as increased capacity productivity improvements. For fiscal 2024, we expect free cash flow conversion will range between 90% and 100%. Turning to Slide 12, we completed our financing activities that we discussed on the May earnings call. We increased our term loan B by $75 million and added an accounts receivable securitization program from which we borrowed $45 million. Proceeds were used to fully pay off the revolver used to fund the montratec acquisition. With no revolver borrowings at quarter end and our covenant light credit agreement, our financial covenant is not tested. We also executed another interest rate swap and are now 65% hedged at a swap rate of approximately 2.8% against three months SOFR, as we move towards the upper end of our policy range to take advantage of the inverted yield curve. Our net debt leverage ratio was 2.9 times on our financial covenant basis. We paid down $10 million of debt in the quarter and expect to pay down a total of $40 million of debt in fiscal 2024. We expect our net leverage ratio to drop to less than 2.5 times by the end of fiscal 2024. Please advance to Slide 13 and I will turn it back over to David.\nDavid Wilson: Thanks, Greg. As I mentioned earlier, our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 1.1 times and was driven by strong sequential order demand in North America. Industrial automation wins are coming in across several verticals where our intelligent motion solutions for material handling are enabling benefits in a variety of industries, from food inspection technology to metals and grain processing, printing, packages, handling, automotive assembly, battery production, even rail system upgrades. Our aerospace and defense markets are also quite busy. Our team remains highly encouraged by the quality of our pipeline and the potential for further growth within our business. In the quarter, we grew orders 5% sequentially, a notable difference from the seasonal slowdown of the business historically experienced when transitioning from Q4 to Q1. Precision conveyance orders excluding montratec grew 28% sequentially. Year-over-year, orders were down modestly as last year's Q1 benefited from increased distributor demand in advance of a significant pre-announced price increase last June. Orders excluding montratec over the last six months were in excess of $500 million and are aligned with our plan to achieve revenue of over $1 billion this year. Backlog achieved a new record at $355 million including the benefit of $23 million contributed for montratec. Our short-term backlog was up nearly 7% sequentially and provides approximately 70% coverage for our expected sales in the second quarter. Long-term backlog, which is more indicative of major projects improved 25% sequentially driven by the montratec additions and new project orders. We had mentioned previously that while our pipeline remains strong, decisions to release projects has slowed. Over the quarter, we saw improvements in customer confidence and this is beginning to show in our long-term backlog expansion. Please turn to Slide 14 and we will discuss our outlook for the second quarter. We are expecting between $250 million and $260 million in revenue for the second quarter including montratec's contribution. This represents approximately 10% growth year-over-year at the midpoint of this guidance. As Greg indicated, the montratec business can be lumpy, given the project nature of the business, and as such, quarter-to-quarter results can vary. We expect that the December quarter will likely be montratec's strongest in the year, given our current visibility to customer delivery requirements. Along with customer experience, our 80/20 initiatives are front and center. We're making great headway with product line simplification for both our electric chain and wire rope hoist. This effort is not only simplifying the portfolio, our supply chain and our manufacturing processes, it will expand our SAM for both products, because we are simultaneously solving for better-suited solutions at the right prices for both the mid-tier and premium markets. We expect the new lines to launch in the latter half of fiscal 2025 with additional phases for the wire rope hoist portfolio to follow. We continue to invest in new product development, including enhancements to targeted offerings that better serve our customers and provide improved market positioning. Fiscal 2024 remains all about execution and the progress we expect to make with our transformation strategy. We are encouraged by the runway that exists for continued 80/20 improvement and we're thrilled with the addition of montratec to our growing precision conveying platform. We will remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2027 strategic objectives and we expect to demonstrate steady progress along that path this year. Keith, we can now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Good morning.\nDavid Wilson: Hi, Matt.\nMatt Summerville: A couple of questions. First, you mentioned on the slide, you had some productivity cost changes. There were $2 million hit to gross profit. Can you maybe expand on that and put some context around why year-on-year operating leverage was pretty weak in the quarter and how we should be thinking about operating leverage going forward?\nGregory Rustowicz: Yes. So the adjustment was related to when we implemented the SAP system in our German facility in Kunzelsau. We moved from a weighted average costing basis to a standard costing basis. So that changed how costs were characterized. And so that resulted in a $2 million positive impact in the quarter a year ago. And that was essentially 100 basis point tailwind last year. In terms of operating leverage, we acknowledge that it was weaker than we would typically see. We expect our operating leverage to be in the 40% range, overall. And we had a bit of a weaker mix this quarter and we would expect that on a go-forward basis. And when you look at it over the course of the entire year, we would be in that 35% to 40%, so.\nDavid Wilson: And that's on an incremental basis.\nGregory Rustowicz: Yes.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. And then, can you maybe talk about -- I mean, you mentioned healthy quote activity. Can you put a little bit more color around that, maybe touch on a little bit more. And you mentioned a few, but a little bit more end market specificity. And would you say quoting now is at a record level. I guess, how would you describe kind of the go forward outlook in that regard?\nDavid Wilson: Yes. Volumes remain robust and -- co-volumes. On the shorter cycle quotation activity, I'd say the size of the quotes is a little bit smaller than we typically see. But on the larger projects, which remain incredibly robust, we are seeing very active demand and an increasing, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, an increasing level of confidence in customers as it compares to where that confidence was when we entered the year. And so larger customers, larger orders are moving forward with I guess, at more predictable level of progress and we're seeing demand across some really attractive verticals. So EV remains robust. E-commerce remains robust or is improving and robustness, I'd say. The activity associated with Life Sciences has been really positive. We're seeing a steady level of demand on the defense front, as I mentioned, and then in general, the automation demand, we think driven by the macro trends around labor shortages and increased capacity expansion in the US, is really driving very high levels of demand for automated solutions for material handling. And so, we're pretty bullish on the way the larger order activity is moving forward. And I think there is a close side that we're keeping to the short cycle demand particularly as it relates to Germany and what they are forecasting for the second half of the year.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.\nDavid Wilson: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities.\nLee Jagoda: Hi, it's actually Lee Jagoda for Jon this morning. Good morning.\nDavid Wilson: Good morning.\nLee Jagoda: So I guess you commented a little bit earlier on input pricing and supply chain. Could you talk a little more about that and maybe how that should translate into margins for both products currently in your backlog, and then your new order quoting activity?\nDavid Wilson: Just to confirm, Lee, you are talking about the input pricing, our cost basis for supply chain.\nLee Jagoda: Yes. Exactly. Yes.\nDavid Wilson: Okay. Yes, I mean, we are seeing some improvements in freight costs, logistics costs. We're seeing metals prices improve and as we look at the way that our forecasted gross margin expansion profile is modeled for the balance of the year, we feel comfortable with what we've guided to which is the 50 to 100 basis points of gross margin expansion, as it relates to that input cost position. Greg, I'm not sure if there's something you add to that.\nGregory Rustowicz: Yes. So, we ended up with pricing overall that was up $8.5 million, which more than offset $2 million of material inflation. So material inflation is decelerating from last year. If you annualize the $2 million, it would be about $8 million. And so we're confident that pricing, net of material inflation will continue to be a positive for the company and it will be accretive to our overall margins.\nLee Jagoda: Great. And then on montratec, it sounds like the early integrations are going pretty well. Can you talk about, I guess, more globally the major growth markets that should drive growth in sales for montratec for couple of years. And in particular, how big an opportunity is or things like [Technical Difficulty] onshoring coming to the US.\nDavid Wilson: Sure. Yes. So we feel really good about the business. Over the last couple of years, they really diversified their end market participation from primarily automotive to now include pharmaceuticals and life sciences, healthcare, the semiconductor space, electronics manufacturing, and we continue to see increasing demand across the majority of those markets. There is a heavy level of opportunity relating to electric vehicle and battery production. That is a wave of activity that's currently underway. We do believe that with their cleanroom certifications and increased capacity improvements on their shuttles, that we can see growth in a broader array of markets including the semiconductor space in the US. And so integration activities are well underway. Several meetings have taken place both in Germany and in the US with their teams and our teams to work the commercial and technology fronts. And we feel really, really good about that business and its potential for growth as we go forward.\nGregory Rustowicz: Yeah. And Lee, just to add on. We expect this business to double within three years. Today they have about 20% of their business in the US, 20% in Asia. They don't have a very strong presence from a people perspective in either of those two locations. So we think that probably half of the growth over the next three years is going to be in the US as we leverage our sales team and our precision conveyance platform that we have here and we also think there's an opportunity in Asia as well where we have a significant presence.\nDavid Wilson: Does that help, Lee?\nLee Jagoda: Yes, it does. I was on mute trying to ask another question actually. So, I'm sorry. No, so, knowing that those are mostly capital equipment sales, when those -- once those systems get installed, how should we think about the recurring sales and service in montratec versus your -- rest of your core business?\nDavid Wilson: Yes. Their recurring revenue and aftermarket sales today are above the average for our broader business. And so today they are in the 20% range and that's something that we anticipate should expand as their installed base grows and customers continue to see the benefits of adding and expanding on those initial installations.\nLee Jagoda: Great, very helpful. I'll hop back in queue. Thank you.\nDavid Wilson: Thanks, Lee.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question comes from Steve Ferazani with Sidoti.\nSteve Ferazani: Good morning, David, Greg, thanks for the color on the call. Just wanted to get a sense of your confidence level on that gross margin improvement target. I'm just thinking about, I know you reported pretty strong sequential improvement in conveyance systems orders. But in general you had -- you've highlighted the weakness from that one big e-commerce provider. I guess one, your confidence level in meeting that target and then two, two pieces to that, is that more pricing? Is it mix, because we would think as conveyance systems grows faster, that contributes. If you can just sort of walk through the pieces to that.\nDavid Wilson: Right. Yes. Steve, we touched on a lot of the major components. And we are very confident in our ability to deliver the 50 to 100 basis points this year and we're obviously working on achieving a target that goes well beyond that as we progress through the balance of our strategic execution phase and remain very confident in that outcome as well. The benefits we expect to see this year are tied to productivity improvements in our business and improved execution that will drive expanded margins. We certainly expect there to be a level of price improvement, net of inflation, as Greg mentioned. And as we do sell more of our precision conveyance products and our efforts there to expand the mix of business in that particular segment, progress we do anticipate that there will be benefits coming from that. And so it's an aggregation of those items that we see as contributing to the benefit this year and continuing to contribute to the expansion that we're seeking over the strategic planning horizon.\nGregory Rustowicz: Yes. And we were really pleased with the fact that our margins expanded 100 basis points sequentially because our fourth quarter is normally a strongest quarter from the seasonal perspective and we think with the operating leverage in the business, the fact that our largest facility in Germany continues to make progress from a productivity perspective, that -- we will continue to see gross margin uptick as we go through the year and we feel really good about the 50 to 100 basis point expansion.\nSteve Ferazani: Perfect. And if you could just, Greg, you mentioned that there was some timing issues related to the significantly higher receivables this quarter which looks like that had the biggest impact on your cash flow. But did I hear -- it sounded like you offered pretty significant guidance for cash flow conversion. If you could just touch on those two points.\nGregory Rustowicz: Yeah. So you're absolutely right. So We had a very strong month of June, sales perspective and with our typical terms, June sales are not collectible, the 30-day terms. And so...\nDavid Wilson: In Q2.\nGregory Rustowicz: June sales are not collectible in Q1 but they are collectible in Q2. Thanks for clarifying. And we also have record or close to record backlog and -- or I guess record backlog of montratec, so we added some inventory to the system as well. And we would expect that inventory to start to flush through especially with the guidance that David gave on revenue for our Q2. So for the year and it's not unusual for our first quarter to have negative free cash flow we saw last year. And so, we ended the year very strong. Last year I think it was 147% free cash flow conversion. And so this year, we think it's going to be more like in the 90% to 100% range, but our CapEx guidance is $35 million to $40 million, which is substantially higher than a year ago and that's because of the investments we're making in our manufacturing facilities that will have big benefits to us down the road from a cost perspective and our productivity perspective.\nSteve Ferazani: Great. So that still means pretty, based on your guidance, pretty good cash flow, but you're guiding for $40 million in debt repayments. Any chance you escalate that? Or are there other uses of cash you're thinking about?\nGregory Rustowicz: Yeah. No. So we ended up the quarter -- we ended the quarter at cash of, I want to say it was a $106 million and we had -- of that, we had about $15 million that was sitting in the US. So one of the things we're going to look at is seeing what levers we have to pull cash back into the US because that's where we need it to in order to pay down on our external debt. And I think we will -- to the extent, we're able to pull some levers in a tax-efficient basis, we'll use that excess cash to further pay down debt, especially with interest rates. our marginal interest rate today is over 8.25%, I think it's like a 8.36%. So that's a pretty good return relative to what we're earning with having cash in bank accounts around the world.\nSteve Ferazani: Perfect. Thanks, David. Thanks, Greg.\nGregory Rustowicz: Thanks, Steve.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Research.\nWalter Liptak: Hi, thanks, good morning, guys. Just maybe a follow on that last one. It sounds like some of that cash repatriation, the timing maybe there, but be more visibility. Is that something that you're expecting shortly here in the next quarter or so?\nGregory Rustowicz: Yes. Walt, I would expect us to -- yes, we are actively working on. That's a key project for us and to the extent, we can pull cash back and have excess cash in the US. We will absolutely use it to pay down that we get an opportunity essentially once a quarter to pay down debt and that's at the end of the quarter. So it's not going to impact interest expense this quarter, but it will help us in the future quarters. This quarter's interest expense at $10 million is pretty well locked in.\nWalter Liptak: Okay. Got it. Okay, all right. Thanks. And a lot of my questions were already asked, but I think -- okay, there -- but, I wonder if you could just refresh us on the distribution channel and how much of your sales go through distribution and what you're hearing from the channel and what they're doing with their inventory levels?\nDavid Wilson: Sure. Yes, thanks. Thanks, Walt. So roughly 50% of our business moves through distribution on aggregate basis and the inventory in the channel has not been at elevated levels, simply given the demand that we've had and some of the excess backlog that we've been carrying as it relates to that demand. And so we're not at a position where we're feeling that the channel is heavily loaded. And I think that our channel partners are being responsible as it relates to potential slowdowns in short-cycle demand that could be tied to any slowdown in the economy. So I think our relationship there is very healthy and we're working closely with our channel partners, as it relates to real current demand, but there's not a lot of excess inventory in the channel. And what I would say is that the demand that our channel partners are seeing is robust. Quotation activity is high. The size, the average size of our book-to-bill quotes has been down and the conversion cycle on some of those book-to-bill quotes has been longer as I think partners are being prudent as it relates to the timing of -- and the need for that demand. I think that's also tied to lead times on related equipment. So when you think about the delivery of automation solutions from other providers in this space, that might tie into our systems, the delivery of robotic equipment that may interface with our systems. If you're waiting for receipts on some of that equipment in our lead times fall within the delivery times of those elements, you might be ordering the more standard or book-to-bill elements -- book-to-ship elements, excuse me, that are within that cycle a little bit later than you would typically order them, so you get that quoted and then that quote might not convert as readily as they may typically convert in a period where there is a long-dated lead times for some of those other elements.\nWalter Liptak: Okay, great. Okay. It's good to hear the increased quotes and the confidence level among your customers. I wonder, you mentioned that June, I think ended a little bit on a strong note when you were talking about accounts receivable. How was July looking? Was the tone of business still good in July?\nDavid Wilson: Yes, so on the execution front, obviously, we're executing from an elevated backlog position and very focused on achieving the growth rates that we've targeted for the quarter, which on an aggregate basis, are healthy as you look at year-over-year performance at the midpoint of our guidance range. As it relates to order demand, July typically would start out a little softer given the holiday period in the US and the beginning of a holiday period in Europe. And so I'd say, demand profiles remain in line with where we would typically expect to see them and the discussion around quotation activity, particularly for larger project activity is very healthy and robust across the verticals that we serve.\nWalter Liptak: Okay, great. Okay, thanks for that color.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is a follow-up from Matt Summerville with D.A. Davidson.\nMatt Summerville: Thanks. Just a quick one. With respect to some comments you made in the prepared remarks, you mentioned the e-commerce cancellation. Does that order actually get de-booked? And then you also mentioned backlog phasing in the US. Maybe put a finer point on that, because I guess I was a little surprised to see volume down 7%, I think you mentioned.\nGregory Rustowicz: Yes, on the US side. So we talked about it in the May call, Matt, that as of March 31st, we had removed the significant orders that we had from that large e-commerce customer and we took it out of backlog, because the orders were received in fiscal year 2022 and we also -- we talked about the fact that we received $7.6 million of cash, which is sitting in a customer deposit, which will be either used as they buy additional product or if they don't. At the end of the agreement that gets recognized as revenue. And so the second part of your question -- second part of the question. I'll take. It was related to the phasing of revenue in the preceding conveyance business or in the US as it related to the volume decrease in the quarter. And that was basically the timing of project orders, Matt. As you think about some of the lumpiness associated with the phasing of order activity and how that translates into -- then into revenue in our business, we had a period in the first quarter where in the US, precision conveyance business, we did not have as much revenue as we anticipated we're going to have as we go forward. Clearly, you saw order bookings in the period were up 28% for our precision conveyance business in the quarter. And so that will phase into future order booking or quarter revenue, but in the period, we had a bit of a phasing issue just related to the timing of prior orders and how they phase in revenue.\nMatt Summerville: Got it. That's all from me. Thank you.\nGregory Rustowicz: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to return the floor to management for any closing comments.\nDavid Wilson: Great. Thank you, Keith. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. We had a solid start to the year in Q1 and we are making excellent headway with our 80/20 initiatives. We added yet another terrific business to our precision conveyance platform in the quarter as well. We remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2027 strategic objectives and we're solidly on the way to becoming a top-tier industrial technology performer. We appreciate your interest in Columbus McKinnon and wish you a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect your lines."
