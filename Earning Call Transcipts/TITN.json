I will now turn the conference over to your host, Jeff Sonnek from IR. You may begin.\nJeff Sonnek: Thank you and welcome to Titan Machinery’s fourth quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call today. We have from the company Bryan Knutson, President and Chief Executive Officer and Bo Larsen, Chief Financial Officer. By now, everyone should have access to the earnings release for the fiscal fourth quarter ended January 31, 2024. If you have not received the release, it’s available on the IR tab of Titan’s website at ir.titanmachinery.com. This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on the company’s website as well. Additionally, we are providing a presentation to accompany today’s prepared remarks which can be found also on the same website, ir.titanmachinery.com. The presentation is located directly below the webcast information in the middle of the page. We’d like to remind everyone that the prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements and management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions. The statements do not guarantee future performance and therefore, undue reliance should be placed upon them. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations of management and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the risk factors section of Titan’s most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K. These risk factors contain a more detailed discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Except as maybe required by applicable law, Titan assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that maybe made in today’s release or call. Please note that during today’s call, we may discuss non-GAAP financial measures including results on an adjusted basis. We believe these adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into Titan’s ongoing financial performance, particularly when comparing underlying results from period to period. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures in today’s release. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks, we will open the call to take your questions. And now, I’d like to introduce the company’s President and CEO, Mr. Bryan Knutson. Bryan, please go ahead.\nBryan Knutson: Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. I want to begin today’s call by providing some historical context, which will help put our recent earnings performance into perspective, then I will offer some thoughts on our fiscal 2025 outlook that we are providing today and finish with a summary of our segment performance before passing the call to Bo for his financial review and incremental thoughts on our modeling assumptions. We finished fiscal year 2024 with a strong performance that was driven by growth across all of our legacy operating segments and resulted in record revenue of $2.8 billion and record earnings per share of $4.93. This marked the third consecutive year of achieving record earnings per share while achieving a pre-tax margin of greater than 5%. Our business remains in a position of strength and we expect to demonstrate the durability of our earnings through this cycle following a multiyear effort to implement greater efficiency across our organization. Moreover, this is exactly the level of execution that we outlined at our 2017 Investor Day. I’d remind everyone that back then we were working hard on expense and inventory optimization as a means to driving higher levels of profitability through the cycle. At that meeting, we also outlined a path to $2 earnings per share. Conceptually, we wanted to ensure we made the adjustments necessary to drive an acceleration in operating leverage, so that we were in a strong position once the next cycle arrived. Our business today is nearly twice as large as those projections from 2017 in terms of revenue and I am proud to say our earnings power of nearly $5 per share is higher by 2.5x. Those principles remain in place today that is positioning the business to drive greater and more sustainable levels of profitability in all demand environments, which leads me to some brief commentary on our outlook for fiscal 2025 that we are introducing today. First of all, I’d like to highlight a few key differences between this cycle and the last one for both Titan and the industry in general and why both are in a healthier position today than the previous cycle. First, for the industry as a whole, as has been well documented, supply chain constraints significantly limited OEM production volumes, restricting the amount of new equipment that was going into the market over the past few years. Because of this, fleet age for categories such as high horsepower tractors are still above long-term averages. There has been less short-term leasing activity further limiting the amount of late mile used equipment for sale. Farmers have had three highly profitable years to bolster their balance sheets and advancements in precision ag technology continued to drive productivity gains, providing ROI and new equipment and aftermarket upgrades. For Titan specifically, as the industry continues to consolidate with larger, higher horsepower, and more technologically advanced equipment, we optimized our footprint and removed costs from the business through these restructuring efforts during the last cycle. We doubled down on our customer care strategy driving more sustainable growth in our parts and service business. And we bolstered our professional back office team who focus on managing inventory levels and use trading valuations. While all of these factors I just mentioned put us in a healthier spot today than we were a decade ago, net farm income is expected to be at or possibly below the 20-year average in calendar year 2024. And interest rates don’t appear to be dropping as fast as our customers would like to see. General consensus by industry participants is that ag volumes will be around mid-cycle levels this year. As such, we don’t expect to repeat the success we enjoyed over the past two fiscal years, but we remain in a strong position heading into our current fiscal 2025. We believe this year will prove to be best described as year of transition. We have rapidly moved out of a period characterized by restricted supply and high demand to one that reflects ample to even excess supply and mid-cycle demand. We continue to have good visibility into demand for the first half of the fiscal year given healthy backlog and pre-sale activity. However, the supply chain has caught up quickly in recent months and OEM lead times have normalized whereas they had extended out 12 to 18 months not that long ago. In a broader sense, this normalized supply environment is a welcome change after years of excessive delays and the additional uncertainty with allocations. This allows us to significantly improve our in-stock levels of high horsepower equipment, self-propelled sprayers and wheel loaders across our footprint. But the pace of the improved supply creates challenges in the near-term as we will be working through a rapid influx of equipment deliveries, which will be visible in our new and used inventory balances throughout this fiscal year. As we meet demand from our existing backlog, those new unit sales to customers also generate trade-ins of used equipment. The guidance we are providing today reflects anticipated margin compression in part so that we can manage inventory levels through this transitional period. Our team will proactively manage through these factors in order to drive strong financial results and position us to maintain the higher levels of pre-tax margin that we have worked so hard to produce. Bo will provide some additional depth on the assumptions that underpin our modeling guidance for fiscal 2025. But before I pass the call to him, I want to briefly walk through our customary update on each of our reporting segments starting with domestic agriculture. We had a great finish to the year growing segment same-store revenue by 36% in the fourth quarter. This was largely a function of the team’s strong execution on improving the pace of customer deliveries, following a concerted effort to complete pre-delivery inspections on new machinery. As we have discussed during the past several quarters, balancing the limitations of our service capacity between our ongoing needs of customers with incremental demands for pre-delivery inspections has been a challenge. So with that in mind, in addition to the strong equipment deliveries, I am particularly pleased with our ability to continue to advance our customer care strategy and drive a double-digit same-store sales increase in our reoccurring parts and service business. Investing in people and CapEx to increase our service network capacity remains a key priority for our organization. As such, we will continue to focus on recruiting, hiring and training skilled technicians in the coming fiscal year as well as investing in related capital expenditures to support that growth. Shifting to our domestic construction segment, as expected, our construction segment produced a strong fourth quarter with same-store sales growth of 18%. This was due in part to timing of OEM deliveries this year versus last and our focus on getting these units turned around and out to our customers. We are pleased with the execution of our construction team, who have continued to drive growth and maintain healthy pre-tax margins. Although there has been some recent softening, as we look ahead, we see general stability in the construction markets that we serve. Further, we also anticipate benefiting from improved availability of equipment from our OEM partners. Now moving on to an overview of our Europe segment, which represents our business within the countries of Bulgaria, Germany, Romania and Ukraine. As discussed on our third quarter call, the growing season varied this year, with timely precipitation driving above average yields in Germany and Ukraine, while dry conditions create some headwinds in Bulgaria and Romania. As expected, we saw slowdown in demand in the fourth quarter, but still achieved modest year-over-year sales growth on a same-store basis. Turning to our new Australia segment, the O'Connor’s acquisition is now consolidated into our financials for the first time this quarter, so you will be able to monitor our progress in our segment reporting going forward. The segment’s fourth quarter came in as expected and plentiful rainfall has provided healthy subsoil moisture across our footprint heading into the next growing season. We have completed initial integration discussions across departments, sharing best practices and setting the stage for future collaboration. In the coming months, we will initiate the branding transition to Titan Machinery and I’d like to reiterate how excited we are to have O'Connor’s join the Titan team. Finally, I want to sincerely thank our employees for their tremendous efforts that drove our record revenue and earnings. With that, I will turn the call over to Bo for his financial review.\nBo Larsen: Thanks, Bryan and good morning everyone. I’ll start with a brief review of our fiscal 2024 full year results. As Bryan noted in his commentary, we had another exceptional year and are proud of the performance the team delivered. While we don’t expect to repeat this performance in the coming year, we are focused on demonstrating improved results relative to that of the previous cycle as we move forward. Total revenue increased 24.9% to a record $2.8 billion, driven by balanced growth across each of our revenue categories. Equipment grew 25.3% for the full year and was complemented by solid contributions from our recurring parts and service businesses, which increased 25.6% and 21.2% respectively. Additionally, rental and other was up 10.4%. Earnings per diluted share increased 9.8% to $4.93 for fiscal 2024. This was a record for Titan and it was also right in line with the midpoint of the guidance we established at the beginning of fiscal 2024 after adjusting for the O’Connor’s acquisition. Shifting to our consolidated results for the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, total revenue was $852.1 million, an increase of 46.2% compared to the prior year period. Growth was driven by a 29.9% increase in same-store sales with the balance reflecting the contribution from the O’Connor’s and other acquisitions. Our equipment revenue increased 51.6% versus the prior year period. Both parts and service revenue each increased 25.7% and rental and other revenue was up 3.1% versus the prior year period. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was $141 million and as expected gross profit margin contracted year-over-year to 16.6% driven primarily by lower equipment margins, which are experiencing some normalization as expected at this stage in the cycle. The fourth quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 included benefits related to manufacturer incentive plans of $7.8 million and $1.8 million respectively. Operating expenses were $100.3 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $83.7 million in the prior year period. The year-over-year increase of 19.9% was driven by additional operating expenses related to our acquisitions that have taken place in the past year as well as an increase in variable expenses associated with increased sales. Floor plan and other interest expense was $9.3 million as compared to $2.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. With the increase led by a higher level of interest bearing inventory, the usage of existing floor plan capacity to finance the O’Connor’s acquisition and higher interest rates. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $24 million or $1.05 per diluted share, which included approximately $0.26 of benefits associated with manufacturer incentive plans. This compares to last year’s fourth quarter net income of $18.1 million or $0.80 per diluted share, which included approximately $0.06 of benefits associated with manufacturer incentive plans. Now turning to our segment results for the fourth quarter. In our agriculture segment, sales increased 40.8% to $620.6 million. Growth was led by strong same-store sales increase of 35.5%, which was further supported by contributions from the acquisitions of Pioneer Farm Equipment in February 2023 and Scott Supply in January 2024. Agriculture segment pre-tax income was $28.8 million and compared to $19.3 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. In our construction segment, same-store sales increased to 17.7% to $100.1 million led by the timing of equipment deliveries, which shifted some revenue into the fourth quarter of this year as compared to the timing of deliveries to customers in the second half of last year. Pre-tax income was $4.6 million and compared to $5.4 million in the fourth quarter of the prior year. In our Europe segment, sales increased 8.1% to $61.6 million, which reflects a 5.5% currency tailwind on the strengthening euro. Net of the effect of these foreign currency fluctuations, revenue increased $2.1 million or 3.6%. Pre-tax loss was $600,000 and compared to pre-tax income of $1.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in profitability was driven primarily by a partial normalization of equipment margins and higher operating expenses. In our Australia segment, sales were $69.8 million and pre-tax income was $4.1 million. This was in line with the lower end of the range we provided on the Q3 call, primarily due to timing of OEM deliveries. This segment is well positioned to start fiscal 2025 with a good amount of pre-sell orders on hand. Now on to our balance sheet and inventory position. We had cash of $38 million and an adjusted debt to tangible net worth ratio of 1.5x as of January 31, which is well below our bank covenant of 3.5x. Equipment inventory increased approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter, of which approximately $87 million is attributable to acquisitions made during the fourth quarter. As Bryan mentioned, we were pleased to be able to improve the pace of customer deliveries following a concerted effort to complete pre-delivery inspections of new machinery. But as expected, our high volume of deliveries to customers was more than offset by receipts from our OEM partners as they were rapidly catching up on production backlog as they finish the calendar year. With that, I will finish by sharing a few comments on our fiscal 2025 full year guidance which we are providing today. First, some segment specific color on the top line. For the agriculture segment, our initial assumption is for revenue to be flat to up 5%. This includes a full year revenue contribution from Scott Supply, which closed in January of 2024 and achieved revenues of approximately $40 million for calendar year 2023. It also assumes mid to high single-digit growth on our parts and service business as we continue to advance our customer care strategy. As for equipment revenues, it assumes industry equipment volumes to be down 10% to 15% and pricing on new equipment to be up low single-digits. The underlying growth for equipment revenue is expected to be driven by market share gains aided by improved availability of high horsepower equipment as well as proactive posture on selling through the use of credit equipment that will be generated through trade-ins. The construction segment has diverse exposure to various end markets and construction activity in Titan’s Midwest footprint remains at level supporting healthy demand. Our initial assumption is for revenue growth in the range of up 3% to 8%. Here again, we assume mid to high single-digit growth of our parts and service business and the low single-digit increase of pricing on new equipment. Construction should also benefit from improved availability of key equipment categories for which we have been – not been able to fulfill demand in recent years. For the Europe segment, our initial assumption is for revenue to be flat to up 5%. Our European business being predominantly ag based has most of the same thematics as we laid out today for our ag segment, one difference being that each country has its own nuances and are at different points in terms of maturation of our business operations. For instance, while our operations in Romania and Bulgaria are more mature, Ukraine is being impacted by ongoing conflict with Russia and in Germany, we are in the earlier innings of establishing our presence across our footprint. As for the Australia segment, which made its debut in Q4 with the acquisition of O’Connor’s, we currently expect FY ‘25 revenue to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million, which is right in line with the $258 million that they achieved in their most recently completed fiscal year prior to acquisition. This business has a strong foundation in place with a focused operations team and is positioned well to deliver a solid first year performance as part of the Titan Machinery. Now on for some overall commentary across our segments. From a gross margin perspective, we expect equipment margins to normalize across all four of our segments as there is now ample supply of inventory available for sale on dealer lots. An additional impact on the agriculture side, as the U.S. net farm income is expected to decrease approximately 25%, which has started to impact demand for equipment purchases. As such, we expect incremental compression on equipment margins in this transitionary period. As for operating expenses, we continue to take action to retain and recruit talent in a consistently tight labor market, especially with service technicians. We also expect a ramp up in IT expenses as we look to complete the rollout of our new ERP across our remaining U.S. locations. From a year-over-year comparison perspective, it’s also worth noting that our Australia segment has a similar level of operating expenses as a percentage of sales as the rest of the business, implying an annualized run-rate of about $30 million for that segment. Taken together, these impacts are expected to result in operating expenses as a percentage of sales about 40 basis points higher than was realized in fiscal 2024 across the company as a whole. Moving to interest expense, I would expect similar levels of quarterly floor plan interest expense in the first half of fiscal 2025 as we incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and then see it reduced from there as OEM interest-free terms normalize and interest rates are expected to reduce modestly in the back half of the year. What I mean by normalization of interest-free terms is that in recent years due to low equipment availability, OEMs provided shorter than typical interest-free periods. But that has started to shift back to more normal terms and is expected to be a benefit to interest expense. Bringing it altogether on a diluted earnings per share basis, we are introducing a fiscal 2025 range of $3 to $3.50 per share, which implies a pre-tax margin of 3.2% to 3.5%. Overall, we believe the variables just discussed are reasonably factored into the ranges we are providing today though both risks and opportunities still exist. The midpoint of our guidance at $3.25 earnings per share, which reflects a mid-cycle ag environment, along with some added transitional pressures would be the third highest EPS in company history and continues to build on a solid foundation for more sustainable and profitable growth through the cycle. To provide more color on this important topic, we have added a slide in the back of our earnings presentation, which provides a comparison of recent years versus the prior ag cycle. It also summarizes some of the key reasons for the improved profitability as has already been discussed today. Overall, we are focused on executing the plan and driving higher levels of profitability through the cycle. This concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer session of our call.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ted Jackson with Northland Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTed Jackson: Thanks very much. Congratulations on the quarter and congratulations on all the work you’ve done in the last several years to position yourself to work your way through changing the cycle, if you would. I just wanted to touch base quickly on some of the commentary around margin, I know you highlighted that you are going to see more pressure on margin on the equipment side as you know, farm income goes down and there is lesser demand. First of all, with regards to that is this across the board with regards to both new and used, I assume that a bigger driver of this would be used more than new? My second point within margin is what does it mean with regards to rental? And then in my third kind of looking at your parts and services in the last quarter was a little below margin relative to kind of recent periods when we see margin pressure with regards to parts and services also? Thanks.\nBo Larsen: Yes, good morning, Ted. Thanks for the question. From an overall margin perspective, in terms of new and used, we don’t really split that out. And it’s really a function of how you evaluate the used, which impacts the new. Overall, your commentary makes sense right, the pressure comes from selling through the used side. So we don’t really split it out, but I mean, that’s how we are thinking about it. And overall, that’s why we talk about a total equipment margin. From a parts and service perspective, I would expect similar margins this next year, as we had in fiscal ‘24 maybe slightly down. But we’re not talking about the same factors that are impacting our equipment margins. And then from a rental perspective, also feeling good about where that’s at and would expect similar margins to last year. I think you were maybe also referencing there, margin changes in Q4 specifically for parts and service and maybe mainly service. Some of that can really be a function of the seasonality which we really see in the business and where our team is focusing their time between delivering new equipment versus service revenue. And I wouldn’t read anything into that. The margins we have seen are pretty similar to what we would expect perhaps slightly down again, as we have seen some pressure and we are wanting to make sure that we are one of the ones in front leading the labor market in recruiting and retaining our service techs.\nTed Jackson: Okay, that’s really it for me. Thanks very much.\nBryan Knutson: Yes, Ted, this is Bryan, I would just add on the rental as Bo commented, recall that if you go back to FY ‘18, we had a much higher rental fleet, and we’ve gotten that really lean and reduced it down by over 35% down to just under the $80 million that we have today and really driven over the last few years, much higher utilization rates both in terms of dollar and physical utilization. And so we expect that to continue again with their very lean and agile rental fleet that we have today.\nTed Jackson: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry De Maria with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry De Maria: Thanks. Good morning. I have a few questions. First, I guess can you talk about I know you talked about lead times to some degree. Can you talk about are there any pockets where they are still extended or is everything normal at this point? And are you guys significantly slowing down or canceling orders at this point?\nBryan Knutson: Hey, Larry, this is Bryan. Good morning. Thank you for the question. Yes, generally everything across the board is now normalized, Larry, as you know, domestic Midwest plants versus overseas production plants always have varying lead times, but the supply chain is, as we mentioned, has really quickly caught up here and so going from even towards the last – at the end of last year still being extended out now generally everything normalized.\nLarry De Maria: Okay, even though it’s large four-wheel drive, it staggers and all that stuff is relatively easy to get.\nBryan Knutson: Yes, there is not easy for the OEM still, still some production challenges for them, but yes, now, no longer allocation, I believe from any of the OEMs on any product categories.\nBo Larsen: Yes. And just to make sure we address the one point, I mean, there is not a cancellation of shareholder rate. What we have done right is adjust the dials and that started last year. So we are just at – we have kind of referred to this as a transitionary period when the supply chain catches up and you see kind of condensing of when that equipment arrives, right. So it’s kind of a matter of timing and it will play itself through, but feel good about our ability to do so. And that’s one of the main focuses this year.\nBryan Knutson: Yes. And Larry, I just add, as you know, we were short on inventory for – in many categories for 2 plus years, we’ve talked a lot about that over the past 2 years. And so it took us a long time to get here. And so as things have rapidly normalized, it’s going to take a while to manage through these. And so that’s why you hear us talking about the transition year in and just – it’s become a lot of equipment coming in a short period of time, orders that we have placed all throughout 2023 and even back into 2022, coming in a short period here. But just to your point about the dialing back, and as Bo said, as we saw some of the markets starting to soften, late last summer, we started to pull levers and dial things back and put actions into place. So we feel really good about the proactive measures we’ve taken and the visibility we have into the order board for the first half of the year and the strong pre-sales coming in. And so again, there is just will be a lot of inventory that’s recently come in and will be coming out in throughout this year that we have got built into our modeling that we are just going to get after and sell through.\nLarry De Maria: Got it. Thanks for the color. And then – and maybe asking from the customer’s perspective, are – how did orders kind of come in through the quarter if they – I guess to understand, have they fallen off a cliff – are they slowly continuing to get weak and have they sort of felt like they have bottomed stabilized and are we seeing any cancellations from customers?\nBryan Knutson: Yes. So, the cancellations are very low. Generally as we talked in the past that tied back to a death or a divorce or unexpected health issues and so, those just continue, but it has not fallen off a cliff by any means. Commodity prices have been pretty steady here for the last few weeks. And so, farmers again had three really good years here and balance sheets are really strong, recording a lot of record land sale prices throughout our footprint. And they are carrying over a lot of good income into this year and that will help stabilize as well and then just, a lot of the new products from our OEMs and the technology that’s really helping with the productivity and supporting demand as well.\nLarry De Maria: Okay, fantastic. If I could just ask one final question, sorry for asking for more, but in the chart where you show the margins a future trough in revenue and you have breakeven margins at sales about half are where we are looking now. Is this meant to be indicative of where you think the market is going or is that more illustrative of what you’ve – of the work you’ve done cycle to cycle?\nBryan Knutson: Yes, no, I appreciate the opportunity to clarify that and it was a bit challenging to perfectly capture something that you can digest relatively quickly. That future state in that trough there right is not trying to provide any indication on the level of revenue, it’s simply trying to provide the pre-tax margin percentage range. So and we also have the budget in there as a reference, right. So, we are coming off of our recent peaks. And we saw an ability to produce pre-tax north of 6%. This year budgeting, a mid-cycle assumption with some added transitionary pressure at that the midpoint about 3.4%. The guidance range here, from zero to 3% is supposed to be indicative of kind of that pre-tax range. And in terms of where it falls in that range, right, all comes down to kind of the timing and the factors at the time, right. Like, what is the trough, what does that look like, where equipment inventory levels, at where interest rates at that point in time. But overall, what we are trying to illustrate is both from peak-to-peak perspective, and then trough-to-trough perspective, and all the way through the cycle, delivering significantly higher profitability. And that’s what we are excited and focused on executing here over the next few years.\nLarry De Maria: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much and good luck.\nBryan Knutson: Thanks Larry.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with R. W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Grabowski: Hey. Good morning guys. It’s Joe Grabowski on for Mig this morning,\nBryan Knutson: Hi Joe.\nBo Larsen: Hi Joe.\nJoe Grabowski: Hey. Good morning. So, I guess I wanted to start with the quarter, the guidance you gave in late-November, would have implied your ag revenue would have been up about 20% in the fourth quarter, it came in up over 40%. I guess I am just checking, did the equipment availability really improved that much more than you were expecting in late-November, kind of what played out in the quarter? And did you maybe pull any revenue forward that you might have gotten in the current fiscal year?\nBryan Knutson: Yes. I think just quickly from me, and I will have Bo expand further, Joe. But to your question, yes, the equipment has been really tricky to forecast timing of deliveries in the past 2 years. And so with supply chain improving and so on, it did come in better than anticipated, so that certainly was a part of it. And then also again, as I have mentioned in our prepared comments, just credit to our team who really worked hard to reduce our backlog that has been at record levels in the past 2 years and putting in the hours and getting that equipment out to our customers.\nBo Larsen: Yes. I don’t think I have anything to add there. I think you covered it well.\nJoe Grabowski: Okay. Great. Thank you. And my next question, you walked through why your ag revenue guidance for the current fiscal year is so much better than the OEMs, Industry forecasts, and it seems like a big component of that is the market share gains that you are expecting. Maybe talk about your confidence in those market share gains, and I guess if it’s predicated on better equipment availability, I mean isn’t equipment availability improving for everybody, so just your thoughts on that.\nBryan Knutson: Yes. So, stripping everything back and setting the acquisition to the side, right equipment revenues on the Ag segment is about flat to slightly down, versus I think you are referencing the industry volume expectation of like 10% to 15%. And yes, we are better positioned with our equipment, right, and specifically for customers we serve. So, it’s really looking at those relationships and the equipment that they are looking for, and in some cases, our inability to get it in previous years, and now our ability to execute and serve those specific customers. So, it’s not just a broad statement, and we feel pretty good with line of sight, and as we mentioned, with our pre-sale activity through the first half of the year, what we are looking to achieve here.\nJoe Grabowski: Alright. And my last question, any early learnings from the O’Connors acquisition and your – maybe your broader thoughts about the Australia market.\nBryan Knutson: Yes. I think just as we continue to get to know the team better and collaborate with them on our best practice sharing and leveraging each other’s knowledge and skill sets, it’s just all been extremely positive. Where, we are really pleased with the acquisition, we are really pleased with the leadership team and the employees over there and very similar business philosophies our two companies have and so that’s really helped with the integration and transition. We really like the market over there. We are very excited to grow over there and continue to invest over in Australia. And yes, we just couldn’t be happier, Joe, and really pleased with that acquisition, excited about going forward.\nJoe Grabowski: Alright. Great. Thank you.\nBryan Knutson: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Klieve with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Klieve: Alright. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple for me. First of all, regarding the ‘25 outlook, I am wondering if you can kind of help us a bit with top line seasonality. Last year was a very lumpy one, I am wondering if you can kind of point to any historic year, you can give us kind of a bit of a benchmark for kind of how we should look at seasonality here in fiscal ‘25, because I suspect it’s going to be off quite a bit from fiscal ‘24.\nBo Larsen: Yes. So certainly, when you look at it, and things like the strength of the fourth quarter, definitely come into play there with your comments. Big picture wise, surprisingly, and as we look at things average over the last 6 years, last 3 years, last couple of years, a whole bunch of different ways. But as we see it, traditionally, our revenues are about 45% in the first half of the year, 55% in the second half of the year. And Australia, even when you overlay Australia with our financials, we expect something very similar with 45%-ish in the first half of the year, 55%-ish in the second half of the year. The nuance here I think is, you are definitely right, there was some strength in the fourth quarter in our U.S. Ag segment, which kind of made Q4 stand out. So, I think that that normalizes a bit, and Q3 and Q4 look more similar in FY ‘25 than they did in FY ‘24. But overall, back half of the year about 55%. And then from a first half of the year perspective, that first 45%, Q1 is traditionally and expected to be lower than Q2, and a lot of that is seasonality and timing of activity and purchasing. So overall, big picture wise, it won’t change drastically from what we have seen. But there is some nuance and certainly more of a level setting between Q3 and Q4 is probably the best expectation at this point.\nBen Klieve: Got it. That’s very helpful. Thanks Bo. And then one more from me and I will get back in queue. I am wondering if you can talk about the M&A opportunities today and maybe in the context of kind of how the M&A environment was at mid-cycle in the – assuming midpoint of the previous cycle as well, is the outlook kind of more favorable, less favorable than it was at this point in the prior cycle, or any big takeaways you can point to there?\nBo Larsen: Yes. Thanks Ben. Yes, certainly, I believe there is – there will start to be a greater amount of opportunities here as we go forward. And also we could see a little bit of a change in the multiples and so on as we go more towards mid-cycle here, and as margins come down a little bit for the other dealers as well. But the real drivers still remain in place, all the back office challenges in the – a lot of the single store, the smaller and the traditional operations struggling with the technology and all the HR and government regulations and just a lot of that back office function that really ties in nicely with our models. And so those drivers that just continued to be ever present. And as we again go towards more mid-cycle here, those get highlighted even further. So, we do believe there will be an increased amount of opportunities as we go forward here. But I would reiterate, for the immediate year here, as we laid out in our prepared comments, we are really focused on our customer care strategy and continuing to focus on driving our parts and service business and increasing our parts and service revenues, increasing our support capabilities for our customers. And we are going to continue to invest in that and be really focused on our customer care strategy. And just really keen on expenses and again, inventory management. So, those are the three priorities we certainly will be opportunistic with acquisitions and as we manage through that inventory that will free up room on the balance sheet, that will generate quite a bit of cash as we exit the year and go throughout next year as well. So, we will certainly be ready and going to be very selective with acquisitions as we go forward.\nBen Klieve: Very good. I appreciate that color. Thanks for taking my questions. I will get back in queue.\nBo Larsen: Thanks Ben.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you. Good morning. A couple of quick questions here. First, can you talk a little bit about your expectations for inventory increasing throughout the year?\nBryan Knutson: Yes. I mean from the color we are trying to provide today is generally right, that we still have inventory coming in. And obviously, we have expectations for good sales pull-through. In terms of quarter-to-quarter, that remains to be seen a little bit. Again, as we have said, lead times have normalized some, but there is still some inconsistency in terms of when things would arrive. But as it stands, I would expect that we do see some uptick in inventory here in the first half of the year, assuming that all of those things stay on schedule, and then we would play it out and see some inventory reduction from there in the back half of the year. All of that subject to again, the timing of how everything plays out. And we will continue to provide an update for you on a quarterly basis.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you. And then what’s your appetite these days to increase investment into your rental fleet?\nBryan Knutson: Yes. So, Alex, we monitor that closely on a real time basis and it just ultimately is a function of our utilization. And so our team does a great job building relations, and relationships and being out there in the market. And we really look to continue to push and promote our rental fleet. It continues to improve every year. And so we are just very mindful, though, of the utilization rates. And as long as we can keep those up and keep improving those, we will continue to add fleet. And as we see them start to taper off or pull back a little bit, we will turn the valves, or decrease the valves back down. And again, just really a function of the utilizations.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question will come from the line of Ted Jackson with Northland Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTed Jackson: Thanks. You kind of touched on it a little bit with your inventory comments, but I did want to circle back with regards to kind of working capital levels as we roll through fiscal 2025. And that’s obviously tied to inventory levels, a little bit surprised that you would see inventories trending up, like in the first half, given the jump you had in the fourth quarter. But kind of taking that and tying it together, is it fair to assume that we will see a drop in working capital and an improvement in free cash flow during fiscal 2025? And will we – what kind of – what can we expect in terms of free cash flow number for the year, and how would that be weighted out in terms of sort of first half to second half? Thanks.\nBo Larsen: Yes. So, I mean overall, at the heart of your question is would we see better operating cash flow generation, right, and ultimately that all comes down to what the inventory balance is going to look like. So, this year, we saw a significant increase year-over-year in inventory. We certainly wouldn’t expect to see the same thing occur in FY ‘25, right. So, that’s going to be a real positive to the dynamics on the cash flow side. Just a bit more on that, I guess as we as we look at this. So again, we have mentioned a little bit earlier, about 45% of revenue in the first half of the year, 55% in the back half of the year, will kind of the inverse is true in terms of expectations for deliveries. Again, because of the supply chain cash up, right. So, when you have more – a larger portion of inventory coming in, in the period where you have a lower portion of your sales, that’s just mathematically I guess against it that would lead to a continued increase here in the near-term. But overall as we step back and take a look at this, right, and we talk about the team that we have in place and the controls we have in place and everything that we focus on, the dynamics that have kind of come together here in terms of the cycle turning and then the catch up with the supply chain, ultimately just lead to a situation where it takes a little time to play through, right. So, big picture wise, we talk about maintaining healthy inventory turns, and staying out of interest-bearing inventory. And I think this year, we will see that inventory turns are lower than our targeted levels. And it probably takes, working through FY ‘26 to get the turns back up, just the dynamics with how those ratios were even calculated. So, we see the transitionary period and kind of a 2-year journey to get back on that term level. But very much seeing it play out something we can manage deliver the higher profitability that we are talking about today, be well positioned for FY ‘26 and beyond. And ultimately, all of that is going to lead to better cash flow generation that we had seen recently. But in terms of specifically now in the quarters, I mean we will have to continue to see how that plays out here in ‘25.\nTed Jackson: Do you think you can generate positive free cash flow for the entire year?\nBo Larsen: Yes. Again, it ultimately all comes down to inventory levels, but we feel good about being able to manage those and achieve them.\nTed Jackson: Okay. Thanks Bo.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nBryan Knutson: Okay. Thank you for your interest in Titan Machinery and we look forward to updating you with our progress on our next call. Thank you and have a great day everyone.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

On today's call, I will provide a summary of our results then Bryan Knutson, our current President and Chief Operating Officer, who will be transitioning to the CEO post on February 1st, will give an overview for each of our business segments. Bo Larsen, our CFO, will conclude the call with a review of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and some commentary around our updated fiscal 2024 full year expectations. We accomplished a great deal this quarter, completing our acquisition of the Australia-based O'Connors Group in October and solidifying our leadership succession plan, which we announced last month, while delivering solid financial results. Bryan and his team have instrumental in jump starting our integration with O'Connors, and we couldn't be more pleased with the quality of the O'Connors team. We recognize an alignment of our strategies during the O'Connors due diligence process, and the first couple of months of operations have proven out how well our organizations mesh. We are thrilled to have them on board and look forward to a bright future together. As it relates to CEO succession, I am very proud of what our team at Titan Machinery has achieved since my early days in a dealership nearly 50 years ago, and the breadth and depth of our operation is a testament to the talent that we have attracted to the organization. Through the process of planning for this transition over the last several years with our Board of Directors, we felt it was critical to fill the role with someone who deeply understands the dealership business and our customers. Bryan is a natural leader with a successful track record and has proven his ability to excel across all aspects of the business and our company culture, and our employee engagement has never been better. I am extremely confident in Bryan's capabilities and watch his development over the last 20 years as he has excelled in both store and central leadership roles, which makes them uniquely qualified to lead Titan Machinery in our next stage of growth. Moving to our fiscal third financial performance, we achieved record revenues of $694 million and diluted earnings per share of $1.32. These results came in below our full potential due to delayed OEM deliveries, prioritizing customer uptime throughout the harvest and end of season construction projects and increased preparation time to complete pre-delivery inspections of new machinery. This dynamic is also visible in our inventory balance at the end of the quarter, as the amount of on hand pre-sold inventory being prepped in our service shops, continues to trend above normal levels. Notwithstanding, customer uptime is our top priority, and our team did a great job on meeting our customers' immediate service needs and minimizing downtime during the all important fall season. Heading into year end, we continue to see demand in excess of OEM production for high horsepower tractors and wheel loaders, which we expect will continue to at least the first half of calendar year 2024. Well, we are positioned well for a strong fourth quarter. Our recognition of equipment revenue will be dependent on both the timing of new machinery received from the OEMs, as well as our ability to manage service department workflows. We continue to experience substantially longer preparation time to complete the quality pre-delivery inspection and setup process required before delivery to our customers due to the supply same chain challenges. Overall, we expect year over year revenue growth in each of our segments in the fourth quarter, and we have narrowed the range of our revenue modeling assumptions to reflect our latest expectations for fourth quarter OEM deliveries and demands on our service departments. Looking forward, both our Ag and CE customers are experiencing the carryover of three exceptionally strong years, putting in excellent financial position and creating optimism as I look to the future. Additionally, over the last 24 months, we have completed some high quality and strategic acquisitions, which will strengthen our bottom line as they get fully integrated into our system. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bryan Knutson for his segment review.\nBryan Knutson: Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Today, I will provide a recap of our fiscal third quarter segment drivers and then review some of our high level expectations for the balance of fiscal year 2024 across our respective segments. I'll begin with our domestic agriculture segment. We achieved another record revenue performance on top of last year's outstanding results driven by a combination of positive same store sales and contribution from the Pioneer acquisition from earlier in the year. As you heard from David, these results were constrained by a few factors. While improving, limited OEM production remains a factor preventing us from meeting the existing demand for high horsepower tractors and self-propelled sprayers. And for those new units that we are receiving, our service team is having to spend more preparation time on each pre-sold new unit before delivering it to our customers due to supply side challenges. While this isn't a new phenomenon for us, as the additional prep time has been something we face throughout this fiscal year, our service department capacity was stretched in the third quarter, given the seasonally higher volumes and a need to prioritize our supportive existing customer equipment throughout harvest. Now that our customers are mostly done with harvest activities, we expect to catch up on delivering some of the incremental buildup of pre-sold units throughout the fourth quarter. Bolstering our service network and capacity remains a key priority for our organization, and as such, we will continue to focus on recruiting, hiring, and training skilled technicians. With respect to harvest and customer sentiment, favorable crop development in the later part of the growing season, produced average to above average yields throughout our footprint. Although corn pricing has softened throughout the year, there was quite a bit of corn that was forward contracted in the $5 to $6 per bushel range and current prices for soybeans, sugar beets, potatoes, and edible beans remain very attractive as well as cattle prices. Yield trends continue to be positive and some input costs have been decreasing and with three consecutive years of historically high net farm income, farmers' balance sheets are in great shape with debt equity ratios historically low and are furthered by increasing land values. Overall, our customers are in a great position to post another solid year of income. Looking to the balance of fiscal 2024 for our agriculture segment, we remain in a position to deliver a strong fourth quarter based on positive fundamentals such as healthy farmer cash receipts, which is supporting net farm income at levels well above historical averages, continued tax incentives surrounding Section 179 and bonus depreciation, and the additional backlog of pre-sold units awaiting pre-delivery, inspection, and final delivery to our customers. Shifting to our domestic construction segment, similar dynamics to what I just described for agricultural segment are also relevant here. OEM wheel loader production does not yet meet demand. Preparation time to get new units ready for delivery to customers is longer than normal, and with a busy fall construction season to complete projects ahead of winter, our service departments were balancing competing demands, but always keeping existing customer machinery running as the top priority. I'd also note that there was a shift in timing of equipment deliveries this year versus last, which has some influence on the comparable growth rates. For instance, last year, we had a really strong third quarter performance whereas we expect a stronger fourth quarter performance in the current year. As a result, we realized a year-over-year, same store sales decrease of 10.3% in the third quarter this year. Despite third quarter year-over-year comparisons, we achieved rental fleet dollar utilization of 33.2% and absorption of 88.5%, both of which are very high compared to historical levels for this segment and showed the sustained improvement in these areas. General construction activity across our footprint remains at healthy levels and infrastructure energy and agriculture activity continue to support demand for construction equipment. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the timing dynamic I mentioned to be a tailwind for us, and as a result and result in year-over-year growth on a same store basis and finish this fiscal year at a high note for our construction segment. Now moving to an overview of our Europe segment, which was formerly known as our international segment prior to our acquisition of O’Connors in Australia. Our Europe segment represents our business within the countries of Bulgaria, Germany, Romania, and Ukraine. Rainfall throughout the growing season varied across these countries, which help drive above average yields in Germany and Ukraine. But dry conditions in Bulgarian Romania cause yields to be below average. These lower yields negatively impacted farmer profitability, and as a result, we saw a softening in demand for new equipment purchases in these two countries. Overall, same store sales decreased 7.5% in our fiscal third quarter. Looking to expectations for the rest of the year, we continue to expect European egg fundamentals to moderate. However, last year's fiscal fourth quarter was significantly impacted by limited equipment availability and did not follow normal revenue season only patterns for our Europe segment. This dynamic should normalize this year and is the basis for our expectation to achieve year-over-year growth in this year's fourth quarter. Last but not least is our new Australia segment. Although, we closed on the O'Connor's acquisition October, those results won't be consolidated into our financials until the fourth quarter. Harvest has now started in Australia and is providing evidence that the O'Connor's footprint is one of the most consistent areas in the country. Growers in our footprint are seen above average yields as they begin harvest activities, while the same cannot be said for much of the rest of the country. Recent moisture is presenting some challenges to the current harvest, but it is helpful to restoring moisture levels in the region for next year's crop. We continue to be extremely excited about the Australian market and the opportunity to build upon what the O'Connors team has accomplished. We are working through our integration strategy and are grateful for the entire team's eagerness as we come together. With that, I just want to thank all the members of our Titan family for their hard work and focus, as we kept growers and contractors up and running during the important fall season. Now, I will turn the call over to Bo to review our financial results in more detail.\nBo Larsen: Thanks, Bryan. Good morning everyone. Starting with our consolidated results for the fiscal 2024 third quarter. Total revenue was $694.1 million, an increase of 3.8% compared to the prior year period. Our equipment revenue increased 2.5% versus the prior year period, led by incremental revenue from our recent acquisitions as well as positive same-store sales growth in our Agriculture segment. Growth was also visible across our other revenue streams as well, with our parts revenue increasing 5.7%, service up 14.9%, and rental and other revenue up 4.2% versus the prior year period. Gross profit for the third quarter was $138 million, and as expected gross profit margin decreased by 100 basis points to 19.9%, driven primarily by lower equipment and parts margins, partially offset by higher service and rental margins. It is worth noting that the equipment gross profit in the prior year, benefited from the recognition of $2 million accrual on the expected achievement of annual manufacturer incentive programs, which is not included in this year's third quarter results. As a reminder, we recognized $6.4 million of manufacturer incentives in the prior fiscal year, spread across Q2, Q3 and Q4. Our guidance which I will talk about further in a few minutes includes a similar level of manufacturing incentives for the current fiscal year, all of which if earned would be recognized in the fourth quarter. The difference in timing relates to the progress in achieving related targets. Thus, our updated guidance includes the full year's impact of manufacturing incentives to be recognized in the fourth quarter and part of the reason for keeping our EPS guidance unchanged. Operating expenses were $92.1 million for the third quarter in fiscal 2024 compared to $84.9 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase of 8.5% was led by additional operating expenses due to acquisitions that have taken place in the past year as well as an increase in variable expenses associated with increased sales. Additionally, the inconsistent OEM deliveries and longer preparation time for pre-delivery inspection of new equipment have created some temporary inefficiencies that we are tackling with an eye toward return into normal conditions in these areas as soon as possible. On a consolidated basis, I would expect operating expenses as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter to be similar to or modestly lower than the 13.3% realized in the third quarter. Over the past two years, we have made seven acquisitions that accounted for approximately $670 million in annualized revenue. Overall and as is typical, those acquisitions came with a higher operating expense as a percentage of sales than our base business, albeit some with favorable gross margin offsets. As David and Bryan have touched on already, we are focused on integration activities and resource reallocation, so the business is optimized to deliver operational efficiencies through the cycle. We have a long track record of acquiring businesses and improving their financial metrics over time to be in line with our overall financial targets, and I'd expect that we'll be able to demonstrate that in the future as well. Floor plan and other interest expense was $5.5 million as compared to $1.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher interest bearing floor plan borrowings driven by higher inventory levels. Additionally, we used the capacity of our existing Bank Syndicate floor plan facility to finance the O'Connor's acquisition. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $30.2 million or $1.32 per diluted share and compares to last year's third quarter net income of $41.3 million or $1.82 per diluted share. Now turning to our segment results for the third quarter. In our agriculture segment, sales increased 7.7% to $531.4 million. This growth was driven by our acquisition of Pioneer Equipment as well as same store sales growth of 3.5%, which was achieved on top of a very robust 46.4% same store sales increase in the prior year, and same store sales growth of 28% the year prior to that. As previously discussed, third quarter revenues were constrained by the delayed OEM deliveries and capacity constraints of our service department. Agriculture segment pre-tax income was $35.1 million and compared to $42 million in the third quarter of the prior year, which implies a pretext margin decrease of 190 basis points to 6.6%. In our construction segment, sales declined 10.3% to $77.5 million. As Bryan already mentioned, the timing of equipment deliveries in the back half of this year versus the back half of last year creates some variability in the year over year comparability. We expect this headwind to shift to a tailwind in the fourth quarter where we anticipate generating year over year growth. Pre-tax income was $4.1 million and compared to $6.1 million in the third quarter of the prior year, and our year over year pretext margin decreased by approximately 180 basis points to 5.2%. In our Europe segment, sales decreased by 4.3% to $85.2 million, which reflects a 7.9% currency tailwind on the strengthening Europe. Net of the effect of these foreign currency fluctuations, revenue decreased 10.4%, reflecting a softening of demand in Bulgarian and Romania, which were negatively impacted by the aforementioned dry conditions and lower yields. Pre-tax income was $5.1 million and compares to $8.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, which implies a pretax margin decrease of 350 basis points to 6%. Given some of the timing and constraint related items we mentioned, it's useful to look at year to date margins across our segments to get a better sense of things. Through the first nine months of the year, the AG segments pre-tax margin is 6.5% or 70 basis points lower than the prior year. CE's pretext margins are 5.9%, which are flat with the prior year, and Europe's pretext margins are 6.8% or 90 basis points lower than the first nine months of the prior year. Now, on to our balance sheet and inventory positions, we had cash of $70 million and in an adjusted debt to tangible net worth ratio of 1.1x as of October 31, 2023, which is well below our bank covenant of 3.5x. Equipment inventory increased $98.8 million in the third quarter. As we discussed in detailed during our second quarter earnings call, our domestic Ag segment was still a little short of targeted inventory levels at that time, and we expected inventories to increase modestly during the third quarter based on planned OEM ship dates and projected customer deliveries. We also expected to start working down the amount of pre-sold equipment and inventory back toward normal levels; however, as David touched on earlier, given the dynamics of longer preparation times and prioritization of service for customers existing equipment, our progress on reducing the amount of pre-sold equipment and inventory stalls. Given that we are largely past the busy fall season, we should have more time to dedicate toward delivering pre-sold equipment to customers in the fourth quarter. But the inventory balance at the end of the fiscal year will be dependent on both the timing of incremental equipment deliveries from OEMs, as well as the pace of our pre-delivery inspection work. Overall, we expect there will be like -- there will likely be an increase in our total ending inventory on the balance sheet, similar to the increase we saw in the third quarter, and then stabilize within arrange thereafter, as things normalize. We will also see the O'Connor's balance sheet added to our financials in the fourth quarter as well. With that, I'll finish sharing by -- I'll finish by sharing a few comments on our fiscal 2024 full year guidance, which we have updated to reflect the year-to-date performance of our businesses. We are positioned well for a strong fourth quarter, and we have narrowed the range of expected revenue for each segment, contemplating the continuation of limited availability of a few key equipment categories and the longer prep times for pre-delivery inspections we have been experiencing. We now expect our Ag segment to finish up 20% to 23%, our construction segment to be at 4% to 7%, and our Europe segment to be at 4% to 7%. With respect to our new Australia reporting segment, we completed the O'Connor's transaction on October 2nd. Similar to Europe, these results will be reported on a one-month lag, and as anticipated, this will result in three months of activity being reported in our fiscal 2024 results. With all of that said, we are refining our fiscal 2024 revenue estimate to be $70 million to $80 million with a diluted EPS contribution in the range of $0.10 to $0.15, when factoring in financing and integration related expenses. As a reminder, fourth quarter gross margins are typically a few 100 basis points lower sequentially than the third quarter, largely driven by mix and larger tax incentivized purchases with multi-unit discounts. The same is expected to hold true this year. Additionally, we continue to expect modest normalization of equipment margins consistent with improved inventory levels and equipment availability. Gross margin in the third quarter was about a hundred basis points lower than the prior year's third quarter, and I would expect a similar 100 basis point normalization year-over-year in the fourth quarter, partially offset by the anticipated incremental manufacturer incentives that I already mentioned. Overall, with margin strength offsetting slightly lower sales expectations for the year, our underlying EPS guidance, excluding the positive impact from the O'Connor's transaction, remains unchanged as compared to the guidance that we established at the beginning of the fiscal year. We look forward to finishing the year strong and delivering on the record results that we committed to nine months ago, and we are really proud of that. This concludes our prepared comments and we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ted Jackson with Northland Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTed Jackson: Thank you. Good morning. So I have got two questions. The first one is just going into the issues with regards to prep time, which I just wanted to get a little more color around. Is it just a labor issue and you are trying you need more people? Is it equipment that's being delivered and needs extra work for some reason because it is coming in a lesser state than is normal? Just kind of what's driving that aspect if you would with regards to delay in top-line?\nDavid Meyer: Sure. Ted, it is really a combination of all the things that you mentioned. As an example, we are to fly over the global flywheel drive plant here in Fargo, you see a lot of units outside and typically what you are going to find is they are either waiting on a truck for delivery due to the shortage of truckers out there right now and/or they are missing a component, some of the supply chain challenges that are still out there, and they got to keep the assembly line moving or the quality of the component that CNH received from one of the suppliers what didn't pass inspection. So, again, they kept the line moving, they caught it at the plan. So they are having those delays on their side, and that creates some of these timing issues we have talked about. Then as we get those units, as far as the additional prep time that we are seeing on our end is anytime you have had one of those units where you can't go through the normal build process, and you have heard a lot of commentary from Deere and CNH and AgCo on this in previous quarters. You always have a risk then of quality issues or other things. So, we just take a lot of pride in our commitment to our customers and excellence in the units when we deliver to them. And so, that's really increased the inspection time to make sure we go through a multipoint inspection. We are catching things and it's just then we got to fix those things and so it just adds to the time. And then as we have also mentioned, we do add a lot of different technology and things that's very commonplace for us to do for our customers, and the supply chain is still constrained and deliveries are delayed on certain components, both within technology, but also with certain casting components like weights and tires and wheels and so on. So still you are waiting on some of those components. But collectively, that all is what's leading to that significant increase in prep time.\nBryan Knutson: And I would just add to that, general supply chain, I think everybody said over time has continued to improve and that's definitely the case. As we look into next year and kind of get past the first half of the year, we largely see a lot of these issues being behind us and getting us back towards normalized conditions. We specifically called it out here because given the higher seasonality volumes, it did create a bit of a pinch point in terms of the amount of equipment we could get delivered kind of prevented us from reaching the full potential for the quarter.\nTed Jackson: And then my -- sorry, I woke up with something today. But my second question is around O'Connors in Australia. And I mean, I'm just kind of curious, you narrowed your guidance range taking the top down by 10 million and is that a result of a change in kind of macro dynamics within Australia? Is that a result of having gotten further into the weeds with regards to the business and a better understanding of it? Just kind of a little color in terms of what prompted you to take the top end of that range down?\nDavid Meyer: It is definitely the latter. It is really just getting in the weeds, understanding what equipment is in inventory, what equipment needs to get in the country and expected timing of delivery to customers. So really just being able to take the time as we got through close to just sharpen the pencil on exactly what would unfold for these three months was just the narrowing on that range there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMig Dobre: Just a quick clarification. I thought I heard you talk about inventories coming up again sequentially in 4Q, and if I heard that correctly, I guess what I'm trying to figure out is when I look seasonally in your business, typically inventories come down sequentially in the fourth quarter. And that feels a little bit different right this year. And I guess I'm also wondering if you sort of had these disruptions that kind of prevented you from delivering some machines in Q3, wouldn't you be able to hopefully catch up on some of that in Q4, which again, at least in theory, should bring inventories down sequential?\nBo Larsen: First of all to start with and maybe a clarifier, right, as we talk about pre-sold equipment awaiting delivery to customers, that's always turning, right? So, the unit that was there in the first quarter has been delivered to a customer. It's not still sitting there. Units that were there in Q2 aren't still sitting there, but what we're seeing right, is a continued delivery from the OEMs and we're needed to process everything through the chute. So definitely in the fourth quarter, we look to be able to chip away at the amount of pre-sold that we have in that inventory balance. But again, as we looked at how timing looks to be for everything and with OEM deliveries, right? And the OEMs are looking to finish their year strong and get as much out as they can, I think we're still seeing some push to make up for some of those supply chain challenges that had otherwise held them back in parts of the year. If you recall last year, we received a tremendous amount of equipment toward the end of the calendar year between really Christmas and the end of December, right, and then a short period of time to really be able to turn that around and deliver to customers. So, it's really those factors that we're talking about, you did hear it right. We expect another incremental increase on inventory there and that kind of stabilizing in that range and looking to continue to normalize that pre-sold backlog as we work through the first part of next year.\nBryan Knutson: Yes. Mig, I would just point out to this BJ adding, O'Connor's to the balance sheet as Bo mentioned in the prepared remarks as well as our other acquisitions, but also just the timing that we've talked about here. So, you're right historically, we would come down by fiscal year end. But everything's kind of delayed on especially on certain products a quarter or so. So I build that in as you look with your modeling, we typically would then be more flattish, and then build back up throughout the year again. So I think just delay in all that as we get into the end of the year and into Q1.\nMig Dobre: Understood. Thank you for that. So my follow up, if we're sort of looking at inventories going up again in the fourth quarter, I guess I'm curious as to how you're thinking about fiscal ‘25, and I'm not looking for you to provide your own guidance in terms of the top line, but obviously Deere, commented on next year DNH, your OEM is thinking that volumes are going to be down as well. So I guess with the inventory built that you have, if indeed volumes are going to be a little bit lower in your fiscal ‘25, how do you think about managing that inventory and your own order placing with the OEM? Thank you.\nBo Larsen: Yes. And you're right. I think the OEMs in their latest earning calls provided some color, and Deere being the end of their fiscal year provided some more granular color on their outlet for the next12 months. For us, I mean, it's not something -- we've been continually managing and estimating where things are going. You're always looking out a year ahead. So in terms of dialing things in and what we're ordering for next year, that's stuff that we've been working on already for quite a while, and are filling really good about where we're sitting and the dials that have been turning over time. We will absolutely manage inventory and focus on that. But overall, as we've said, we do feel good about where our levels are at. On the Ag side, we want more four-wheel drive tractors. On the CE side, we want some more wheel loaders. But one data point for you, just comparing it to say the prior cycle, right? The number of combines that we have in inventory is about 55% lower than it was in the prior peak. So I think some of that's reflective of the industry and the constraints that we're out there. But then also, our back-office team that's focused on managing inventory levels, both what we're ordering from a new side and also the used equipment valuations. So, the dollars that people are making comparison to in terms of prior peak, I think you need to consider the decade of price increases, the acquisitions that we've done and otherwise. I mean, overall, we feel really good about the inventory levels, but appreciate the comment and we'll certainly, as industry volumes trended downwards, we'll be managing our inventory accordingly. We want to keep inventory terms high, we want to keep interest free terms, and we want to keep our balance sheet really healthy.\nBryan Knutson: Yes, and Mig, I would just add, as Bo mentioned, when you're talking about 6 to 12 and greater months lead time here, you better already have done the actions in place, and we've done that and we feel really good about that and heading into next year, and just as he mentioned, our professional team that just focuses on that for a living, that's all they do really watching a lot of the analytics and metrics and running the dials on our inventory. So, we feel really good about the actions we have taken. I think as we mentioned on our previous call and as Scott Wine mentioned on the CNH call, there is a little bit of pockets with some of that lower took, horsepower tractor inventory, real life style stuff that we're a little bit longer on than we'd like, but we have got actions in place on that as well to clean that up. And then as we mentioned with four wheel drives and wheel loads and so on, there is some pockets that we are still a little short on some certain categories. But other than that, we feel really good about where we are positioned to deliver the fourth quarter results that we need to and then as we transition into next year and what we anticipate the market is going to do next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you and good morning, gentlemen. A couple of quick questions here, first, your full EPS guidance includes a range of $0.65 of which I believe $0.22 could be from the incentives. So if you could maybe talk about some of the catalysts being at high-end or low end of that $0.43 difference?\nBo Larsen: This isn't going to sound overly sophisticated, but it is related to the revenue and where that comes in took in terms of whether it is toward the top end or the low end of the range. We feel pretty good in terms of where we are going to be operating from a margin perspective. Operating expenses are pretty well, honed in right. So it really is just a function of how much of that equipment gets delivered.\nAlex Rygiel: That is helpful. And then, as it relates to sort of inventory kind of walking up a little bit in fourth quarter, I believe you might have thought that it would kind of tail off from the third quarter and decline into the fourth quarter, but now it sounds like you are expecting it to increase a little bit. Maybe I guess my question is. What has changed? And then, what's the mix of inventory across Ag versus construction is? Is one higher or lower than where you would like the optimal level to be?\nBo Larsen: Maybe addressing the latter first. I don't think so. I mean, in general, we are feeling pretty good about our inventory levels. On the CE side, the one that's short as well orders like we mentioned, but otherwise across the board in general, it is good. There are probably a couple areas just like on the Ag side, for example, low horsepower tractors, where we want to continue to look to trim just as we anticipate, trends going into next year. On the Europe side, also some areas there that we would be looking at to try to trim as we are seeing some softness specifically in Bulgaria and Romania, but on the whole, there is not a drastic difference, in terms of our take thoughts or level of health between Ag and CE as you were asking there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nDaniel Imbro: Hey guys, and thanks for the question. We were just wondering how much visibility do you all have into these OEM deliveries improving, as we move into like the fourth and first quarter, and since we are going to have a similar dynamic to last year with maybe a heavier fourth quarter, do you foresee maybe delivery timing being a problem again in the first quarter, since you might get a large influx in the fourth quarter?\nBo Larsen: So, we definitely anticipate being a strong fourth quarter revenue wise compared to the prior year. And even a bit, if you do the math from where we were in the third quarter. Obviously, we have more equipment available and we have backlog there, right? So in terms of the confidence in the fourth quarter, we're feeling good about that stuff. And I think at the same time, we have talked a little bit about today in terms of anticipating that the inventory increases a bit from where we're at. So I think both of those we're saying is what our expectation is, right? And then we're in terms of setting up for next year, again, we are feeling like we're ending the year to healthy spot inventory wise. We'll provide more context guidance wise as we get into the March year end call. Did that answer your question?\nDaniel Imbro: Yes. That's perfect. And then on the service delay side, you said mentioned wanting to hire more technicians. How is that going? How is the technician availability? And are you having any trouble there that could limit your ability to catch up on this throughput?\nDavid Meyer: Yes, there's a real shortage out there, just technicians in general, whether you're talking about the airline industry or trucking industry or marine power sports, wherever, automotive, and we really hit hard into this with our customer care strategy several years ago and have just a lot of actions in place that we feel really good about and have been the pilot and the cutting edge for many people in our industry that are trying to follow suit and keep up with us on a lot of the things we're doing. We just now came out with the first accredited apprentice program for our industry. We have the first student tech scholarship sponsorship program that we started years ago that we're really starting to see the fruits of now. And then our internship programs as well as the recruiting efforts that we're doing, the sponsoring that we're doing with tech schools and relationships we have with the high schools, and again, those tech schools. And so, it all takes time and thankfully we put a lot of the actions in place that we did that we're now able to see some of the fruits of the labor on because you got a lot of baby boomers, a lot of workers that are retiring now exiting the workforce. And so as you can imagine, it takes in order to grow the base and add the amount of technicians we need and then you to offset the retirements it takes quite a bit and we feel good about the traction momentum we've got in that, and that's going to remain an absolute front and center priority for us as we go forward.\nOperator: Our final question this morning comes from the line of Steve Dyer with Craig Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Dyer: Curious on the 6 million of manufacturer incentives that you expect to achieve in Q4, I guess, is that dependent on CNH and your OEM partners meeting their delivery schedules to you? Or is that fully within your control?\nDavid Meyer: And for competitive reasons and others, we don't really get into a lot of the mechanics on that, but I guess what I would say right, is we have it in our guidance and that reflects our confidence in achieving the number. There are definite timing differences between this year and last year and that's why we put a little bit more perspective on that.\nSteve Dyer: Then for a second question, what percent of equipment is leased versus sold today? And I guess how has that mix trended over the past several years?\nDavid Meyer: Right now, we're in single digits on leasing versus sold just a tremendously low amount being leased. And that has trended way down. I think Deere mentioned also on their call, you look at that's a big difference between 10 years ago and today is not only the level of leasing, but the quality of the leases. So one in two year leases, everybody was doing those. They were very problematic back then. And then of course, when the downturn had hit, then those lease returns were coming back in addition to a glut of supply of used from the overbilling, overselling a new, that all happened, and none of that trifecta is in place today. So, we have way less leases. We have the leases -- we do have our minimum three year, mostly five year very quality leases. And then again, as Bo mentioned with a combine example, you just got a lot lower levels of used equipment in play today. And then unfortunately, it constrained our revenue opportunity, the last year or two here. But the limited production capabilities just didn't put out the amount of new units. So it results in an older fleet and most categories except to a degree, combines and so that helps with the dampening. And then with less new sold, you just didn't get the amount of used. And so again, back to the shortage of used supply. So, all those components are tremendously healthy and very supportive factors as we go into next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Meyer for final comments.\nDavid Meyer: Okay, well thank you everybody for your time today and your interest in Titan Machinery.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.\nDavid Meyer: That concludes our call.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our conference call. Thank you for your participation.

David, please go ahead.\nDavid Meyer: Thank you, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. On today's call, I'll provide a summary of our results, then Bryan Knutson, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will give an overview for each of our business segments. Bo Larson, our CFO, will then review financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and conclude with some commentary around fiscal 2024 full year expectations. We will also follow-up on the O'Connors acquisition that was announced yesterday with a high-level overview. We carried a strong momentum into the second quarter with revenue increasing 29.4% to $642.6 million. This performance reflects double-digit same-store revenue growth across all three of our operating segments combined $86 million contribution from the Heartland and Pioneer acquisitions. Our organic revenue growth was also balanced across equipment, parts and service, each of which performed well and also delivered healthy gross margins. Taken together, we generated a consolidated pretax margin of 6.5% and diluted earnings per share of $1.38, which is more than a 25% increase over last year's second quarter earnings performance which once again demonstrates the strength of our organization and the efficiency which we are operating in the business. Next, I'd like to provide an update on our equipment inventory. Consistent with our prior expectations, we are seeing some improvement in equipment availability of several equipment categories, but do not anticipate receiving shipments of high horsepower tractors, self-propelled sprayers or wheel orders in excess of customer retail units. We continue to see demand for these products sustained at high levels and expect that to continue into next year. With our suppliers’ production capacities being limited, we do not anticipate replenishment towards targeted minimum stocking levels for these equipment categories until at least the second-half of calendar year 2024. This is on doubly limiting our sales levels. I'm very proud of the team for achieving these record results given all of these constraints. Now as you may have seen last night, we are also very excited about our definitive agreement to acquire O'Connors, the largest Case IH dealership group in Australia and a market leader in high horsepower equipment. O'Connor's has a seasoned management team with a proven track record of driving solid financial performance through a combination of organic and acquisitive goals for over nearly six decades. Additionally, the operating metrics, core values and customer-centric focused highly aligns with our own, making them a great partner for our entry into the Australian agriculture market. In their fiscal year, which ended on June 30, 2023, O'Connor's generated revenue of $258 million and an EBITDA of $21.4 million, which demonstrates the scale of the network they've developed. Combined, the Titan Machinery enterprise, including the O'Connors acquisition, is expected to generate annualized revenue of approximately $2.9 billion, and approximately $200 million in adjusted EBITDA, which makes us an even more formidable player as a global agriculture and construction equipment dealer. Australia is the largest wheat producer in the Southern Hemisphere and the third largest wheat exporter only behind Europe and Russia. O'Connor stores are located in Australia's highly productive grain belt, which produces 60% of Australia's wheat. The Australian market is benefiting from strong fundamentals that are being driven by enhanced productivity, economies of scale and farmer profitability. O'Connor's focus on high horsepower cash crop production equipment and Australia's grain belt region is being supported by combined farm expansions and increasing adoption of precision ag technology that enhances productivity and crop yields. These trends are very similar to that of Titan's domestic and European agriculture business and coupled with Australia's native English language and comparable legal system, this transaction bodes well for a seamless integration that carries over into our shared values and customer-centric focus. We believe it also provides Titan with the unique operational synergy opportunities to expand our global customer service capabilities and capacity across the network. The Australian market is at the early stages of dealer consolidation and through a combined approach where we are able to leverage O'Connor's existing leadership team and bring Titan's broader capabilities and resources to bear, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on continued opportunities to unlock network synergies while driving market share gains. Together, we believe we will be able to build upon their presence in the heart of the Australian Grain Belt and capitalize on operational synergies across our 3 continent footprint consisting of some of the best global agricultural markets generating significant value for our shareholders. We are excited to welcome the O'Connors management team and employees to the Titan Machinery family, and we look forward to a smooth transaction closing and integration process. We expect closing to be completed in Q4 of calendar year 2023. In closing, we remain highly encouraged by the ongoing demand we are seeing in our business, and we're looking -- working hard to get our customers their equipment as OEM production and delivery schedules allow. Our team is ready to support our customers through a very busy harvest and year-end construction seasons in the second-half of our fiscal year. With that, I will turn the call over to Bryan Knutson for his segment review.\nBryan Knutson: Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. Today, I will provide a recap of our fiscal second quarter segment drivers and then review some of our high-level expectations for the balance of fiscal year 2024 across our respective segments. I will begin with our domestic agriculture segment, which produced strong organic growth with same-store sales that increased 10%. As you heard from David, we continue to be acquisitive and the O'Connors transaction is particularly exciting. Our organic growth in the ag segment was further bolstered by revenue contributions from our recent acquisitions in our domestic market. We are also particularly pleased with our ability to maintain our strong pre-tax margin execution, which remained consistent with the prior year period at 7%. Although spring planting got off to a late start this year in some of our Northern markets, crop progress across our footprint is largely back on track following some timely precipitation. Although this precipitation was inconsistent across the Upper Midwest, yield potential has improved from earlier this summer, which is encouraging and is helping improve farmer sentiment. Additionally, with the planting delay, we realized some additional parts and service activity that moved from Q1 into Q2, which is also reflected in the strong growth that we reported today. As David touched on in his commentary, we are still experiencing tight supply in several of our highest selling equipment categories. Our dedicated inventory procurement team continues to work tirelessly to obtain as many of those units as we can from our OEM partners, other dealers, lease returns and through the used market. Most other categories of equipment have returned to more normalized levels, and this same inventory procurement team has been monitoring inventory trends and have made the appropriate adjustments to purchasing volumes to optimize inventory levels and will continue to do so on a forward-looking basis. While we remain focused on presell, especially for cash crop equipment, we feel good about where we have landed and are happy to have replenished stocking levels for many equipment categories that we can serve our customers well, despite not yet being able to procure enough equipment in our key cash crop product categories. We also have a team dedicated to our inventory valuation process in regards to ongoing mark-to-market, as well as determining what price we should offer a customer for a trade-in unit. This team also intensely monitors internal and external market trends and is continually adjusting our trade in pricing on a real-time basis to ensure healthy margins on future used equipment sales. Our used equipment inventories are in a very healthy position. Due to our industry-leading inventory management processes, which are the result of our scale, decades of experience and continuous improvements. Looking to the balance of fiscal 2024 for our Agriculture segment, we remain on track with the modeling assumptions that we laid out at the beginning of the year. Net farm income remains well above historical averages and continues to support demand for equipment purchases. Further, with healthy farmer profitability remaining in place, coupled with continued tax incentives throughout in Section 179 and bonus depreciation, the environment is setting up well for a strong second-half of the year. Although equipment shortages in cash crop categories are expected to persist, we do foresee an increase in available slots as we move through calendar year 2024. Nonetheless, long lead times, coupled with strong fundamentals have our order board consistent with our prevailing expectation that the industry is well positioned heading into next year. Now shifting to our domestic construction segment. Construction activity was strong throughout our footprint during our fiscal second quarter, and we generated another great performance in all areas of the business with same-store sales growth of 18.5% and excellent pre-tax margin expansion of 60 basis points to 6.2%. We also achieved rental fleet dollar utilization of 30.2% and absorption of 91.2%. General construction activity remains strong and infrastructure, energy and agriculture projects continues to support demand for construction equipment, which has resulted in year-to-date segment revenue growth of 13%, which is above the initial modeling assumptions we provided at the beginning of the 2024 fiscal year. Although equipment availability is also a limiting factor in the near term for certain types of construction equipment, we continue to see a favorable backdrop as a result and as a result, are increasing our full year modeling assumptions for this segment today. Now moving to an overview of our International segment, which represents our business within the countries of Bulgaria, Germany, Romania and Ukraine. Same-store sales increased 15.9% in the fiscal second quarter, and pretax margin remained very healthy at 6.1%. Conditions varied across our European footprint with excellent growing conditions in Germany and Ukraine, contrasting with those of Bulgaria, which is experiencing dry growing conditions, which are also present in Southeastern Romania, although to a lesser extent. As a part of our footprint build-out strategy in our current German market, we acquired an adjacent two-store dealership complex in Germany during the second quarter. Looking forward to the balance of the year, we are updating our modeling assumptions to reflect somatic conservatism given our year-to-date growth of 7.8%, which was at the low-end of our prior range. We continue to expect European ag fundamentals to moderate with flat industry volumes given the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the challenges with equipment availability that we see across the other segments of our business. Before I turn the call over to Bo, I'd like to echo David's comments with respect to the O'Connors team. A few months back, I had the privilege of touring all their stores and traveled their entire footprint. Doing so, confirm my expectations of their highly productive agriculture landscape, and I met a number of wonderfully talented people who make their organization so special. Throughout my visit, I was very encouraged by how similar our company cultures are, which is a testament to the focus that their leadership team has brought to their business over the years. We are extremely excited to welcome them to the Titan family and look forward to a smooth integration. With that, I just want to thank all the members of our Titan family for their hard work and dedication to our customers which have produced fantastic year-to-date results. Now I will turn the call over to Bo to review our financial results in more detail.\nBo Larsen: Thanks, Brian. And good morning, everyone. Starting with our consolidated results for the fiscal 2024 second quarter, total revenue was $642.6 million, an increase of 29.4%, compared to the prior year period. Our equipment revenue increased 28% versus the prior year period, led by incremental revenue from our recent acquisitions, as well as double-digit same-store sales growth across all three of our reporting segments, which combined for a 12.1% increase on a same-store basis. This growth was also visible across our other revenue streams as well, with our parts revenue increasing 39.7% service up 27.3% and rental and other revenue, up 11.6% versus the prior year period. Gross profit for the second quarter increased 29.9% to $133 million. Gross profit margin increased by 10 basis points to 20.8%, driven primarily by a slight mix shift to higher-margin parts sales relative to equipment sales. Operating expenses were $88.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to $68.8 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase of 28.9% was primarily additional operating expenses due to acquisitions that have taken place in the past year, as well as an increase in variable expenses associated with the increased sales. That said, we are pleased to achieve some modest operating leverage of 10 basis points versus the prior year as a percentage of sales. Floor plan and other interest expense was $3.7 million as compared to $1.6 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher interest-bearing floor plan borrowings driven by higher inventory levels. Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was $31.3 million or $1.38 per diluted share and compares to last year's second quarter net income of $25 million or $1.10 per diluted share. Now turning to our segment results for the second quarter. In our Agriculture segment, sales increased 34.4% to $469.1 million. This growth was driven by our acquisitions of Heartland Ag Systems and Pioneer equipment, as well as same-store sales growth of 10%, which was achieved on top of a strong performance in the prior year period. Despite the strong quarterly performance, second quarter revenues continue to be constrained by the equipment availability of high-demand cash product categories has already touched on during this call. Agriculture segment pretax income was $33 million and compared to $24.9 million in the second quarter of the prior year, which implies a pretax margin decrease of 10 basis points to 7%. Our Construction segment continued its momentum in the second quarter and grew sales to $82.9 million, up 18.3%, compared to the prior year period. Benefiting from broad-based construction activity and improved equipment availability in some equipment categories. Pre-tax income was $5.2 million and compared to $3.9 million in the second quarter of the prior year and our year-over-year pretax margin increased by approximately 60 basis points to 6.2%. In our International segment, sales increased by 16.9% to $90.6 million which reflects a 2.1% currency tailwind on the strengthening euro. Net of the effect of these foreign currency fluctuations, the segment achieved sales growth of 14.9%, which included a modest year-over-year decline in Ukraine as it remains impacted by the ongoing conflict. Pre-tax income was $5.6 million and compares to $5.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and which implies a pretax margin decrease of 150 basis points to 6.1%. Now on to our balance sheet and inventory position. We had cash of $53 million and an adjusted debt to tangible net worth ratio of 1.0 as of July 31, 2023, which is well below our bank covenant of 3.5. Our total inventory balance at the end of the second quarter was $979.4 million, an increase of approximately $275.5 million during the first six months of this fiscal year. This increase came via growth in equipment and parts inventories of $259.1 million and $15 million, respectively. Of the total increase, $22 million is attributable to the Pioneer acquisition, which was made during the first quarter. The primary driver of the increase is the improvement in new equipment availability from our OEM partners as they have largely caught up on production outside of those key high horsepower equipment categories that David and Brian both mentioned, which are still on allocation. Overall, we are still a bit short of targeted stocking levels of available-for-sale inventory. Driving by some of our ag store locations, the lack of high horsepower display units is clearly notable. To put it in perspective, we have 74 ag dealerships domestically. And at today's industry volumes and cost of equipment we target a combined $7 million of new and used whole good inventory on average per location, which is the minimum we need to have one or two stocking units for sale demonstration or loaner for our highest demand categories. Add in a couple of weeks' backlog to account for predelivery inspection work and you get to our target of about $600 million versus the $540 million we are at today for our domestic ag segment, which implies a shortage of about $60 million. However, if you then consider that backlog remains above targeted levels, while we continue to normalize those turnaround times, our available-for-sale inventory is actually about $100 million short of targeted levels. As for other segments, while there are still key shortages impacting construction and international, their current inventory levels are more or less aligned with targeted levels. But again, do have a few key categories that are still short. Overall, we want to continue to normalize the amount of backlog in inventory and replenish stocking levels of those key equipment categories. Note that these targeted inventory levels take into consideration that we remain focused on those presale activities that Brian touched on earlier and presale is an excellent opportunity to provide more visibility into future sales as well as maintaining higher levels of inventory turns. With that, I'll share a few comments on our fiscal 2024 full-year guidance which we have updated to reflect the year-to-date performance of our businesses and to include an assumption for the partial year impact of the O'Connor's acquisition, which we expect to report as a fourth business segment. The year-to-date performance of our Agriculture segment has been consistent with our expectations, underpinned by strong organic growth and operating performance. We expect that to continue through the back half of this fiscal year. Our Construction segment has been exceeding expectations, and we expect construction activity to continue to support that trend for the rest of the year. As for our International segment, it is performing well but toward the lower end of our previous guidance range. As such, we are reaffirming our assumptions for our Agriculture segment of up 20% to 25%, increasing our assumption for construction to be up 5% to 10% as compared to the previous guidance of flat to up 5%. And modifying our international segment assumption to be up 5% to 10%, as compared to the previous guidance of up 8% to 13%. This adjustment for Europe brings us more in line with industry volume forecast for that region. Before adding the partial year impact of the O'Connor transaction, we are maintaining our expectation for diluted earnings per share with the midpoint of $4.80. Our first-half performance has added to our confidence in achieving the numbers that we presented at the beginning of the fiscal year, and we remain focused on execution for the remainder of the year. With respect to the anticipated partial year impact of the O'Connor transaction, we expect for it to close in the fourth quarter of this calendar year. And for purposes of this estimate, we are assuming a closing date of October 1. Their results will be reported on a one-month lag, so these assumptions would result in three months of activity being reported in our fiscal 2024 results. With all of that said, we have provided an initial revenue estimate of $70 million to $90 million, which translates to a diluted earnings per share contribution in the range of $0.10 to $0.15. Win factoring in financing and integration-related expenses. Adding the acquisition to our guidance, the range has arised to $4.60 to $5.25. Seasonality in the O'Connor business is similar to historical tightened seasonality in that for O'Connors, about 45% of revenues have historically come in the first-half of the year and 55% come in the second-half of the year. O'Connor's business for fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, produced revenue of $258 million pre-tax income of $18.7 million and EBITDA of $21.4 million. Adding estimated financing and integration expenses for the first 12-months of ownership to these results, provides for a run rate pro forma pre-tax income of $13 million or $0.40 of earnings per diluted share. We are excited to welcome the O'Connor's team members to Titan and look forward to providing further updates on this business segment on future earnings calls. This concludes our prepared comments, and we are now ready to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we’ll conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ben Klieve with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBen Klieve: Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter and it looks like a great acquisition as well. I'd like to start with the acquisition. I'm curious kind of the genesis of this acquisition. Was this a function of you guys actively looking to move into Australia and considering a lot of options? Or was O'Connors kind of a kind of unique opportunity that you decided to act on?\nDavid Meyer: Yes. This is Dave. So I actually got to wind a little bit. I think it's one of these classic situations where you had the two family owners, two brothers had both retired. They've been out of the business. I know Dennis O'Connor, I think has been off for 10-years. And put a professional management team in and really didn't have that family succession. So I knew a couple of new years ago that they were probably going to be looking for -- so some of it, they could sell their shares of stock to. And I think as you recall, we just -- last year, we were -- had some Heartland in systems is a pretty important and strategic acquisition. And we didn't -- I didn't really want to come with those two together. But once we got that completed, we got that integrated, I reach out Dennis O'Connor earlier this year and tried to understand the business a little bit, but when you get into that, when you -- definitely, if you look at the case size business in Australia, O'Connor was hands down the market leader in high horsepower equipment. Every year, all the Australian and New Zealand dealers, they get together for an annual meeting, and they have a top dealer award well, O'Connor have won that for the last five years in a row. So you couple that with operating down in the Southeastern of the country and the grain belt and arguably the best farmland in Australia. And I think most important is that proven in the experienced professional management team has been in place for over five years now. Add all of this together, really an old brainer. So we met with the team. Brian went down there and turn the dealership. And it's just on Candy their metrics or financial metrics or cultures or people, the products, everything just almost identical to ours and English language, English base law, low in the corruption scale. I mean just -- it was just really made a lot of sense for us.\nBen Klieve: Yes, it sounds like that's very helpful color. Thank you. Follow-up unrelated to O'Connors but just kind of general kind of sentiment farmer sentiment. I appreciate your comment on kind of the state of the state in your backyard and understand the inventory dynamics that you guys are facing. But I'm wondering if farmer sentiment and buying patterns are being impacted right now at all by the interest rate environment. If you can elaborate on how interest rates over the last, especially six months are impacting their buying patterns, that would be helpful.\nBryan Knutson: Yes. This is Brian. We're still actually having historically higher amount of cash transactions right now and then on a lot of these larger ticket items, we do have manufacturer-supported programs as well and especially as you get into some of the lower horsepower or the more rural lifestyle products. And so definitely, it's an impact and something our farmers are -- producers are watching. It is cutting into their net farm income a little bit. It's one of the contributing factors, along with just a lot of other things which have the price up. But urea and fertilizer being down is helping, and we're still on pace for a really good year. Maybe a lot of different estimates out there around between 15% and 20% below last year's record depending on where yields come in but still on pace for a really good year. They did push a lot of income into this year from last year. And there's a lot of tax incentives still in place, and we're anticipating that farmers are even going to be pushing income from this year into next year. And there was a lot of forward contracting. So still pretty robust, still a fair amount of cash out there, but yes, interest rates are on people's minds, and we do have a lot of different financing tools to help with that.\nDavid Meyer: Yes. The only thing I'd add to that -- the only thing I'd add to that, too, and I think some of the OEMs maybe earlier this year broken down pretty nicely. Interest expense is a fairly small portion of the cost when you're talking about the equation for farm income. So while it has increased, it's -- there's other factors that are much more at play here.\nBen Klieve: Yes, yes. No doubt about that. Very good. Well, that's all very helpful. Congratulations again on a great quarter, and I'll get back in queue.\nDavid Meyer: Thanks, Ben.\nBryan Knutson: Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Rygiel with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you and good morning gentlemen and congratulations on the O'Connor transaction.\nDavid Meyer: Good morning, Alex.\nAlex Rygiel: Questions here. You talked a lot about inventory and that was all very, very helpful. But taking a quick step back, why do you think being at a target inventory level that's comparable to historical levels is appropriate in this higher rate environment that we're in right now?\nDavid Meyer: I would start with saying that the levels we're talking about aren't comparable to historical so if you want to take it back to a prior peak, which I think some people are naturally doing and comparing our total inventory level. I think you have to factor in the cost per unit, right? So we're talking about a significantly smaller number of units per location than we were a decade ago. If you simply ran the math on a 3% increase over a decade, you'd be talking about a like-for-like equipment being 35% higher. And we know with the pricing that we've seen over the past couple of years has been much larger than that. So even on a very conservative basis, you're talking about one-third less number of units out at the locations. And then from there, as we talk about targeted levels, right, we're really focused on our main categories, and it's making sure, again, that we have one or two that are available for demonstration, loaner or display units. And that's just what you need in order to drive the high volume of sales, right? And so that's really what we're talking about. We're missing out on sales opportunities because we don't have those high horsepower items on our lots. And if we did, our sales would be even higher than they are today. So taking a step back, I think it's important to keep all of that in perspective. So we continue to improve our business model, and we want to be as efficient as possible, and we certainly want to focus on presale activities and all of that is good business practices that we'll continue to do going forward.\nAlex Rygiel: That's very helpful. And then back in January, you had some delivery delays. I know it's kind of hard to quantify those, but do you think you're all caught up in those delivery delays?\nBryan Knutson: No, not yet, Alex. In fact, Bo spoke to his prepared comments, our backlog is actually up a little bit sequentially. So no, we anticipate likely at least another couple of quarters before we can get caught up on that. Just our shops are really busy, which is a good thing and we're selling a lot of iron, which is a good thing. And it will just take a little time up. But Bo, anything to add on your end?\nBo Larsen: No. Yes. I think that that's right. We talked about our mix and available-for-sale inventory and wanting to normalize that backlog, and we continue to see opportunity to focus on that at the back half of the year.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you very much.\nDavid Meyer: And one more comment I had to, with some of the supply side issues and some of the conditions, some of the equipment when it's coming out of the factories, too, it's taken us substantially longer per unit to get them through our shops right now. And we're seeing that it started to improve a little bit, and we do think that's going to be probably back to normal towards the end of the year, too. So that will help a lot.\nAlex Rygiel: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ted Jackson with Northland Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nTed Jackson: Thank you and good morning. So I'm going to throw my two questions back as it relates to the O'Connor acquisition. And the first one is just maybe a little more color on the Case IH Australia dealer network. Can you give us some sense in terms of how many locations there are across Australia like kind of maybe the average locations per dealer kind of like who's the next largest dealer, now that you have the largest kind of who's number two, just some metrics to kind of give us a sense with regards to how it compares to the domestic dealer network for Case International Harvester.\nDavid Meyer: So in our discussions with the management team there, they had a pretty well-defined future growth strategy through acquisitions like identified locations. They've been in conversations with different owners. But I'd say it's much different in the United States. You've got -- you don't have a lot of really big dealer groups, at least on the case side, maybe more so on some of the competition. So a lot of family business, smaller businesses. And what I say, I think it's a much more robust consolidation story than what we've even experienced here in the United States. And a lot of smaller groups, family owned. And I think that's just right for consolidation as you continue to adjacent from where they are now. And I think there's really good relationships between our team and some of the existing owners and some good camaraderie. And so -- we just want to do that on a timely and managed approach. But no, I think we -- that's one of the positives about the story is future M&A opportunities.\nBryan Knutson: Yes. And Ted, I would just add on to David. I think you asked what's the next largest. And so O'Connor's footprint in the grain belt there would be there's a CNH dealership with six rooftops. And then you asked what the average is. And so the average is more around two to three locations per.\nTed Jackson: Okay. And do you have any kind of sense in terms of just, I don't know, like the number of locations that are in Australia, just bit of curiosity, just the kind of the whole size of that market, at least from like a location standpoint?\nBryan Knutson: Yes. We know the number definitely in the grain belt and in O'Connor's footprint where we're where our interest level is. There's just -- as David mentioned, I'll just go back to there will likely be a fair amount of consolidation in that area over time here. And we're seeing that with the Deere side as well. RDO equipment that is headquartered out of Fargo here as well. That's a very large John Deere dealer, has 25 locations in Australia has for a long time. You know what, I remember way back when they entered the Australian market, and they continue to add locations and continue to build their presence every year in Australia. And then service equipment, large John Deere dealer just North of us here in Canada has 15 locations, so they're now on basically either side of us. So there is a fair amount of North American presence there now between us and RDO in service.\nTed Jackson: My second question just is in terms of O'Connor's revenue mix. When you look at it from sort of equipment parts, services, rental, et cetera, I mean would you -- is it a mix that's similar to your domestic business here in ag? Or is it more like the international business? I mean, not that they're that much different, but you have a bit more of a skew towards equipment relative to some of the higher-margin stuff internationally than you do domestically. And so I'm just kind of curious if you could give some color on kind of the mix of O'Connor's business and then I'll get in queue again. Thanks.\nBo Larsen: Yes. It's pretty similar to our domestic ag business. The supplemental deck that we posted on our website breaks that down pretty nicely. So looking at a three-year historical average there, equipment sales mix was 82% versus on the U.S. side, ours is more like 77%, 78%. So a couple of percentage points different, but very similar. And that's just one of the many similarities that their business profile and metrics have to our domestic ag business.\nTed Jackson: Okay. Congrats on the quarter and the acquisition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nReid Seay: Hey, guys. This is Reid on for Daniel. Just a couple of questions on margins here. As you noted, we're seeing a lot lower inventory, which should translate to a better gross margin and that should benefit your SG&A to gross margin ratio. Is this a sustainable ratio going forward, assuming inventory stays low? Or how should we be thinking about that?\nBo Larsen: I mean, in talking about back half of the year and our expectations, we touched on fact that we do expect some moderation in the gross margin perspective. But from an operating expense perspective, we expect to remain in line or below prior year as a percentage of sales. And for the full-year, that same story would be true at this point is to be in line or probably a little bit below last year's percentage of sales from those operating expenses.\nReid Seay: Okay, thank you. And on the O'Connors acquisition, it looks like last fiscal year today, finished with gross margin slightly a bit low. Do you all expect to see some synergies uplift that gross margin? Or can you touch on maybe some margin synergies? Just a little more color there would be great.\nBo Larsen: Yes. So in the financials that we provided in the supplemental deck, they had gross margin of 18.7%. I think that's what you're referencing, slightly below ours and then actually had a pretax margin of 7.2%. So the profitability of their business is one of the many things that really attracted us to the management team and their operating model. That margin, if you factor in the fact that they are a little bit more skewed to equipment sales makes a lot of sense and is pretty similar to us. In terms of synergies, I mean, what we're really looking at is focused on a consolidated executive leadership team looking at the business from a global perspective. We want to continue to support that senior management team to execute on the growth strategy that they had in front of them. And then there are some unique opportunities from a service model perspective and being able to provide customers 24/7 type support as we look at the different time zones that we're now operating in as well.\nReid Seay: Right. Thank you all for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mig Dobre with Baird. Please proceed with your question.\nMig Dobre: Good morning. And thank you for the question here.\nBo Larsen: Hi, Mig.\nMig Dobre: I want to go back to the inventory discussion. And I'm sort of curious as to how you think inventories will progress for you for the remainder of the year. It sounds like you'd like more inventory, if available. So as the supply chain is getting better for the OEM, are you sort of inferring here that you're going to continue to build inventories through year-end. So I guess that's part number one. And then related to this, given that so much of your business is now presell, can you comment at all about your presale activity on model year '24 equipment in North America? And then I have some follow-ups. Thanks you.\nBo Larsen: Yes, I'll maybe start with the inventory question, and then Brian might touch on the presales. So from an inventory perspective, we would expect the inventories probably will increase sequentially in the third quarter and then come down a little bit from there in the fourth quarter. We typically see that to be the case. We did mention that largely speaking, from a high horsepower perspective that most of everything that we're going to receive is retail to customers, Of course, we need to turn that around with predelivery inspection. So again, we'll see what we're able to do with normalizing that backlog. And those are really the factors that are at play from a bigger picture perspective in terms of the increase that we've seen year-to-date versus what we would expect in the back half of the year, the back half would -- should be a lot less than what we saw in the first-half. And again, the first-half was kind of -- very welcome to get us replenished levels on some of these other categories, back half, a smaller modest increase, and again, focusing on normalizing that backlog.\nBryan Knutson: Yes. Mig, this is Bryan. I would just add we're definitely trying to be really clear that we are short in certain key product categories, and those are the areas that we're looking to get more in. But as you know, there are other product categories where we're finally feeling pretty good about where we're at. We've been running low for quite a while now. And then there are a couple of other product categories that we talked about last call that we have a little bit excess of smaller tractors in some of those. And so I think you see it implied in our guidance is us being proactive about just in the second-half here, cleaning up that mix a little bit. So we're positioned really well for next year and hope that some of these key product categories will open up. And so we're proactively addressing these few smaller categories where we're a little long, and that's what you see in the anticipated margins that we've got reflected most dealers, I know they wouldn't do that. They wouldn't be feeling the pressure yet that stuff isn't aged. And so we really just want to -- are cognizant of our healthy mix and are being proactive there. And to your presale question, as you know, the OEMs are keeping the order books really tight here. They're not out very far -- these key product categories are on allocation. And so as Bo said, we're we just finally are out into '24 now. And with our first tranche of early orders there, we've got names on all those key product category units.\nMig Dobre: But again, do you get a sense that volumetrically demand for model year '24 is up relative to 23. And I ask the question because it matters within the context of inventories building on your balance sheet and in the industry more broadly.\nBryan Knutson: No, I would say demand is still very similar to how it's been in those key product categories. But importantly, demand has been outpacing supply now for a long time on those. And then normalized in the other product categories. So yes, I don't see demand increasing here as we've got a little bit lower net farm incomes and likewise on the construction side, but demand is still strong. And again, as I mentioned, our order boards in those key product categories, we're still selling everything we can get for the allocation we have so far.\nDavid Meyer: David, I'll just reiterate my comment. I don't see us getting sold sprayers, all wheel orders or forward-drive tractors, in any quantities of stock until at the earliest second-half of 2024, that's how tight it is.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Larry De Maria with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry De Maria: Yes, thanks. Good morning. First question, let's just pick up where we left off there. On the early order programs in presales -- and what is the message that you're -- we're sort of seeing on calendar 2024. I mean I understand that obviously, there's orders and there's short supply. So first of all, are there any cancellations out there that we're seeing? And to BJ's question point about demand not getting stronger, are we seeing I don't know talking about a flat calendar 2024 at this point. What's the specific messaging on what the order programs are telling you about next year?\nBryan Knutson: Yes, I think so, Larry, so to answer your first question, no cancellation still and yes, '24 is a long ways out at this point but that's flattish is kind of our anticipation at this point for demand perspective. But again, then you got to work in the fact that we need production availability to increase in these key product categories, and we haven't been able to keep up there with demand and that fleet continues to get older in those certain product categories.\nDavid Meyer: Maybe what you're asking a little bit, I'd say farmer sentiment might be tempered a little bit, like you say, there's a lot of noise out there. There's interest rates, things like that. But it said so much demand before and the production levels were so much below previous peaks that the demand is still good. But maybe farmer settlement might be off a little bit, but I have a deal with farmers for over 40 years. They're always pretty negative. But there is some noise out there in that, but still the demand is still outpacing supply and high horsepower.\nBryan Knutson: Yes, good point, Dave.\nLarry De Maria: Okay. Thank you. And then can you give us some color on the second-half? Obviously, a good quarter. Construction looking stronger and you're actually a little lower. It seems like the core guide, ex-O'Connor should be going up, not staying flat for the year, which would imply maybe a lower second-half than the expectations in the consensus numbers? So can you talk about expectation in the second-half? Or is there a deceleration? Or is it just really about not getting production or not having confidence in the production and then a fiscal 3Q versus 4Q sales split? Thanks.\nBo Larsen: Yes, a couple pieces of commentary on that, right? I'd say -- from a top line perspective, if you look at same-store sales growth on our domestic ag business, it's been about 7% in the first-half of the year. We expect something similar in the second-half of the year. Then you layer on any growth expected from a Heartland perspective, which given some of the commentary about sprayer production, we'd expect their growth to be north of those levels. Mathematically speaking, from a margin perspective, we've been touching on it, right? But that's where some of the math comes into play to get to the results. So the top line is very much what we've been discussing and reiterated the guidance. And gross margin moderation is something we've been talking about since the beginning of the year. So year-over-year in Q3 and Q4 we would expect margins to be lower than they were in the prior year. And that would be for a number of reasons, including what Bryan was touching on a little bit earlier. And then from a split perspective, we would expect Q3 to be our highest quarter and Q4 to be a little less than that, but more than what we just saw in the second quarter. So that's also consistent with the expectations that we had put out there previously. The other thing just to help you out and doing your math and getting to where we come out to from an expectation perspective is you did see other interest expense higher in the second quarter, and we would expect that in the third and fourth quarter as well, certainly, as you're comparing to the prior year period. So put all that together and take a step back, what we're really doing is reiterating a guidance midpoint of $4.80, which is outside of the O'Connors acquisition, which is on top of last year's record results. And if you really zoom out and talk about where we're at today, with our earnings power versus where we were in the prior peak, we were talking about $2 per share looking good. So again, we've spoken this year about higher confidence in achieving average pretax margins north of 5% through the cycle. The reasons why we have confidence in getting there, focusing on our organic growth through market share gains and continuing to execute on our pipeline. So for us, and I hope you hear it, we're nothing but excited about how the rest of the year shapes up and how we're going to be well positioned to continue to execute next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Steve Dyer with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Please proceed with your question.\nRyan Sigdahl: Good morning, Brian, Bo. Ryan on for Steve. Just want to follow up on that last time. And I guess when you say Q3 highest, is that the core business, excluding the acquisition just made of O'Connors or is that all in Q3 will be the highest revenue?\nBo Larsen: Yes. No, that's a great point, and thanks for allowing me the opportunity to clarify that. That was our expectation, excluding the O'Connors acquisition. So then we layer the O'Connor's acquisition on top of that. So I appreciate that.\nRyan Sigdahl: Good. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you realize any manufacturing incentives in Q2? And then what are your assumptions within guidance for the back half of the year regarding incentives?\nBo Larsen: Yes. Another opportunity for me to clarify there. So last year, we started to accrue for manufacturer incentives in the second quarter to the tune of $2.6 million. This year, we haven't yet done that, just aligning again with the cadence of production that we're expecting and for that to continue to increase in the back half of the year, and we just talked about our expectations in the second-half from a volume perspective, i.e., the second-half being larger than the first-half. So we definitely expect to recognize similar levels. Overall for the year, it will just fall in the back half of the year as opposed to starting incrementally last year to recognize that $2.6 million a year in the quarter.\nRyan Sigdahl: Great. Thanks, Bo. Good luck guys.\nBo Larsen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Meyer for any final comments.\nDavid Meyer: All right. Thanks, everybody, for your participation and your interest in Titan Machinery, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call. So have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our conference today. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

Welcome to our first quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. On today's call, I will provide a summary of our results. And then Brian Knutson, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will give an overview for each of our business segments. Bo Larsen, our CFO, will then review financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and conclude with some commentary around fiscal 2024 full year expectations. We're off to a solid start to fiscal 2024 with strong first quarter results consistent with our expectations going into the year. Revenue increased 23.6% to $569.6 million in the first quarter, which represents record first quarter revenues supplemented with significant contributions from our most recent acquisitions. The combination of Mark's Machinery, Heartland and Pioneer acquisitions added $94 million of revenue in the first quarter, and we couldn't be happier with how integration has been going so far with each of these acquisitions. Notably, each of our operating segments achieved expansion in pretax margins versus the prior year period. This drove consolidated pretax margin of 6.2% and diluted earnings per share of $1.19, which was over 53% higher than last year's earnings performance. Our Agriculture segment revenue grew 33%, benefiting from our recent acquisitions and reflecting healthy underlying industry fundamentals and strong customer demand. Across all our segments, our equipment business remains very healthy, yet constrained due to an insufficient inventory and delivery delays in key product categories. Our parts and service business also performed well despite a later start to the planting season in some of our northern U.S. markets and in our European footprint. We are poised for this momentum to carry into fiscal second quarter as our agriculture customers complete their spring field work and construction activity gets into full swing. We are well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that lie ahead and are committed to providing world-class service to our customers and delivering strong results for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Knutson for his segment review.\nBryan Knutson: Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. I will now provide a recap of our fiscal first quarter segment drivers, and then review some of our high-level expectations for the balance of fiscal year 2024 across our respective segments. I'll begin with our domestic Agriculture segment, which produced organic growth on top of last year's strong performance, which was further bolstered by revenue contributions from our most recent acquisitions. This segment also realized another solid quarter of margin performance, with pretax profitability expanding by 50 basis points versus the prior year period to 5.7%, driven by improved equipment margins that benefited from a combination of strong demand and product mix. While planting progress is largely on track across the farm belt, we are experiencing some delays in our northern markets due to the late spring. Our same-store sales growth in the first quarter reflects the delayed start to spring field work, as well as the continued limitations on equipment availability and timing of deliveries for cash crop products. In terms of elements that we have control of, our team is doing an excellent job. We are focused on receiving in performing pre-delivery inspections, installing additional components and then delivering presold equipment to customers as quickly as possible. However, as I previously noted, the timing for that process varies from several weeks to several months, and we continue to see higher levels of presold equipment and inventory at the end of the first quarter. In addition to having presold inventory, our sales team is excited about now having some stock inventory at hand that is available for sale, which puts us in a better position to serve customer demand on products like harvest equipment, small tractors and certain tillage equipment than we were a year ago. We are also working hard to deliver best-in-class service and support through our parts and service business, and we remain very active in the evaluation of M&A opportunities. Fiscal 2023 was a big year for us in that regard, having acquired 22 store locations since December of 2021. I expect that we'll continue to see additional acquisitions as we move forward to complement our intense focus on organic growth. All of our current integrations are going well, and we are very pleased with how the businesses are coming together. Looking to the balance of fiscal 2024 for Agriculture segment, we believe we are on track to meet our modeling assumptions that we laid out at the beginning of the year. Net farm income remains well above historical averages and continues to support demand for equipment purchases. We expect this to sustain demand throughout the fiscal year and for demand to continue to outpace supply in many cash crop products. While there are equipment shortages and long lead times, we have a solid order board and have incorporated all of these factors into our modeling assumptions that we are reiterating today. Shifting to our domestic Construction segment, we are benefiting from our diversified customer base as well as the less volatile Midwest construction market dynamics. Construction activity was strong throughout our footprint during our fiscal first quarter and we generated a great performance across the board, with same-store sales growth of 9.9% and excellent pretax margin expansion of 150 basis points to 6.3%. We also achieved rental fleet dollar utilization of 26.8% and absorption of 86.2%. Our expectations for fiscal 2024 remain high. General construction activity remains strong and infrastructure projects are expected to support demand for construction equipment throughout the 2024 fiscal year. Not unlike our Ag segment, equipment availability is a limiting factor in the near term for certain types of equipment. However, we continue to feel good about our ability to achieve our full year modeling assumptions for this segment. Now moving on to our overview of our International segment, which represents our businesses within the countries of Bulgaria, Germany, Romania and Ukraine. The year-over-year decline in revenue was driven by the weakening of the euro. However, net of the effect of these foreign currency fluctuations, first quarter sales grew by 2.8%. Overall, our business within the countries of Bulgaria, Germany and Romania has been performing very well. While the region experienced a later start to the spring planting season, the recent rainfall has benefited early crop development, which is creating some optimism among producers. We are very pleased to see the continued operating leverage in our International segment, particularly during the quarter where we realized a slight decrease in our reported revenues. In the first quarter, we expanded our pretax margin by 290 basis points to an impressive 8.6%.  Looking toward the balance of fiscal year 2024, European Ag fundamentals are expected to be more moderate in nature with flat industry volumes. And this segment is not immune to the equipment availability issues that we see across the other segments of our business. However, we expect to continue to trend in a favorable direction as we execute on our growth strategy. Before I turn the call over to Bo, I'd like to sincerely thank our employees for their ongoing dedication to our customers. This was another great quarter for our business and is the result of their individual contributions and ability to overcome challenges and find solutions.  With that, I will turn the call over to Bo to review our financial results in more detail.\nBo Larsen: Thanks, Bryan. Starting with our consolidated results for the fiscal 2024 first quarter, total revenue was $569.6 million an increase of 23.6% compared to the prior year period. Our equipment revenue increased 20.5% versus the prior year period, led by incremental revenue from our recent acquisitions as well as positive same-store sales growth across our Agriculture and Construction segments. Our parts revenue grew 40.9%, service revenue grew 18.3% and rental and other revenue increased 32.9% versus the prior year period. Gross profit for the first quarter increased 33.7% to $119 million. Reported gross profit margin increased by 160 basis points, driven primarily by improved equipment margins, which benefited from strong demand and favorable product mix. Consistent with the first quarter of the prior year, there was no recognition of manufacturer incentives as we will wait until we get further into the year to make these types of accruals for accounting purposes. Operating expenses were $81.3 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $64.2 million in the prior year. The year-over-year increase of 26.8% was primarily due to the inclusion of operating expenses related to our acquisitions over the past year, as well as higher variable expenses on increased revenues. Floor plan and other interest expense was $2.5 million as compared to $1.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to higher interest-bearing floor plan borrowings. Net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was $27 million, or $1.19 per diluted share, and compared to last year's first quarter net income of $17.5 million or $0.78 per diluted share. Now turning to our segment results for the first quarter. In our Agriculture segment, sales increased 32.9% to $423.2 million. This growth was driven by our recent acquisitions of Mark's Machinery, Heartland Ag and Pioneer, as well as organic growth of 3.8%. As has already been mentioned in our commentary, first quarter revenues continued to be constrained by equipment availability of high-demand cash crop product categories, which limited our ability to drive higher same-store sales growth for the quarter. With these same equipment categories on allocation through at least the fourth quarter of this calendar year, this demand-supply imbalance is expected to carry over into fiscal year 2025. Agriculture segment pretax income was $24.2 million when compared to $16.4 million in the first quarter of the prior year, which implies a pretax margin increase of 50 basis points to 5.7%. In our Construction segment, sales increased to 7.5% to $72 million compared to the prior year period. Same-store sales growth of 9.9% drove the increase, which was slightly offset by the divestiture of the North Dakota consumer product store in the prior year. Pretax income was $4.5 million and compared to $3.2 million in the first quarter of the prior year. As a reminder, in the prior year's first quarter, we’ve recorded a $1.4 million gain associated with the aforementioned divestiture. Excluding that gain, our year-over-year pretax margin increased by approximately 370 basis points to 6.3%, just a solid overall performance by the Construction segment, as Bryan touched on in his comments. In our International segment, sales decreased by 1.4% to $74.4 million, which reflects a 4.6% currency headwind on a weakening euro. Net of the effect of these foreign currency fluctuations, the segment achieved sales growth of 2.8%, which included a modest year-over-year decline in Ukraine as it remains impacted by the ongoing conflict. Limited availability of cash crop products is a factor here, just like in our domestic ag segment. Pretax income was $6.4 million and compares to $4.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which implies a pretax margin increase of 290 basis points to 8.6%. Equipment margins for the International segment were very strong and benefited from some timing windfalls, which we do not expect to reoccur. As such, we expect those margins to moderate off of these unusually high levels as we progress through the rest of the year. Now on to our balance sheet and inventory position. We had cash of $38 million and an adjusted tangible net worth ratio of 1.0 as of April 30, 2023. Our total inventory balance at the end of the first quarter was $854.2 million, an increase of approximately $150.2 million during the quarter. This increase came via growth in equipment and parts inventories of $144.6 million and $4.1 million, respectively. Of the total increase, $22 million is attributable to the Pioneer acquisition, which was made during the first quarter. It might be helpful to talk through inventory changes, excluding acquisition-related balances. As you heard on recent OEM earnings calls and in our commentary today, much of the high horsepower cash crop products remain on allocation for the full year and depending on the product, we have minimal inventory that is available for sale as many units on hand are awaiting pre-delivery inspection activities and delivery to the customer. On the other hand, demand for items like low horsepower tractors has softened and the inventory has returned to more historical levels. Specifically, for harvest, hay and tillage equipment, we have seen some normalization in inventory available for sale but not back to historical levels, and this increase should be helpful for our sales team as they look to fulfill customer demand before fall field activities commence. We foresee a little more build in new equipment inventory in the second quarter before leveling off and decreasing as we work through the rest of the fiscal year. Overall inventory available for sale is below targeted levels, with timing and other constraints causing higher-than-normal levels of presold units sitting in inventory at a given point in time. Consistent with our comments from our last earnings call in March, we expect to continue to work through these timing issues as we progress throughout the year. With that, I'll share a few comments on our fiscal 2024 full year guidance, which we are reiterating today for the company as a whole and for each of our segments. Our first quarter performance was consistent with the expectations that we had coming into the year. Market conditions remained positive, and demand remained high across our segments. Commodity prices have come down somewhat, but so have farm input costs, and it's expected to be another good year for net farm income and for it to be above the 10-year average. Preliminary visibility into fourth quarter allocation has been provided and aligns with previous expectations. These allocation levels confirm there is excess demand versus supply for several types of cash crop products, which will carry demand into fiscal 2025. These levels also suggest that the existing fleet will continue to age for products, like high horsepower tractors. On the other hand, Inventory levels are normalizing for other types of equipment and correspondingly, we expect equipment margins to moderate off of last year's all-time records as we progress throughout the year. OEM production and timing of deliveries are expected to continue to improve throughout the year. Our acquisitions are meeting our high expectations, and the labor market remains competitive, especially as it relates to scaled product support positions. Overall, we are off to a strong start to the year. And with our current level of presold inventory and continued strong demand, we are confident in our guidance range of $4.50 to $5.10 on a diluted earnings per share basis, which we are reiterating today. This concludes our prepared comments. We can now open up the line for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Alex Rygiel with B. Riley. Please proceed with your question. Alex, is your line on mute? \nAlex Rygiel: Good morning. And sorry about that. If we come back to inventory as a topic, you mentioned that insufficient inventory and product delays in certain key product lines, I know you went through that a little bit. But can you expand upon that a little bit more?\nBryan Knutson: Yes. Good morning, Alex, this is Bryan. Yes, I think it's important, as Bo and I both tried to do in the prepared remarks, to delineate within the different inventory or product categories. So as we mentioned, certainly, lower horsepower tractors have been normalizing. We have been getting in some stock inventory for those, which is great. That's traditionally a product that does sell more out of stock than presale and it's the type of thing you like to have on hand. So we're optimistic about that improving. So that's leading definitely to some of the increase again, still feel really good about that level. And then as Bo mentioned, other areas, harvest equipment, certain tillage, hay and forage, not quite back to historical levels yet. But we have seen some improvement in those levels. Also, there's some timing things with those products as well. We feel good about that as well with the way our cattle prices are right now, looking for a great season here in hay and forage. And then as you get into a lot of the cash crop products, Alex, you look at things like four-wheel drive tractors, magnum, sprayers, a lot of that critical cash crop equipment that's critical to our business as well. It's still an extremely short supply on allocation and continues to be really short of demand. And as Bo mentioned, that really, at this point, will carry into FY '25 now for us. And I guess just to maybe delineate between the sales WIP that we talked about as well as the on-hand inventory. And so again, sales WIP, like we talked about last quarter, there's just an increase in the number of things. We need to do to units right now that are arriving from our manufacturers over historical levels. And then also the components that we put on are also impacted by the supply chain. So we are seeing longer turnover times to get those out to our customers and get the revenue recognized as well. But important to point out, the available for-sale inventory in many of those key cash crop categories is extremely low and much lower than we'd like.\nAlex Rygiel: And then just so we could maybe sort of understand, how long do you think lead times for high horsepower equipment are still going to be sort of extended?\nBryan Knutson: So right now, we have visibility into our fiscal '25. And so definitely through then, Alex.\nAlex Rygiel: Great. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question is from Daniel Imbro with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. \nJoseph Enderlin: Hey guys, this is Joe Enderlin on for Daniel. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to start out on revenue growth. You saw around 25% growth this quarter. Could you maybe break out how much of that would be from the demand aligned with the first quarter? And then how much was driven by the delay in shipments last quarter? Do you expect the revenue from that delay in shipments to be relatively evenly spaced over this year? Or is there any change in how you're thinking about the cadence?\nBryan Knutson: Yes. No, I appreciate the question. So as we talked about at the end of last year, and you were referencing the $100 million push and us discussing working through that as we progress through the year, our view and we continue to have confidence in the fact that we can continue to see improvement in production and delivery cadence as we progress throughout the year. In other words, it gets better quarter over quarter over quarter. So, in terms of the $100 million specifically, right, like those units are units that were delivered in the quarter. But it's a similar carryover from Q1 to Q2. So I guess we see getting another bite -- a larger bite at that apple as we work through the year.\nJoseph Enderlin: That makes sense. Thank you. As a follow-up, in the slides, you noted you're still actively looking for acquisitions in the ag sector. Could you maybe provide some color on how seller multiples are trending in this market? And then are you seeing more sellers come to market?\nDavid Meyer: Well, I'd say there are definitely some motivated sellers out there, Joe, as you see the interest rates increasing and increased cost of equipment and all the capital needs with that, increased OEM demands, this complexity and sophistication of these equipment and the shortage of the skilled product support people out there to support that equipment. We're getting into a new round of regulations, employer mandates. There are challenges out there, especially on the HR side from the recruiting and retaining of employees. So definitely, we're seeing that continued consolidation ownership. And yes, I think there's a good pipeline out there and we continue to focus on integrating the acquisition we did. But at the same time, we're actively looking for quality and strategic acquisitions going ahead. And there is the pipeline it's consistent to what we've seen in the last couple of years.\nBryan Knutson: And maybe just a little bit more from a multiples perspective, right? I mean we maintained discipline. The company has been in acquisitions for a long time. And so that's not necessarily something that's changing. Clearly, the average dealer is doing more revenue and more EBITDA today than they were a few years ago. So that's there. But from a multiple perspective, that's not something that we're seeing evolve, at least not the way we approach acquisitions.\nJoseph Enderlin: That’s helpful. Thanks guys. That’s all for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Larry De Maria with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nLarry De Maria: Thanks and good morning. First question regarding allocations. Obviously, you had some comments on those, but in your discussion with Scott and the final outcome here, kind of curious magnitude of what you got versus what you asked for. Can you kind of talk about how that played out for you? And maybe, let's say, how short you are versus where you want to be? And related to that, is the current full allocation, is it complete? Is that fully embedded into your guide? And do you think you can go out and get more of that stuff that you're reasonably short of this year, kind of like you've did in the last couple of years, sort of more in the open market?\nBryan Knutson: Yes. Thanks, Larry. So I'll start with -- on the allocation, again, it really depends on the product category. But in several of our key product categories, I think it's important to separate into, you asked what we want versus what we got. Then there's the other bucket of what we got versus what we expected to get. And so that's definitely in line. What we're getting is roughly in line with the information they've given us as we work closely with them since allocation came out here about a year ago. And we certainly -- it really does depend on the product category, Larry, but there are some certain product categories where we would like at least 50% more than what we are able to get. So as Bo mentioned, as you know, that does elongate the cycle here specifically and especially in those product categories. And it does -- we're really seeing some aged fleets now in those certain product categories as well. So that's an additional driver to our parts and service business, though, as you know. So that's the positive side of it. And -- then again, it'll likely be into next year before we even see signs of catch-up. And depending on how supply chain recovers in those areas as well as some of the production constraints, it could even be -- we could be sitting at the end of next year and still not be quite to the levels we want in some of those product categories.\nLarry De Maria: Okay, that's good color. Thank you. And maybe staying there, the -- obviously, crop prices are lower, which we all know. And you noted that obviously in for question lower as well. Can you just really give us a real-time update of what you're seeing? Obviously, talking about strong demand, but have these lower prices start to matriculate through the system at all in terms of in your conversations and sort of, like, let's say, real-time ordering out there? And then also related to that, any real impact to North Dakota late planting season? Or is that just going to get caught up and be okay?\nBryan Knutson: Sure. So a lot of our customers do a lot of planning with their advisers and tax consultants and so on, and a lot of income average unit. So there was a lot of income pushed out of last year into this year are deferred. We expect to see that again. Also with grain sales, a lot of our customers are working with very professional marketers as well. So there is a nice percentage of the crop that is sold now, to hedge if commodity prices do come down further. So just much healthier there than if you look back a couple of decades ago in terms of the professionalism our customers are bringing to the marketing side and again, the tax planning side. So we -- a lot of optimism from our growers, it's still an extremely profitable year overall. And again, the inputs coming down also will help with that.  In terms of what we anticipate going forward -- or excuse me, how it impacted North Dakota and, really, Minnesota as well with the late spring, is some of that timing you see in some of our numbers maybe and how things could flow to one quarter or the other in terms of parts and service business, recognizing some of the revenue. Certainly, with all the work that we've had to do with the equipment coming in for the manufacturers, again, I mentioned there's additional work that what we normally see, which we believe will correct itself as we get into next year. But -- and then some of those components we're putting on being delayed as well. So Dave also mentioned the labor shortages across our industry with skilled labor. So we're having to prioritize, Larry, the equipment that we get out that was critical for spring planting. So now we'll get after some of the summer and fall equipment. But from a yield impact perspective, a lot of our growers are going to be getting the crop in the ground here in North Dakota and Minnesota. Very similar timing to last year, which still generated above-average yields. And so at this point, don't expect much other than timing, at least that's our expectation.\nLarry De Maria: That's great. Thank you for that color. If I could just sneak one more quick question. Sales were light on, especially on the ag side, obviously, good bottom line performance overall. How did the ag sales in the quarter different from your expectations? And was that more delivery delays and kind of spillover from the prior quarter? Or is there something else that caused the ag sales to miss?\nBryan Knutson: Yes, I'll let Bo comment mostly here. But generally, from my end was timing and the constraints that we had on equipment and equipment shipments. And again, getting the stuff out the door and onto our customers' hands to recognize the revenue. But yes, just anything you have to add, Bo?\nBo Larsen: Yes. And I would just say so, I mean, largely overall, things came in as expected. If there was any softness, it would be on the ag side. And I'd say still pretty well aligned with what we expected. Now what we want to do for our customers and deliver for them, we would have loved to fulfill more of that demand. And yes, it was largely what we've been talking about here today, and it's really the cadence of receiving those higher demand cash crop units in and being able to turn them around. That would be the area we want to continue to see improved and that we have confidence will continue to improve through the year.\nLarry De Maria: Okay. Thank you. Good luck.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mig Dobre with Baird. Please proceed with your question. \nJoe Grabowski: Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Joe Grabowski on for Mig this morning. I thought I'd ask a question on equipment gross margin. It was quite strong for a first quarter. I was wondering if Heartland maybe impacted it favorably? And you also mentioned product mix aided margin in the quarter. I was wondering if maybe you could provide a little more color there?\nBo Larsen: Yes, I'll help you out with that a little bit, and two things. I would say that there was a bit of a timing on the international side, which was exceptionally strong, and I'll talk about that, and then the product mix. So from an international perspective, what we were really alluding to on the timing side of things is kind of the timing of when we ordered products and what price increases had or hadn't come through yet. By the time we received products and we're able to sell them in the market, prices had gone up, and there was an opportunity to sell at the current value, so expect a little bit more profitability there. And then that will kind of have wrapped up in the first quarter here. We don't foresee that continuing the rest of the year. More broadly speaking, and we did see strong margins across our segments. But specifically with ag because we know that drives a lot of what goes on here. The understanding, the dynamics of the cash crop units and those kind of being slower to go out the door and foreseeing more of that happening as we progress throughout the year. Those big ticket items with high price tags tend to have lower margins than some of the hay and forage and other, and tillage and other areas. So what we really saw from a mix perspective, what we're talking about there is some of the equipment that we sell from short lines and some of these smaller ticket items, they carry a higher margin and they were more of that mix. And again, for expectations for the rest of the year, as we drive sequential growth in volume and get more of this cash crop equipment sent out to customers, that comes at a little lower margin, and that's one of the reasons we talk about, the margin changing sequentially as we progress throughout the year.\nJoe Grabowski: Got it. Okay, that makes sense. Thank you for that. And then maybe just a couple of questions on the construction business. Maybe talk about some of the demand trends you're seeing there. Is the infrastructure bill starting to lift demand? And maybe are there any headwinds from some of the commercial lending issues we've seen? And then maybe secondarily, you mentioned some equipment availability issues in construction. Maybe expand on that.\nBryan Knutson: Yes, Joe, I'll just talk -- we -- up here in the upper Midwest, it's been a strong economy overall. So a lot of our customers had a great year last year. A lot of their demand and thus our equipment demand is carrying now into this year. And the fleet has also been getting really aged out there on the construction side from lack of availability in the last two years now. And so again, carrying demand. Also with the lot of these small independent rental houses that we deal with are also have very aged fleets, again, due to the construction constraints of the last two years. And so they're still looking to replenish their fleets. We haven't been able to do a lot of that yet. And then again, those key product categories, as you mentioned. So very similar to ag. Some of our core legacy products that we do really well with, which are -- some of those are some big ticket items, are on allocation. And again, very short of and we'll continue to grab every one of those we can find and continue to push for more units, or to get our hands on more of those and hope to fulfill demand. But that will be pushed out very similar to the high horsepower tractors and some of those things that we mentioned on the ag side.\nJoe Grabowski: Okay, great. I leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question is from Steve Dyer with Craig Hallum. Please proceed with your question. \nRyan Sigdahl: Good morning, Ryan on for Steve. I want to start with parts supports growth. It was effectively double service growth on the revenue side this quarter. I guess, what caused that outsized strength in parts, vis-a-vis service? And then secondly to that, are you having any supply constraints getting core parts inventory?\nBryan Knutson: So from a growth perspective, parts growth was fairly well aligned with overall ag growth, and some of that came with the acquisitions. But also busy spring, getting people ready for field work.  You asked about the dynamic. Why isn't the service growth in line with that parts growth? Some of the service effort, right -- a lot of service effort is focused on getting those new units ready, pre-delivery inspection, installing products like parts, for example. And that doesn't get charged to service revenue. That's going to be part of a new whole good process. So that's a factor there. As there's -- we'd love to have more service tech so that we can accomplish everything at the same time. But with some of the congestion we've discussed and focused on getting new whole goods delivered, that's why you'd see the softer side of the service. And then again, back to parts, I just see it more in line kind of with what we're seeing in other areas of the business.\nDavid Meyer: And I would just add on your question right, about the parts availability. We've definitely seen some improvement lately in that. However, still not where we'd like to see. We still have longer lead times than we'd like. We still are struggling to get some parts. And then as an example, our back order lines are still well above where we would -- the levels we'd like to see or met.  Now on the flip side, you look at -- it is much improved compared to some of those key cash crop equipment categories like we said, where we just haven't seen any improvement.\nRyan Sigdahl: And then just for my second question, are any customers willing or even able to shift down to lower horsepower equipment or some of the inventory that you have better supply of? Or are they effectively forced to wait and thus building that almost two-year type pipeline of demand for those high horsepower and in-demand tractors and combines?\nBryan Knutson: Yes, there'd be a few rare exceptions. But in almost every case, they're forced to have to wait.\nDavid Meyer: Yes. And just to add on to that, in some cases, it creates a -- we've got some really nice late model used equipment. And all of a sudden, maybe some of these customer is going to switch from a new purchase to a late model used purchase. And we need to use through the pipeline too. So that's helpful to move the used equipment.\nBryan Knutson: Yes. And then also just adding, that does really help with the future pipeline and the presell is, I guess, the positive is it gives those customers and their tax accounts and advisers plenty of time to plan their business and helps us plan our business, helps them lock in and get the specs that they want and so on. But yes, again, on the specific product category, still dealing with longer lead times than we would like and then our customers would like.\nRyan Sigdahl: That’s it for me. Thanks guys. Good luck.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to David Meyer for any closing comments.\nDavid Meyer: All right. Thank you, everyone, for taking time for our call, and thanks for your interest in Titan Machinery, and we look forward to updating you on our progress on our next call. So have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
