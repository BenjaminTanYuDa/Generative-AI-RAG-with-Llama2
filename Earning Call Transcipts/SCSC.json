Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Mary Gentry, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nMary Gentry: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Joining me on the call today are Mike Baur, our Chair and CEO, and Steve Jones, our Chief Financial Officer. We will review our operating results for the quarter and then take your questions. We posted an earnings infographic that accompanies our comments and webcast in the Investor Relations section of our website. As you know, certain statements in our press release, infographic and on this call are forward-looking statements and subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. These risks and uncertainties include the factors identified in our earnings release and in our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2023. Forward-looking statements represent our views only as of today, and ScanSource disclaims any duty to update these statements, except as required by law. During our call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP results and have provided reconciliations on our website and in our Form 8-K. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Baur: Thanks, Mary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As we entered fiscal year 2024, we identified strong free cash flow and focus on Intelisys as keys for our success. For our second quarter, we achieved this aim with free cash flow of $61 million and Intelisys growth of 7.5%. Our business fundamentals remain strong. However, we were disappointed at our lower-than-expected net sales for our hardware business. As it turns out, we were too optimistic in a changing demand environment. Second quarter net sales declined 13%, reflecting lower demand from our portfolio of technologies. Net sales for our Intelisys Technology Services business grew 7.5% and drove our recurring revenue growth. Q2 end user billings increased 10% year-over-year and exceed $2.6 billion annualized. This includes billings growth in Contact Center as a Service CCaaS of 24% and UCaaS of 18%. As long-standing channel advocates and thought leaders, we meet our partners where they are and help them grow their business. A recent example is our series of AMP'd for Growth educational events, we held the first one last week featuring AI and Communication Platform as a Service CPaaS opportunities. During Q2, barcode, mobility, point-of-sale, security and communications hardware sales declined more than we expected. As we have discussed in previous quarters, strong growth continued from our Cisco portfolio of products and services and our networking products. Our hardware technologies are at different stages of their demand cycles. During the supply chain crisis over the last couple of years, we experienced broad-based demand across our technologies. We used our strong balance sheet to minimize inventory shortages while enabling our customers to meet stronger than normal demand. End users purchased inventory ahead of their needs, and they are taking time to deploy these products. In this environment, forecasting demand is very challenging. And as a reminder, at ScanSource, we work with no backlogs and no bookings. For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA and improved working capital efficiency generated another strong quarter of free cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to Steve to take you through our financial results for the quarter and our outlook for fiscal year 2024.\nSteve Jones: Thanks, Mike. Q2 demand was softer than we expected. While revenues were lower, our business delivered EBITDA margins consistent with our expectations and strong free cash flow. We continued to improve our key working capital metrics and recurring revenues grew led by 7.5% year-over-year growth in Intelisys. Q2 net sales of $885 million declined 12.5% year-over-year, while gross profit margins of 11.4% were in line with the prior year. While we expected a year-over-year revenue decline, the recovery for our barcode and mobility technology is occurring slower than we expected, and we saw a slowdown sooner than expected in physical security. These technologies are reported in our Specialty Technology & Solutions segment, which saw a revenue decline of 17% year-over-year and a corresponding 17% year-over-year decline in gross profit. In our Modern Communication and Cloud segment, revenues declined 5% year-over-year. Growth in Cisco partially offset lower sales of communication devices. Gross profits in our Modern Communication and Cloud segment declined 9% year-over-year, reflecting an unfavorable product mix. For the quarter, we delivered $61 million in free cash flow with solid progress on improving our working capital efficiency. Inventory levels and paid for inventory days continue to improve, reflecting both a return to normal supply chain lead times and our expectation of demand. Accounts receivable balances are moving with revenue as we would expect. We are setting the business up to continue to deliver positive free cash flow when our business returns to growth. Now going a bit deeper into the balance sheet and cash flow. We are pleased with the progress we are making with working capital investment. Our goal is to increase inventory turns while maintaining appropriate inventory levels to meet customer demand. We gained working capital efficiency as demonstrated by improvements in our working capital metrics. Q2 inventory turns increased to 5.1 times, the fastest in five quarters. Days sales outstanding also improved and declined to 68 days, the lowest in five quarters. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a net debt leverage perspective, we ended Q2 at approximately 0.8 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA, with ample liquidity within our existing credit facility to support our strategic plans. We have an active pipeline of M&A opportunities. However, we believe there is ample room on our existing $65 million authorization to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases for the remainder of FY '24, while maintaining our target leverage ratio of 1 to 2 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA. Looking ahead to the second half of FY '24, the company expects revenue headwinds to continue, and we are updating our guidance to reflect our current view of near-term demand. We are managing our SG&A spending to match our revenue growth expectations for FY '24 and beyond by redirecting resources and investing in our Intelisys recurring revenue business. For FY '24, we now believe that our net sales will be at least $3.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be at least $155 million, which reflects an EBITDA margin of 4.4%. For Q3, we expect net sales to be down 6% to 8% quarter-over-quarter, which is better than our typical Q3 seasonality. We are maintaining our free cash flow outlook of at least $200 million as we continue to improve our working capital efficiency. To help with analyst models, we expect net expense for interest expense, interest income and other expenses to range from $9 million to $10 million for the fiscal year '24. Our estimated effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to range from 27% to 28% for the fiscal year. Our updated guidance reflects our expectation of the near-term demand environment. We remain confident in the resilience of our business and our ability to be well positioned for return to growth. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for closing comments.\nMike Baur: Thanks, Steve. We are building a cash culture at ScanSource. In fiscal year '24, for the first time, we included free cash flow as part of our annual outlook. Our aspiration is sustainable and predictable free cash flow that we can forecast and count on. An excellent use of free cash flow is to fund growth of high margin and working capital-light recurring revenue. We will now open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Burns with Sidoti. Your line is now open.\nGreg Burns: Good morning. You talked about the different points in the cycle for different technologies. And obviously, there's been weakness on the mobility point of sale and that side of the business. But in terms of networking and some of the other areas, they seem to be holding up well, but we've seen commentary from like Cisco talking about order pace slowing down and kind of a similar dynamic where customers have preordered or taking delivery of product and they're implementing it now. So are you seeing a slowdown in that area of the business due to that dynamic?\nMike Baur: Hey, Greg, it's Mike. Yeah, that's exactly right. What we experienced in Q2 is that our networking business did grow. However, it didn't grow at the rate that maybe it had been. So I would say we still had growth, pretty good growth year-over-year, but we definitely saw signs of it starting to slow down. And we also mentioned in our prepared remarks, that the security part of that business, our physical security surprised us in the quarter. It slowed down in Q2, and we didn't anticipate that.\nGreg Burns: Okay. And I've seen headlines around some businesses moving away from self-checkout kiosks. I don't know if that's a large part of your business or is that something meaningful that you've seen impacting demand there. But if that's in any way kind of impactful on you, could you just talk about that dynamic possibly that change in the market?\nMike Baur: Yeah. We -- I would say, during the last two years, we did talk very frequently about the growth of self-checkout. We actually have a strong relationship with NCR and some key partners that deployed self-checkout for at least two years during COVID, post-COVID. And that business definitely did slow down last quarter. We saw most of that coming, but still -- as you noted, Greg, we've seen the same stories in the press that some of the retailers are done with their installation plans. And so they've slowed down any new purchases. We still believe that for us, it's an area that we expect to continue to have point-of-sale, self-checkout opportunities, but they're going to be smaller. The larger retailers acted first, and what we're seeing now is the price points and the customers are smaller than they were in the prior year.\nGreg Burns: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Please stand by for the next question. The next question comes from Mike Latimore with Northland Capital. Your line is open.\nMike Latimore: Okay, great. Thank you. On the UCaaS billings growth rate, I think you said it was 18%. I believe it was 10% in the September quarter. Any reason for that acceleration?\nMike Baur: Hey, Mike, it's Mike. Nothing in particular. I think we continue to do well in the space. We did recently receive an award. You may have seen the press release, RingCentral said that for 2023 calendar year, we were the technology services distributor of the year. And so we do believe within that part of the business, we're doing very well versus our competitors. And so for us, it could have been, Mike, just to be very candid, a market share opportunity that we took in that particular space with Ring being one of the key players, as you know. But our UCaaS business has continued to be strong and we'll see what happens going forward.\nMike Latimore: Great. And then as you think about the UCaaS and CCaaS business for calendar '24, is there any reason for these growth rates to either accelerate or slow?\nMike Baur: Well, I think what I would say is this, is we still are talking about UCaaS and CCaaS with our partners. They still have a lot of questions. And where the discussions are going now, we just had this AMP'd event last week with partners and everybody is talking about CCaaS and AI. I mean that tends to be a big part of the discussion, how is AI going to be part of the CCaaS/UCaaS story. And so I think that's going to continue to make the end user customers interested in talking about it, because now you have a way to leverage either your existing UCaaS implementation that doesn't use AI or maybe look at something new. And so I think AI added to CCaaS and UCaaS will be a driver of demand for us in '24.\nMike Latimore: That makes sense. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Adam Tindle with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Thanks, good morning. Mike, I just wanted to ask on maybe the cadence of the quarter, obviously below expectations. But I'd be curious how things progressed as the quarter went, how it exited versus began? And any comments that you're seeing on more real-time demand here in January and February?\nMike Baur: Hey, Adam. I want to talk about January or February than the guidance that we just gave reflects what we've seen so far. But I will say this, back to Q2, definitely, December, we saw a slowdown would be my comment is that typically, for most of our suppliers, and this is typically, historically, it's a good quarter because especially some of our larger long-standing partners, they tend to have a budget flush, if you will, at the end of the year. That's very common. It didn't happen. So we didn't see some of the end of the year buying and we did see a slowdown in the December month. And I think that was reflected in the results we had. And lots of reasons for that, but all we could hear was there was not this additional budget flush. And so as a result of that, again, even if January comes in better than historical, we want to make sure that we're careful about how we guide for this quarter and next quarter because this is such a changing demand scenario, we just haven't seen this in a long time. We spent the last 2.5 years with demand increasing across our technologies. And now things are much more difficult for us as a company that has an average order size of around $2,500 and no bookings and no backlogs to forecast.\nAdam Tindle: Understandable. And Mike, I think Steve may have mentioned in his prepared remarks about redirecting resources. I just wondered if you could maybe give us a little bit more color on what goes into the logistics behind that? It makes sense, but just kind of wonder if you could share some of the strategy for that?\nMike Baur: Well, for us, one of the key investment areas is people, always has been. And so I would say we will continue to add head count in that area. For example, we talked about this AMP'd event we did last week. We're going to do events like that across the calendar year, and we'll probably add more as demand tells us that this is what our partners need to hear. We've got a history of educating the Intelisys community on new technologies, and there's a lot to talk about this year. So we also need frankly, to beef up our in-house experts on these technologies. And we've got some very, very smart people, but we need to add more. And we think that's why partners trust our Intelisys team is because they can come to us for independent advice on what are the key technologies they should invest in also for this year. So you're going to see us add primarily head count in the Intelisys as an investment thesis.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. And maybe just one more for me. I think it's important that you mentioned building a cash culture, and I know investors probably like to hear that, makes a lot of sense. If I looked at your guidance here, it looks like at least $200 million of free cash flow for the year is what you're talking about. If you could maybe just double click on capital allocation priorities, I mentioned that because depending on the second of the day here in the market that the company is valued at a market cap less than $1 billion, and you've got $200 million of free cash flow, would seem to be a really good opportunity to consider share repurchase given that sort of a yield. But -- just curious how you would evaluate capital allocation priorities, especially share repurchase? Thanks.\nSteve Jones: Yeah. Adam, thanks for the question. This is Steve. As we've talked about in the past, we really have two priorities for our capital allocation, and that is share repurchases and M&A that would help drive our recurring revenue. And as we talked about in our remarks, we've got about $65 million remaining on our current authorization. We think that's ample to go through FY '24 for us in terms of repurchases, but those would still be our two capital allocation priorities and then always looking at our leverage ratio as well as kind of the balancing act of our capital allocation.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: I show no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to Steve Jones for closing remarks.\nSteve Jones: Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. We expect to hold our next conference call to discuss March 31 quarterly results on Tuesday, May 7, at approximately 10:30 AM.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day."

I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael Baur: Thanks, Mary, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.  Our team executed well in a softer revenue environment and our business fundamentals remained strong. It's our purpose to be a trusted partner for our customers and our suppliers, exceeding their expectations in all demand environments.  First quarter net sales were softer than expected. Net sales declined 7% and reflect mixed demand. As in the past, we have benefited from a diverse ecosystem of partners who sell into different areas of technology and end markets. This allows our sales and marketing teams to find growth opportunities as demand changes during challenging market conditions. As an example, during the supply chain crisis, we utilized our strong balance sheet to minimize inventory shortages while enabling our customers to meet stronger than normal demand.  During Q1, technology growth areas included networking and physical security, which have been strong throughout this calendar year. And as we have discussed in previous quarters, our strong growth continued from our Cisco portfolio of products and services, especially in the areas of network security, software and Meraki endpoints. For our barcode, mobility and point of sale business, demand was lower than expected with fewer large enterprise deals. Based on our survey of customers and suppliers and our recent Channel Connect event, we believe the slowing demand for barcode, mobility and point of sale was widespread.  Our Intelisys Technology Services business continues to grow as demand remains solid, with sales growth of 9% in the quarter. This includes growth in contact center, which is CCaaS, up 27%, and growth of UCaaS of 10%. Our gross profit margin for the quarter remained consistently strong, benefiting from sales mix, especially as our recurring revenue from Intelisys grows faster than our device business. As the highest growth opportunity for our company, Intelisys remains an area of investment for the company. As a reminder, we also benefit from the fact that our Intelisys business has very low working capital requirements.  In a quarter like this one with declining net sales, we expect our business to generate strong free cash flow, and it did. Our first quarter free cash flow topped $91 million. Our strong free cash flow demonstrates that our business model is working as expected. As we indicated last quarter, we expected a slower first half of fiscal year '24 with improvement in the second half of FY '24. However, we are now expecting a slower demand outlook for the remainder of our FY '24. With the softening demand expectations, we expect free cash flow to be a bright spot throughout our fiscal year.  Changes in the technology distribution market and our belief in the growth opportunities ahead make this an ideal time to use our balance sheet to be disruptive in the market, both organically and through acquisitions. As in the past, we will make acquisitions where we expect higher growth and higher margins for the company. We have confidence in our business, and are well positioned to take advantage of our opportunities for profitable growth.  I'll now turn the call over to Steve to take you through our financial results for the quarter and outlook for fiscal year 2024.\nStephen Jones: Thanks, Mike. Our Q1 financial results reflect our transformed business model that derives more than 25% of our gross profit from our recurring revenues, including strong growth from our Intelisys business, successful execution of our working capital normalization plan and a mixed demand across technologies in our device business.  Q1 net sales of $876 million were lower than expected, while gross profit margins of 12.2% were slightly ahead of our expectations with a more favorable mix of revenue. While we expected a year-over-year revenue decline, we saw slower demand in our barcode, mobility and point of sale technologies, with fewer large deals in the quarter. These technologies are reported in our Specialty Technology Solutions segment, which saw a revenue decline of 12% year-over-year and a 16% year-over-year decline in gross profits.  In our Modern Communication & Cloud segment, revenue was equal to the strong results we posted last year, with strong networking and security sales from Cisco and 9% year-over-year growth in our Intelisys business, offsetting lower sales of communication devices. Gross profits in our MC&C segment grew 4% year-over-year and benefited from favorable mix of Intelisys revenue.  For the quarter, we delivered $91 million in free cash flow with solid progress on our multi-quarter working capital improvement plan. Inventory levels are normalizing to reflect both a return to normal supply chain lead times and our expectations of demand. Accounts receivable balances are moving with revenue as we would expect. Our Q1 free cash flow got off to a fast start as our business model is working as expected.  Now going a bit deeper into the balance sheet and cash flow. We are pleased with the improvement of our working capital. Our goal is to increase our inventory turns while maintaining appropriate inventory levels to meet customer demand. You may recall, we talked about lead times during the supply chain crisis exceeding 12 months. Those days are behind us, and our suppliers have done an outstanding job returning lead times to normal, allowing us to return to more efficient inventory levels.  Q1 inventory turns were 4.4x, well below the normal operating levels for our business. We expect to see improved inventory turns in Q2 given the progress we made on our ending inventory level this quarter. DSO declined slightly to 71 days, and Q1 was a strong quarter for cash collections. Our balance sheet remains strong. From a net debt leverage perspective, we ended Q1 at approximately 1.2x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA with ample liquidity within our existing credit facility. For the remainder of FY '24, our primary capital allocation priority is to focus on M&A opportunities to accelerate our strategic plan.  Looking ahead to Q2 and the rest of our fiscal year, the company expects continued first half revenue headwinds and a slower recovery in the second half than we believed last quarter. We continue to execute on our working capital plan and expect to generate significant free cash flow in the year. We expect to manage our SG&A spend to match our revenue growth expectations for FY '24 and beyond, focusing our investments on faster-growing business areas.  We are updating our annual guidance to reflect our latest expectations. For FY '24, we now believe that our revenue will be at least $3.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA to be at least $170 million. We are increasing our free cash flow estimates to at least $200 million. To help with analyst models, we expect a net expense range for interest expense, interest income and other expenses from $11 million to $12 million for fiscal '24. Our estimated effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to range from 26.6% to 27.6% for the fiscal year. Our updated guidance reflects our expectations for near-term demand environment. We remain confident in the resilience of our business model and our ability to be well positioned for a return to growth.  I'll now turn the call back over to Mike for some closing comments.\nMichael Baur: Thanks, Steve. We recently held our annual customer and supplier event for the U.S. and Canada for over 1,700 attendees in Orlando, Florida. Our theme was opportunities for growth, and we had many conversations with our customers about where they see growth in the next 12 months. We also held our customer and supplier event in Brazil, where the theme was . Our customers and suppliers from both events shared feedback on areas where ScanSource can improve and where we achieve high marks.  I'm very proud of our amazing group of employees that constantly achieve excellent results with our customers. We are reminded of our success when we receive industry recognition from our suppliers. Just this week, we received the Americas Distributor of the Year Award from Cisco, which is a first for ScanSource. Our team was recognized at the Cisco Global Partner Summit for our success at recruiting and enabling sales partners and producing double-digit growth with Cisco security, networking and software. Recent awards from additional suppliers demonstrate our leadership in the industry. We are really pleased to be recognized by customers and suppliers with Distributor of the Year Awards from Aruba, Extreme and Zoom.  We will now open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Greg Burns with Sidoti.\nGregory Burns: Can you just walk us through how you get -- I guess, you're guiding now to like roughly flat revenue but down 7% in the first quarter, and I guess, expected weakness in the second quarter. So does that imply you're expecting growth in the back half? Like how do you get to flat for the year from starting off in a little bit of a hole here in the first quarter?\nStephen Jones: Yes, Greg, thanks for the question. Thanks for joining us today. This is Steve.  You're right. As we look at the first quarter and the first half, we still see headwinds similar to what we saw in the first quarter to go through the half. And then as we get into the second half of the year, we would see a year-over-year increase or a growth to get to our $3.8 billion. So you're thinking about it the right way.\nGregory Burns: But where -- like what are you contemplating? Like what are you looking at in terms of driving that growth? Like what are the drivers there?\nStephen Jones: Well, we benefit from a diverse portfolio of products and technologies, and so we'll have different growth rates underneath our technologies in the second half that will help us accelerate. So -- also don't forget, we suffered in the fourth quarter last year from our cyber event, and so that makes it a little bit easier compare for us in the fourth quarter as well.\nGregory Burns: And then in terms of M&A priorities, like are you looking to expand on Intelisys' capabilities? Or is there a new technology segment you might be wanting to get into? Like what are your priorities or goals in terms of M&A?\nMichael Baur: Greg, it's Mike. I'll take that one. What we've talked about for the last 2 quarters is that we really see continued opportunity in our Intelisys business. We're very bullish on it. It continues to be an area that we are in investment mode. We love the recurring revenue. We love the high margins. We really believe that, that business is still in growth mode for our company, and frankly, for the industry, as suppliers look to technology services distributors like ScanSource, Intelisys to really lead the way. But we also think for us, we have an opportunity to do some disruptive things this year.\nGregory Burns: That's organically?\nMichael Baur: Both, actually. What we're trying to do is to take a look at the total supply chain from manufacturing to end user, and we've talked about this with a few of our suppliers. How do we work with our key suppliers and our customers to facilitate a more efficient channel as we look out in the future? And we really think there's a lot of friction still in the business model as it exists today, so we're being very thoughtful about where strategic acquisition opportunities are and how we can change our existing business organically. So we're in a great position to do it. We believe now is the time to take advantage of our balance sheet and the fact that we have a team of people that are anxious to do this.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Adam Tindle with Raymond James.\nAdam Tindle: I just want to start on margins, noticing that gross margin fairly healthy here and understand the mix dynamic. The operating or EBITDA margin was down healthily year-over-year. It sounds like, Mike, you're doing some things to address that when you talked about full year operating expenses in line with revenue. But maybe just double click on this dynamic in the quarter of gross margin versus EBITDA margin. Why that was such a delta? What drove that? And what's happening moving forward to rightsize that?\nStephen Jones: Adam, this is Steve. Let me take that one. So if you look at our SG&A for the quarter, it's really unusually high from what we were running fourth quarter and what we would expect. That's really because of about $4 million worth of unusual expenses that we saw in the quarter. So we would anticipate that, that EBITDA margin would have been closer to our kind of 4.5% excluding those items, and we don't see those going forward.\nAdam Tindle: Can you expand on it? Is that like inventory write down now or something that would be onetime in nature?\nStephen Jones: Sure. Yes.  We had some specific customer bad debt reserves that we took in the quarter as well as some onetime people costs.\nAdam Tindle: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And this will kind of maybe help answer the second question, but I do want to return to the revenue and EBITDA guidance for the year. We're starting Q1 down 7% on revenue, down over 20% on EBITDA. And when we look at the full year, we've got kind of flattish to modest growth depending on which metric that you want to look at. So it's just a fairly steep climb.  Steve, I wonder if you could maybe give us a little bit of help on the shape of that for the year. I'm noticing that Q2 is -- it looks like the comparison is just as tough, if not tougher. So I'm wondering if we can maybe level set so we don't get ahead of ourselves on Q2 dynamics. And then, Mike, if you don't mind maybe speaking to the acceleration as the year progresses from growth opportunities. And as Steve mentioned earlier, it's kind of a mix depending on the segment. But if you want to maybe talk more qualitatively about the growth opportunities you see to drive this revenue expectation for the year, that would be helpful.\nStephen Jones: Yes. Thanks, Adam. I think from a first half perspective, we're kind of thinking Q2 similar to Q1 in terms of the headwinds, and that's really following what we're hearing both from our suppliers and others in the industry kind of near term.  As we think about the second half, as you know, Adam, it's only been a few years that we've given annual guidance. So we're still learning our way through this and trying to do the best that we can to kind of guide. And some of the things that maybe move our business differently is the fact that we've got technologies growing at different rates, but we still see strong growth expectations for Intelisys. We think that's going to be a bright spot for us in the second half. And then just in terms of the curve of kind of the growth in the second half. When you look at the compares, fourth quarter will be an easier compare for us and have a faster growth just because of the cyber event last year and what -- the business that we lost during that time.\nAdam Tindle: Okay. Just to clarify, when you say Q2 looking like Q1 -- this is helpful. But does that mean like in dollar terms or the year-over-year decline will look similar?\nStephen Jones: Similar in year-over-year decline. We're still seeing those same headwinds as we're going through this quarter.\nMichael Baur: And Adam, it's Mike. On the other question you had, what we're having to do right now, and Steve said it very well. For us to give annual guidance with a business that has no backlog to speak of, it doesn't have bookings. It really, of course, has always been a little bit of a guess. What we're trying to do today is to share what we learned from our customer event in Orlando where we had a lot of customers, we had a lot of one-on-one discussions, we had recent meetings. Actually, I was just in Miami this week with our Cisco customers talking about their expectations for growth. Everyone is saying the same thing that right now, their pipelines have emptied out, and now, the supply chain had pretty much gotten to normal. We're now looking more of what's a normal technology year going to be like in next year. When I say next year, I really mean not calendar year.  So when we look out to the typical ScanSource model, we have seasonality in our Q3, which is the March quarter. And we have no idea, are we going to have that seasonality or not, because Q2 is going to be a crapshoot. So we're trying to triangulate on what customers are telling us, what some of our suppliers have already said publicly about this quarter, meaning our Q1 and Q2. We heard that, and you've probably seen from some of our barcoding and point of sale suppliers, they're talking about how they're down 30% or so, and so we certainly are feeling that through our customer base.  But we have no reason to think that there won't be come back in the second half of our year. We said this back in August. The challenge now is we think it's got to be softer to some extent. There's no way it's going to be as strong as we thought back in August based on these customer conversations, based on supply chain issues gone. And some of our suppliers are already saying, \"Hey, their bookings are not like they were before.\" So we want to be very clear that we are planning for the second half to be reasonable, but we're also thinking beyond that. That we want to be careful and make sure we've still got investments positioned for the rest of calendar -- calendar '24, which would be our FY '25. We don't want to sacrifice future growth opportunities because the next 2 quarters might be soft.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Michael Latimore with Northland Capital Markets.\nMichael Latimore: Your comments on Intelisys seem fairly positive. Should we assume that the kind of the growth rates you're seeing in CCaaS and UCaaS are sustainable for the foreseeable future?\nMichael Baur: Mike, it's Mike. Yes, we do. That business for us has continued to grow. The dollars have gotten much larger. So even as in some cases, the UCaaS growth rate is maybe less than it was a year ago, the dollars are still substantial and CCaaS has gone up dramatically. So yes, we're still seeing that happen. We still see the quarter-over-quarter growth happening and the year-over-year happening. Certain suppliers are doing better than others, and that was expected as well. There would be some leveling out last year with the winners, and we think we're in the right place. We have the right suppliers to win in this market.\nMichael Latimore: Do you think -- is Intelisys taking share in those categories?\nMichael Baur: We believe we are. We believe we're having more success than the industry growth rates would suggest. And yes, we are. Now that, again, that's part of the challenge we have because we have been, by far, the largest technology services distributor. And so there are always -- our competitors coming after us. And so we're having a battle for some share, too, Mike, just to be fair. And that affects our growth rate as well because as we compete for market share, we have to take a lower margin in some cases, which is very typical of distribution. That's the way it works. So in some respects, our end user billings is actually doing quite well, and we look at that as an indicator of overall success.\nMichael Latimore: Have the -- over the last year, have the sort of lead vendors in each category changed much?\nMichael Baur: I would say they've taken more share, yes. I think there's been a shift to the lead vendors, yes. And again, what we're seeing is some of the suppliers and vendors are more willing to embrace the channel, embrace the agent community than others. And those that really go all out to make sure that the agents are profitable and have a long-term return on investment are the ones that are winning.\nMichael Latimore: Yes. Can you highlight which vendors are kind of in the top group business point?\nMichael Baur: Not today but -- well, at different times, we've shared that. I would say for example, previous quarters in CCaaS, we've mentioned Five9, Genesys and NICE, but we decided not to really mention any this quarter. So that is a previous quarter comment.\nMichael Latimore: Right, right. In the CCaaS world, generative AI has gotten a lot of attention. Does that flow through? Is that visible to your channel and your business? Or is that not really a driver yet?\nMichael Baur: Probably still early days, yes. More to come on that, but we certainly think it's going to be a factor and our channel will benefit. I mean, the thing about the channel is we generally -- partners don't want to sell things that are not ready for prime time, but they certainly want to be at the very early, early stages at the same time. So we'll see.\nMichael Latimore: Very last one here. On your -- it sounds like physical security is doing well. Can you highlight which kind of use cases are doing well and what verticals are doing well there?\nMichael Baur: Yes. Over the years, we've talked about our physical securities led by our video surveillance technologies. And if you think about it, gosh, you just look around the world. Every time there's some events, there's more interest in do we have video to capture that. And so the video technologies continue to improve. You've got 4K cameras, you got even better cameras now, color, thermal. And then, well, for example, here in Greenville this week, we had one of our key suppliers, Axis Communications. Axis was here with their mobile experience centers. Basically, a big RV with $1 million worth of equipment demonstrating all of the capabilities of video surveillance, and Axis continues to be one of our leading suppliers. And of course, they're also talking about AI and how you can use software and identity capabilities to enhance that.  And so probably the biggest vertical for us historically, Mike, is education. And kind of, again, no surprise there. You have funding from the federal government for school systems, and we have a lot of partners that are very strong in education and in physical security.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from the line of Keith Housum with Northcoast Research.\nMichael Baur: Hello, Keith? We don't hear Keith. You want to go to the next caller?\nOperator: Okay. One moment. [Operator Instructions]. I see no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to Steve Jones.\nStephen Jones: Yes. Thank you, and thank you for joining us today. We expect to hold our next conference call to discuss December 31 quarterly results on Tuesday, February 6, at approximately 10:30 Eastern Time.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
