[Operator Instructions] After today’s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call to Natasha Vecchiarelli. Please go ahead.\nNatasha Vecchiarelli: Thank you and good morning, everyone. I'm Natasha Vecchiarelli Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications. And I welcome you to the Anterix third quarter conference call. Joining me today are Rob Schwartz, President and CEO; Ryan Gerbrandt, COO; Tim Gray, CFO; and Chris Guttman-McCabe, Chief Regulatory and Communications Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that we will make forward-looking statements during this call regarding future events and our anticipated future performance such as our commercial outlook and guidance. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additionally, we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Important factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations are disclosed in our most recent SEC filings. These files can be accessed on our website or on the SEC's website. After Rob provides his prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. With that I'll turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Schwartz: Thanks, Natasha and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. In this latest quarter in Anterix continued progress on our journey to making 900 megahertz Utility Broadband, the de facto standard in creating a cleaner, safer, affordable and more secure energy future. Since our last investor update in November, we welcomed our six utility customer, Tampa Electric. We achieved 3GPP standards approval giving a clear evolutionary path to 5G for 900 megahertz spectrum users. We continued to advance industry wide support for utility private broadband evidenced by a significant movement in our demonstrated intent scorecard and we welcomed the legendary utility industry leader, Tom Kuhn to our team as Vice Chairman of our Board. I'll start by providing a quick update on our demonstrated intent scorecard, which we began sharing a year ago to measure and quantify the meaningful indicators of customer intent that we see before we get to get to a contract. As a reminder, the analysis behind our demonstrated intent scorecard, includes tracking of 20 measurable indicators for each prospective customer in our pipeline, scoring each indicator based on our assessment of its relative importance and then calculated a combined demonstrated intent or DI score for each of these prospective customers. As we track and score 20 into individual indicators with scores it's the sum of the analysis that lets us know whether the DI threshold has been crossed and in turn informs our confidence level that a utility is demonstrating its intent to proceed with deploying 900 megahertz spectrum. Of course, that does not mean that the process of moving them toward a contract is finished. Work is still needed like the work we did with Tampa Electric to move them to a contract and therefore out of the DI scorecard. Even with those that have shown the highest of demonstrated intent stops and starts are expected. It's the total score of the opportunity within this category and beyond that makes us confident that will continue to finalize contracts. And we have seen that continued movement both for the number of utilities that have crossed the threshold and beyond. As the updated DI infographic available on our Investor Relations website shows since our last report in November four utilities have crossed the DI threshold representing approximately 200 million in additional potential contracts. In total there are now 18 utilities in that highest category of DI, representing about $1.1 billion of potential contract proceeds. Note that this count is net of Tampa Electric that came out of the scorecard when we entered into a contract and also reflects the removal of one small municipal utility a single-digit deal. Needless to say, we are working collaboratively with all 18 of this category and the dozens of other utilities in our pipeline to move them to contracts. Another significant milestone that we reached this quarter is the inclusion of new specifications in 3GPPs release 18. Anterix's technology team was able to secure global support for our effort as we move through the standardization process. For those less familiar, 3GPP is the global organization of wireless carriers and infrastructure vendors as defined the evolutionary standards of LTE through 3G, 4G, 5G and beyond. The new 3GPP specification means that utilities using Anterix’s 900 megahertz spectrum for private wireless networks now have a clear migration path to 5G when needed, ensuring that their investments in private networks are forward compatible. Anterix is also advancing our efforts to build industry-wide support and scale for utility private wireless broadband networks at 900 megahertz. We continue to engage with the utility and wireless ecosystem as well as policymakers to join us including our utility customers in this collective action. Later this month we will harness three flagship industry events to continue to build our momentum with all of our stakeholders. Anterix's presence at the key industry trade show DISTRIBUTECH will showcase dozens of real-world use cases, showing valuable applications that are available now for utilities to strengthen their grids. We will have 40 of our active ecosystem members co-located in our booth, demonstrating their solutions that harness the power of broadband platform we are enabling. As we've seen from prior years. This event has resulted in broadening industry awareness of the tangible and immediate benefits of 900 megahertz private wireless broadband. At the same time, the winter meeting of NARUC, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners will convene utility regulators and their staffs from virtually every state in the nation to examine industry-wide challenges including top priorities of integrating more renewable energy and addressing the growing threats of wildfires and cybersecurity. We will be actively participating this event to further educate policymakers about the essential need for private broadband networks to support solutions for these increasing challenges. And third, we'll have an executive presence at Wireless sector's flagship event Mobile World Congress, we will engage the global leaders, driving the development and deployment of private wireless broadband networks. Anterix is also advancing the market by supporting multiple filings to the US Department of Energy for funding under the bipartisan infrastructure law. One submission included a collaboration with the Southern States Energy Board and a national organization representing the Rural Cooperative Utilities, known as co-ops. The business model represented in the filing provides a scalable shared communications platform, where each regional utility can connect to improve grid resilience and deliver more affordable electricity to rural communities. This provide – will provide a channel to extend Anterix's 900 megahertz spectrum to the co-op community, addressing the 2000 plus universe of cooperative electric providers. Additionally, Anterix was recently invited to participate in supporting the US Department of Energy's efforts to help modernize the electric grid. Anterix is joining with four of the DOE's national laboratories and others to support a program entitled; the Assessment of Communications Architectures for Energy Systems. This multiparty team is investigating ways to mitigate gaps in technology, standards and processes for communications across the grid. This program is designed to support and advance future cybersecurity training and planning and provide recommendations for improved technology standards and practices for the grid. Before I wrap up our prepared remarks, I want to highlight another indicator of strength for our movement advancing Utility Broadband. Our Anterix team, this quarter as a resounding sign of further industry endorsement we proudly welcome the legendary electric power industry leader Tom Kuhn, as Vice Chairman of our Board of Directors. Tom brings decades of energy industry experience and policy expertise to Anterix. His track record of accomplishments and honors during his more than 30 years as President and CEO of Edison Electric Institute is formidable. Tom has built his career on leading winning coalitions that bring together utility C-suites, regulators, legislators, environmental advocates, labor leaders and other stakeholders to advance favorable public policies from debates over legislation of deregulation decades ago to the bipartisan infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act, Tom has helped shape the industry wide narrative and policy environment in support of the industry's vision for resilient clean energy future. We are honored that Tom has chosen to join us in advancing the industry-wide movement towards private wireless broadband networks at 900 megahertz. As we have said throughout our journey, Anterix is doing more than simply providing spectrum, we are shaping a nationwide platform to support utility success in creating a secure, resilient energy future. We are in this for the long game, and we are confident in the belief that our sector-specific strategy with multi-decade relationships uniquely positions us for long-term growth and capturing additional opportunities for Anterix and our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you very much. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mike Crawford with B. Riley Securities. Please go ahead.\nMike Crawford: Thank you. And can you talk about what utilities that are in this highest level of demonstrating intent that are currently pursuing rate case, rate cases what their PUCs that might involve spectrum and wireless investments?\nRob Schwartz : So, Mike, good morning. This is Rob. So the process, I think, we talked about it before to investors, but just to kind of go back through it a little bit, right? So a typical utility, as we work with them goes through a process internally building a business case, working with their internal management, and at some point that gets rolled into a rate case. And this is a state-by-state regulated effort in which there's different rules in each state. And this as I say that because some have annual rate cases, others have rate cases that can be as infrequent as every four years or so. And so what we've seen is utilities that either have funding that they're from a broader effort, and they're able to move forward, others that are wanting to roll this into a rate case to be more specific about private LTE. Rarely is it a rate case that's about private LTE, just to be clear. We've seen all kinds of grid monetization cases that are put forward that can include other communications mediums like fiber and other things, but also more broadly infrastructure to harden and create greater reliability within the networks of utilities. And so this is one of those questions that it's an it depends answer. And we've got a team of experts. I mentioned in my comments about the work we're going to do with Nevro coming up. That's the annual event of all the state regulators. And through those efforts we often have a chance to talk directly both the utility regulatory teams, but also with them to the state regulators, educating about the importance of supporting communications typically as an element of those rate cases as they go through.\nChris Guttman-McCabe: And Mike, it's Chris. As Rob referenced, some of them are just logically sort of after the fact that the utility has to prove that the investment is and the keywords are used and useful. And so it clearly as Rob referenced, differs from state to state. So some of them will enter into a broader package that may include private LTE as they are working with us, and some of us will work with us go to conclusion, actually begin deployment and then pursue a rate case.\nMike Crawford: Okay. Thank you. And then just maybe ancillary to that. Are you finding much traction or success with helping utilities access some supplemental funding from the government like from the U.S. DOE, we got this grid resilience and innovation partnership program. There's 3.5 billion of grants that have been earmarked so far, and there's also inflation Reduction Act money that might be available. Is that something you're seeing traction with?\nRob Schwartz : Yes. Mike, thanks. I'll start that and feel free, Tim, to jump in. So, absolutely. But just to put it out more broadly, right? This is funding that is going to utilities to invest in all kinds of infrastructure, things that have impact, again, towards reliability, resiliency, typically under the GRIP funding. We're typically -- we're not the applicant. We're actually helping utilities with the content for their applications and we've done that in numerous cases already through -- through multiple rounds. And so we're actually seeing a strong interest in that. And that's facilitating not just the funding efforts and understand that the funding can be including private LTE, but sometimes when it funds other projects that actually frees up funds from the capital budgets to be able to fund private LTE as well and so we're seeing a lot of that. Ryan, you want to add to that?\nRyan Gerbrandt: Yeah. Happy to. Yeah, there's kind of I think that, Mike has had direct and indirect ways that it's influencing what we're doing. Obviously, our participation directly doesn't always come out quite as overtly. It's just an application for PLC funding. You'll see a lot of us and the intention of the DOE and the structure was really targeted at outcomes. So specific set of use cases in a variety of different topics of which many have inclusion of communications or broadband applications that fit underneath that. But outside of that a couple of things that, we've seen is actually give you one specific example one, one utility that we've worked with had gone through the process and unfortunately didn't receive the award. But the benefit of it was the initiative that they undertook drove internal alignment all the way up into the executive suite to really make the initiative and the program plan for private LTE viable and we're continuing to work with that utility here today. The other thing we're seeing is to highlight that the RAB lightly referenced as part of this is just access to and availability of capital. I think we've all heard across utility, ecosystem now just there's so many priorities that they have and have a finite ability and their capital plans to be able to deploy that capital that any initiative that brings capital in opens up the otherwise accessible capital for other programs to accelerate initiatives. So we're seeing this tail on effect even where PLT may not have been their top priority for BIL funding several utilities have approached us post awards with an intention of trying to deploy some of that capital in different ways.\nChris Guttman-McCabe: And Mike, it's Chris again. We -- we have a team internally that works directly with utilities and as Rob referenced earlier, we did coordinate with the southern states Energy Board and a Rural Cooperative Association to really drive an opportunity to move our private LTE at scale into the co-op community. So we're trying to find creative ways to engage the Department of Energy and the Department of Commerce on using those funds to really modernize the grid across the country. We also saw more than 10 utilities receive middle mile funding so that they can deploy fiber. And in some instances that will be part of their private LTE deployment. So they got funding for the for fiber elements of the private LTE department. So we are seeing the funds. We talked gosh a year plus ago about the work we did to get the language into the bipartisan legislation. We're now seeing the fruits of that effort sort of across the different tiers of the energy sector.\nMike Crawford: Okay. Thank you. And then final -- final question is we saw the $16.8 million of cash that came in from Accel January. Can you remind us when or what expected milestone cash payment milestones we were currently expecting in the next call it, I don't know, 14 months and as well as, I'm not sure, if we know yet the mile the revenue milestones on LCRA and Chicago as we do for some of your prior deals from your last 10K?\nTim Gray: Yes, Mike, this is Tim. So we've now gotten in $190 million of the $270 million we've done in contracts. So there's $80 million more to go. We don't have any additional cash receipts scheduled from the contracts for this fiscal year. So that's through March. We've got another roughly $15 million contracted to come in FY 2025. And then the rest of those funds roughly $65 million in our fiscal years 2026 through 2028 and to come in. So that's the cash flow on based on the contracts that we've done to-date and our revenue recognition, wellbore in the next 10K that we'll be filing in May about how we chart those out specifically. But I think you'll start to see both LCRA and Tego revenue recognition and within the next 12 months.\nMike Crawford: Okay. Thank you, Jim.\nRob Schwartz: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Alana Papa with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nAlana Papa: Good morning, I'm on for Simon Flannery today. Just a couple quick ones for me, and I know, you mentioned DISTRIBUTECH and the use cases are shown there or any sneak peek you can give us now on what you're seeing, any updates from what you've described in our last few earnings calls? And then second, actually the buyback, just a bit in the quarter and I know you expected it to pick up immediately. Can you maybe help us in terms of modeling out what we should expect on that side?\nRob Schwartz: Absolutely, Alanna. Good morning, and thank you for the questions. I think we’re really excited about DISTRIBUTECH and I will let Ryan take that one and then Tim will talk about the buyback update.\nRyan Gerbrandt: Excellent. Good morning, Alanna. Yeah, let me give you a little bit of a sneak peek into how we're thinking about DISTRIBUTECH. And our focus there is really to demonstrate the broad set of capabilities and the priority set of use cases and things that the ecosystem at large is doing and we're going to have a significant member of our ecosystem participants there, really showcasing all the innovative solutions that they've developed as a result of having capabilities that a broadband network can bring. But big picture, it's very consistent with how we've talked about the evolution over time, which again is a macro reflection of what's happening in the industry, the focus on security and cybersecurity you may have seen the FBI's testimony just at the end of January, reflecting on the potential risk associated with China and the vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and specific utilities. If that is a primary area of focus and one that will continue to evolve with time, we're equally seeing continued evolution around resiliency when the ongoing focus somewhat related to what we're seeing in the environmental impacts and storms. Wildfire mitigation, obviously, with the disastrous events in Hawaii coming through the holiday season has brought a new focus in a positive way to how critical it is that we help bring solutions not just to be able to detect and mitigate, but to proactively help provide technology solutions to stop wildfires before they start. And that's a big part of our focus with the falling conductor protection solution that we've talked about in San Diego Gas & Electric has already deployed in the field. Clean energy, workforce mobility those are other themes that we're continuing to see around and also the broader topic around grid edge, smart metering that came through the early parts of the 2000s is really coming up into a replacement cycle here soon. And the concept of now what's being talked about in the industry as smart metering 2.0 is really becoming an evolving story that is really only capable because of the investments that we see now in front of us with broadband communications and the ability to do more with the connected devices, provide connectivity not just to the meter on the side of a consumer's home, but into the devices that they call behind the meter with renewables and residential solar and everything else that comes with it. It's really an exploding opportunity we're seeing in the ecosystem and across the industry at large will have a total of something like 40 of our ecosystem members just to give you an example at our booth with us at DISTRIBUTECH, so we'll have a big team. Obviously they’re present, we're anticipating a lot of direct customer interaction as we have for the last few years.\nTim Gray: So, Alana, this is Tim. On the buyback, so we spent about $8 million this last quarter and then the previous quarter was about $10.8 million. So it will have variability quarter-to-quarter based on current liquidity, what we're expecting to spend particularly around clearing at that time and then looking at what the near-term cash inflows are going to be, but I would expect us to remain very active and we are in the $250 million program that we just announced. So we'll continue to be very active. Quarter-to-quarter, I can't say what exactly those numbers are going to be, but hopefully we'll stay within the vicinity of where we've been in the last couple of quarters.\nAlana Papa: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Robert Schwartz for any closing remarks.\nRob Schwartz: Thanks MJ. Thanks everyone for your participation this morning. As you heard, we're really excited about the progress we made this quarter and we remain laser focused on advancing and completing our contracts towards our mission of becoming the de facto provider of wireless broadband in our nation's utilities. Look forward to sharing more with you all soon, and look forward to our next call. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please also note that this event is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Natasha Vecchiarelli. Please go ahead.\nNatasha Vecchiarelli: Thank you and good morning everyone. I'm Natasha Vecchiarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications and I welcome you to the Anterix Second Quarter Conference Call.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\nRob Schwartz: Thanks, Natasha. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. As we continue to execute on our vision of an industry-wide movement centered on 900 megahertz, I'm pleased to share that there has been significant progress made this past quarter across a number of key initiatives. Today, I'll focus my brief comments on three areas that emphasize our confidence in continuing to deliver value to our shareholders. First, I'll discuss our recently announced share repurchase program, which will be leveraging to transcend their anticipated contracted proceeds into shareholder value. Second, I'll provide examples of activities, accomplishments and industry thought leadership that are important milestones on our path to move the utility industry in scale to 900 megahertz private wireless broadband. And third, I'll provide an update on our customer demonstrated intent scorecard. So let's start with reviewing our new share repurchase program. One way that we're marking our confidence in our future is through the robust share repurchase program, we launched in September. Under the program, we have the ability to repurchase up to $250 million of our outstanding shares of common stock over a three-year period. With our current visibility, we see near-term opportunities in excess of this $250 million. We remain fully funded and are forecasted to have free cash flow for fiscal 2024. In addition, we expect to receive $53 million in proceeds from our existing contracts during the remainder of this fiscal year. As we have said throughout our journey, Anterix is doing more than simply providing spectrum. Through our ongoing collaboration with our customers and a host of solutions providers, Anterix is enabling a nationwide platform for utilities that will support a resilient, secure and clean energy future. One of the most significant validators of our approach came last month during the Utility Broadband Alliance or UBBA Annual Summit. As many of you know, Anterix created funded and actively managed UBBA. And since 2019, UBBA has held an Annual Summit, where leading utilities and the industry ecosystem come together with a specific and valuable focus of sharing experiences, use cases and plans to build private wireless broadband networks. This year Xcel Energy hosted this dynamic sold-out event in Minneapolis with more than 500 participants in attendance, including representatives from 35 utilities and increased C-level participation. To put it in perspective, the utilities and attendants represent more than 60% of our spectrum value. We also are pleased to have a group of investors and an equity analyst attend to witness this event directly, my thanks to those who participated. At the show and monitored panel where several Senior Xcel Energy executives, including their COO, shared insights on the 900 megahertz private wireless LTE investment and how we'll bring valuable business outcomes in support of Xcel's secure, resilient energy future. What was also visible in nearly all the sessions was that 900 megahertz broadband was front and center. Our Anterix Active Ecosystem members were very well represented showcasing 900 megahertz enabled devices and solutions. An Itron and Anterix's Active Ecosystem member and one of the industry's most respected technology and solutions providers announced during the show, that it now offers several 900 megahertz compatible devices, giving utilities and cities the flexibility to deploy and operate Itron Solutions across Anterix supported private LTE networks. In the Anterix Booth, we offered a live demonstration of CatalyX, our turnkey subscriber management and roaming solution that helps utilities realize even greater benefits from Private Broadband Networks. We believe the growth of this forum directly correlates to our growing market and the opportunities we are driving and experiencing. Executive acknowledgment throughout the event that Private Wireless broadband is a critical asset underpinning most, if not all, of their primary utility objectives strongly aligns with our effort to move the entire sector forward. The message that 900 megahertz is a critical asset was again echoed last week, when EEI Foundation hosted a wildfire mitigation panel with our own COO and executives from SDG&E and Fortis. The discussion, attended by representatives of more than 30 utilities, centered on combining a 900 megahertz private LTE network with Cutting Edge Technology Solutions to address critical existential issues facing the utility sector. SDG&E is shared their updated experience, on the deployment and successful operation of their wildfire mitigation solution. This executive level industry focus has been reflected in the continuing significant movement we see within our demonstrated intent scorecard. As a reminder, the demonstrated intent metric which we introduced several quarters ago, tracks the activity and movements of utilities across a range of 20 indicators toward a 900 megahertz LTE contract. To summarize the scorecard movement, from just August until the beginning of November of the utilities below the demonstrated 10 threshold, seven have added a total of 11 demonstrated intent indicators to their scorecard. Example of these include, the identification of a Senior Executive to lead the private LTE process, the provision of pricing data, exchange of contract language and more. Currently, 16 utilities representing approximately $900 million in potential contract proceeds have crossed the demonstrated intent threshold a point at which we believe indicates a high-degree of confidence that a customer has clearly demonstrated their intent to move forward with Anterix on a 900-megahertz contract. To give you a sense of the scale and intensity of the movement in the last three quarters since we've introduced this measurement, we've recorded positive movement by customers on more than 60 new measurable indicators of intent throughout our DI scorecard. The totality of this activity and the indicators recorded on our scorecard underpin our confidence in continuing to deliver scale value to our shareholders. And before I close, I'm pleased to note that we announced just a few days ago Wassim Akhdar has joined Anterix as our Senior Vice President of Product Innovation from a long career of bringing innovative solutions to utilities. He'll oversee the delivery of products and solutions that harness utility-owned 900 megahertz private LTE networks in collaboration with our Anterix active ecosystem. We expect these solutions to produce value across the industry for utilities, ecosystem members and Anterix shareholders. At Anterix, we continue to view the opportunity before us not just by the water passing over the dam, but by the amount of water swelling behind it. I'll close with a summary of why I remain highly confident in our ability to continue delivering value to our shareholders. The industry movement towards 900-megahertz represented at forums like UBBA's Summit. The clear demonstrations of utility progress through our demonstrated intent scorecard; and finally, our confidence shown through our share repurchase program and based on our visibility of the near-term opportunities in excess of $250 million. And with that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, we will take our first question, which will come from George Sutton with Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Sutton : Thank you. Nice to have you all in Minneapolis recently for UBBA. So I'm curious if you've ever quantified, because the stark amount of both utilities and ecosystem partners that were represented at UBBA. Have you ever quantified the amount of investment being made by others to support and benefit from this ecosystem?\nRob Schwartz : Hey, George, good morning and thanks for the Minneapolis shoutout. It was great to be there for the UBBA event. I think I want to make sure I understood your question clearly. We do focus on the spectrum spend clearly of the ecosystem. As we talked about we had 60% roughly of our spectrum value represented at that recent utility broadband aligned to that in Minnesota. When you expand into the full ecosystem of partners that we have we've said in the past that our spectrum represents, let's just say, roughly a third of the spend. And that varies based on the size and the nature of the build-outs. That's just of the network deployment costs. But obviously the private LTE systems are part of much broader solution sets and whether that's part of multibillion-dollar AMI RFPs, or whether that's part of large-scale SCADA systems that are being deployed or integrated into larger grid modernization projects. When you look at the percentage of what the spend is for just the spectrum, it's a relatively small piece compared to the grid modernization budget. I mean, utilities are spending upwards of $150 billion a year in aggregate on capital projects. And so you can imagine that relative to what we're talking about being a much smaller element of the overall budget.\nChristopher Guttman-McCabe: Hey, George, it's Chris. And while we don't track the exact investment one of the things obviously we're tracking membership in the active ecosystem we talk about that regularly, but we also track those that have commercial-ready products and that number keeps so Itron, Rob referenced a few minutes ago. We're now at 23 companies that have commercial-ready products for 900 megahertz. And within those companies for some of them there are a multitude of products. So we are seeing incredible third-party investment in this opportunity and platform that we're creating.\nGeorge Sutton: Well for what it's worth we summarized our takeaways is we're waiting on the inevitable. So I'm curious separately if we could talk about the unfortunate situation in Hawaii and what happened there. And perhaps how boards at utilities have begun to respond with really moving this up to a much higher level of need rather than once?\nRob Schwartz: Sure. Maybe I'll start on that and Ryan can add to it. A couple of thoughts. First of all, we are actually reporting live here from Arizona at the EI Financial Conference where most of the C-suite of the IOUs -- investor-owned utilities are gathering talking about key issues and talking to their investors front and center is absolutely wildfire mitigation unfortunately given both the experience in Hawaii, but also the growing experience that many utilities are having it's just been an ever-increasing issue not just what used to be was an operational issue and then into kind of a logistics issue. Now it's a financial liability issue obviously with what we've seen. And so the level of focus and investment as a result Ryan who can add some comments who was on this -- I mentioned in my comments on this foundation EEI foundation call last week with the SDG&E wildfire leader where they really had a chance to talk specifically about the application of private LTE 900 megahertz on their wildfire mitigation plan which they've now deployed on numerous circuits and actually seen positive results from it already. And so we think that that actual tangible realization of the solution set is going to hopefully continue to spread throughout other utilities.\nRyan Gerbrandt: Yes. Hey, George, Ryan here. Let me add a couple of pieces of commentary. I agree with you first off devastating to see the impact in Hawaii and the theme of the conversation as Rob said it's kind of not unique to Hawaii anymore unfortunately. Now part of the conversation we had with the foundation and this call was moderated by David Hutchens the CIO of Fortis Energy was very specifically focused on just how pervasive these types of risks and threats are starting to become moving out beyond the West Coast. And I think there's a realism to it as we start going through these situations around how do we be better prepared to deal with risks proactively. And you have a specific topics that we were talking about with San Diego and one of the benefits of the falling conductor protection solution it's one of those technological solutions. It's really purpose-built to be able to detect, isolate and clear aligned before it becomes a potential risk to ignite a fire quite different than detecting a fire and being able to drive mitigations and being able to slow it down or dispatch resources and crude. And so it has been a very important conversation as Rob said kind of risk and the risk attributes of it are very pervasive. We're in many of these conversations actually here right now in Arizona at EEI. It is really a topic of the event is to continue to manage risk and wildfire mitigation being one of those existential ones that are just impossible to ignore given the both impact on human lives and the potential impact to drive utilities into bankruptcy. In our role, as it continued to be identified and just how important it is to drive the advancement of multifaceted solutions to be able to deal with these kinds of risk and technology is a major, major component to that in addition to physical things like dealing with the tree canopy and pruning even elements of hardening and covered conductors et cetera. But the advancements of technologies are necessary and critical component of that architecture and being able to put those out there at pace is part of the solution.\nChristopher Guttman-McCabe: Yeah. And George, Chris, I'll just finish it up by saying the rating agencies, right? So Moody's, S&P, Fitch all of them are making this a focus. And Fitch does a state of the sector breakfast every year that sort of helps to kick off this EEI financial that we're all at and the entirety of their focus during the breakfast was on wildfire. And as Ryan and Rob referenced the risk issues and the impact the potential for bankruptcy the existential elements of its payouts things like that. And so it is as Ryan referenced sort of front and center here, but it's really illustrated and fit spending the entirety of the state of the sector breakfast that they do on this issue.\nGeorge Sutton: Interesting stuff. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nChristopher Guttman-McCabe: Thank you, George.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Crawford with B. Riley. Please go ahead.\nMike Crawford: Thank you. Is there a second milestone you're expecting to occur with Evergy this quarter?\nTim Gray: Mike, hey, this is Tim. So Evergy, they prepaid the $30 million at the beginning of the deal right after we signed that one. I don't know, if you're maybe referencing Exelon, but we've got money due from them this quarter roughly 20 -- or excuse me Xcel not Exelon I got the wrong name. But $20 million is due this quarter from them just roughly the same as we got last quarter.\nMike Crawford: Okay. And then can you just remind me where the other $32 million was coming in I guess in the March quarter?\nTim Gray: Correct. Yeah. So we'll have another $16 million from Xcel and then we anticipate $15 million from LCRA at the beginning of that deal which should come in actually December time frame.\nMike Crawford: Okay. Great, Tim. And then I suppose, what I can tell from your demonstrated in times that you've had one additional utility, representing about a $50 million licensing opportunity move into above the threshold in the last three months. Is that accurate?\nTim Gray: That's correct.\nMike Crawford: Okay. Thank you very much.\nTim Gray: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you and good morning. First on the buyback nice to see the new program and the initiation on that, how are you thinking about cash balances and liquidity? And maybe you can kind of talk about the LTE OpEx burn here. But should we think about basically taking the $53 million out of the ongoing OpEx and then use that against buybacks? Is there any other way to think about it?\nTim Gray: Yes. I think -- Simon, this is Tim. We would expect to want to keep somewhere between $40 million to $50 million of cash on hand to cover the annual OpEx spend that we've got and anything above that we would consider looking at ongoing clearing. But outside of that we'd look at that as kind of excess liquidity that we push into the buyback program. So we expect in this new program to be pretty active immediately. And so you'll start to see that as we report on the next few quarters.\nSimon Flannery: Great, great. And the T-Mobile and Dish 800 megahertz is sort of coming to a head right now. The DOJ gave them I think until April. But I think Dish had said recently that there probability been able to buy that spectrum from T-Mobile has dropped. There's other counterparties out there potentially looking at it, potentially for private networks. Would you be able to just comment on how that 800 fits against your 900 either for you as a partner or as a competitor? Would you have an interest in working around that?\nRob Schwartz: Hey, Simon, it's Rob. So as you know, we know that spectrum well since the origination of it was -- I think the license still say Nextel Communication on them. We follow them actively and understand it. Our view is just broadly on any spectrum opportunities, we're always going to be opportunistic in looking at ways to be able to capture that for the benefit of our shareholders. The specifics of the ongoing dialogues both in the courts and between the parties. We talk to a lot of the folks, but also read all the good research that you and others write about this. It's hard to judge the tea leaves, but most likely, our view is that spectrum ends up with a valuable carrier network to do what carriers do well which is serve consumers enterprise, should it come to market in an auction. There's a lot of hurdles that would have to go through in order to get there. We'd be absolutely looking to see if there's opportunities for us, whether it's in partnership with others, including the current or future owners of that spectrum. So just to go back to your other question, I just want to -- on the buyback piece, I think it's important to say that you heard it in my statement, but I want to restate it. Our confidence in what we see in our near-term opportunities is really what gives us the confidence to put out that $250 million buyback program. We've got great visibility of all the activities spending time with these utilities both at UBBA and EEI. And so really just gives us a strong confidence that we'll be able to utilize that program in the near future.\nSimon Flannery: Good. That's helpful. And then maybe just one last one. We continue to talk about LTE, but the carriers typically like talking about 5G and moving most of their traffic and most of their subscribers on to 5G devices covering most of the country now. So what are you hearing from the utilities? And as this 5G ecosystem builds up, 5G stand-alone cores are out there? Is there more interest in having a combo LTE 5G solution?\nRob Schwartz: Yeah. I think look carriers don't like technology risk in any way. And so one of my favorite quotes from one of the leaders of Southern Company, the pioneers and using private LTE talks about 4G as being their workhorse. And we've got to realize, these LTE systems are placing technologies, they put out 15, 20 even 30 years ago. And so -- but what we're putting in place now and it was a great form at the Utility Broadband Alliance where we along with Ericsson, Nokia and Qualcomm talked about the future of 5G on 900 megahertz of which all of them stated their high confidence of that migration path. And that's what the EEI and LTE is right the evolution, but also the forward compatibility of the gear that's being sold by leaders like Nokia and Ericsson. So what utilities are putting in place now as infrastructure will be software upgradable to be able to utilize 5G when they need it. There's no use cases today that are compelling, that are driving that, but I'm certain there will be at the right time. And so remember, we're signing 20- 30-year relationships with these utilities. And so over that life span that we will continue to be their trusted adviser and helping them figure out that path of evolution. And so we're working with the utilities and a lot of those ecosystem partners in the 3GPP process to make sure that our brand continues to be supported through all the new revisions that occur. We're always looking at other ways of expanding our spectrum opportunity to in the future should there be any additional needs and as utilities both serve their own needs but they're also serving needs of other folks within their service territories. And those could be municipal and cooperative utilities those could be other industrial entities. And so we think there's opportunities to take this initial infrastructure and continue to build upon it both in services and products, but also expanding to serve other parties like-minded parties what we like to say.\nSimon Flannery: Okay. Thank you.\nRob Schwartz: Thanks Simon.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Walter Piecyk with LightShed. Please go ahead.\nWalter Piecyk: Thanks. Rob, you've had I think $500 million or so in Phase III for, I guess, about a year, if there was like a Phase IV that you created where someone pans out, what do you think that would be in that mix of $500 million?\nRob Schwartz: Yeah. I think – well, we've had those spaces out for -- since we've launched our commercial operations post the FCC ruling. We had a demonstrated intent really to give you that granularity to think of it from a different facet. And so we're measuring element by element of the things that utilities are doing that are moving them through those phases and really driving them towards a contract process. So I think when you're looking for that granularity within that phase, our DI as we call it is probably the right way to understand that progress. So when you see the movement that we've had just in the few quarters that we've been reporting that continues to expand even as we've had entities like LCRA signed and they obviously fall out of that in a good way. We continue to see growth in those as we say above that threshold where they're showing enough elements to show that they're showing significant intent that we have confidence about them contracting.\nWalter Piecyk: But maybe I'm confused the DI is that's a different tracker? Is that -- so DI is -- or Demonstrated Intent is after someone has been in the Phase III bucket, or where it's -- I think what's -- how do you describe it, negotiation and commitment phase? So DI is after that, or is that before that?\nRob Schwartz: Yeah. It's intersecting almost -- so think about the three phases is kind of the classic sales funnel as we're tracking through those three categories. But DI measures on much -- many more characteristics, the things that we've realized are indications of them getting to contract.\nWalter Piecyk: Is it like a circle, or DI -- So all the DI is in Phase III right now? Do I have that right?\nRyan Gerbrandt: DI is actually -- Walt it's Ryan here. DI is actually covering Phase II and Phase III specifically, the 16 deals we referenced. But Rob said like it's intended to provide more overlap and granularity with the 20 metrics of the items. I'll give you one example. There's different things that happen in the phases of the pipeline. But very specifically in DI, one of the elements that we noted here is when we're actually specifically passing contract papers and is one of the pieces that we flagged on. It obviously happens within the phases of the pipeline, but it's a very specific measure obviously of intent as we're starting to pre-negotiate terms for example. Obviously we don't break those out into a separate phase of the pipeline as we can't get down to that level of…\nWalter Piecyk: That sounds like -- but the way you describe it the way you describe, it sounds like negotiation and commitments I would think that all of DI should be in Phase 3, no?\nRyan Gerbrandt: Well, not all of them are at that level of step. Yes, one of 20 things. So, there are several other pieces that are equally important while we're even getting prepared for that. And that's why we've got some of that kind of later stages of Phase 2 is to work in the way in a Phase 3.\nRob Schwartz: And just also we've had entities that have jumped past those phases, some of the deals we've done where they've gone from a standing start relatively below the threshold in DI and not in Phase 3 and suddenly accelerated because they -- for one reason or another they've moved forward and contracted. So, it's two different facets of the way we look at our customer flow, but we're happy to go into it in more detail with you.\nWalter Piecyk: Okay. And the DI I guess I could ask my first question may be targeted DI. So, if there's a DI Plus or DI MAX in media terms, where someone's 10 is out and getting ready. Like how much of the demonstrated intent is getting you closer to actually getting something on the tape?\nRob Schwartz: Yes, I think to bring our third number on the table in there. I think the -- what we just talked about with our share buyback program by putting out that scale and saying that we have visibility in our near-term opportunities in that scale. That's really what -- that's how I'd probably answer that question, Walt. Again, we have a strong influence on these opportunities. We can't predict the precise timing, but what we're seeing is this kind of broad movement and you're really trying to identify that tip of the iceberg. I think that's the best way to talk about the scale of what we're seeing.\nWalter Piecyk: Okay. Just a question for Chris. Biden put some stuff out yesterday. I think -- who was it I guess, I'm blanking on his name not -- Carr [ph] had some negative -- Commissioner Carr had some perhaps negative things to say basically just saying it was kind of bullshitting that that spectrum was going to hit the market anytime soon. I'm just curious kind of can you give us your take on like does any of that spectrum hit the market? Is that stuff that your utilities would look at as they've looked at CBRS in the past in terms of being integrated with the low-band spectrum that you can have to offer.\nChristopher Guttman-McCabe: Yes. I mean, Walt, I think -- first of all, I think the process of getting that spectrum and the nation's sort of spectrum plan to market will take some time. We're always excited to see potential spectrum opportunities as Rob referenced whether it's or other bands that we think can be accretive and valuable and beneficial to our shareholders and additive like CBRS can be complementary to our 900. So, we definitely track that. That spectrum will have to go through a process at the FCC. Much of it will likely be auctioned. So, we certainly are aware of it. What we're doing and you've heard us talk about this you've heard this theme throughout many of our calls is we're building a solution set sort of an ecosystem of solutions that makes our spectrum different than other spectrum opportunities because it's wrapped into 110 companies and 11 utility strategic Advisory Board members, all the things we talk about in terms of creating value and creating solutions for the sector. But certainly if other opportunities from a spectrum perspective come to play, we will be actively aware and participating.\nWalter Piecyk: I mean where do you think the government is right now? Obviously, the government can change shortly. But where are they right now, in terms of shared spectrum. There's been a lot of debate around CBRS. I mean the cable guys claim they're using it, but it doesn't seem like it's actually getting deployed aggressively, yet. Your customers have integrated it. Do you think that shared spectrum is something for the future, regardless of who's in charge at the FCC? Or is it the kind of lost its luster?\nChristopher Guttman: Yes. So micro, macro. So, I'll take micro. The sector we're serving they want and need control. They want and need certainty. And so the idea of relying completely, on a shared spectrum opportunity, is just not in their core way of thinking. And so when you talk about CBRS, there are some utilities who bought those PoW licenses even those have some unique aspects and traits to them. And so we likely will see many of them pursuing Anterix in 900 megahertz. But share -- then I'll go macro, shared from a macro perspective I think there are spectrum bands that only can be shared going forward. And so I think -- I don't think the concept of shared will go away. I think we'll still see it from time to time and in certain bands. And there is, a little bit of a political element to it. Shared is appreciated more by the Democratic side of the aisle, and license and exclusive generally, but both parties I think understand the benefit of both sides. And so the luster rises and falls from time to time, but I think we'll see both a shared spectrum model going forward and an exclusive license auction model going forward, as well.\nQ – Walter Piecyk: Okay. And then, just last question. Given the low band nature of your spectrum, have you received any inquiries anyone sniffing around in the satellite industry, perhaps LEO constellations that are planned or in process that are looking for some additional uplink that they could use, in order to achieve their goals of trying to provide satellite connectivity to phones?\nRob Schwartz: Yes. Well, I think look, we're watching talking with leading vendors on all those fronts nothing specific to really share there. We're really focused on saying this low-band spectrum has such high value for our utility partners, and what they're doing. Absolutely, the eventual hybrid approach of terrestrial and satellite makes sense for them and others. And so, not as a replacement or as a complement. And we foresee that that will be a product, that will also continue to supplement it. It's just like what we've watched over the decades, with carriers evolution starting with low band and all the supplemental things they've added to those networks the layer cake, other elements of technologies to strengthen those systems, we'll see the same thing here. 900 will be the foundational enrollment for these utilities and other critical infrastructure and we'll expand from there. I'm sure that will include satellite over time.\nQ – Walter Piecyk: I’ll roger that. Thank you. \nRob Schwartz: Thanks, Walt.\nChristopher Guttman: Thank you. \nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Rob Schwartz, for any closing remarks.\nRob Schwartz: Thank you, operator and thank you, everybody for joining us today. We're really looking forward to continuing to share our progress over time, and we'll talk to everyone soon. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Anterix Investor Conference Call. All participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to Natasha Vecchiarelli. Please go ahead madam.\nNatasha Vecchiarelli: Thank you and good morning, everyone. I'm Natasha Vecchiarelli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, and I welcome you to the Anterix first quarter conference call. Joining me today are Rob Schwartz, President and CEO; Ryan Gerbrandt, COO; Tim Gray, CFO; and Chris Guttman-McCabe, Chief Regulatory and Communications Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that we will make forward-looking statements during this call regarding future events and our anticipated future performance, such as our commercial outlook and guidance. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additionally, we do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements. Important factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company's expectations are disclosed in our most recent SEC filings. These files can be accessed on our website or on the SEC's website. After Rob provides his prepared remarks, Tim will provide a quick update and we'll open the call for questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to Rob.\nRobert Schwartz: Thanks, Natasha. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Our most recent call in April focused on the signing of the LCRA deal, providing them with broadband spectrum and in 68 counties of their approximately 73,000 square mile service territory in Texas. We highlighted that LCRA is unique to our previous customers as it's a public power generation and transmission utility and also water management utility, creating a new universe of private broadband use cases that's already attracting additional utility attention to Anterix. Now before I start, I want to acknowledge that the frustration of investors with the cautious pace of the utility sector and our lagging stock price is not lost on us. We share in these frustrations. We do remain laser focused on continuing to capture valuable customer contracts that we will further demonstrate to the market the substantial value of our spectrum asset and our full business opportunity. With that, today, I'll focus on two areas. First, I'll provide an update on our demonstrated intent scorecard, providing at the request of investors to give a market pulse of customer progress between spectrum transactions. And second, I'll give you an update on a range of activities and accomplishments that are important building blocks in our mission to become the utility industry's de facto wireless broadband solution. We introduced Demonstrated Intent or DI in February, to address the challenge of communicating interim progress with customer contracts given the slower-than-anticipated pace of the market, longer sales cycles and resulting prolonged length of time between agreements. This transparent and fact based DI scorecard is intended to measure and quantify the meaningful signs of customer intent that we see before we get to a contract. This tool aligns well with our goal of providing investors with a consistent and measurable way to see the combined impact and development of our target customers complementing the stand-alone phases of our sales pipeline we previously reported. We also believe this tool provides a detailed picture of prospective customer progress towards contracting for our 900 megahertz spectrum and supports our resulting confidence in the strength and potential value of our pipeline. For this analysis, every targeted customer in our sales pipeline, representing over $3 billion in contracted proceeds is tracked and measured on 20 individual indicators of intent to pursue a 900 megahertz private wireless network. Each of these 20 indicators is individually weighted based on our assessment of its importance. These include, for example, rate case filings, participation on panels or interviews, experimental licenses, membership and our Utility Strategic Advisory Board, participation in UBA and more. We'll continue to use the same indicators consistently from quarter-to-quarter. If that total weighted score places utility over a specific threshold, this indicates that a customer has demonstrated substantial intent to move forward with Anterix on a 900 megahertz contract. This data provides three key metrics that we'll share. The number of utilities that are scoring above the specific DI threshold, along with the total dollar value of the potential contract proceeds associated with those utilities. And lastly, the net increase in the total number of individual indicators recorded for utilities in our pipeline. In our first Demonstrated Intent report shared in February of this year, we highlighted that 15 utilities had crossed the threshold, representing over $800 million in potential contract proceeds. In late April, we provided our second DI update. At this time, just after announcing the LCRA contract for $30 million, 14 utilities still remained above the DI threshold, representing approximately $800 million in potential contract proceeds. And in June, we provided the third update on our DI scorecard when there were still 14 utilities that had crossed the threshold. We also reported progress on a significant number of additional indicators of movement. Since our last report in June, we measured additional activity across our accounts. As of today, there are now 15 utilities that have crossed the DI threshold, representing more than $850 million in potential contract proceeds. And beyond that, the next 3 utilities that are close to crossing the DI threshold represent more than $275 million in potential contract proceeds. An additional measurement of progress below the DI threshold, we've seen a total of 13 incremental demonstrated intent indicators across 8 utilities that have been recorded on our DI scorecard since June. Several of you have also asked for a report on the total progress since we introduced the DI scorecard in February. In this period of less than six months, we've recorded positive movement by customers on about 50 new measurable indicators of intent throughout our DI scorecard. Additionally, beginning in June, we created an infographic that captures these updates and is available on the Investor Relations page of our website. The individual results recorded on our DI scorecard are directly attributable to our broader efforts to become the de facto wireless broadband solution for the utility sector. We have been successful to date, closing 100% of the contracts within the five utilities that have committed to wide area private wireless broadband since we've had our broadband spectrum available. We strongly believe this outcome is based on our focus of being a partner to utilities through our work with the utility Strategic Advisory Board, our Anterix active ecosystem and the Utility Broadband Alliance and more. Through our Utility Strategic Advisory Board, we've had the unique ability to collectively identify and pursue solutions that are key priorities of our current and potential customers. The Board consists of a senior level executive from nine utilities, including Amarin, Evergy, Excel, LCRA, Exelon, Dominion, Southern, Northwestern, and we're excited to report the new addition of New York Power Authority. In addition, we continue to aid the development and growth of the Utility Broadband Alliance, or UBBA. A collaborative industry association dedicated to advancing the adoption of private broadband networks in the industry. In June, UBBA announced that it had surpassed 100 members with CenterPoint Energy, Duke Energy and LCRA listed as its newest utility members. Anterix couldn't be any prouder of the success of UVA since our cofounding of this critical industry organization. And finally, another program that passed the 100 member mark, our own Anterix active ecosystem program, which turned two in May and now has more than 100 leading innovator companies collectively focused on offering the broad array of equipment solutions and services that utilities require to plan, build, operate and capture value from their 900 megahertz private wireless broadband network investments. It's a who's who of wireless and utility technology and service leadership. I'll conclude with an update on our increasing thought leadership presence in the industry, an important element of our near- and long-term strategic positioning. Beyond the work with our ecosystem, the Utility Strategic Advisory Board and UBBA, as pioneers of a new market, our goal is to consistently educate our key stakeholders on the necessity and value of private broadband networks. It's a big industry, and that sort of educational effort is no small undertaking. For Anterix, it means we need to be nothing less than diligent, providing insightful trusted thought leadership at every opportunity, not just getting the word out, but explaining why 900 megahertz private LTE is the right answer for each specific utility, its customers and its regulators as well as for the industry, the region and the nation. In the last few months alone, from EEI, Nark, IEEE to our own industry insights and more, we have participated on panels and spoken at conferences, broadcast webinars and written a number of pieces in industry publications. Our team's profile is high enough now that Anterix is sought out as a thought leader on utility communications, not only by utilities themselves, but also by regulators and the media. We believe it's the cumulative impact of all these efforts that will continue to drive customer contracts is reflected in our demonstrated intent scorecard and will lead to our goal of becoming the de facto broadband solution. And with that, I'll turn it over to Tim for a brief financial update.\nTimothy Gray: Thanks, Rob. I'm pleased to share that after delivering our first excel Spectrum milestone for broadband licenses, we received approximately $21 million last week. We also expect to receive roughly $80 million of additional near-term proceeds based on the delivery of additional milestones to our current customers spread across the remainder of this fiscal year. We remain debt-free, are fully funded and forecast have free cash flow for fiscal '24. As a reminder, we have approximately $26 million available to repurchase shares in our current program, and we anticipate efficiently using this plan during the remainder of the quarter by leveraging a majority of the funds we received last week from Excel. Additionally, we intend to put a significantly more robust plan in place prior to the expiration of the current plan subject to Board approval. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]The first question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Tim, thanks for the clarification on the buybacks. Maybe you can just remind us on what you think an appropriate cash balance is for the company? And then, Rob, you opened with talking about the frustrations with the delays with the utility industry. Can you just give us an update on what the key issues here are? Is it sort of just the layers of management, the layers of approval? Is it syncing with others in whether it's equipment providers or other parts of a broader grid modernization? Just how do we think about this and why even now, it's still taking longer than you expected?\nTimothy Gray: Hey Simon, this is Tim. On the cash balance piece, traditionally, I'd like to have at least to cover a year of our OpEx, but I don't look at that like that as a stand-alone, also look at the cash flows that we're going to have coming in from the contracts that we've got. Of the $238 million we've signed to date, we've received $102 million, and we've got $136 million coming in still with $80 million of that this year. So I'm comfortable with where our cash position is with being able to buy back shares with the current cash balance.\nSimon Flannery: Great. And just remind us what you think a year of cash OpEx is?\nTimothy Gray: Roughly $40 million, $45 million.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nRobert Schwartz: And Simon, to your second point, I think we went into probably more detail in our April call about kind of some of the process issues that we're seeing and our learnings along the way. These are cautious customers, cautious institutions that run our nation's electric grid and when they make decisions, they make them for multiple decades, right? And so while it takes a long time on the front end of those decisions because of the complexity of the organizations and the way they have to get agreement from the regulators, they also, at the same time, are committing, as you know, to multi-decades, 20-, 30-, 40-year terms that we have in our current agreements. So long front end, but equivalently long back end of contracts. Part of it is we really have -- we set it out 10 years ago to be the de facto provider here. We've really seen what I see as the thought leaders and pioneers step forward, who in my mind are inspiring the followers. This is a very unique industry that they're influencing each other and while it takes time to get that progress momentum going, you can now see through the activity in all of the organizations that I just talked about, the participation, I mean, open participation of senior executives that are now working as part of our USAB, for example, Utility Strategic Advisory Board that are not yet customers, but are committing their time to move forward in learning from other signed customers. That's a great sign, Designated Intent, as we've talked about it. That's just a quantification of all of the ways in which we're working with these utilities to move forward, whether it's through their experimental licenses where they're doing pilots, whether it's through the USAB through other efforts of how they need to bring their complex organizations. The larger deals that we're doing in our pipeline, 9-figure deals, those require more work. There are multiple opcos as we talked about back in April and each of them have their own state regulatory environment, their own leadership and need to make their individual decisions that then roll up into a broader holding company decision. So they are complicated, but again, these are customers once we're embedded, as we can see from the five that we've signed, all five that have made these wide area decisions for private LTE over the last three years, we're batting 1,000. It's unfortunate that it takes a while to get a new sector going like this, but we're happy to see the whole progress. We're working on closing an entire sector here, not just one at a time and so while it's frustrating at the speed at which it's happening, the indications that we're seeing, including as measured from Demonstrated Intent, give us strong optimism.\nSimon Flannery: And then anything on the water opportunity? You mentioned the opportunity kind of sort of expanding your addressable market, any more color you can give us on that?\nTimothy Gray: Yes. I think it's interesting. We approached it looking at alternatives originally of ways in which we could monetize our spectrum and Simon, you've been follow us for a long time. We're clearly committed, as I like to say, our bull's eye is the utility sector. It's where the spending is to be fair, right? The utility sector is spending over $150 billion a year in capital expenditures. There's a few sectors that you can look at that have that opportunity to monetize within them. And so as you know, when you look across the other sectors, if you added up everything else going on in the private markets, most likely, it doesn't even equal what we've already signed for contracted proceeds and service territory in the 15 states with the five utilities that we have now. Ryan, do you want to add?\nRyan Gerbrandt: Yes, Simon, it's Ryan here. The one thing I'll add, too, I think the corelationship with that, as we've just been continuing to grow the set of use cases that ultimately drive the underpinnings of why utilities push forward with broadband networks in the first place. And we've captured now, and I think LCR is a great example of this, a new relatively unique company in the public power space that brings in additional use cases focused on transmission distribution and water management through the lower Colorado River that they're responsible for. But all of these just add to this Rolodex of value. When the value gets established through these different use cases, and we get a lot of attention from the utilities as we're working with them through the pipeline as they explore how to use cases ultimately underpin what they need to do most importantly as a utility. A big part of the work that we do in establishing how to build a business case with the utility is rooted in that foundation of use cases. So kind of whether it opens up a brand-new market or not, they're all valuable in the cumulative because they help a utility understand the full scope of the potential of driving this kind of a transformation on broadband.\nSimon Flannery: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Walter Piecyk from LightShed. Please go ahead.\nWalter Piecyk: Rob, I don't know if Chris is on the call, but can you just kind of remind us and review again what government programs are out there, not necessarily to fund purchases of or leases of your spectrum but to help these utilities upgrade the grid in order to reach Biden's goal. Then I'm just curious like how sticky some of that stuff is, if we have a change? I mean, given the long lead time and a lot of the stuff, it may ultimately result in getting into a new administration. How much of that funding falls away? Or maybe what new opportunities what we have is the administration changes in the upcoming election?\nRobert Schwartz: Yes. Sure, Walt. Great question. So there are a range of programs. I know we've talked a little bit about this. The BIO IIJ has a multitude of programs. The ones that we're focused on are on one side, the broadband side, middle mile and on the other side, the GRIP programs. And what we've seen is that these programs are -- they're over a number of years. So the ones that people just filed for were for the first two years. So we will see these programs and this money available again over the next two years. We're excited in that we did participate with a number of utilities in that first phase, that first two-year tranche. Those programs or those applications and concept papers were given the green light that thumbs up to move forward to the decision-making process. We've also seen, and it's been reported in the press, a number of our customers and potential customers received grants for middle mile deployments. And so as we've said in the past, we're excited because we see these programs as opportunities to accelerate, to stimulate, to move opportunities that may have been further back in our pipeline to move them forward. I don't see any future where those programs don't continue because of the way that they've gone through the process. They're fully funded, and they're ready to be used over the range of the next three years beyond this two-year tranche. So I think they are sticky programs to use one of your words, Walt, and I see them being around. We are actively working with the utility community. We're working with the consultants that they are working with and we're consistently meeting with folks on Capitol Hill and at the Department of Energy to ensure that these types of programs or as written in the legislation continue to be considered for funding.\nWalter Piecyk: So let me ask it, I guess, more directly. So Trump couldn't come in and basically blow them up if he's not necessarily a believer in the use of electric versus some other energy alternatives out there. I mean that could not be a casualty in terms of blowing up those programs? And then Similarly, again, I would assume that maybe I'm wrong, you're aware of something during his administration where he was into helping electric utilities, but I'm assuming there would be probably less opportunity going forward under a Trump administration?\nRobert Schwartz: Right. So let me start by saying we see these programs as additive. They are not a necessity for us to drive our success. Could a new administration come in and have the Department of Energy interpret the legislative language differently? Absolutely. But the neat thing that we were happy to see and obviously had a hand in putting in there is a range of benefits. I think Rob calls it the Swiss Army knife is what private LTE provides. The legislative language sort of recognizes that Swiss Army knife element in that the funding can support the integration of renewable energy. It can also support the integration of wildfire mitigation tools or the capture and analysis of data or the cybersecurity benefits of private LTE. So even if an element or elements were interpreted differently by a new Department of Energy, there are so many benefits encapsulated in that language that private LTE underpins that we're excited about pretty much however it's interpreted. But again, it's not a necessity, but we've always thought about it and set it up as additive going forward.\nWalter Piecyk: Yes, thank you.\nRobert Schwartz: Yep.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Philip Cusic from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nPhilip Cusick: Hi guys. It looks like someone or a customer moved up from Tier 2 to Tier 3. Can you give us any more detail as to sort of what criteria changes to get that customer up? And within that sort of highest tier of potential customers, anything additional you can tell us in terms of people getting closer or what's sort of contracted and ready to go versus not quite negotiated?\nRyan Gerbrandt: Phil, it's Ryan here. Excellent question. Yes, I mean, as you can imagine, I mean what we're looking at kind of across the factors is how the utilities are progressing in a variety of these 20 different metrics that we're looking at. So it's hard to distinguish a single one, even though one may move it above the threshold from a scorecard perspective, it's really the cumulative effect of all of them that we look at that ultimately are how we measure kind of the combination effect of what those elements all mean in terms of Demonstrated Intent. But let me give you a couple of examples because we do continue to develop the opportunities both, I'll describe it as above the line and below the line. And obviously, our primary focus every single day is to drive customers through to the end game and close contracts. That drives us to be able to continue to develop their opportunities as they sit above the line and a couple of the items that I've got, I'll pick just one example of a utility that's sitting above the line as we've been continuing to work with them. A couple of the measures that we've worked on specifically with them is they were progressing closer to the end state and realizing as we get closer to the end, having the executive champions really, the executive stakeholder that takes responsibility to help promote and drive the topic and the program through is a very important part, and we've talked about it here on these calls before as their stakeholding across the organization. And so that's one of the elements that we've moved with this team. The other one was formulating with what they do internally around how they assign team allocations and budget and this you have a perspective of just utilities are relatively labor constrained in a lot of different ways and for a variety of reasons. But when it comes to program allocation, I've always tracked how do utilities make conscious decisions around how they allocate people and in turn how they allocate money as a measure to where they're putting their attention and what truly matters for them. And so it's been another indicator on one of these deals as we're trying to progress it through at the end stage to put the kind of what I call a closing team together, it's ultimately driving the decisions, the approvals, getting ready for negotiations and such as things as we're working through with them. And so that's one kind of that sits above the line. We also talked about the metrics as we're continuing to promote the rest of the pipeline and how they develop coming up below the line. One to call out, and this is where, obviously, we're seeing more volume of movement because there's more activity and there's just more general utilities that sit below the threshold where we've had one customer, potential customer demonstrate movement in five indicators in just the last six months. And that's one of the faster ones that I've seen in terms of the ability to progress them all the way through, and they've done a handful of different things. They've also got an executive sponsor. They've created an internal working organization, a signed budget, cost centers, these kind of things to promote the work. They've also already brought in an outside firm, which I track as an indicator of, again, where they're allocating budget and where they're making a commitment to invest time and external resources to be able to put together the kind of the third-party expertise necessary to be able to evaluate the components of putting a plan together. So those are just examples of the types of things that I'm seeing as they're moving their way through it and amongst all of the other activity as Rob highlighted, we've seen a total of 50 movements here just since we started tracking it this way in February, which I look at positively just in terms of the big picture of how we're generally seeing things move through.\nPhilip Cusick: Okay, thanks guys.\nRyan Gerbrandt: Thank you.\nOperator: The last question for today's call comes from George Sutton from Craig-Hallum. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Sutton: Thank you. We have seen Ericsson begin marketing a partnership with NRTC, which, as you know, represents 1,500 utilities. And they've said they're moving on 900 megahertz and they, of course, had the West Kentucky trial that was successful. How does something like that fit into your pipeline? How would that roll out as that would move forward?\nRobert Schwartz: Thanks for the question, George. I'll start. Anybody wants to add on, right? So for those who don't know, NRTC is the National Rural Telecommunications Association. Their members are rural telcos that also often operate utilities as well. They're a great organization happen to be led by Nextel veterans as we are as well. So we've got a close alliance. As they develop opportunities, we see opportunities to continue to work with them to be able to drive what I think of is to the next segment of customers, right? They've got smaller rural co-ops and municipal organizations, most of whom are not in what we talk about in the top of our pipeline. They're a great opportunity. They've been a channel for many vendors for services and products, and that could include metering systems, other kinds of equipment. So they've done bulk purchasing support deployment of other systems. And I think likely, that's a way in which we could get to that next segment of customers. As you know, we're focused initially on really where the money is, which is in the larger IOUs, but that's a segment that we're already starting to see demand growing and we see opportunity.\nRyan Gerbrandt: Yes. I'll just add a little bit there. I mean, I've seen the announcements and stuff to, and I think it's reflective of just kind of the broad industry-wide needs for communications, digitalization and adding resiliency and robustness. It's not unique to the IOUs, even though they are a primary customer that we're targeting in the pipeline. And so as Rob said, I think looking at it as another channel potentially, and frankly, another area that we've seen some utilities start to explore is what other advantages, this is an IOU, for example, George, what can they do to take advantage of a to-be-built private LTE network in terms of looking provided like-minded services to other constituents, not uncommon in the energy landscape either where other capabilities can be ported down, and they provide services to others. Southern Company is a great example of that, that we referenced who've used their network, not just for their own services, but to be able to try to offer commercialization services to other industrial customers. And so certainly, we'll see a few of those opportunities kind of develop as they go forward.\nGeorge Sutton: One other question on the active ecosystem. Obviously, you have a Gordy number of people that are working with you, a 100 companies, I believe you referenced. You have five customers today. So obviously, those 100 companies are seeing a very different opportunity than what's represented by your current base. Can you just talk about any sort of examples of spending being done by those 100 companies to go after this opportunity, therefore, suggesting that bigger opportunity?\nRyan Gerbrandt: Yes. Yes. I can't speak to specifics, but you're right in that they're participating in the ecosystem because it helps inform their understanding of the general trajectory of the market. And so by associating with the overall collective, and we hold kind of an annual event with them where we get together, we invite customers and prospective customers and to speak about what they're trying to do and where their private LTE journey is going, that informs in like any product development business case, those are critical inputs for them to understand kind of volumetrically what they see in their forecast to drive the R&D and investment priorities in the form of chips and end devices and infrastructure solutions and services. And so that's the particular reason why they're paying attention. Let me add one other lens to it, too. On top of this, we announced the formation of our Utility Strategic Advisory Board, which is our C-level governance structure. That is another reason why members participate in the ecosystem, and it's a specific value proposition that utilities can extract by having an association with us and that ecosystem. And so now through that and that member group, and I'll just reflect back on as we've been having sessions with them, we were face-to-face with them at EEI down in Austin, not that long ago and having the opportunity to sit in the room with the C-level executives from the utilities, talking and having them share their experiences because keep in mind, they're not all existing customers today on the spectrum. And so we've got participation there from some other large utilities that are hearing the lessons learned firsthand from the other utilities that have gone before them and more importantly, collectively, we're talking about the next set of priorities that those utilities collectively are seeing so that we can drive and influence through the form of something that we call collective. It's just like we did with the cybersecurity collective to bring programs back into the ecosystem so that we can create these programs that collectively, we try to put our heads together to find the final way to tackle because honestly, the big picture of where this market is developing, the point aspects of the solutions aren't necessarily where the value is extracted. The tighter that we can bring these together and deliver real outcomes to the utilities, the more rapidly they're going to be able to adopt them and extract the value that ultimately helps to move forward with broadband faster, which is our goal.\nChristopher Guttman-McCabe: And George, it's Chris. You had asked about sort of how they -- and sort of what type of activity we're seeing from those 100-plus members. A full one third of them have been developing products. In fact, I think it's the numbers like 21 have broadband-enabled products already 900 megahertz enabled products and those are companies like GE and Cisco and Motorola to key Ericsson. So these are some of the themes in both the utility sector and the wireless sector who already have developed products, and they're commercially available and another 10 or so have what we call showcase ready. So 30 plus of our 100 already have products that they can either demonstrate or actively offer to utility customers. That aligns sensibly with what we're seeing this year, right? We're going to see networks being built this year. A number of our utilities are building towers or putting up RAN, deploying infrastructure. This is going to be an exciting active year in terms of really the deployment of 900 megahertz Anterix enabled utility equipment.\nGeorge Sutton: Got you, perfect. Thanks guys.\nChristopher Guttman-McCabe: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Rob Schwartz for any closing remarks.\nRobert Schwartz: Thank you, operator. Just in close, as I said earlier, the lagging stock price, the slowly developing market frustrates us, no doubt. With that in mind, as Tim said, we do intend and we will use our proceeds from our contracts to take advantage of these prices to buy back stock. But really make no mistake. We remain confident in our future. We see activity throughout our pipeline. We see consistent signs of progress and intent as we just shared with you all, and we appreciate everybody's patience and time today. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Goodbye."
