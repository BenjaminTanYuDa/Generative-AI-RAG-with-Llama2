I would now like to turn the floor over to Joe Burke, Vice President of Treasury and Investor Relations for Avnet.\nJoe Burke: Thank you, operator. I'd like to welcome everyone to the Avnet second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. This morning, Avnet released financial results for the second quarter fiscal year 2024 and the release is available on the Investor Relations section of Avnet's website, along with a slide presentation which you may access at your convenience. As a reminder, some of the information contained in the news release and on this conference call contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Such forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of performance and the company's actual results could differ materially from those contained in such statements. Several factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are described in detail in Avnet's most recent Form 10-Q and 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements or supply new information regarding the circumstances after the date of this presentation. Today's call will be led by Phil Gallagher, Avnet's CEO; and Ken Jacobson, Avnet's CFO. With that, let me turn the call over to Phil Gallagher. Phil?\nPhil Gallagher: Thank you, Joe, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on our second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. I am pleased to share that we delivered another quarter of solid financial results, which was in line with our guidance. In the quarter, we achieved sales of $6.2 billion. This was slightly above the midpoint of our guidance, down 2% sequentially and down 8% year-over-year. We achieved operating margins of 3.9% highlighted by a 4.3% operating margin in our Electronic Components business. We've been working through an inventory correction on a global basis over the past couple of quarters. In addition, we're also facing weak and uncertain economic conditions which began in Asia, including China and are now present in the West. This economic softness has resulted in lower demand with some of our customers, which is being magnified by elevated inventory levels across the supply chain. In the quarter, demand was mixed across the diverse end markets we serve. Defense and transportation markets continue to show relative strength, while demand in the industrial, consumer and communications verticals was relatively soft. As semiconductor lead times continue to improve, the pricing environment remains stable, which is a positive sign. And for the majority of the products, we do not expect overall pricing to decline meaningfully in the near term as we see it today. We continue to manage our backlog and close coordination with our customers and suppliers to align with current softening market conditions. Our backlog activity is centered on pushouts and reschedules rather than cancellations, which are within a normal range. Shorter lead times, however, are contributing to backlogs being lower year-over-year and sequentially. As a result of these factors, our book-to-bill ratio continued to be below parity, though modestly above last quarter. Although our reported inventory levels were up, the increase was driven by a combination of Supply Chain as a Service engagements and foreign currency. Excluding these items, inventory for our core EC business was relatively flat. And our teams are confident that inventory levels for this core business will come down over the remainder of fiscal 2024. Ken will provide further color on inventory and our supply chain as a service offerings. As I mentioned previously, we are in the midst of an inventory correction. And our team has done a really nice job navigating it with a focus on optimizing our inventory investments today and reducing inventory levels in the coming quarters. We provide our supplier partners with our best read on true end market demand for our customers. I've said it before, we view inventory as a vital asset to fuel our business. But with the near-term sales outlook, we are focused on reducing inventory, were elevated and improving our cash conversion cycle. With that, let me turn to the highlights for our business. At the top line, our Electronic Components business saw mixed results across the regions. In constant currency, electronic component sales were down 1% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. Sales in the Americas were up 1% sequentially and declined 6% year-on-year with defense and transportation as the strongest end markets. Sales in Asia were up 2% sequentially and down 10% year-on-year. In Asia, transportation and communications were our strongest end markets. EMEA sales were down 7% sequentially and 10% year-on-year in constant currency. It is worth noting that EMEA had near record sales in the December quarter last year, Saragon is up against a tough compare. In EMEA, we are seeing softening in the industrial and transportation sectors. For our Farnell business, as expected, sales and profitability were impacted by softening demand, product mix and competitive pricing pressures. Farnell sales were down 6%, both sequentially and year-over-year in constant currency. Operating margins for Farnell were 4% during the quarter, which is disappointing but in line with our stated outlook. Despite the greater-than-expected sales decline, we were able to hold our operating margin as we began to see the benefits from some of the cost reduction actions we have already taken.  We still believe Farnell has a great potential to deliver value to customers, suppliers and is an important part of the Avnet portfolio. We are focused on improving operating margins near term while further leveraging the breadth of Avnet's customer base and sales force to identify growth opportunities. Our team is focused on several growth and margin expansion opportunities, including demand creation, IP&E and Embedded Solutions. In the quarter, our demand creation design wins and registrations remained strong, and demand creation revenues as a percentage of total revenue was stable on a sequential basis. We are also pursuing growth in our IP&E business. IP&E products have higher gross margins, and there are many cross-selling opportunities with IP&E components that are complementary to our semiconductor business. Finally, we see exciting opportunities with our embedded business, where we offer embedded board and display solutions. We have the capability to offer both custom solutions and third-party solutions, both of which come with higher gross margins. We continue to find ways to leverage our global sales force and technical capabilities to capitalize on these embedded growth opportunities. Our supplier partners value Avnet's ability to create solutions for customers that leverage their entire portfolio of products. The importance of solutions selling highlights why our suppliers continue to support our demand creation efforts. They are also focused on increasing customer count and leveraging the long tail of the industrial sector to generate growth. Our suppliers continue to part with Avnet and distribution in general to help them drive the growth they are seeking. As exciting as these opportunities are, we are still in the midst of an uncertain market. Over the past several weeks, I have met with several CEOs and decision makers at our supplier partners, representing nearly half of our revenues. The consensus sentiment among this group is that overall market softness will continue for at least a couple more quarters, but could extend through calendar 2024. To conclude, we are confident that our strong competitive position and our experience managing through many prior market cycles will serve us well as we navigate through these choppy waters. I want to thank our team for their dedication and commitment. We believe our people and our culture are key differentiators for Avnet, which enables us to compete well in any market environment. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken to dive deeper into our second quarter results.\nKen Jacobson: Thank you, Phil, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Avnet and for joining our earnings call. Our sales for the second quarter were approximately $6.2 billion, in line with guidance and down 8% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, sales were down 2% in constant currency as expected due to seasonal declines in the Western regions in the December quarter. From a regional perspective, sales in EMEA and the Americas each declined by 6% and Asia sales declined 10% from the year ago quarter. From an operating group perspective, electronic component sales declined 8% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency. EC sales declined 1% quarter-over-quarter in constant currency. Farnell sales declined 4% year-over-year and 6% in constant currency. Farnell sales were also 6% lower sequentially in constant currency. Sales of single board computers continue to ramp, increasing 32% quarter-over-quarter. For the second quarter, gross margin of 11.4% was 29 basis points lower year-over-year and 43 basis points lower quarter-over-quarter. EC gross margin was flat year-over-year and declined sequentially primarily due to a seasonal mix shift to Asia. Farnell gross margin was down sequentially and year-over-year, largely due to an unfavorable sales mix and from competitive pricing pressures for on-the-board components. Turning to operating expenses. Adjusted operating expenses were $464 million in the quarter, down 4% year-over-year and down 5% sequentially. Operating expenses were down 6% in constant currency year-over-year. As a percentage of gross profit dollars, adjusted operating expenses were 66% in the second quarter, 68 basis points higher than last quarter. For the second quarter, we reported adjusted operating income of $242 million, which decreased 19% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating margin was 3.9%, which decreased 57 basis points year-over-year and decreased 23 basis points quarter-over-quarter. By operating group, Electronic Components operating income was $248 million, down 16% year-over-year. EC operating margin was 4.3%, down 43 basis points year-over-year and 34 basis points lower sequentially. The sequential decline was primarily due to a combination of lower sales and a seasonal mix shift of sales to Asia. Farnell operating income was $16 million, down 7% year-over-year. Farnell operating margin was 4% in the quarter, down 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter and was impacted by lower sales an unfavorable sales mix and competitive pricing pressures related to on-the-board components, which was partially offset by lower operating expenses. As we discussed last quarter, Farnell has begun undertaking a wide range of restructuring actions to reduce operating expenses and improve gross margins. Overall, we are targeting annual expense reductions of between $50 million to $70 million, of which approximately 25% was already completed as we exited the second quarter. The majority of the restructuring actions at Farnell will be completed by the end of the fiscal year. We anticipate the next few quarters will be challenging for Farnell as continued demand and competitive pressures for on-the-board components may dampen the expected benefits of lower expenses. Although these restructuring actions are necessary to ensure Farnell has a sustainable operating expense model through any cycle, we do not take these actions lightly as they impact our people. Turning to expenses below operating income. Second quarter interest expense of $74 million increased by $15 million year-over-year and increased $4 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to higher average borrowings. This higher interest expense negatively impacted adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.12 year-over-year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 24% in the quarter as expected. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was in line with expectations at $1.40 for the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. During the quarter, working capital increased by $328 million sequentially, including an increase in reported inventories of $361 million, $171 million decrease in receivables and $138 million decrease in payables. As a result of this working capital increase, working capital days were 107 days for the quarter, an increase of 6 days quarter-over-quarter. Our return on working capital decreased quarterly on the higher working capital and lower operating income. Let me take a moment to give more color on inventory and the sequential increase in inventory this quarter. The overall increase in reported inventories was driven by an increase in inventory specific to supply chain service engagements and also from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Inventory related to our traditional core EC business remained flat and was stable in the December quarter. We continue to have line of sight on incoming inventory while we work through the challenges created by elevated inventory levels across the supply chain. Although we are disappointed that inventory for our core EC business remains flat, we are confident these inventory levels will start to decline in the March and June quarters. From a supply chain as a service perspective, we continue to see an increase in opportunities for this service offering. The customer base for these engagements are typically large OEMs who have historically done their business directly with our suppliers. These OEMs and suppliers are prioritizing resiliency in their supply chains as a lesson learned from the past few years of component shortages, which is driving an increase in these opportunities. As a reminder, these service engagements are separate from our traditional core EC business as the associated inventory is really the inventory of the OEM or the supplier that we hold on their behalf. The inventory is contractually restricted and the risk profile is different compared to inventories held for our core EC distribution business. The increase in inventories for supply chain services was specific to a few newer engagements that ramp towards the end of the quarter. We would expect inventories for Supply Chain Services to be flat to down slightly in the third and fourth quarters for our existing engagements. Our team remains highly focused on reducing inventory levels where elevated which will help us drive cash flow from operations in the second half of fiscal 2024. The increase in working capital led to an increase in debt of $279 million. During the quarter, we used $42 million of cash for operations. However, over the past 4 quarters, we generated $169 million of cash from operations. We expect to generate positive cash flow in the third quarter in excess of the cash used for operations during the first half of fiscal 2024. We ended the quarter with a gross leverage of 2.6x, and we had approximately $493 million of available committed borrowing capacity. With regard to our capital allocation, we continue to prioritize our existing business needs, including working capital and capital expenditures. During the second quarter, cash used for CapEx was $82 million, primarily to support a new distribution center being constructed in EMEA. We expect CapEx to return to historical levels in the second half of fiscal 2024 of approximately $25 million to $35 million per quarter. In the second quarter, we repurchased approximately $59 million of the shares. We used the cash proceeds from our recent legal settlement to buy back shares during the first and second quarters. We have $232 million left on our current share repurchase authorization entering the third quarter. We also paid our quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share or $28 million. For the long term, we remain committed to our road map of delivering a reliable and increasing dividend and share repurchases to increase our shareholder value when we believe our shares are undervalued by the market. Book value per share improved to approximately $55 a share or a sequential increase of approximately $3 a share. As we generate cash flow from operations in the second half of fiscal 2024, we expect to use the cash for a combination of debt paydown and for buying back shares. Turning to guidance. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we are guiding sales in the range of $5.55 billion to $5.85 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.05 to $1.15. Our third quarter guidance is based on current market conditions and implies a sequential sales decline of 6% to 11%. This guidance assumes sales declines for the Western regions versus typical seasonality of sales growth and a seasonal decline in sales from Asia due to the Lunar New Year. This guidance assumes similar interest expense compared to the second quarter, an effective income tax rate of between 22% and 26% and 91 million shares outstanding on a diluted basis. Implied in our guidance is an EC operating margin above 4%.  Although there is some uncertainty in the overall market environment we are currently in, our team will continue to focus on the things that we can control or influence. This includes being disciplined with our operating expenses, driving working capital reductions and cash flows and winning new opportunities that drive profitable growth and continued market share gains. With that, I will turn it back over to the operator to open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from William Stein with Truth Securities.\nWilliam Stein: I'd like to ask -- I was going to ask about inventory, but maybe given the way you addressed it already, it sounds like it's really more of a supply chain issue. So -- a supply chain engagement issue. So let me instead ask about that. We've heard Avnet talk about supply chain engagements for quite some time. I wonder if you can talk to us about the differences between that business and the more traditional electronic components distribution whether it might warrant reporting the revenue separately and the inventories for that separately? And maybe talk about the different dynamics there sort of inventory turns in that business versus the core returns on invested capital, other metrics that you're targeting in that business? And I do have a follow-up, if that's okay.\nPhil Gallagher: Yes. Will, thanks. This is Phil, and I'll probably turn it over to Ken. So -- and that's what we're working to clarify in the script, okay, to start breaking that out a little bit more. And we'll pull that string as we move forward. Supply chain is kind of a generic term, too. That's why we're kind of defining it as a service because supply chain is what we do. And you're right, we've been doing that for years with our traditional supply chain and our traditional core customers, whether it be consignments of implant stores, compound, point of use replenishment systems, et cetera, et cetera. That still exists. That's still a big part of our business. The ones that we're kind of breaking out in the call today and we started to a couple of calls ago, the supply chain as a service are really large OEMs that maybe traditionally weren't utilizing our supply chain services that are now coming to us. And they are different financial models, different inventory carrying and working capital models, even with different financing. So that let me turn it over to Ken. He can give articulate a little bit more color on that. But I appreciate the question. We'll continue to work to break that out and explain more in the future. Ken?\nKen Jacobson: I'd just say, the message we want to kind of convey is that the broader inventory for the EC business is stable. We're disappointed that it hasn't gone down yet, right, because that's something the team is actively driving to do, but we do see line of sight to some reductions in that core inventory to go in the next couple of quarters. As the supply chain as a service inventory, I mean that happens to be our accounting, our reporting, is within our inventory.  We're beginning to give a little bit more color at least on the balance sheet will. So I think the path for further clarity would be first on the balance sheet and then moving to the P&L as those engagements ramp. And so here's how I'd characterize the difference. I mean, I think the first thing, these are really large engagements typically, right? So the magnitude of the throughput of components is much bigger. And that's mostly driven by the fact that the, let's say, the end customer here in these service arrangements are typically large OEMs. And what we try to comment on it, these are the ones that we typically haven't been doing business with because they have direct relationship with suppliers and they have their own partners they use. And so this is new opportunities for us because we haven't really played in the big OEM space. So transportation is one opportunity, but it's really across all end markets that we're seeing, including, let's say, communications and networking and things like that. But typically, the engagements are driven by the OEM. And typically, what's happening is we're kind of procuring on their behalf the inventory that they were normally buying at their pricing most likely, right? So they might have a direct contract or other pricing. So it's not, let's say, normal course fulfillment or anything like that. This is really buying based on their contract. And so the main difference we see is the inventory profile we try to talk about it's not really our inventory even though we report it as such. It's their inventory, there's contractual restrictions, right? So it's really providing the service on their behalf. So from an overall profile, typically the gross margin is better, but it's not really a top line revenue because of the fact that it's services revenue versus revenue from the sale of components. From a return on invested capital, return on working capital, it's at or above typically where other engagements would be at. We look to find creative working capital solutions for these types of engagements. In some cases, we'll finance it or we'll fund it through our own working capital or borrowing capacity. But a lot of times, we're either trying to have the OEMs bring cash to the table or looking for third-party programs to help us finance that and our commitment really not only to our supplier partners, but also to our teams is the fact that we're really not trying to restrict our existing business, right? We want to have this be and, not an or, and so we really don't want to consume our working capital to fund these engagements because we want to protect that for the normal horse of business to grow our long tail of customers and things like that. So hopefully, that adds the color you're looking for. And again, we'll continue to add transparency as these things ramp and get bigger.\nPhil Gallagher: Great explanation, Ken. And well, it is a good question. Apologize for a lengthy answer because it is complex, and we want to be transparent. And what brought some of these on is the breakdown in supply chain late over the last 3 years, and where customers got caught short as we all know, right, with the shortages and the stoppages and supply chain. So some of these opportunities even come those from our suppliers have being asked is beginning to be asked to do things that maybe is not in their core. So they bring it to us and we go work it together. So I'll leave it at that, and then we can pick it up later, if you like.\nWilliam Stein: If I could just ask one follow-up. So I think you've made this explanation of the increased inventory from the from the supply chain engagements or supply chain as a service engagements, but I think you said that the -- for the core EC and Farnell business, it was flattish and you were trying to bring it down. All the semi companies I cover have -- or most of them have talked about a significant decline in channel revenue in the last couple of quarters. And I'm just trying to -- obviously, I don't cover every semi company in the world, but I'm wondering if you can help me sort of reconcile these data points when many of the larger semi companies are talking about channel sales being down any way that you might be able to reconcile that I can't recognize, it's not so obvious to me.\nPhil Gallagher: Clarification, channel sales to the channel. Will, you are talking about our sales out and sales into us.\nWilliam Stein: In.\nPhil Gallagher: Well, our sales out, I think we guided. I mean, so we hit the December. So we were pleased with that. So -- and we believe we gained some share. Sales in all the suppliers are a little bit different. Obviously, there's a few that probably need a little bit more help than others. But we're -- even when we're up in inventory I've said this before. It's not across all the suppliers.  I mean we could use more inventory in a lot of areas that still might be a little tight. It's in a handful of suppliers that might even be heavier ship in debit. So I think the important thing is we're working on our suppliers, as we said in the script, I mean every day with our customers trying to balance the true demand as best we can see it in the outlook and we pipeline accordingly. But overall, the behavior from the suppliers has been good. They've been good partners. And as we said, I think 2 calls good. There's 1 or 2, we've had some opportunistic opportunities that we've taken advantage of, and it's been a win-win.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Phil, in the prepared remarks, I think you said that you can -- your conversations with the CEOs have been showing that market softness in the last couple of quarters or through 2024. I think last quarter when we spoke, the thought was that the channel is going through an inventory correction, which is until the mid of 2024. Has your thought process on that changed as your viewpoint changed do you think that the inventory correction take longer? And do you see like -- it just sounded like you think that the markets are going to be weaker longer. Just your overall thoughts on that?\nPhil Gallagher: Yes. I think -- I still think it's somewhere around midyear. I might stretch into the September quarter, Ruplu. Things have changed. I mean, things changed in 90 days -- from 90 days ago with some of the softness in industrial and whatnot, we pointed out, and our suppliers are pointing out. But I still think it's mid-'24 into December for the inventory correction. And then we'll see if there's growth or statement remains flat through 2024. It's just too far out to call that. But I do think as we bring our inventory down, which we believe we would do in the next several quarters. That would be a positive sign. We'll spin off cash and we'll go from there, and then we'll see what kind of growth the market dictates at that point in time.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Let me ask, Ken, a question on margins. I think you said EC margins in the guide can stay above 4%. So can you comment on what revenue level you need to see to keep those margins above 4%. And the same question on Farnell margins. How should we think about that trending over the next couple of quarters? What are the puts and takes there? I mean it was at 4% this quarter. Do you think there's a chance that -- how quickly can that recover? What do you need to see there?\nKen Jacobson: Yes. Maybe I'll take the Farnell question first, Ruplu. I'll just say I think in the December quarter, the Farnell sales were a little softer than we had anticipated, which kind of hurt the ability to provide a healthier operating margin. We have the expense actions ongoing. But I think the challenge with Farnell is really competitive pressures on the board components. Now that the on-the-board components are more available with lead times coming down, right, there's less demand from the catalog or high service distributors. And then on top of that, the high service competitors have a lot of inventory, including Farnell having a lot of inventory, so that's putting further pressure on the pricing. So we're seeing those 2 headwinds. And so that's why we kind of gave the outlook that it's going to be a tough couple of quarters for Farnell as that business gets through the inventory we feel decent that margin levels have stabilized, but unfortunately, they're a little lower than we had anticipated. And the cost actions are going to take a little time as well. So that's why we kind of signaled it's going to be perhaps more of the same for the next couple of quarters with Farnell with opportunity to kind of uplift that margin modestly over the -- as we ended the year. Talking about the EC business, what I would say is I think implied in the guidance, which I talked about a little bit is normally, we would get a seasonal uplift in the West, right? So we get a robust shift in business from Asia to the West, which helps on the margin. We're still seeing some of that, but because the West is expected to be down in the March quarter versus typically up, we're not getting the uplift that we normally would see there with a favorable mix. And so what I would say is, hey, we're kind of at the revenue levels, right, to kind of maintain that. But typically, we're not going to get into the fourth quarter. But typically, you see Asia rebound a little bit coming off the Lunar New Year. So that would be typically what would happen in the fourth quarter, as you'd see Asia up a little bit from whatever they do in the March quarter. But with that being said, we're continuing to drive it. And as Phil noted, we're going to control expenses. And we're going to continue to work on that core inventory, and we wanted to go from stable to down where that inventory is elevated, the team is working on it. And so we're going to focus on the cash flow and getting the inventory down. And try to compete well in the market where we have opportunities. We're still seeing some opportunities out there, but it's definitely more challenging than it was 9 days ago.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Let me just sneak one more in. You mentioned expenses. Maybe both for you and Phil. Phil, I think you said you're making investments in the sales force? I mean you talked about demand creation and IP&E and embedded. So I guess my question is, do you need to invest in more sales force to train them or to hire more people. At the same time, you're doing restructuring in Farnell. So I mean if you can reason like what your expectation is for OpEx as a percent of gross profit going forward and the type of investments you see happening over the next couple of quarters?\nPhil Gallagher: Yes, you got it Ruplu. I'll let Ken answer that net of ease in that GP. Look, we've been managing our expenses. I mean we have not increased our expenses as a percent. And we've been actually -- I always say that, yes, we're always reducing expenses while we need to make investments. And some investments might be in productivity tools, RPAs, things on those lines now artificial intelligence/machine learning. So we're putting more and more investment behind the, I'll call it, the digital side of the equation. As far as sales force, our field application engineers, our design solutions and yes, we mentioned embedded. We're well staffed there. We've invested there appropriately. We are not removing investments in that space that drives the growth and the profitability of the company. So there's no movement of foot in the core to adjust anything in those areas. And we've articulated clearly, we'll come back more on the Farnell restructuring is separate as Ken pointed out. Ken, on net GP.\nKen Jacobson: Yes. I mean I think sales are coming down Obviously, Ruplu implied in the March guidance that the OE to GP is going to be impacted accordingly in terms of percentage. But I would just think about it as kind of flattish. I mean, where we are making investments, we're trying to self-fund we are focused on expense discipline. So what I would say is we're kind of more of the same outside of Farnell, but depending on our view of how long the demand softness may look at, we might have to take a harder look at more expense actions. But again, anything we do there, we're going to protect for the medium term and long term and really focus on the opportunities we see out beyond the horizon of where the demand is soft.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo.\nJoe Quatrochi: A couple if I could. Maybe just kind of first sticking with the Farnell. The cost restructuring that you're putting in place, do we think about that $50 million to $70 million is flowing to the bottom line for the total kind of company P&L? Or are there areas that maybe there's a little bit of offset from a cost perspective just as we're thinking about OpEx?\nKen Jacobson: Yes. I think first thing I'd say is it's an annual amount, and I think there are other factors to consider. So I'd say I don't know that I would be a direct one for one. It depends on volume and other things. But I think from a Farnell perspective, right, I think that you can kind of start to build that in to the operating margin as we exit the year.\nJoe Quatrochi: And I assume you meant fiscal year. And then just as a follow-up to that. Maybe just kind of trying to understand what's changed from 90 days ago and just understanding maybe it's the kind of the mix of demand of the areas that are starting to maybe see incremental weakness I guess, how do I think about just your exposure, the mix exposure of, say, industrial to like Western regions relative to Asia and just kind of what's incrementally weaker relative to last quarter?\nPhil Gallagher: Yes, I'll take that, Joe. Thanks. I think what we've seen it vary global basis, I'd sum it up that where we've seen probably the greater weakness and it's been very strong and really some of those would be in the industrial space, okay? And that's our -- let's call it between 25% and 33% of our business is industrial. It's really broad, okay? But that's come down a little bit sequentially and year-on-year. That's been particularly strong. The industrial has been particularly strong in Europe. And Europe, as we pointed out, has had 3 record quarters until this past quarter. So we've been performing well as that got soft that obviously affects us. If you look at the transportation overall, I know there's a lot of mixed signals out on transportation. That's still holding up pretty good. It's down sequentially and down year-on-year, but I would say modestly in single digit. So still holding up and it's actually up in the Americas was more down in Europe, again, which is our second largest vertical. Defense, unfortunately, with what's going on in the world today is actually quite healthy, and we see that continuing to stay strong.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel.\nMatt Sheerin: Phil, I wanted to get back to the inventory issues. I appreciate the commentary about the supply chain engagements as a service. But it seems like it's more -- you're actually you're buying the inventory, you're carrying the inventory, that's a working capital burden for you. And so when you talk about inventory, and I know it's restricted, but that's still inventory on your books, right? So when we think about your over 100 days of inventory, what's the target for the next 2 to 3 quarters? And is there a thought to given to working with OEM customers, where they're actually owning the inventory, it's more consigned so it's a true as-a-service model because it seems like it's a traditional model where you're carrying the cost of that inventory.\nKen Jacobson: Matt, I mean -- this is Ken. I guess I'd start with is, I think there's alternative forms of funding of the inventory in general, right of the components part of what you're talking about is really an accounting versus how you actually perform the service, right? So you need physical custody, you need in our warehouses to move it, right? You think about the OEM that may not have manufacturing and things like that. So this gets to a lot of complications in terms of there's one, how you account for it and how we report it in our financials, and there's 2, is how do you actually conduct the service for OEMs that are without manufacturing footprints and things like that, right? So I think there's tax things, legal entity things that get into why someone like Avnet needs to step in to provide the service versus other parties. So I guess how I'd characterize it, we do feel it's a different risk profile. We do feel that we've got enhanced protection for this product versus, let's say, normal course of business product. So we do view it differently, even if it's currently reported in the same line item as the other inventory, and that's what we're trying to convey. But part of that becomes in, how do you provide the service. And if it's consigned then that means something that OEMs could already do the supply chain on their own, right? In some cases, it's not consigned, but it's -- the capital is provided by the OEMs in some cases, they want capital being part of the service, right? So it's a mixed bag. And our view is we're trying to maintain flexibility to provide the services they need but measure it based on the returns we get and the fact that it won't restrict our normal course of business opportunities, right, with the capital restriction, right? We've got enough, let's say, elevated inventory levels in our normal course of business, we're not compounding the issue, if you will with these engagements. And that's been transparent with the customers we're working with. And so they kind of understand that this is kind of separate.\nPhil Gallagher: Yes, Matt, so it's just -- thanks, Ken. Yes, the inventory days are certainly up a little bit higher than we'd like it to be. And as I said in the script, we're not -- I mean, inventory is not a bad thing. We have maybe a little too much, but it's not aged, it's not a liability. We do want to start bringing it down in the March quarter as we bring it down relative to the sales, it's a math issue, the days of inventory. So we would expect the days to start to come down as well.  But the key is just making sure we got the quality inventory as we bring it down, start generating more cash. So again, we got to support the market that we see going forward and balance the right investments in inventory is one of the big ones.\nMatt Sheerin: And then just related to that, your interest expense obviously has gone up significantly, it looks like it's kind of -- it's a $300 million run rate for fiscal '24. 2 years ago, it was $100 million. That's obviously a huge swing in EPS. So Ken, is that a priority in terms of working down at short-term borrowings and getting that interest expense down.\nKen Jacobson: Yes, Matt, 100%. I mean, I think the -- we need to get the cash flow and that cash is going to be used in part for debt pay down, right? I mean there's a combination of factors driving that. But clearly, the elevated inventory is a big piece of that over the past year and even longer than that. So I would say that is a focus. And the cost of borrowing is definitely much more expensive than it was in the past, but we need to get that down. And it's going to take some time, though, I would caution.\nOperator: Our last question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: The first one is on long-term margins. And Ken, I think this predates you as a CFO. But back in June '22 at the Analyst or Investor Day, you guys threw out a medium-term operating margin target of above 5%. And I realize we're at the close to the trough of the cycle. But Farnell, I think at the time, operating margins were in the mid-teens. You're currently at 4% or 5%. I think EC has held in really well. But do you think the above 5% cross cycle or medium-term target is still intact and you're comfortable with that? Or have there been sort of fundamental permanent changes that would kind of swing that view?\nKen Jacobson: Yes. Thanks, Toshiya. I mean I'm generally familiar with, obviously, those targets to put out. And I would say we are not coming off of those targets. We see opportunity. Now clearly, we're a little bit backwards, right? So we've got to get back to where we were. But again, the EC business holding up in the third quarter. You mentioned the trough. I've just knocked on wood there. But let's -- we see opportunity, and we see that some of the markets we're in have growth, we do see right now, Phil made some commentary that pricing in general is holding up pretty well. We are still focused on gross margin. So even if there is pressures on some level of pricing, what we're focused on those higher margin opportunities. We use supply chain as a service as higher margin. Phil talked about demand creation, IP&E, some of our embedded solutions products. So those are all higher-margin type opportunities relative to kind of the baseline margin we have. And then Farnell, obviously, getting that back is key, and that's going to take longer than we would have liked or expected because of where -- how far down has come, but we still see those opportunities medium term. And we think the overall health of our business and the overall opportunities we're seeing when we talk to our supplier partners, I mean I think we're definitely excited for the future, even though it's going to be some choppy waters here for the next couple of quarters.\nToshiya Hari: Okay. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up on free cash flow generation going forward. You guys spoke to a declining inventory or managing that better going forward. You also noted that CapEx should normalize lower, I forget at what point, but you talked about that. So it feels like you've got pretty good tailwinds from a free cash flow perspective, middle part of the year, back half of the year. A, is that the right way to think about sort of the trajectory of free cash flow; and b, if there's any quantitative guidance you can provide on that, that would be super helpful for perhaps calendar '24.\nKen Jacobson: Yes, I think that's right. I mean I wouldn't get into calendar '24, but what we did say for this next quarter for the March quarter was cash flow in excess of what we used in the first half of the fiscal year and that the CapEx levels are normalized, so we would expect positive free cash flow in the third quarter. And to answer your question, as the inventory goes down, right, then the cash flow accelerates. So we see line of sight to that in Q3 and Q4. We're not going to give quantitative numbers, but we see lots of opportunity and we want to drive large cash flow numbers.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Phil Gallagher for closing remarks.\nPhil Gallagher: Great. Thanks a lot. And I want to thank everyone for attending today's earnings call, and I look forward to speaking to you again at our third fiscal quarter earnings report in May. Thank you very much. Have a great rest of the week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to the Avnet First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Burke, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Joe. You may begin.\nJoe Burke: Thank you, Paul. I’d like to welcome everyone to the Avnet first quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. This afternoon, Avnet released financial results for the first quarter fiscal year 2024, and the release is available on the Investor Relations section of Avnet’s website, along with a slide presentation, which you may access in advance at your convenience. As a reminder, some of the information contained in the news release and on this conference call contain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Such forward-looking statements are not the guarantee of performance, and the company’s actual results could differ materially from those contained in such statements. Several factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are described in detail in Avnet’s most recent Form 10-Q and 10-K and subsequent filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this presentation, and the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements or supply new information regarding the circumstances after the date of this presentation. Today’s call will be led by Phil Gallagher, Avnet’s CEO; and Ken Jacobson, Avnet’s CFO. With that, let me turn the call over to Phil Gallagher. Phil?\nPhil Gallagher: Thank you, Joe, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on our first quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. Before we get into the quarter, I want to take a moment and remark on recent events in the Middle East in general and specifically, our operations in Israel. Our thoughts and prayers are with our employees and all those in the region affected by recent events. We hope this devastating conflict will be resolved as soon as possible. As of this date, all of our employees in Israel are safe and accounted for, and we continue to service our customers to the greatest extent possible under these circumstances. Moving on to our results. I’ll start with a reminder that in fiscal year 2023, we delivered double-digit sales growth in constant currency, record earnings per share and ended the year with a strong balance sheet and great momentum. I’m pleased to share that we kicked off the new fiscal year with another quarter of solid financial results, continuing that momentum and underscoring our strength and resiliency in the current market environment. In the quarter, we achieved sales of more than $6.3 billion. This was above the midpoint of our guidance, down 3% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. Continued efficient management of our operations enabled us to drive solid operating margins of 4.1%, highlighted by a 4.6% operating margin in our Electronic Components business. Our team continues to compete well in this market by working with our customers to provide the flexibility they need to manage their component supply chains and by working with our suppliers to provide visibility to end-customer demand and the impact to our customers’ current inventory levels have or near-term demand. In the quarter, demand was mixed across our diverse verticals. Transportation remains strongest, while demand in the industrial and aerospace and defense verticals were a bit more moderate. Overall, semiconductor lead times continue to improve slightly, but still remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. Shortages continue in some areas, particularly MCUs and power products targeting automotive and industrial applications. While pricing has generally stabilized, we do not expect overall pricing to decline in the near term due to the increased cost for producing components, including higher cost for labor, raw materials and general inflationary pressures. We continue to coordinate closely with customers and suppliers to effectively manage backlog, which is down from a year ago. As a result, our overall book-to-bill ratios continue to be below parity, though modestly above last quarter. We communicated on our August call that we expect inventory levels to be up this quarter as we supported a specific strategic initiative. Our ending inventory levels were in line with those expectations, which Ken will discuss in his comments. I do want to emphasize that as a distributor, inventory is the lifeblood of our business and having the right inventory is a strategic advantage. We are always working to ensure we have the right mix and right levels. Our suppliers continue to work with us on inventory, and I want to thank them for their partnership and support as we work through the correction together. Before we move on to operating group results, I wanted to provide my thoughts on recent conversations I’ve had with key stakeholders across the supply chain. I was recently in the Bay Area with a large group of procurement leaders from several of our customers and suppliers. The consensus of the group is that inventory levels for certain parts across the supply chain continue to be elevated and that additional flexibility to delay inventory replenishment is necessary. Although demand across end markets remain healthy, customers have enough supply of many components, which will take multiple quarters to burn off. The conversations with these procurement leaders also confirmed our belief that Avnet is well positioned with our supply chain capabilities. Our customers continue to have a need for our services as they transition from a JIT to a more resilient supply chain. With that, let me turn to the highlights for our businesses. At the top line, Electronic Components business saw mixed results across the regions. In constant currency, Electronic Components sales were down nearly 3% sequentially and 8% year-over-year. Sales in the Americas were down 9% sequentially and 6% year-on-year with transportation and industrial as the strongest end markets. Sales in Asia were up 4% sequentially and down nearly 17% year-on-year, coming off a record sales quarter last year. In Asia, transportation continues to be our strongest end market and China continues to have the softest demand. Coming off a record sales quarter in Q4, EMEA sales were down 5% sequentially and up 2% year-on-year in constant currency. In the quarter, EMEA continued to see strength in transportation, industrial and the aerospace and defense end markets. Despite some of the broader market challenges we’ve been facing, we’re encouraged by how demand is holding up in some of our key markets. We believe that our diversification and focus on high-growth verticals is helping to keep sales above the $6 billion per quarter level as previously communicated. We continue to benefit from our unique engineering capabilities with our field application engineers and digital design tools, resulting in another strong quarter for demand creation. As component lead time stabilize, our field application engineers are now busy spending more time on product innovation and developing new design starts rather than chasing down parts to maintain existing designs. Customers are also evaluating more redesigns as they look to optimize costs or to mitigate future risk related to older technologies. Turning to our Farnell business. As expected, Farnell sales and profitability were impacted by product mix and competitive pricing pressures. Farnell sales were down 5% sequentially and down 4% year-over-year in constant currency. In the quarter, we made progress working through the backlog for single-board computers, but the shipments have yet to fully ramp. We also had a good quarter for test and measurement component sales. Sales of the onboard product lines comprised of semiconductors and IP&E products saw the greatest decline in sales, driving the unfavorable sales mix. Operating margins for Farnell were above 4% during the quarter, and we expect them to be at or above similar levels in the December quarter, which is traditionally the lowest sales quarter from a seasonality standpoint. We remain excited about Farnell despite the disappointing near-term outlook and see additional opportunity to leverage Farnell’s and Electronic Components’ unique and synergistic collaboration to better serve Avnet customers. Farnell also has growth opportunities with recent line card additions and from investments in new products that should materialize over the next few quarters. Given the recent results, however, we are taking certain cost actions to reduce the operating expense base at Farnell, which Ken will touch on in his remarks. To conclude, as we navigate the current market environment, we continue to demonstrate our strength and resiliency. I believe our recent results reflect that, and I want to thank our teams for delivering under such challenging conditions. Given the macro and industry-specific backdrop, it is difficult to gauge when the correction will finish, but our best estimate is it will last through mid-2024. This time frame is also consistent with some of the recent conversations I’ve had with top executives of several of our major suppliers, who share the view that the correction will subside sometime in the middle of 2024. We continue to believe our diversified end markets and our broad customer base positions us well for profitable growth for all of our stakeholders. As [Indiscernible] market, I am confident in our team’s ability to execute in a challenging and uncertain environment and to continue to deliver value to our suppliers and customer partners. With that, I’ll turn it over to Ken to dive deeper into our first quarter results. Ken?\nKen Jacobson: Thank you, Phil, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining our earnings call. As Phil mentioned, we had a solid start to 2024. Our sales for the first quarter were approximately $6.3 billion, down 6% year-over-year and in line with guidance. On a sequential basis, sales were down 3% in constant currency. From a regional perspective, sales from the Western regions were 61% of sales in the first quarter compared to 64% last quarter and 56% in the year ago quarter. The sequential decline was expected due to seasonal mix shifts from the Western regions to Asia in the first half of each fiscal year. From an operating group perspective, Electronic Components sales declined 7% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency. Sales declined 3% quarter-over-quarter in constant currency. Farnell sales declined 1% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. Farnell sales were 5% lower sequentially in constant currency. Excluding sales of single-board computers, Farnell sales declined 8% year-over-year and 7% quarter-over-quarter in constant currency. For the first quarter, gross margin of 11.8% improved 43 basis points year-over-year and was 67 basis points lower quarter-over-quarter. EC gross margin improved year-over-year primarily due to a greater mix of sales from our Western regions. EC gross margin declined sequentially primarily due to a seasonal mix shift to Asia. Farnell gross margin was down year-over-year largely due to the unwinding of pricing premiums and unfavorable sales mix and from competitive pricing pressures. Farnell gross margin was down sequentially primarily due to an unfavorable sales mix and from competitive pricing pressures for on-the-board components. Turning to operating expenses. We continue to focus on controlling and reducing costs in specific areas, but we aren’t currently planning any broad-based cost-reduction actions while we navigate through this market correction. We want to build on the momentum we created over the past couple of years and to be fully resourced to take advantage of the opportunities we see coming out of the correction. During the quarter, adjusted operating expenses were $486 million, down 4% sequentially, but 2% higher year-over-year. Operating expenses were down slightly in constant currency year-over-year. As a percentage of gross profit dollars, adjusted operating expenses were 65% in the first quarter, 320 basis points higher than a year ago and 323 basis points higher than last quarter. For the first quarter, we reported adjusted operating income of $262 million, which decreased 11% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating margin was 4.1%, which decreased 22 basis points year-over-year and decreased 64 basis points quarter-over-quarter. By operating group, Electronic Components operating income was $273 million, up 2% year-over-year. EC operating margin was 4.6%, up 38 basis points year-over-year, but 47 basis points lower sequentially. The year-over-year improvement was led by our EC EMEA and EC Americas businesses, each of which expanded operating margin year-over-year by more than 20 basis points. The sequential decline was primarily due to a combination of lower sales and a seasonal mix shift of sales to Asia. Farnell operating income was $18 million, down 66% year-over-year. Farnell operating margin was 4.2% in the quarter, down 389 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Farnell operating margin continued to be impacted by sales mix and competitive pricing pressures related to on-the-board components. In order to improve margins, Farnell has implemented a series of expense management activities to reduce operating expenses. While we anticipate Q2 to be another challenging quarter for Farnell, we expect these actions will support its path back to high single-digit operating margins in the near term and a return to double-digit operating margins in the medium term. Turning to expenses below operating income. First quarter interest expense of $71 million increased by $26 million year-over-year, but decreased $40 million quarter-over-quarter. Increased interest expense negatively impacted adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.21 year-over-year. Our adjusted effective income tax rate was 24% in the quarter as expected. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were better than expected at $1.61 for the quarter. Turning to the balance sheet and liquidity. During the quarter, working capital increased by $134 million, including an expected increase in inventories of $290 million, partially offset by an $84 million decrease in receivables and a $72 million increase in payables. As a result of this working capital increase, working capital days was 101 days for the quarter, which increased four days quarter-over-quarter. Our return on working capital decreased accordingly but remains well above our cost of capital. Inventories grew during the quarter due to two factors. The largest was expected increase in inventories for EC business due to the strategic opportunity we had communicated last quarter. The second was an increase in inventory investments made at Farnell. Note, we don’t expect any further investments in Farnell as they have sufficient inventory to support current business conditions. As we move into our second quarter, we are seeing a ramp in our supply chain services, which will result in an increase in inventories. For Q2, we expect inventory levels to remain flat to up slightly as a result of the inventory growth for those engagements, which are expected to be cash flow and working capital-neutral. We continue to characterize our inventories as stable. And as Phil mentioned, we believe it will take multiple quarters for customers to burn off their elevated inventory levels. While we continue to focus on improving inventory turns and generating cash flow, our top priority is to ensure we continue to support our customers’ and suppliers’ needs as we work through these challenges together. The increase in working capital led to an increase in debt of $112 million. During the quarter, we used $41 million of cash for operations. We used $110 million of cash for operations over the past 12 months. We ended the quarter with a gross leverage of 2.3 times, and we had approximately $732 million of available committed borrowing capacity. Our teams continue to work on selling inventory on hand and collecting receivables to provide additional liquidity in the coming quarters. From a capital allocation perspective, we continue to prioritize our existing business needs, including working capital and capital expenditures. During the first quarter, cash used for capital expenditures was $76 million primarily to support a new distribution center being constructed in EMEA. We increased our quarterly dividend by approximately 7% to $0.31 per share, and we repurchased approximately $27 million worth of shares. We have $291 million left in our current share repurchase authorization. For the long term, we remain committed to our road map of delivering a reliable and increasing dividend and share repurchases to increase our shareholder value when we believe our shares are undervalued by the market. Book value per share improved to approximately $52 a share or a sequential increase of approximately $1 per share. Turning to guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we are guiding sales in the range of $6.0 billion to $6.3 billion and diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. Our second quarter guidance is based on current marketing conditions and implies a sequential sales decline of 1% to 5%. This guidance assumes a seasonal decline in sales from the Western regions primarily due to holidays. This guidance assumes similar interest expense compared to the first quarter, an effective tax rate of between 22% and 26%, and 92 million shares outstanding on a diluted basis. In summary, we’re pleased with our performance and execution during the quarter within this current market environment. We will continue to focus on execution, managing through the correction and achieving our stated financial goals. With that, I will turn it back over to the operator to open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Melissa Fairbanks with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Hi guys, thanks so much. Great quarter. Congratulations on another great quarter in a little bit of a challenging time. I was wondering if we could dig in on the strategic investment in inventory that you made. Are you able to give us a little more color on maybe is that targeting a specific end market or specific customer sets or just kind of understand what’s going on there?\nPhil Gallagher: Yes. Melissa, it’s Phil. And by the way, thanks for the comments. Appreciate that. It’s really for specific – it’s a specific supplier with a handful of customers, okay? And so it’s very limited. And I think it’s important. That’s why we noted on the last call to let everybody know, hey we planned this, we know about this. And we don’t do that without all the ROIC measures in place and be sure it’s good for Avnet and good for the customer, good for the supplier. So it’s very specific in nature.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay. Great. Is it safe to assume that that’s already in the backlog, whatever that level of fulfillment is going to be?\nPhil Gallagher: Yes. Yes, this was not – that’s actually a great question. Because it wasn’t a broad-based, say, go bring in inventory and go try to find homes. It’s brought it in, it has specific homes.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Great, great. Thanks. And then maybe just one kind of quick – I don’t know if this is a quick answer, but maybe discuss some of the actions that you’re taking at Farnell. You mentioned return to high single-digit operating margin within the near term. Just wondering if you could give a little bit more detail on – is near term by fiscal year-end? Or what should we be thinking there?\nKen Jacobson: Yes. I mean, I think specific to some of the cost actions; it’s a combination of factors. I think it’s things like optimized freight, looking at warehouse footprint as well as some people actions, right? But it’s trying to look at where we have some areas for improvement that we’ve been planning for a couple of quarters, but hadn’t really pulled the trigger and now need to accelerate some of those things. There’s also opportunities in terms of new supplier lines and shared strategic customers between Avnet and Farnell. And I do think that time line is exiting the fiscal year in that mid- to high-single digits is the expectation.\nMelissa Fairbanks: Okay, great. Thanks so much. That’s all for me now.\nKen Jacobson: Thanks, Melissa.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. Phil, I want to start with a higher-level question. I think I heard you say that the industry inventory correction, you think it will take till the middle of next year. And so I guess my question would be, why is that the right time frame? Why not earlier or later? What are some of the things that are leading you to think that it will be till the middle of next year? And what can drive that – what can help in that process? Like what are some of the factors that go into that?\nPhil Gallagher: Yes. Thanks, Ruplu. Well, it’s our best estimate on how – by what we’re seeing in lead times, combined with our backlog and the book-to-bills. So there’s a lot that goes into that, not to mention our own analytics that we put to the historical versus future. So that’s just what we’re seeing today, Ruplu. Hey, it could be sooner, I mean, no question. I just didn’t think we need to be overly bullish there. I think as we’re seeing the market softening a bit, the book-to-bills have been below parity for a while, which again, I think is fine at this point because we want to get that backlog right. So we’re making the adjustments in the backlog. But that’s just what we see. And based on those factors I shared and the different verticals that we study, I think the good news is, we’re so diversified that we’re not any too over – or top-heavy on any one vertical, which I think helps us give a pretty good view to the market. And as I’ve said before, this is a – in my 47-year that – it’s a different market. I mean there’s so many mixed signals. There’s still some lead times that are out there tied to certain products. There are some verticals and customers still doing really well, others not so well. So it’s definitely a bit of a mixed bag, but that’s just how we see it. We don’t press them with our regions. We get the roll up in the forecast and do a rolling four quarter, and that’s about what we see.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay. Thanks for details there. If I can ask you a question on margins. I think overall, you’ve said that as long as revenues can stay above $6 billion, then the operating margin for the company can stay above 4%. When you look at the operating environment today, I think you said that you saw unwinding of pricing premiums at Farnell and you saw some competitive pricing there. Are you also seeing competitive pricing in the core business? And does that range still hold valid that as long as revenues are above $6 billion [ph] above 4%. Can you just give us your thoughts on that?\nPhil Gallagher: Yes. Let me touch on the first part with Farnell, and I’ll let Ken touch on the $6 billion or 4% EC. The difference there in Farnell versus what we’re seeing in the core – and we’ve talked about this over the last several years. The catalog guys, in general, get an unnatural lift in tight times or extended lead times, where they’ll get premium pricing as well as nontraditional customers kind of swooping in large volumes and they get the lift in both margin and in revenue. So when we say the unwinding and the pricing pressure there, some of those customers have gone away. And the margins have come just normalizing, particularly in semiconductor and IP&E, okay? Right now, as we look at and we talked about in the script, we’re not seeing as much of that ASP pricing pressure on the component side on EC. And we’ve said that before, we don’t believe we’re going to see the pressures or deflationary pricing. It’s always competitive, Ruplu. In commodity standard products, it’s always up and down. I’m just talking as an overall view. That’s our take. I’ll let Ken comment on the $6 billion and 4%.\nKen Jacobson: Yes. I think the guidance obviously is above $6 billion. And I think the 4% is really, if you dial it back to a couple of quarters ago, it was really an EC-focused kind of commentary. Clearly, with Farnell being down, let’s say, from 8% to 4% caused some pressure on the overall corporation margin. But I think the EC is very healthy implied in the guidance. And remember, when we get into the March and June quarters, we go into our seasonal mix shift where we get a little bit more out of the West and less from Asia. And the only other comment I would give is, I think we are seeing like in Asia, for example, we’d expect in the first half of FY 2024 – first half calendar 2024 to kind of start to think about year-over-year growth because of how early Asia started to seeing some of the softness.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, okay. I appreciate the details there. If I can sneak one more in. Once the warehouse in Europe is done, and I think this quarter, you said that inventories, you had expected it to be up because of certain – because of a specific program. So then how should we think about the cash conversion cycle and free cash flow over the next couple of quarters. Any thoughts on that? And will your CapEx be coming down year-on-year next year, because you already have – you’ll have that warehouse already factored in? Thank you.\nKen Jacobson: Yes. I think you’ll see another quarter – next quarter should be another elevated quarter of cash – of CapEx similar to this past quarter as that warehouse gets constructed. And then you start to see it taper off in the first half of 2024, I guess, similar to what I would say at historical levels. From a free cash flow standpoint, as Phil said, going to be challenging on the inventory side to really work it down over the next couple of quarters. So we’d expect cash flow from our earnings and some collection of receivables from the sales decline. So we’d expect cash flow over the next couple of quarters – trailing 12-month cash flow, I think I mentioned was about $110 million usage. So, I think there’s another bad quarter falling off of cash flow usage from a year ago. So that’s how I think we should think about it.\nRuplu Bhattacharya: Okay, thank you for all the details. Appreciate it.\nPhil Gallagher: Thanks, Ruplu. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Quatrochi with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. \nJoe Quatrochi: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to kind of understand talking about maybe a cycle correction kind of last until mid-2024. And in the context of kind of maintaining revenue above $6 billion, and that’s kind of the low end of your guide for the December quarter. Are we to take that as you’re kind of viewing things bouncing along the bottom here? Or should we think about the potential of further correction as we get into the first half of next year?\nPhil Gallagher: Yes. Thanks, Joe. Good question. I think it’s going to be more bouncing along the bottom. I mean – and Ken, I think it’s just what I just shared, I think with Melissa, maybe with Ruplu, the mixed signals in the market. Again, we are still seeing – as of today, we’re still seeing transportation overall pretty positive. The industrial segment had a few bumps in it. But again, part of the – industrial is so broad. Parts of that customer base is still really good and other parts, a little bit softer. And defense/aero, unfortunately, what’s going on in the world is going to continue to be a pretty strong market for us, and that’s sizable for us in the Americas. So – and sooner or later, I guess the wildcard is China and Asia Pac, right? I mean – so what happens there is that pops back sooner than people think. That could have a greater lift. So right now, we’re just rolling up what we see. We do a rolling forecast with our teams, and what we’re sharing is what we’re getting from them. And looking at the backlog in a 0 to 30, 31 to 90, 91 to 180 day and look at it daily and see what is our backlog today versus a year ago, and it’s telling us that’s about where we’re going to be. And again, you’re going to have the mix shifts, too, Joe. As Ken pointed out, Asia is going to be stronger this quarter. It typically comes back down in the March quarter. So we have a stronger mix in the West. So...\nJoe Quatrochi: Got it. And then maybe – yes, sure. I appreciate that. Maybe just a question on the Farnell side in terms of the cost actions you’re taking. I think in the past, you had chose to leave the lead facility open or online just given the demand you’re seeing. Is that part of the cost actions of closing that? And then can you revise it is [ph]? Can you remind us of the cost savings related to that?\nKen Jacobson: Yes. No, what we’re talking about is separate from that. What you’re referring to, Joe, would have been bringing up a new warehouse in leads and shutting down the old warehouse. And a lot of that’s behind us, although I’d say some of the – now with that warehouse online, there’s more optimization on the broader warehouse footprint. So it’s maybe more adjacent warehouses, not primary warehouses that provide some of the cost savings. So, I think it was a subcomponent of some of those numbers we talked about before.\nJoe Quatrochi: Okay, thank you. \nPhil Gallagher: Thanks, Joe. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. \nMatt Sheerin: Yes. Thank you, and hello everyone. Phil, just another question regarding the inventory that you’re building and the supply chain engagements that you’re talking about for the December quarter. Is that mostly Asia business?\nKen Jacobson: I think, Matt, it depends – this is Ken. It depends on the engagement. Some of its global. A lot of its physically in Asia, but I wouldn’t characterize it as something predominantly Asia. I’d say it’s more global engagements in nature. Although a lot of the global production does happen in Asia, but some of its Americas-based, a little bit EMEA-based. But it’s – I think it’s across the board rather than something Asia-specific.\nPhil Gallagher: I fair to say it’s more Americas and Asia than Europe, okay, but it’s not primarily – it’s not [indiscernible].\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. That’s helpful. And so this is more of a fulfillment, so lower margin, but good returns. Is that how we think about that?\nKen Jacobson: Yes. And some of its maybe buffer stock, and some of it may be fast-turning. It’s kind of a mixed bag.\nPhil Gallagher: But for sure, the returns are there, though, Matt. That’s your point. They are always modeled there.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes. And then – and I think you said that inventories will remain elevated in the December quarter. Is that because you expect some of those supply engagements to carry over until March? Or are there other reasons why you wouldn’t start cutting inventory or your portfolio? I would imagine that some of your products with lead times in where you can prune where others you said there was elevated lead time. So I’m trying to figure out why you’re not – you’re talking about more significant cuts to your inventory when a lot of suppliers are basically blaming all the distributors for cutting orders, yet you don’t seem to be doing that.\nKen Jacobson: Yes. Hey Matt, I would say its net new inventory coming in specific for the supply chain engagements as they begin to ramp, and that would be offsetting anything we’re doing organically to get inventories down. So that’s kind of how we’re trying to signal it as there’s net new coming in, not, let’s say, normal course of business but specific to some supply chain engagements that’s been having a flattening effect of overall work we’re doing on inventory in the base business – in the core business.\nPhil Gallagher: Yes. It’s complex, Matt. So your questions are right on. And I guess the net-net is we’re confident with the inventory levels. We’ll start to bring them down. But right now, the inventory is fresh, it’s good inventory, it’s not aging. To Ken’s point, the newer stuff is what we’re talking about that’s stopping it from coming down.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, okay. Thank you for that. And I appreciate that the visibility behind Q2 is difficult, but you did talk about this inventory correction taking at least a couple of more quarters. And traditionally, in your March quarter, you’re sequentially up in the Western markets, in North America and in Europe. In past cycles, that hasn’t happened because of some of the issues that you’re facing now. So the question is, how should we think about how the rest of the year plays out to the best that you can tell us?\nKen Jacobson: Yes. Matt, I guess what I’d say is I think we’ll still get a mix shift to the West. Now whether it will be normal seasonality or let’s say, normal pops, I still think that’s to be determined. We still feel confident above $6 billion and we’ll get a little bit of gross margin lift from mix shifts. That’s how I’m seeing. I think a lot of what Phil’s commentary on the mid-2024 is really about inventory levels, right? The inventory is stable. We’re not going to see the inventories really come down meaningfully through that time frame because there’s still plenty of work to do there.\nPhil Gallagher: Yes, Matt, we’re not talking about the inventory levels. We’re talking about the market. We think – we track like you do all the inventory levels by EMS, us end markets, et cetera. And that’s our estimate based on current pull and demand at the inventory. The inventories burn off out there, end-customer inventory. To sum it up, we estimate that mid-2024. Could be sooner, like it could come quicker.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Thank you. And just lastly, relative to the interest expense, which was down sequentially, but still up significantly from where it was a few quarters ago. And I would think that would be one area where you can drive profitability growth as you continue to generate more cash, inventory comes down, you bring down your short-term borrowings. So how should we think about that as a potential driver of profitability over the next few quarters?\nKen Jacobson: Yes. I think, Matt, definitely, as we get back to cash flow generation, paying down debt will be a part of that, especially as sales are down, trying to keep leverage in the same ballpark we’ve had it. But then we’ll try to be more opportunistic on buybacks as well. We think there’ll be enough cash to do both, but got to get back to that generation before we can start to work down the debt and/or increase the buybacks.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay, well, sounds good. Thank you very much and best of luck to your baseball team tonight.\nPhil Gallagher: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Joseph Cardoso with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. \nJoseph Cardoso: Hey, thanks for the question guys. So first one here is just can you provide a bit more color on what you’re seeing out of Asia? Obviously, it was another quarter of softness. But just curious, it sounds like you’re expecting some improvement there. And just wanted to touch on, is that just more of a function of typical seasonality and the easier comps or if you’re actually seeing any green shoots in the region around improvement? And if so, where that is materializing, if you have any color on that?\nPhil Gallagher: Yes. Sure, Joe, I’ll go first. And – so thanks for that. Overall, we’re competing well in Asia. We think we’re picking up some share as well. But the – if you look at it Q-on-Q, just looking at the numbers for – the industrial and Asia held up pretty well. It was down year-on-year as we talked about in the script in general, because we had such a record-breaking numbers a year ago. Transportation was up both Q-on-Q and year-on-year. So there’s some signs of positiveness in Asia, and Japan has been good. Japan has been positive for us. So it’s really – there’s no one thing. We just feel that – and Ken, I were just over there and talking to the team and our leader there that feeling that it is going to start to turn a bit. Now, we’re not – it’s very important. We’re not overly exposed to any one vertical, right? And I think that’s really, really important. And we’re not overly exposed to China, right? We do our business in China, but we’re not overexposed. So it gives us maybe a little bit more of a balanced portfolio in the Asia Pac region.\nKen Jacobson: Yes. My only other comment would be our team over there is really competing well in the markets they serve. And so we’re seeing very good progress there in terms of trying to take share.\nJoseph Cardoso: Got it. That sounds great. And then – and maybe this one is a little bit more random. But just within the automotive transportation business, some folks across the supply chain have just been highlighting headwinds, either in the form of UAW strikes or increased competition in China around some of the new applications being deployed there. Just curious, and it doesn’t sound like it, but are you guys seeing any of those headwinds at all materialize in your business? Or is that largely a noise for you guys? Thanks for the question. \nPhil Gallagher: Yes. Well it’s not noise. It – there’s certainly some reality to the competitive nature of what’s going on in automotive. Again, this past quarter, we just did not see that and we still see it pretty positive. The auto strike, we really didn’t see any real effect on that, at least to date. And it sounds like they’re working to resolve some of those. But again, when you look in automotive, in total, it’s just – we’re not overexposed. It’s maybe 15%, 16% of our business is – approximately or something along those lines. So it’s not like 50% or 60%. So even if there is a slight tick down, it’s not going to have a huge effect on us. And we also look at transportation beyond just automotive. It’s got to – we put in that bucket transportation, it’s golf carts, dump trucks, trains, e-bikes, so – which is battery and a lot of that semiconductor. So we kind of broaden that vertical as well.\nKen Jacobson: Got it. Appreciate the colors guy.\nPhil Gallagher: Thanks, Joe. \nOperator: Thank you. Our last question is from William Stein with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. \nWilliam Stein: Great, thanks for taking my questions. I want to offer my congratulations and also add on to Matt’s comment. I was surprised to see the Avnet logo on the Diamondbacks. But all good stuff. I have a couple of questions. First – and I apologize if you had touched on this already. But I think you said in automotive or transportation as a strong end market. And I even think you cited industrial, at least in Asia, as a relatively stronger end market. These have been sort of the standout weakening end markets among the semi suppliers as the – as we progress through earnings season early so far, but enough to have said it that it’s been pretty significant misses actually. And I wonder if you’re not seeing the same trends, is this a matter of you think inventory in the channel that you guys – that you’re not ordering as much from the suppliers? Or is it inventory at end customers? Or any clarification on this would be really helpful.\nPhil Gallagher: Yes. Let me give a shot at that. Yes, transportation, if you look at globally, was up modestly Q-on-Q and up year-on-year as well for us. And industrial, first of all, it’s really a broad – so it maybe depends on how people define industrial. It’s our largest segment by a long shot. So it’s really a long tail. And if you look at some regions, it’s stronger than others. I think what we said in the script, we called out that it’s moderating though. We definitely see some moderation in industrial. So we did call that out, William, and that we saw it. So we saw a stronger strength in transportation than we did in industrial. And then we called out defense/aero. It was a little softer in September, but we don’t expect that that’s going to continue to be a growth market as well. We separate that out from industrial. But it depends – it just depends on the market – the submarkets within industrial because it’s so broad. And that’s why I keep talking about the mixed signals because there’s still some nice pull on demand, and there’s others that are just a little over-inventory. But I think they’ll be burning that off, like I said, through the first half calendar 2024.\nWilliam Stein: Great. And the follow-up, recently, WT Micro acquired Future. And that’s a pretty unusual, rather large combination of competitors. And I wonder if the company has any view as to whether that would increase or decrease competitive pressures. And any description of the sort of change in competitive dynamics that you anticipate from that or ones that you’ve already seen? Thank you. \nPhil Gallagher: Yes. Thanks, Will. Thanks for your comments. We don’t make comments on the competition nor certainly that merger. We want to focus on our execution and our operational focus and just continue to deal with our suppliers, who we value greatly and our customers. I think we do that, we’ll be fine. So you got – we already compete with WT in Asia, and we compete with Future in the West. So they’re going to combine together. We’ll see how that works out. But in the interim, we’re stable and balance sheet solid, and we want to continue to drive growth with our current suppliers and customers. I wish them luck.\nWilliam Stein: Thank you.\nPhil Gallagher: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Phil Gallagher, CEO, for closing comments.\nPhil Gallagher: Thank you. I want to thank you for attending today’s earnings call, and I look forward to speaking to all of you again at our fiscal second quarter earnings report in January. And as – since it was noted today, it does mark Game 5 of the World Series in Major League Baseball. On behalf of Avnet – Team Avnet, I want to say, go Diamondbacks. Okay. Have a great rest of the week. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
