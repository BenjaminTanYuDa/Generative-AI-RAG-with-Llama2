A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If anyone should require Operator assistance during today’s conference, please press star, zero from your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I’ll now turn the conference over Jack Jancin, Senior Vice President of Corporate and Business Development. Mr. Jancin, you may now begin your presentation.\nJack Jancin: Thank you Operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to Helen of Troy’s third quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call.  The agenda for the call this morning is as follows. I’ll begin with a brief discussion of forward-looking statements.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Mininberg.\nJulien Mininberg: Thank you, Jack. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. This morning, we reported results that came in slightly above our expectations. I am pleased with the recent consistency of our results and believe we are on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. For the past several quarters, our organization has made significant progress across the initiatives we announced at the beginning of fiscal ’24, as well as the comprehensive work streams we have been executing under Pegasus. This outstanding work has helped enable our results in fiscal ’24 and helps set us up for future growth. Today marks my last earnings call with you as CEO of Helen of Troy. As previously announced, after 10 years in my current role, 20 years in C-level roles and 34 years in the global consumer products industry, I will be retiring on March 1 and Noel Geoffroy will become only the third CEO since the company’s founding in 1968. Noel is an outstanding leader. In addition to her work as COO, she has been working very closely with our global leadership team and the rest of our organization to develop and implement the Elevate for Growth strategy detailed in our Investor Day last October.  As I look back on the past decade, leading the company’s transformation has been an honor. I am very proud of what we have achieved. When I became CEO in 2014, we challenged ourselves to increase sales of Helen of Troy by 50%, and we asked ourselves what it would take to double adjusted earnings per share. We far exceeded those goals not only on the business results, but also by significantly strengthening our brand portfolio through strategic acquisition and divestiture and further building our existing brands into consumer-preferred solutions that are trusted, purchased, used and adored. We also established a set of highly capable global shared services that drive efficiency and effectiveness.  Our relentless focus over the past decade has been on executing the transformation with excellence, creating and delivering countless innovations designed each to delight consumers and continuously improving our capabilities as a unified global operating company. I am most proud of the powerful culture we’ve created. It helps make the company an employer of choice. From all corners of Helen of Troy, our global associates work every single day to do together what none can do alone. We take enormous pleasure in serving millions of consumers and retailers around the world. I would like to thank our people for their enduring passion, engagement and ownership mindset. I am inspired by their never-ending devotion to drive the company, its brands and its timeless values. They are the secret sauce of Helen of Troy. Before I turn the call over to Noel, I would like to leave you with one more thought. I remain confident that the best is still to come. Noel is the right next CEO, the Elevate for Growth strategy has just the right balance of newness and continuity, and the organization is fully committed to delivering its stretching yet achievable goals.  To close, I would like to thank you, our investors and analysts. I have enjoyed getting to know so many of you throughout my tenure. I learned from you and I worked hard to use your input to make myself and our company significantly stronger and better. With that, on to Noel.\nNoel Geoffroy: Thank you, Julien, and congratulations on your distinguished career. Your leadership over the last 10 years has transformed Helen of Troy from a holding company into a focused operating company and a leader in consumer devices and consumables with an outstanding brand portfolio and a highly capable global organization. Building on its 50 year-plus heritage, you repositioned Helen of Troy to create significant value and set a foundation for a bright future. Above all, you led with genuine care and appreciation for all stakeholders, creating a powerful culture and an enduring legacy. The entire organization will miss you and we wish you all the very best in your retirement.  Now let’s turn to our third quarter business results and outlook for the remainder of the year. As Julien highlighted, our third quarter consolidated net sales and adjusted EPS were slightly better than the outlook we provided in October. We are pleased to be in a position to end the fiscal year within the ranges of our original full-year outlook for net sales, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow.  For perspective, the midpoint of our current outlook for net sales and adjusted EPS is essentially the same as what we provided at the beginning of the fiscal year, and we have maintained our outlook for free cash flow. We also expect continued expansion of our gross margin and further improvement to our debt position. Brian will elaborate further during his remarks. In addition, our Pegasus initiatives remain on track and are enabling improved efficiency and effectiveness in fiscal ’24.  Third quarter net sales declined 1.6%, an improvement versus the decline of 2% to 4% in the outlook we provided in October. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.79 or a 1.3% increase over the same period last year, and also slightly ahead of our expectations.  During the quarter, we further expanded our gross margin by over 200 basis points, controlled expenses while still investing in our strategic initiatives, and built on the strong cash flow generation we have been delivering over the past five quarters with a further $66 million of free cash flow. This is a solid outcome in what continues to be a challenging macro consumer environment, and is a testament to the initiatives we have chosen, the talent and dedication of our global associates, and the strength of our brands. Macro trends have remained broadly consistent since we spoke to you in October. Persistent inflation and reduced household savings continue to require consumers to make tough choices on all types of spending. While overall consumer confidence has recently improved and the pace of inflation has slowed somewhat, consumers remain prudent with their money and continue to prioritize spending on travel and other entertainment experiences. We saw this trend play out with holiday performance for our brand portfolio. Osprey and OXO performed well overall, Hydro Flask performed well online, and our hair tools performed below expectations. As this consumer environment has evolved, so have we. We spoke earlier this year about the ways we are expanding our product assortment to incremental channels and price points to improve our availability and relevance in this environment. I’m pleased with the progress of these efforts as we see benefits from expanded distribution, new product offerings, and organizational changes. As we prepare for fiscal 2025, our entire organization is working to advance the ambitious set of initiatives and goals that we announced as part of our Elevate for Growth strategic plan at our October investor day.  Turning now to our segments. Home and outdoor net sales grew 3.1% over the prior year period driven by strong club channel sales, new product introductions, and expanded distribution and sell through. Starting with OXO, the brand was a standout in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the Bed, Bath and Beyond bankruptcy, overall point of sale was strongly positive during the three-month period and OXO grew market share in the core kitchen utensil segment. Brick and mortar growth was primarily driven by our club programs as well as expanded distribution of OXO with several of our major retail partners in the bath, kitchen organization and gadget categories. Our product offerings also performed very well online, growing double digits over the same period last year, driven by success in the electric and infant and toddler categories. OXO also benefited from strong sales across brick and mortar and online as consumers turned their attention to holiday entertaining. Turning to Hydro Flask, as anticipated, consumer demand in the insulated beverage ware category continued to shift from bottles to tumblers. We benefited from a full quarter of our new travel tumbler, including the launch of some new on-trend colors. As mentioned previously, we progressively rolled out our tumbler line to retailers in September and October and continue to be pleased with both consumer and retailer reception. Online sales for Hydro Flask were up, driven by demand for our travel tumblers as well as some accelerated holiday load-in. We also saw increased demand for personalization through our My Hydro website.  Moving now to Osprey, the brand continues to benefit from new innovations that meet consumers’ desires to get out and travel. Strong demand and a better inventory position compared to the prior year period drove sales of Osprey travel packs, travel wheeled packs, and lifestyle packs. New innovations such as Osprey’s Sojourn travel series redesigned for fall 2023 provide luggage and travel packs for adventure-seeking travelers. The all-new AO collection of lifestyle packs have also been doing well, offering Osprey’s take on best-in-class comfort and urban sophistication. Internationally, the brand continued to perform very well with growth in key regions of Great Britain, Germany and France driven by strong travel demand, brand strength, and a robust product line-up. Stepping back, Osprey’s growth continues to exceed our expectations and acquisition assumptions.  Switching gears now to our beauty and wellness segment, net sales declined 4.9% primarily driven by lower sales of hair appliances as well as a softer start to the cough, cold and flu season versus prior year, which impacts sales of our humidification and thermometry products. While we have seen an increase in incidence since mid-November, cumulative incidence for the illness season was below year ago for the third quarter and in December. Despite recent news reports citing increased cough, cold, flu and COVID incidence, our outlook now assumes the season will be below historical averages. Ultimately, the impact on our results will depend on the severity and timing of the illness season and the resulting retailer inventory replenishment.  Looking at our beauty portfolio specifically, while our hair appliances declined versus year ago, we gained market share on our key brands in mass retailers with our expanded assortment. In addition, Drybar and Curlsmith Prestige liquids continued to grow behind strong innovation pipelines. Drybar’s Big Brew hair thickening crème saw strong performance by delivering on the highly desired consumer benefit of thicker looking hair. Curlsmith’s anti-frizz collection quickly became one of our bestsellers and a consumer favorite by addressing the number one unmet need among textured hair consumers.  In our wellness portfolio, Braun grew double digits driven by strong demand in our key international markets. This growth also translated to higher market share helped by our improved supply position to better meet the growing demand. Towards the end of the third quarter, we leaned into online marketing and ecommerce support for our Vicks brand and saw a double-digit pick-up in demand. As the brand is market leader in the U.S., Vicks humidifiers, Vapo-Steam and Vapo-Pads are well positioned to serve retailers and consumers if the illness incidence accelerates. In water filtration, Pure increased market share for both faucet-mount and pitcher systems behind increased demand in ecommerce and key brick and mortar customers. Looking at our international business, sales were better than we expected, largely due to outperformance in EMEA from Braun and Osprey. As mentioned, Braun benefited from increased supply, and Osprey enjoyed strong demand from continued growth in travel. Before I turn the call over to Brian, I want to share that our organization is energized and motivated to finish this fiscal year strong as we advance into the Elevate for Growth era. As detailed in our recent investor day, the multi-year Elevate for Growth strategic plan builds on successful themes while also introducing several new strategies that I am optimistic will help us elevate to the next level. One of those strategies is to be consumer obsessed in all that we do. As I shared in October, we are in the process of sharpening our brand equity to ensure our target consumer and brand positioning definitions are clear, distinctive and inspiring. This is the foundation that we believe will lead to elevated brand activation and pipeline.  I am pleased with the progress and engagement I am seeing across our organization in this critical work. We believe this combined with the fuel generated by Pegasus will allow us to deploy even more investment dollars into our brands, supported by more focused, data-driven investment choices. We also intend to continue to expand our distribution, making our brands more available and more visible where our shoppers are shopping. We will also continue to lean into next-level centralization of shared services so that we leverage our functional expertise in all that we do. I believe the best is yet to come for Helen of Troy in the Elevate for Growth era.  With that, I would like to hand the call over to Brian.\nBrian Grass: Thank you Noel. Happy new year everyone. I’m pleased to report third quarter results that exceeded our expectations. We achieved better than expected net sales, further strengthened gross margin, grew adjusted EPS, and generated strong cash from operations that puts us ahead of schedule at this point in the year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was largely flat despite higher marketing and annual incentive compensation expense and lower operating leverage compared to the same period last year. Our adjusted EPS of $2.79 exceeded expectations even as we overcame a charge of approximately $0.05 related to the Rite Aid bankruptcy during the quarter. Our Pegasus initiatives remain on track and we used fuel from Pegasus to make incremental growth investments during the quarter.  Consolidated net sales decreased 1.6%, which was favorable to the 4% to 2% decline we provided in our outlook in October. As a reminder, our outlook continues to include the estimated year-over-year declines from SKU rationalization and the Bed, Bath and Beyond bankruptcy of approximately 3.4% combined. Gross profit margin improved 210 basis points to 48% compared to 45.9% for the same period last year, largely in line with our expectations for the quarter. Year-over-year improvement was due to lower inbound freight costs, the favorable impact of SKU rationalization in beauty and wellness, and the more favorable customer mix within home and outdoor. These factors were partially offset by a less favorable product mix within beauty and wellness and a less a favorable sales mix overall. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 19.5% compared to 13.8% in the same period last year. GAAP operating margin includes a gain of $34.2 million from the sale of our El Paso facility that was completed during the quarter, as compared to a gain of $9.7 million from insurance recoveries included in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, operating margin declined 30 basis points to 16.3%. The decrease primarily reflects higher annual incentive compensation and marketing expense, the Rite Aid bankruptcy charge, lower operating leverage, a less favorable sales mix overall, and higher distribution expense as we fine tune our new state-of-the-art distribution facility and fully integrate it into our network in fiscal ’25. These factors were partially offset by lower inbound and outbound freight costs, lower salary and wage costs primarily due to our Pegasus role reductions, the favorable impact of SKU rationalization in beauty and wellness, and a more favorable customer mix within home and outdoor. On a segment basis, home and outdoor adjusted operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 16.9% driven by higher distribution and depreciation expense related to our new distribution facility, increased marketing expense, an increase in inventory reserve expense, and higher annual incentive compensation expense. These factors were partially offset by lower inbound and outbound freight costs, lower commodity costs, lower salary and wage costs driven by Pegasus, and a more favorable customer mix. Adjusted operating margin for beauty and wellness was in line with the prior year period at 16% despite lower operating leverage. The segment’s adjusted operating margin reflects lower inbound and outbound freight costs, reduced inventory reserve expense, the favorable impact of SKU rationalization, decreased distribution expense, and lower salary and wage costs driven by Pegasus. These factors were offset by an increase in annual incentive compensation expense, higher marketing expense, the Rite Aid bankruptcy charge, and a less favorable product mix. Net income was $75.9 million or $3.19 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS grew 1.5% to $2.79 per share primarily due to a decrease in the adjusted effective tax rate, lower diluted shares outstanding, and a decrease in interest expense partially offset by lower adjusted operating income.  As previously disclosed, during the third quarter we closed on the sale of our El Paso distribution and office facility for total proceeds of $51 million. During the third quarter, we recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $34.2 million in SG&A, of which approximately $18 million was recognized in beauty and wellness and $16.2 million in home and outdoor.  We continued to generate strong cash flow with cash from operations of $75 million in the third quarter. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $233 million, which is an improvement of $183 million year-over-year. We ended the quarter with total debt of $736 million, a sequential decrease of $109 million compared to the end of the second quarter and a $345 million decrease compared to the same period last year. Our net leverage ratio was 2.34 times compared to 2.68 times at the end of the second quarter and 3.1 times at the same time last year. Turning to our full year outlook for fiscal ’24, we are fine tuning our range for net sales and adjusted diluted EPS. We’re also raising our outlook for GAAP diluted EPS to reflect lower expected restructuring charges and narrowing the range to align with the adjusted diluted EPS expectations. We are maintaining our outlook for free cash flow, reflecting slightly lower cash from operations offset by slightly lower capital expenditures, and maintaining our ending net leverage ratio expectations. Finally, we are lowering our adjusted EBITDA outlook to reflect lower adjusted operating income and a lower depreciation add-back than originally expected. The lower adjusting operating income reflects a slightly less favorable sales mix and the impact of incremental growth investments as compared to our original expectations. Our outlook factors in our year-to-date performance as well as our view of continued pressure and uncertainty on consumer spending, a softer than expected holiday sales season, and lower illness incidence than the prior year, which was in line with pre-COVID historical averages. Finally, we believe retail inventory as a whole is at healthy levels and we continue to expect that sell-in will more closely match sell-through during the remainder of fiscal ’24. We now expected consolidated net sales between $1.975 billion and $2 billion in fiscal ’24, which continues to reflect the combined unfavorable year-over-year impacts of SKU rationalization and the bankruptcy at Bed, Bath and Beyond of approximately 3.4%, as I referred to earlier. This compares to our previous range of $1.965 billion to $2.015 billion. In terms of our net sales outlook by segment for the full fiscal year, we now expect a home and outdoor decline of 1.5% to 0.5% and a beauty and wellness decline of 7.5% to 5.9%. We now expect GAAP diluted EPS of $6.67 to $7.05 for the full year compared to our previous expectation of $6.36 to $7.03. We are narrowing our outlook range for non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS to $8.60 to $8.85 compared to our previous expectation of $8.50 to $9. Moving onto our tax outlook, we now expect a GAAP effective tax rate range of 20% to 19% for the fiscal year and are maintaining our expectations for a non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate range of 14.5% to 13.5%. We now expect capital asset expenditures of between $40 million and $45 million for fiscal ’24 compared to our previous expectation of $45 million to $50 million.  We continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million, reflecting slightly lower cash flow from operations and slightly lower capital expenditures, as just mentioned. We now expect adjusted EBITDA of $330 million to $335 million, which implies growth of 0.8% to 2.3% compared to our previous expectation of 3.2% to 6.3% growth. We are maintaining our net leverage ratio outlook of 2 times to 1.85 times by the end of fiscal ’24.  In closing, I am pleased with our results year to date, which position us to end the year within the ranges of our original full-year outlook for net sales, adjusted EPS, free cash flow, and end-of-year debt leverage. More specifically, the midpoint of our revised outlook for net sales and adjusted EPS is essentially the same as provided at the beginning of the fiscal year, and we have fully maintained our outlook for free cash flow and ending debt leverage. I’m also pleased with our sequential improvement in year-over-year sales and gross profit performance throughout the year. Our teams are doing a great job at continuing to navigate a pressured consumer environment, as well as the structural headwinds of higher annual incentive compensation, depreciation and interest expense. Year-to-date, we have improved our gross profit margin by 340 basis points, largely maintained our adjusted EBITDA margin despite structural headwinds and lower operating leverage, generated $203 million in free cash flow, improved balance sheet productivity, accelerated debt repayment, and returned capital to shareholders. We continue to expect Pegasus to provide the fuel and operational improvements that allow us to achieve the objectives we outlined at our investor day, which are: average annual growth rates of 3% to 4% for net sales, 30 to 40 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and at least 10% adjusted EPS growth. We look forward to providing our fiscal 2025 outlook on our normal timing when we report our Q4 results in April. With that, I’ll turn it back to the Operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nBob Labick: Good morning and Happy New Year to you all. \nJulien Mininberg: Hey, Bob.\nNoel Geoffroy: Hey, Bob.\nBob Labick: Hi. I wanted to start off just by saying to Julien, congratulations once again on your retirement and the last earnings call. It obviously has to be exciting, and it’s been such a pleasure to work together since you took over as CEO. We’ve learned a ton from you, and I want to congratulate you on the extreme success of Helen of Troy and the transformation you led. We know the company is in good hands with Noel and Brian and everyone else, so congratulations. We’ve enjoyed it, and we’ll miss you.\nJulien Mininberg: Thank you very much, Bob. Very kind of you, and the company is in great hands. And I very much appreciate your comments.\nBob Labick: Absolutely.  So obviously, in the last few months, you’ve already given us a ton of information with a great Analyst Day recently, and you’re already given guidance. So I was hoping for my questions, I wanted just to ask you for an update on Project Pegasus and milestones and expectations for fiscal ’25, maybe speaking a little about the regional marketing organization, new sales opportunities and wins and white space, and I think next year is going to be kind of an inflection back to growth, so maybe talk about how we’re set up in that regard, or how you’re set up in that regard. \nNoel Geoffroy: Yes, sure. Thanks Bob. So, as we mentioned in our remarks, Project Pegasus remains on track, and a couple of the areas that we touched on today and we’ve talked about in the last couple of quarters are some of the savings opportunities that came from this year, and a lot of those were due to the one work stream that was around the reorganization. And as you mentioned, one of the things that I’m most excited about in those changes are not only the efficiency but also the effectiveness that they bring.  And one of the biggest choices that we made as part of Pegasus in that regard was the North American regional market organization, where we created kind of a single selling organization across the company, where our folks calling on our various large customers would be across the entire portfolio versus just one of the segments. What that’s really allowed them to do is, one, build bigger joint business plans, more strategic relationships with those customers, but also identify some of the white space distribution opportunities, looking for those places where we might have distribution of certain of our products currently and others are not in distribution. So we can kind of sell across the portfolio, or they might identify places where the category has developed and we’re not developed, and we’ve got an opportunity to sell things in. We’ve already seen some success there.  We’ve gotten into the dollar channel with some of our water filtration products. We’ve continued -- we’ve gotten into the more mass channels with OXO that we’ve talked about, and we’ll continue to see more of that kind of growth, that’s going to be one of our key levers as we get into fiscal ’25 as some of those plan-o-grams come up. So that was a big part of sort of the efficiency that we saw in Pegasus in this year. As we go into next year, that’s really where the bulk are the majority, a bigger part of the savings come into play, and that comes from some of the cost of goods initiatives that we saw. And again, we feel very good about those initiatives, they’re on track, and that becomes the fuel that we can use to reinvest back in the business, leveraging the new portfolio classification that we laid out, invest to grow, strong hold, and optimize, so we really get a double benefit there, right? We’re able to invest the incremental fuel, but we’re also doing it in a more focused way, I guess, the opportunities that we think are most appealing, best ROI, most attractive.  Brian, I don’t know if there’s anything else you want to build on?\nBrian Grass: No, I would just say that when we give our outlook for fiscal ’25, we will do our best to give you an idea of kind of the cadence of Pegasus savings that we expect over the course of the year.\nBob Labick: Okay, great. And then just to build on that a little bit, obviously, at the Analyst Day, you mentioned targeting investment in brands, increasing from 6% to 9%, and then in a targeted way you just discussed. Has that started already, or will that be kind of implemented as the savings come in throughout next year and beyond?\nNoel Geoffroy: That’s a great question. I would say, as we commented, we already have started to lean in where we can. There are a couple of places that we leaned in recently, one was Hydro Flask travel tumbler over the holiday season, where we offered personalization, complementary personalization for consumers, that did quite well. We also leaned into an opportunity we saw with Vicks on Amazon. Vicks is a very strong market leader brand in brick and mortar, but a bit less developed online. And so we really leaned in with some online marketing, online support, and saw double-digit increases in our performance there without seeing a dip in brick and mortar performance. So those are some of the areas that, as we identify them, we’ve already started to lean into, and we will continue to do more of that as we build our fiscal ’25 plans and share that in the coming quarter.\nBob Labick: Okay, super. Congratulations, and thanks very much. I’ll jump back in queue. Thank you.\nNoel Geoffroy: Thanks, Bob.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Julien, I want to say thank you for all the help, and I wish you nothing but the best in retirement.  So I wanted to ask about the top line growth. Obviously, the return to growth continues to be delayed, but even kind of going back to the October earnings, there seemed to be a degree of confidence that we could still see a return to growth in the fourth quarter. And Noel, you touched on the environment hasn’t really changed, and I know we will get to ’25 guidance in April. But I guess, how does what you’re seeing today in terms of consumer demand or retail ordering kind of inform your view on when we could actually see a return to growth?\nBrian Grass: Yes, this is Brian. I mean, I might look at it maybe a little bit differently than you. I think if you drew a line between -- or plotted our points of sales performance over the course of the year, I think there’s a steady progression towards growth, and it kind of ends with the fourth quarter at the high end of our expectations at very slight growth for the fourth quarter. So I actually think it’s a very consistent and reliable, I would say, path towards growth, and very much in line with our expectations.  We did adjust our range on the high end down slightly and up on the bottom end of the range slightly for the fourth quarter, and I would just view that as a fine tuning and narrowing, and we explained the reasons why we did that. I mean, we had a slightly softer holiday season, and we’re projecting out at this point lower overall illness for the full cold-flu season versus an in-line level of incidence in the same period of last year. So in my mind, nothing really much has changed from the outlook that we gave in Q3, and I still feel we’re very much on track. And we are targeting growth for fiscal ’25, can’t tell you exactly what that looks like until we do all the work that we’re doing, that goes into that, but very much targeted and we feel it’s achievable over time, or we wouldn’t provide in our long-term outlook that has growth.\nPeter Grom: That’s super helpful, Brian. Maybe a quick follow-up in the cough-cold-flu commentary. Obviously it’s maybe gotten off to a slower start, but can you maybe help us understand how much of a--like, when you think about the marginal changes to guidance, how much of the weaker season is having on the outlook. I guess should illness incidence pick up, which at least it seems around me they have, could this be a source of upside versus your guidance from here? Just trying to understand the degree of visibility where we are today as it pertains to cough, cold and flu. Thanks. \nNoel Geoffroy: Yes, sure Peter. What I would say is what we look at is the data as it comes in, and both November and December were meaningfully below the prior year in terms of the illness levels. As you noted, and I noted in my prepared remarks, we feel like we’re hearing about it in the news quite a bit, and it is in the news quite a bit - there’s no doubt about that, but the reality is in really all cases, including COVID, which we’re hearing a lot about, it’s below prior year levels. Now, if that changes and things accelerate, that could be an upside to our fourth quarter, but it all depends on the severity and it depends on the timing of that, because it’s got to happen fairly quickly in order for it to make an meaningful impact to our fourth quarter, and that’s why we made the adjustment that we did in our outlook.\nPeter Grom: Got it, thanks so much. I’ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thanks. Good morning, and best of luck, Julien, with all that you have planned going forward. It’s been great working with you.\nJulien Mininberg: Thank you.\nOlivia Tong: My first question is really around visibility - you know, you mentioned in your commentary to Peter about the steady improvement through the year. We kind of look at this and think about this year’s performance versus last year, there have been obviously a couple of different fits and starts with respect to that, but maybe just boiling it down in terms of your view on visibility as you head into--as you finish up this year, head into next year. You mentioned that retail inventories are in a better place in terms of sell-in versus sell-through. Do you think the de-stocking is done?  As you think about next year and some of the innovation plan for next year and reflect on the tumbler launch, where you are with respect to that, if you could just talk a little bit about some of the building blocks there, that would be helpful as we think about tying a bow on this year and embarking on next year. Thanks.\nNoel Geoffroy: Yes, so as we think about fiscal ’25, it’s really--it’s year one of Elevate for Growth, and so as we’re--you know, we’re in the process of pulling together those plans now. We had some pre-budget meetings in December and then we’ll continue that process later this month and February, before we kind of provide our full look for next year. But the things that are on my mind are very similar to what we discussed in the October investor day. The first is, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, kind of really clear, sharpened brand equity to set the foundation, and then this new portfolio classification strategy that we talked about, so that we can really focus our investment and our resources against those opportunities that we think have the best ROI and the best chance for driving growth, fueled by the incremental investment that we will put behind it through Project Pegasus, that will really start to kick in. As I mentioned, we kicked in a little bit of it this year, but a lot of the Project Pegasus efficiency this year offsets some of the headwinds that Brian talked about - the AIP, the interest expense, etc., so next year we really have more opportunity to invest back into the business.  Then another key lever that I mentioned to Bob earlier is the expanded distribution. We’ve seen a couple of those wins that have already come in this fiscal year, but I expect more of that kind of white space distribution closing to be a significant lever for us in fiscal ’25. Those would be some of the things that I think are going to be important drivers. Of course, we also have an innovation pipeline, as we do each and every year, where we’ll bring out some great new products as well, so all of those aspects are what bring the confidence that Brian and I have on what we shared at the investor day, kind of year one of Elevate for Growth in fiscal ’25. Anything you want to build on, Brian?\nBrian Grass: No, that’s good.\nOlivia Tong: Got it. Then I know at analyst day, you had mentioned--you made some discussion around M&A, looking at divesting, also looking at acquiring. If you could give us an update on that, and then also would you--your debt, obviously, the leverage profile has improved through the year. Would you look at buying something before selling something, or is your preference to sort of match those as much as possible?\nBrian Grass: Yes Olivia, this is Brian. I’d say there’s activity going on in both of the areas that you mentioned. Of course, activity doesn’t always mean that there is something imminent or anything like that, but I would say we’re putting effort behind both potential divestiture and potential acquisition, and the--I agree with the comments about the leverage ratio coming down. I don’t think we would need to do a divestiture at this point before we considered doing acquisitions. I think acquisition is available to us, and sometimes these processes take quite a bit of time to execute, and so we have even more time really, honestly, to de-lever before getting to the end of a transaction. The other comment I’ll make is, I think in this environment, some people might view interest rates as being a barrier to completing acquisition, and while we have to be aware of interest rates on our end, I think we look at things maybe a little bit more strategically, and I kind of actually view the environment with lower multiplies because of interest rates as more of an opportunity than a barrier. I think it gives us the opportunity to find quality assets at low valuations, and so we’re really looking to maybe try and take advantage of that and get something for good value.\nNoel Geoffroy: The only build I would make is our approach to acquisition remains consistent, right - the discipline and the criteria that we use, the Better Together is key, so as Brian said, we have gotten our debt to a place where we can be even more interested in what is out there, and we continue to look for what’s available but also things that we might be interested in, that may not be on the market, like we did with Osprey, to see if there’s something that we think is a great strategic fit.\nOlivia Tong: Got it, thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your questions.\nLinda Bolton Weiser: Yes, hello. I was wondering if you could comment on the hair appliance category. You mentioned you’re kind of gaining market share, but maybe the whole category is not so good. It seems like Dyson is doing some nice innovation in things, I guess probably at the higher end. Can you just comment on Dyson’s influence on the category and just what you think the category needs in order to get it growing a little bit better? Thanks.\nNoel Geoffroy: Yes, sure. Good to hear from you, Linda.  Here’s what I would say on hair tools. When I look at the category in total, especially over the holiday period, the part of the category that’s kind of $199 and lower of price points is not performing as well. It’s the higher end, which is as you’re calling out, where Dyson is playing, that is performing better. We play more in the $199 and below part of the category today, a few items that may be above that, but for the most part we’re at $199 and below. What we’re seeing is, and I’ve mentioned this in a couple of the earnings calls, we worked to broaden our assortment across this year in our hair tools to make sure that we have the full range, so not just the higher end of that $199 but also some of the entry price point hair dryers, curling irons, straighteners, etc., and that has made a positive impact for us in that mass class of trade, where we’re seeing share improvement now that we’ve gotten that assortment broadened again. As we mentioned in the remarks, holiday for us on hair tools in particular was softer than we anticipated, and it really kind of came down to that category of the $199 and less not performing as well in the holiday period. In terms of what it’s going to take, it’s going to take--it’s really the fundamentals. It’s really making sure that we’ve got great innovation that addresses consumers’ needs, whether it’s their pain points or whether it’s the opportunity to save them time, get a better result, etc., and the right claims and marketing to reach them when and where they’re most receptive. That’s certainly part of the activity and plan that our team has as we move forward into fiscal ’25, to continue to do that. We’ve done that very well in the past - you know, Volumizer was a ringing success for us from an innovation standpoint, so we know how to do it, we know how to understand consumers’ needs and build those opportunities, and that’s exactly what the team is focused on doing.\nLinda Bolton Weiser: Thanks.  Then I just wanted to ask - I mean, you talked quite a bit about the flu season and everything, but certainly in China, they’re going through a first post-COVID flu season, so it’s been very severe in China. I understand--you mentioned in the past, your Braun thermometers do very well online in China. Is that a source of strength right now? Are you seeing growth in that part of your portfolio?\nNoel Geoffroy: We are, Linda. You’re exactly right - we are seeing higher level of illness in China right now and our Braun business, which is quite developed outside of the U.S. in both Europe and Asia, and we are growing very nicely in the absolute based on just the trends that you’re calling out, as well as our share performance is growing in that part of the business.  An interesting phenomenon that we’re seeing over there is during COVID, there was a really big run-up in the no-touch portion of thermometers. At that point, people were really kind of looking to get whatever thermometer they could, and a lot of no-touch thermometers were sold. Since the pandemic has ended, consumers there have kind of come to the realization that they’re a lot less accurate than the ear thermometers are, and we’re seeing a lot of backlash on that as we monitor social media and we monitor ratings and reviews, etc. They’re really coming to the ear thermometer driven by the accuracy, and then you layer on top of that the strength of the Braun brand and the trust that consumers have in it, it’s really making for a winning combination. That’s a bright spot for sure in the business. \nLinda Bolton Weiser: Thanks, and then just my last question is on Hydro Flask. What is the root of why it is performing so much better online than in brick and mortar? Then finally, I just want to say farewell as well to Julien - Julien, it’s been a pleasure working with you, I’ve learned so much, and best of luck with everything.\nJulien Mininberg: Thank you Linda.\nNoel Geoffroy: On Hydro Flask, here’s what I would say. I mean, I think one of the reasons I think it performed better online than in brick and mortar is that the whole holiday trend went to online more than brick and mortar. We were looking at some syndicated studies, etc., and you really see brick and mortar traffic over the holidays down overall, and down more in December than it was in November, so I think this was a holiday season that really skewed more online than in brick and mortar in most categories and in most cases. Then as I mentioned, this was a place that we leaned into - you know, the travel tumbler did well, we continue to see that shift from bottles to tumblers, and so that was an area that we really leaned into, both with retail partners online but also on our own D2C site, we saw really significant increases in the personalization over the holiday period on Hydro Flask. I think those extra offerings really made the online side of it perform well.\nLinda Bolton Weiser: Thank you.\nNoel Geoffroy: You’re welcome.\nOperator: Our next questions are from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your questions.\nAlec Legg: Hi, good morning - Alec Legg on for Susan. First, we just wanted to share our congratulations as well to Julien on all of your successful work and your long career at Helen. Noel, we’re also very excited to see you execute the next step of Helen of Troy’s story. My question, just on the gross margins in the quarter and longer term, for this quarter, how much was driven by lower inbound freight versus the SKU rationalization, and then looking forward, how should we expect gross margins to play out between the two buckets? Thank you.\nBrian Grass: Yes, we’ve not really broken out or parsed out publicly the specific impacts from SKU-rat versus the other, some of the other factors, but there is meaningful impact year over year, starting to get less and less as we anniversary quarters of inbound freight reductions, so I would say more pronounced at the beginning of the year on that and then becoming less and less over the course of the year, so probably still meaningful but less meaningful than it had been, maybe in Q1 and Q2. SKU-rat, very meaningful impact that we expect to continue to do in smaller degrees as we go forward. This was kind of a fresh look at it as we went through Project Pegasus, so I don’t want people to expect the kind of revenue impact that we had going into this year from it, but we did that because we could get the meaningful profit impact that you’re now seeing in gross profit margins, so we felt like the juice was worth the squeeze. Hopefully going forward, the amount that--the impact that will have on revenue will be less and less, but we’ll still be able to get some of that profit drive that you saw over the course of this year. Hopefully that gives you some directional answer to your question without specifics. I would say they’re both fairly meaningful in Q3.\nAlec Legg: Got it, that’s pretty helpful. Then on the top line, so sales came in ahead of guidance. Was there anything that changed during the quarter that led to better top line sales in the quarter, and then also the narrowing of top line for the rest of the year?\nBrian Grass: I’d say nothing specific. I’d say just strong execution, taking advantage of our opportunities. We mentioned--the two bright spots I would call out, and Noel will probably elaborate, is the areas where we leaned into from a marketing spend perspective. We really have leaned into Hydro Flask and drove good online sales there with free engraving and some other activities - you know, higher marketing spend and things like that, and then on Vicks, we really leaned into the cold-flu season and really driving sales online. I’d say those are two of the larger things that kind of drove slight over-performance in the quarter versus our expectations. \nNoel Geoffroy: Yes, I called out in the prepared remarks, OXO was a real standout in the quarter if you take out the Bed, Bath and Beyond bankruptcy, really strong point-of-sale across the board, growing share in that core kitchen utensil segment, so OXO was a bright spot. Osprey continues to perform well. We continue to see the strong travel demand, better inventory position than we had a year ago, and really growth across all of the different portions of the business. Obviously there’s the tech path that is the heritage of the brand, but also nice growth in travel and duffle and lifestyle as we extend that brand across, and then I mentioned international was a bright spot, both with Braun and with Osprey. \nAlec Legg: Thank you so much.\nNoel Geoffroy: You’re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Also Julien, best of luck with your retirement.\nJulien Mininberg: Thank you Rupesh.\nRupesh Parikh: Just to follow up on the last question on gross margin, Brian, I’m not sure if you can give any updated expectations for how you’re thinking about gross margins in Q4?\nBrian Grass: I would say you could expect similar to Q3 with slight, maybe, expansion off of Q3. \nRupesh Parikh: Okay, that’s helpful. Then as we think about gross margins, you’re now in that 48%-plus range. Is that a fair base that you can build off of going forward? Is this the new steady state to think of, and then going forward, maybe there’s still opportunity for expansion from here?\nBrian Grass: Well, I think it’s a fair base to build off of, assuming there is not significant exogenous changes in commodity or freight costs. Then yes, I think we build off of it with Pegasus savings that we’re expecting in fiscal ’25, which is largely cost of goods sold focused.\nNoel Geoffroy: The only build I would have on that is you also get the brand portfolio classification benefit, so as we put more Invest to Grow sales into the mix, that’s also a help over time. Remember, now that we’ve classified them, as we put the incremental Pegasus investment, we’re going to focus it more on those brands that are in Invest to Grow, and those are the higher margin brands of the portfolio.\nBrian Grass: Yes, that’s a good point - I would say for fiscal ’24, we actually sort of under-achieved on gross profit margin versus our expectations, because we weren’t able to achieve the mix that allows us--or to the degree that we would like, that Noel was talking about, and we do see the opportunity to do that in fiscal year ’25. I would say our base wasn’t quite where we wanted it to be for this fiscal year, but we feel like we can get it to where it needs to be going forward. \nRupesh Parikh: Great, and then I guess my follow-up question, as you look at the holiday season in terms of trends, if you look at November-December, just curious at the cadence of trends as you look at some of the POS data. Then from a promotional backdrop perspective, just curious how that played out versus your expectations.\nNoel Geoffroy: Yes, so holiday performance for us, Rupesh, I would say broadly was in line with what we’re seeing in general consumer spending trends, so OXO and Osprey performed well, and that kind of matches the entertainment travel focus of where consumers are spending those discretionary dollars, more than other places.  As mentioned, Hydro Flask performed well online and the hair tools performance was a little bit softer, but those are probably the parts of our portfolio that are most holiday exposed. We’ve obviously got the big illness portion of our portfolio that we touched on during the call today, so not everything is holiday relevant, if you will. What was the last part of your question, remind me, Rupesh?\nRupesh Parikh: Just on promotional backdrop--yes, promotional backdrop?\nNoel Geoffroy: Yes, I would say we didn’t see anything hugely unusual. What I would say across holiday in general is that it started earlier, so we saw retailers starting to offer some of their better deals, not waiting all the way to Black Friday but starting to kind of lean into I a bit earlier in the season, but not dramatically different levels of activity and discount. As I look at our portfolio, not meaningfully different or deeper areas. I’ve mentioned a couple things that we did on Hydro Flask as a really competitive category - we offered the free customization, we had some of the typical offers that we would have online. We had an offer on some special items, special colors that we brought back and things like that, but in general not a dramatic difference year-on-year in what we did promotionally.\nRupesh Parikh: Great, thank you for all the color. I’ll pass it along.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we have reached the end of the question and answer session, and I’ll turn the call over to Noel for closing remarks.\nNoel Geoffroy: Great, thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today and for your continued interest in Helen of Troy. We look forward to speaking with many of you over the next two days at ICR, as well as virtually at the CJS conference on Wednesday. I hope everyone has a great day. \nOperator: This will conclude today’s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings. Welcome to Helen of Troy's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Jack Jancin, Senior Vice President of Corporate Development. Thank you. You may begin.\nJack Jancin: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Helen of Troy's second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings conference call. The agenda for the call this morning is as follows. I'll begin with a brief discussion of forward-looking statements. Mr. Julien Mininberg, the company's CEO and Ms. Noel Geoffroy, the company's COO will comment on financial performance of the quarter and current trends. Then, Mr. Brian Grass, the company's CFO will review the financials in more detail and our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Following this, we will take questions you have for us today. This conference call may contain certain forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectation with respect to future events or financial performance. Generally, the words anticipates, believes, expects, and other words similar are words identifying forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause anticipated results to differ materially from the actual results. This conference call may also include information that may be considered non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures are not an alternative to GAAP financial information and may be calculated differently than the non-GAAP financial information disclosed by other parties. The company cautions listeners not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements or non-GAAP information. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Mininberg, I would like to inform all interested parties that a copy of today's earnings release has been posted to the Investor Relations section of the company's website at www.helenoftroy.com. The earnings release contains tables that reconcile non-GAAP financial measures to their corresponding GAAP-based measures. The release can be obtained by selecting the Investor Relations tab on the company's home page and then the Press Releases tab. I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Mininberg.\nJulien Mininberg: Thank you, Jack. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Starting with our second quarter results, today we reported net sales and adjusted earnings per share that came in at the high end of our expectations. I'm pleased with the consistency of our results as we work toward returning to growth. I continue to be impressed with how well our organization is executing the ambitious set of initiatives we announced at the beginning of fiscal 2024. This includes delivering our revenue expectations on the majority of our leadership brands and strong performance in international, as well as advancing a wide range of efficiency improvement projects. During the quarter, we made further progress on gross margin improvement and cash flow generation. We significantly expanded gross margins as we realized the benefits of lower inbound freight costs and skew rationalization. We also generated positive free cash flow as we continue to diligently manage our inventory and deployed a portion of our cash to repurchase approximately $50 million of our shares. For perspective, our initiative to streamline inventory over the past several quarters has resulted in a reduction of over $200 million compared to year-ago levels. The progress on free cash flow has also been significant, delivering a $325 million improvement in the first half of this fiscal year versus the first half of fiscal 2023. Our second quarter results not only demonstrate strong execution across our entire organization, they also demonstrate resiliency as we manage through the continued challenging macro consumer environment in which consumers are continuing to shift spending away from discretionary products and more towards discretionary experiences, such as travel and entertainment. That shift in consumer spending patterns has been exacerbated by persistent inflation that forces consumers to make tough choices on all types of spending. Subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we closed on the sale of our office and 400,000 square foot distribution facility in El Paso, Texas as part of our previously announced initiative to improve the efficiency of our assets. We intend to move to a new facility in El Paso to house our US headquarters, which we expect will be a long-term rental property. With El Paso being our largest shared service hub, we expect it to continue to play an ongoing important role for the company and community. We strongly value the work and passion of our dedicated associates in El Paso and are proud of our 55 year legacy in the area. In conjunction with the sale of the El Paso facility, we are also making some organizational moves as part of our ongoing efforts to operate more efficiently. Noel and Brian will provide more detail on these actions during their remarks. Turning to our outlook, we are maintaining our full-year expectations, which include returning to net sales and adjusted earnings per share growth in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, and significant improvements to our gross margin, cash flow, and net leverage ratio. Our outlook includes our expectation of a continued slower economy and pressure on consumer spending levels and patterns, especially for some discretionary categories. During the quarter, we also made significant progress on planning for the future. This includes further progress executing Pegasus, finalizing our next strategic plan, and continuing a smooth transition to Noel as we prepare for her to become CEO in March. I am very pleased by the performance of our team on the Pegasus restructuring workstreams. Pegasus remains nicely on track as we continue executing and delivering its strategic and financial goals. The work of the Pegasus teams reiterates the strength of Helen of Troy's people and culture as we deliver the outcomes needed to help manage through the current challenging macro environment and we believe Pegasus savings will provide significant additional fuel to fund our strategic investments. During our October 17th Investor Day we will discuss our next strategic plan in detail, which will guide the company's actions during the next era. It is designed to deliver sustainable, profitable growth, create value for our shareholders, and is grounded on our timeless purpose, vision, and values. Before I turn the call over to Noel, I would like to comment on the outcome of our CFO search. Today we announced that Brian Grass, who returned to Helen of Troy as Interim CFO in April has reached an agreement with the company to remain in the CFO position on an ongoing basis. Noel made a great selection and I believe she and Brian will make a great team as the company embarks on its next chapter following my retirement. I will now turn the conversation over to Noel.\nNoel Geoffroy: Thank you, Julien, and good morning, everyone. I'm so delighted to welcome Brian back to Helen of Troy's leadership team on a more permanent basis. We conducted a national search, and I concluded Brian is the ideal choice to partner with me now and when I assume the CEO position next fiscal year. Brian and I have worked closely together since his return in April, and I greatly value his experience and perspective. He is a strategic business leader, a collaborative thought partner, and a proven public company CFO with an extraordinary record of delivering results and creating value throughout his career. We believe his results-oriented mindset and deep company experience will help us deliver for all our stakeholders as we enter our next phase as a growth-oriented company. I know Brian shares my passion, energy, and enthusiasm for the opportunities we have ahead of us at Helen of Troy. As Julien mentioned, our Pegasus initiatives remain on track and have enabled improved efficiency and effectiveness in fiscal 2024. We also expect Pegasus savings will help fuel our brands in fiscal 2025 and beyond. As you may recall, one of the seven major Pegasus work streams is all about streamlining our organization. During the second quarter, we initiated a change that aligns with the creation of the Beauty and Wellness segment. With the sale of the El Paso facility, we determined that this is the right time to geographically consolidate our U.S. Beauty business. Effective in fiscal 2025, our U.S. Beauty business, which is currently in El Paso, Texas and Irvine, California, will move to the Boston, Massachusetts area to co-locate with our Wellness business. This co-location is the next step in the company's initiative to streamline, simplify, and enable enhanced collaboration to deliver greater innovation and realize commercial and product platform synergies between Beauty and Wellness. Now turning to our second quarter business results, as Julien highlighted, our consolidated net sales and adjusted EPS were at the better end of our expectations. In recent months, we achieved market share gains in core categories in a number of our brands including OXO, Osprey, PUR, and Vicks, as well as Braun and Revlon internationally where we have visibility. Taking a look at the performance of home and outdoor, net sales were essentially flat to the prior year period. Starting with OXO, we are seeing signs that overall U.S. point of sale is beginning to stabilize in key home categories. While the kitchen utensils category continue to decline compared to the pandemic peak, the rate of decline has slowed. OXO showed strength in the quarter as the brand benefited from new distribution gains in part due to key customers moving to capture market share from Bed, Bath & Beyond after the retailers bankruptcy. OXO also benefited from new product introductions such as the Grilling Prep and Carry System. Our test of OXO Soft Works at Walmart is also continuing to perform ahead of expectations. Overall, we expect OXO to perform well in the balance of the fiscal year fueled by new product introductions, distribution gains, and select club programs. Consumers continue to turn to OXO as a trusted source of quality products that marries innovation with purpose. One example is in cooking, where the brand helps to bring consumers' joy of cooking to life, from the everyday cooks to the gourmet chefs. Feeding consumers' passion for cooking is our [Chefs in Residence] (ph) program, a collaborative series featuring inspiring creators with one common goal, bring a better experience to your kitchen. We were thrilled to introduce the latest additions to this exceptional culinary series a few weeks ago. These new chefs are baked by Melissa's owner, Melissa Ben-Ishay, and the celebrated James Beard award-winning chef Joseph Johnson, also known as Chef J.J. Turning to Hydro Flask. The broader insulated beverage category continued to be skewed toward tumblers with a further decline in the insulated bottle subcategory. As we noted on our July call, we soft launched our new travel tumbler on June 21st exclusively on hydroflask.com to a strong reception. The launch drove traffic to the website, and we benefited from a halo effect in our base business, including an increase in personalized orders. We expanded online distribution of our travel tumbler in late August, and I'm pleased to say, it continues to resonate well with consumers. The product was ranked number one new release in water bottles and number one new release in sport and outdoor on Amazon. We began further rollout to retailers and started to show up on shelf in September with continued ramp up in October. We also recently launched our new insulated sport bottle with an ergonomic shape that fits well in your hand at the gym as it does in the bottle cage of your bike. We believe that Hydro Flask travel tumbler, sport bottle, and other innovations position us well for the upcoming holiday season. Moving now to Osprey. The brand achieved strong growth in the quarter compared to the prior year period, fueled by accelerated travel demand and our improved inventory position compared to fiscal 2023 when COVID related factory closures curtailed supply. Osprey was a standout in the quarter as greater supply coupled with new product introductions and engaging marketing contributed to strength in the U.S. technical, travel and lifestyle categories, a strong endorsement of the brand's relevance to consumers. Internationally, the brand is also performing very well with growth in key regions of Great Britain and Germany. As a reminder, approximately half of Osprey sales are outside the U.S. At the recent Outdoor Magazine industry event in Germany, consumers awarded Osprey second place in the backpack category for the third year in a row. High praise in an important market with demanding consumers. We continue to expect growth from Osprey in the back half of the fiscal year in both the backpack core and in the on-trend travel pack adjacency. Switching gears now to our Beauty and Wellness segment, net sales declined 10.4% driven primarily by skew rationalization and softness in humidification, heaters, and fans, but we're in line with our expectations. In our beauty portfolio, Revlon and Hot Tools appliances drove sales ahead of our expectations in the quarter. We are seeing Revlon trends improve as the brand achieved incremental distribution within major brick-and-mortar retailers. In Prestige Liquids, our newest brand CurlSmith continued to grow strongly versus prior year, and our new Hot Tools Liquid line is meeting expectations at ULTA with two additional skews and continued in-store support coming in the balance of the year. The beauty portfolio continues to distinguish itself in delivering superior consumer benefits, earning important industry recognition. In September alone, both Drybar Crown Tonic and Revlon One-Step Volumizer were recognized in Allure's Best of Beauty Awards, while Drybar, Smooth Shot Hot Styling Brush was selected by People Magazine as the best tool for delivering salon-like results. This adds to the four separate industry awards our brands have already received this year. In our wellness portfolio, water purification was a standout in the quarter, driven by both category growth, as well as sequential market share improvement for PUR faucet mount systems and pitcher systems. PUR also launched an exclusive pitcher and faucet mount collaboration with Beautiful by Drew Barrymore, available only at Walmart. In addition, our North American RMO team secured new placement of one of our PUR pitchers in Family Dollar. This is a promising opportunity in one of the fastest growing and relevant channels in this inflationary environment. As it relates to the International Trade Commission action [BRITA] filed against our PUR products, we are extremely pleased with the recent decision terminating the investigation in favor of PUR. The commission found there was no violation by our company because the BRITA patent at issue is invalid. We look forward to continuing to serve for American consumers' need for lead contaminant-reducing filters. Air purification was also a strong contributor to sales in the quarter. As we mentioned on our July call, the Canadian wildfires that impacted the US drove incremental air purification device and filter sales, as well as inventory improvements. The humidification category was soft in the quarter compared to the prior year period when consumers experienced the summer of 2022 COVID surge of Omicron and its variants. Despite the softer category sales Vicks grew share in the quarter. In thermometry, we continue to see post-COVID normalization in the US category, while international sales remain strong. We remain the branded market leader in the US with our Braun and Vicks thermometers, and Braun remains the strong branded market leader in ear thermometers in most of the countries where it is sold. More broadly on international, sales growth was driven by Braun and Osprey as both brands did very well in both the UK and Germany. Revlon is also having success in major European markets. We continue to strengthen our international operations and our new integrated and optimized sales and marketing organizational design and structure was implemented as of September 1st. International remains a strong growth avenue for us, and we are excited about the opportunities we see ahead of us outside the US. I'd like to close my prepared comments today with a few thoughts on the company's next strategic plan, which we will be discussing at our Investor Day planed for October 17th at the NASDAQ market site in New York. During our Investor Day, we'll also be outlining our specific long-term targets. We see considerable opportunity to deliver growth and profit improvements by focusing on delighting consumers with our outstanding family of brands and further increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of our business units, regional market organizations, and global shared services. We also see opportunity to continue setting the right capital priorities to help accelerate shareholder value creation. Our leadership team and I look forward to sharing our ambitious goals with you. We hope you can join either in person or online for the webcast. And with that, I'd like to hand the call over to Brian.\nBrian Grass: Good morning, everyone. Thank you, Noel. I appreciate the kind words, but more importantly, your trust. And I echo your sentiments on our opportunity to deliver for all stakeholders. I'm excited to come out of retirement and partner with you in my role as CFO as we enter our next era. I'm looking forward to working alongside you, Julien, and the rest of the leadership team as we look to finish fiscal 2024 strong and launch our next multi-year strategic plan. I hope to see everyone at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks where we will share more of our plan to maximize the opportunities in front of the company and create long-term shareholder value. Moving on to the second quarter. I'm pleased to report results at the better end of our expectations. We significantly improved gross margin, generated strong cash flow and deployed capital to repurchase our shares, while also taking steps to strengthen our balance sheet and further improve our asset efficiency. Consolidated net sales decreased 5.7%, compared to growth of 9.7% in the same period last year or growth of 3.4% on a two-year stack. Second quarter net sales were favorable to the 8% to 6% decline we provided in our outlook in July. As a reminder, our outlook includes expected year-over-year declines from our SKU rationalization efforts and the impact of the Bed, Bath and Beyond bankruptcy. Despite the impacts of higher inflation and interest rates, we are seeing signs that key categories are beginning to stabilize. And we were pleased to drive point of sale growth with expanded distribution, new product introductions and better supply of inventory. Gross profit margin improved 420 basis points to 46.7% compared to 42.5% in the same period last year, in line with our expectations for the quarter. Year-over-year improvement was due to lower inbound freight costs, the favorable impact of SKU rationalization, lower inventory reserve expense, a more favorable customer mix in Home & Outdoor, and the favorable comparative impact of EPA compliance costs of 130 basis points incurred in the same period last year. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 9.5% compared to 9% in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, operating margin declined 120 basis points to 12.7%. The decrease primarily reflects an increase in annual incentive compensation expense, higher marketing expense, increased distribution and depreciation expense due to the opening of our new state-of-the-art distribution facility in Tennessee, unfavorable operating leverage, and a less favorable product mix in Beauty & Wellness. These factors were partially offset by lower inbound and outbound freight costs, a decrease in inventory reserve expense, the favorable impact of SKU rationalization and a more favorable customer mix in Home & Outdoor. On a segment basis, Home & Outdoor adjusted operating margin decreased 180 basis points to 17.7%, driven by increased annual incentive compensation expense, higher distribution and depreciation expense due to the opening of the new distribution facility, and increased marketing expense. These factors were partially offset by lower inbound freight costs and a more favorable customer mix. Adjusted operating margin for Beauty & Wellness decreased 110 basis points to 7.9%, primarily due to an increase in annual incentive compensation expense, higher marketing expense, unfavorable operating leverage and a less favorable product mix. These factors were partially offset by lower inbound and outbound freight costs, reduced inventory reserve expense, decreased distribution expense and the favorable impact of SKU rationalization. Net income was $27.4 million, or $1.14 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS decreased 23.3% to $1.74 per share, primarily due to higher interest expense and lower adjusted operating income. We continued to generate strong cash flow, with cash from operations of $36.7 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date cash flow from operations was $158 million, which is an improvement of $233 million year-over-year. We ended the quarter with total debt of $845 million, which is a slight increase on a sequential basis, despite the repurchase of $50 million of our stock in the quarter. Our net leverage ratio was 2.68 times compared to 2.56 times at the end of the first quarter and 3.16 times at the same time last year. As Julien and Noel mentioned, subsequent to the end of the second quarter, we closed on the sale of our El Paso, Texas distribution and office facility for total proceeds of $51 million. Concurrently, we entered into an agreement to leaseback the office facility for a period of up to 18 months substantially rent free. We expect to recognize a gain on the sale of approximately $34 million in SG&A during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, of which approximately $18 million will be recognized in Beauty & Wellness and $16 million in Home & Outdoor. Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024, we are maintaining our full year expectations for net sales, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and ending net leverage ratio. We still anticipate a continued slower economy and uncertainty in consumer spending patterns, especially for some discretionary categories. Although we've seen a general decrease in retailer inventory, our outlook includes the expectation of cautious retail ordering patterns during the third quarter and a more normalized ordering in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect consolidated net sales between $1.965 billion and $2.015 billion in fiscal 2024, which continues to reflect the estimated unfavorable year-over-year impacts of SKU rationalization and the bankruptcy of Bed, Bath & Beyond of approximately 3.4% combined. In terms of our net sales outlook by segment, we expect a Home & Outdoor decline of 1.7% to growth of 1% and a Beauty & Wellness decline of 8% to 5.8%. As noted in our earnings release issued this morning, we have updated our expectations regarding Project Pegasus charges. We now estimate lower total pre-tax restructuring charges over the duration of the plan of approximately $60 million to $65 million, which we now expect to be completed during fiscal 2025. This compares favorably to our previous estimate of approximately $85 million to $95 million, which was initially expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2024. The reduction in estimated restructuring charges is due to a favorable revision in our assessment of the impact of a potential exit from one of our businesses, partially offset by an increase from the Beauty & Wellness geographic consolidation referred to in our earnings release issued this morning. Factoring in the reduction in expected restructuring charges, as well as the gain on the sale of the El Paso facility we expect to recognize in the third quarter, we now expect an increase in GAAP diluted EPS to $6.36 to $7.03 for the full year compared to our previous expectation of $3.81 to $4.67. We continue to expect non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $8.50 to $9.00, which reflects additional year-over-year expense from the restoration of annual incentive compensation expense to target levels, as well as higher interest and depreciation expense totaling approximately $1.77, net of tax. Moving on to our tax outlook, we now expect a GAAP effective tax rate range of 20% to 18% for the full fiscal year and a non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate range of 14.5% to 13.5%. In terms of quarterly cadence, we now expect net sales growth to be concentrated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and a decline in net sales of approximately 4% to 2% in the third quarter. We continue to expect to realize the benefits of debt deleveraging and lower inbound freight and product costs more fully in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we expect growth in adjusted diluted EPS in the range of 1.5% to 12% in the second half of fiscal 2024, with that growth highly concentrated in the fourth quarter. The company now expects adjusted diluted EPS to be roughly flat in the third quarter, reflecting the expectation of more cautious retail ordering patterns in the short-term, a timing shift in the realization of some cost of goods sold savings into the fourth quarter and an expected increase in growth investments in the third quarter. We continue to expect capital asset expenditures of between $45 million and $50 million for fiscal 2024, which includes approximately $25 million for the completion of our new distribution facility and the full installation of its state-of-the-art automation equipment. We still expect that the final cost of the facility and its equipment will be largely in line with our original expectations. With lower CapEx needs in fiscal 2024, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million and our net leverage ratio to be between 2 times to 1.85 times by the end of fiscal 2024. In closing, I'm pleased with our business performance year-to-date, which keeps us on track to achieve our full year financial objectives. I'm encouraged by our progress in advancing key initiatives, while navigating the pressured consumer environment as well as the structural headwinds of higher annual incentive compensation, depreciation and interest expense. Year-to-date, we've improved our gross profit margin by 410 basis points, maintained our adjusted EBITDA margin despite structural headwinds and unfavorable operating leverage, generated $137 million in free cash flow, accelerated debt repayment and returned capital to shareholders. We also took steps to further strengthen our balance sheet and improve our asset efficiency, culminating with the sale of the El Paso facility after the end of the quarter. We remain excited about the opportunities that Pegasus provides to drive further performance improvement and look forward to sharing our longer-term strategic initiatives and financial objectives with you during our Investor Day. And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed.\nBob Labick: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations to Brian. So glad to hear it, we're looking forward to continuing to work with you.\nBrian Grass: Thanks, Bob. Me too.\nBob Labick: That’s very exciting and congrats to all on another solid quarter. I wanted to start with one of your last comments there, Brian, about the change in the Pegasus costs, if I wrote it down quickly as a result of the impact of a potential exit from one of your businesses, could you maybe elaborate on that comment or tell me if I heard it correctly?\nBrian Grass: That's correct. So in the original estimates of the restructuring charges, there was and amount designated for our consideration of a potential exit from a business that's currently in the portfolio today. We are still considering that exit, but we have revised and updated our assessment of the opportunities for that exit and have concluded that it would not result -- our belief is, it would not result in a restructuring charge, whereas the initial assessment that was performed is that there was some likelihood that there could be a range of disposal costs and exit costs as a result. But we, again, have updated and revised that and don't feel that we have that potential today. And so we decided that we should take it out of the restructuring cost range.\nBob Labick: Got it. Thanks. Does that mean we might hear more about this? I'll drop this in a second, at the upcoming Analyst Day? Or is this -- I don't know, what's the other change there? Might we learn more soon? Or what's the timing on when you guys will decide, I guess, that -- is that...\nBrian Grass: Yes. I mean we continue to work on this project. We do not have anything to report at this point in time. I think it's more likely going to be in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 when we are able to share something with you.\nJulien Mininberg: Yes. Within a year, we'll be on the other side it one way or the other. It's good news, it lowers the restructuring charges now. It's good news on a total portfolio basis [indiscernible] report we definitely will seek more.\nBob Labick: Okay. Great. And then I just wanted to kind of go back -- my first question was going to be really on the focus on Pegasus. Obviously, you're making a lot of progress there. And on the sales front, the new regional marketing organization and I think you discussed in the press release some distribution gains already there. So maybe give us a sense of any progress, positive surprises or anything that's turning out to be a little harder than you thought as a result of the new North American RMO.\nNoel Geoffroy: Yes. Sure, Bob. This is Noel, good to hear from you this morning. I would say, as you indicated, the North American regional market organization was one of the biggest choices and changes that we made with the Pegasus restructuring. And as you called out, and I mentioned in my remarks and we'll actually speak more about this at Investor Day as we have our leader, [Ron Andesco] (ph) with us that day. But we have -- we did this so that we could look for white space distribution opportunities across the portfolio, looking at either customers where we might play with some of our brands, but not all of them, and we saw an opportunity to scale our presence with them or new customers, new distribution that we could go after with this organization kind of solely focused on that. So we have started to pick up some of those things. We have talked about increasing some of our shelf space in beauty at mass retailers. We've talked about dollar distribution, Family Dollar distribution on PUR. I mentioned that today. So we are getting some of those wins. And I think as we look at the back half of this year and in particular, quarter four, we'll continue to see some of those things layer in, which is part of what gives us confidence in what we're looking at in quarter four. Some of the results of that move. Challenges wise, I don't know probably the biggest thing is just as always, when you're moving organization and people are reporting to different leaders, et cetera, just the settling in period. But I've actually been really delighted at how the teams come together. They were just -- that leadership team was put together a week or so ago. We had a big national sales meeting a couple of months ago. So the energy and the enthusiasm of that team as a single organization has been really fantastic.\nJulien Mininberg: Yes. By design, it's continuity even though the restructures and all the ways just said, that the people and the leadership externally focusing to the teams is largely the same and on purpose by design. So not only the way people adapted, as Noel says, but what the market sees when we sell at the power of the scale and all the other method. There's a further side benefit to it that the business units are even more focused on the consumer. So that obsession becomes even more innovation and more focused as opposed to handling the sales market facing -- shopper facing part.\nBob Labick: Okay. Super. And last one, I'll probably will jump back in queue. And just -- I mean, you just mentioned innovation there. Can you give us a sense of new product introductions going forward versus how they've compared in the past? Because obviously, we're kind of, as you said, poised to resume growth very shortly, and I think that's probably a big part of it. But where do you stand on the innovation pipeline and expectations for new product introductions going forward versus how they've looked?\nNoel Geoffroy: Yes. Certainly, we continue to feel innovation is very important in all of our segments, both in new product innovation as well as what I call commercial innovation, new claims, new ways to position our brands and our products in the marketplace or new ways of reaching the consumer from a marketing standpoint. So I continue to see a lot of emphasis on that. In fact, as Julian just mentioned, that was one of the reasons we went with the organization structure we did. We've got business units now fully focused on consumers, brands, innovation so that we can take that to the next level, and that is underway. We've got some great innovation in the market now. OXO has always had some terrific innovation the Grilling Prep and Carry, the fridge organizers that have come out this year, continued coffee. Innovation has been strong. Osprey continues to go into adjacent categories like travel. We've also put out in the market. It's not quite out for sale yet, but announced launches in the bike for Osprey, which is a really interesting new vesture for that brand. Hydro Flask, of course, we launched the soft launch for the travel tumbler in the last quarter. We've now ramped up distribution there and just launched a new Hydro Flask sport bottle, that's a unique shape. And then across the Beauty wellness portfolio, many new formulas on Drybar and Curlsmith in particular, addressing a lot of consumer needs. So we continue to have really a lot of innovation across the portfolio, and I continue to anticipate more of that on both the product and the commercial side going forward. And we'll talk more about that in our Investor Day on the 17th as well.\nBob Labick: Super. Thank you so much.\nNoel Geoffroy: Yes. Thanks. Bob.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go back to your commentary on inventory destocking. I was curious if you can provide more color in terms of where you're seeing this categories across the trade? And then your confidence in being -- getting back to a more normalized inventory ordering in Q4?\nBrian Grass: So yes, and repression might be focusing on our kind of honing of the quarterly cadence and as we get basically greater visibility we are seeing cautious ordering patterns in the short term as retailers factor in things like student loan impact. And keep in mind, a lot of them are ending their fiscal years generally in December and January. Retail inventory in our view is at generally low levels, which is why we are seeing Q4 ordering patterns more in line with the first half of the year. I want to clarify that, we said more normalized in the press release. And I think what we're really trying to say is more in line with the first half of the year, but we see Q3 being slightly below that. I also kind of want to point out that the Q3 comparison is a 10.6% decline in the prior year, whereas the Q4 comparison is a 16.7% decline. So that's part of the explanation as to why we expect Q4 to be stronger against that comparison. We also have had some isolated supply pinches on certain components that are going -- we expect to hurt Q3, but we'll definitely benefit Q4 as we come out of those. And then we have secured distribution gains that we've talked about in the past those were secured in the first half of the year, but those are going to layer into the back half of the year and will be more fully weighted in the fourth quarter. We're also -- and we called it out, we made more marketing investments in Q2. We expect to make even more marketing investments in Q3, which we also called out when we tried to shape kind of the view of our guidance for our -- our EPS guidance for Q3. And we expect more drive from those marketing investments in Q4. And so, we really kind of just see this as a honing of our quarterly cadence as we get greater visibility and get halfway through the year. I hope that all makes sense.\nRupesh Parikh: No, that's helpful. So it sounds like the overall demand backdrop is fairly consistent with what you guys thought maybe last quarter for the full year. Is that a fair characterization?\nBrian Grass: I think it's fair. There's obviously puts and takes and a lot of shifting and moving around. But generally speaking, I'd say that's fair.\nNoel Geoffroy: Yes. I think generally, we see -- as we're talking means consumers are making choices on where they spend their money, and that's been the case and what we assumed as we kind of came into this year. So we don't see major changes in kind of their -- as they look at inflation, as they look at the student loan repayments, some of the things that Brian mentioned, we don't see major changes in that as we go through the back half of the year.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you. I’ll pass the line.\nOperator: Our next question is from Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed.\nSusan Anderson: Hi. Good morning and let me send my congrats to Brian, too. It's nice to have you on board. I guess maybe just as a -- as you look at the Beauty business, it sounded like hair tools are starting to rebound, particularly at mass with Revlon. I'm curious what you're seeing kind of in the prestige category, particularly Drybar and if you're seeing any rebound there? And then what you're thinking about new innovation in the category in the back half?\nNoel Geoffroy: Yes, Susan. Good to hear from you. So I would say in Prestige, what we continue to see is -- we see a lot of positive momentum in our liquids business, and I mentioned a couple of the innovations there that are doing particularly well. I would say our tool business is. We've got some innovation out there. It's not as strong right now as the liquid business. I would say the consumer is looking to make some choices on where to spend money, the liquids is where we're seeing more action. We've got a thickening spray that's doing quite well, [first] (ph) control spray, these sorts of things are the things that are performing. I see a lot more innovation on tools coming in the future as we look forward. But those liquids are what are performing best for us right now.\nSusan Anderson: Okay. Great. And then maybe just a follow-up on just kind of the cadence of the sales and inventory levels. I'm curious how comfortable you're feeling about inventory levels at retail. I think last year, obviously, we had a lot of consolidation. I guess how are you feeling going into the holiday season just in the channel in general?\nNoel Geoffroy: Just a general holiday outlook. Is that what you're asking?\nSusan Anderson: Yes. Just in terms of inventory levels out there. I mean, with the sales getting shifted into fourth quarter, I mean, do you feel like there's still kind of pockets of higher inventory. Do you guys feel comfortable with where you're at and then just also the industry in general?\nNoel Geoffroy: Yes. I would say inventory levels, as Brian mentioned, aren't at very high levels in retail right now. They're relatively low and somewhat in line with consumer consumption. We've seen in a couple of places, I would say, more in the seasonal businesses like cough, cold where retail -- a couple of retailers have done less of a quarter two load in and want to do more of a quarter three, quarter four replenishment model on some of those items like Vicks humidifiers and our consumables with Vicks. The good news is, we've got ample supply this year, more supply this year than we had in the prior year. So we're ready for that when those orders come. I think in holiday, we continue to see good interest in -- coming to your prior question, we see good interest in Drybar and Curlsmith kits. Kits always do very well during the holiday season. So the combination of tool and some of these new liquids that are doing well, those sorts of things are what we're preparing and getting strong traction on from retailers on the parts of our business that are more gift holiday in nature.\nSusan Anderson: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess just last, just on kind of the M&A environment. And as you guys get closer to that 2 time leverage target, how are you feeling about potentially being able to buy something again? And just curious if you're seeing any attractive opportunities out there?\nBrian Grass: I think that our leverage is coming down in line or maybe even slightly ahead of our expectations. So that's positive and puts us in a good position. I think as we end the year and get below 2 times, we're definitely in a position to be able to make an acquisition. But the other part of your question is, what are we seeing out there? I would say there is a flow of assets being available, but not a lot that meet our criteria. I would say the market is not strong in that regard currently in terms of quality assets that we would seriously consider that meet our criteria. I don't know Jack is here as well. Maybe you want to add something, Jack?\nJack Jancin: I think Brian's got it just right. There is more flow is starting to come in versus what it's been in the last six months. But items or assets that fit the criteria are things that we are looking for. We're not seeing those yet, but we're going to continue to look, and when we find it, we would certainly lean into one when the time is right and inventory is ready.\nJulien Mininberg: You've seen us before, Susan is dulling here and high, we're picky. So as prices come down in the market the equilibrates all that you just heard were not eager dependence on the wrong asset. We're excited to find the right one and we're quite picky on such.\nSusan Anderson: Okay. Great. Thanks so much everyone. That’s really helpful. Good luck next quarter.\nJulien Mininberg: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please proceed.\nOlivia Tong : Great. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of clarification questions first. Just on the element sell-through, I just want to understand on the Q3 versus Q4, is the decline in Q3 due to retailers expecting lower sales and they're adjusting their orders appropriately, but the [indiscernible] inventory on hand doesn't change? Or are they actually looking to hold less inventory because they don't -- it's more of a forward indicator that they think that they don't need as much inventory to drive the sales?\nBrian Grass: Yes. And I think it could be a combination of the two. I think they're definitely forming an expectation of what they're expecting for demand and then maybe being cautious in their ordering, reflecting what they are seeing. I also see a general trend of them wanting to generally hold less inventory. And I'm not talking about huge weeks on hand adjustments, but I am -- on the margin, they would like to expose themselves to a little bit less risk as they end their fiscal year. So I would say it's a combination of those two things, but I also want to make the point that we're not talking about wild inventory adjustments and things like that, that would have occurred last year. I think it's more on the margin. But that -- those marginal adjustments do have an impact enough for us to need to adjust for revenue guidance for the third quarter. So it's not hugely meaningful, but enough to change 2 or 3 percentage points in terms of our revenue for the quarter.\nJulien Mininberg: [Multiple Speakers] guidance, which means that the back half will produce exactly what we said and including the good news that we brought out today on Q2. So I think people just even looking at the stock price early reaction may be hung up on this idea of is there pressure in the back half. And what we're saying is exactly what Brian just said, that there's a rejiggering of the cadence between Q3 and Q4 and the reaffirmation of the full year results.\nOlivia Tong : Got it. And then just sticking on the outlook. The full year outlook is still a pretty wide range considering we're past the midpoint of the year you've historically tried to narrow that a bit by this time. And you've already obviously, talked about the line of sight on Q3 versus Q4 cadence. So perhaps can you provide just maybe some goalposts on what's embedded at the low end versus the initiatives that potentially gets you to the high end of the range.\nBrian Grass: Yes. I mean I think it's a good call out. Something considered narrowing. I think you would hopefully agree that there's a lot going on in the macro environment that could have an impact. And I think weighing all of that, including very recent things. We felt like let's go ahead and maintain the range, even though it does result in a wide range, especially for Q4. I think, hopefully, you've seen from our history, at least the history, I know I've been a part of, we're always focused on the high end of our ranges, and that's where we like to steer towards and we like to have conversations around but felt like with all the uncertainty in the environment, it made sense to keep a wide range to account for every -- a lot of different variables that could change over the course of the second half of the year. But we feel very good about our forecast. We feel like we factored in a lot of potential downside impact and left a lot of room for upside on top of our forecast if we're able to hit on all our strategic initiatives. I don't know if you want to add anything there about -- I called out -- or I answered a previous question about some of the things versus Q3 and Q4 that are going to drive that and give us confidence in that I don't know if you've got follow-up questions on those items, I would call those items out. It's being the primary drivers of kind of the Q3, Q4 cadence.\nOlivia Tong : Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So I apologize if I missed this, Brian, in your remarks. But is the expectation for full year gross margin to still be around this 48%. And if so, can you maybe speak to the phasing from a gross margin perspective given the more challenged 3Q outlook? And I guess what I'm really trying to get at here is if that's still the expectation that it's more weighted to the fourth quarter, which seems to be the case given the change in the outlook in terms of phasing, like how does that inform your view on the gross margin potential for the business as you look out to fiscal 2025, particularly as Pegasus savings continue to build?\nBrian Grass: Yes. Good question. We are seeing the -- that will end the year with a slightly lower gross profit margin implied in our original guidance. And -- but that's really just from shift -- margin mix shift in revenue impacts that are going on. So nothing structural that we're concerned about and no concerns about fiscal year 2025. So structurally, we still have the ability to elevate our gross profit margin and achieve kind of what we've talked about through Pegasus and see that impact through into fiscal year 2025 and we're still realizing the freight and commodity savings in the second half of fiscal year 2024. The -- I'll call it, one percentage point decrease in our full year gross profit margin expectation is really due to shifts in margin mix within our portfolio.\nJulien Mininberg: Peter, no impact on our continued confidence that we can build it from there because of your comment about Pegasus. So as Pegasus has ramped, remember, 60% of the Pegasus savings are coming from cost of goods related work stream projects. As Noel reinforced in her comments about Pegasus is nicely on track. So with 60% of such a big number, which is Pegasus published target falling into COGS, it's -- we feel confident to say that not only will we keep the base gross margin gains that are reiterated now or can be used now for gross margin fiscal 2024 but build from there in fiscal 2025, 2026, et cetera.\nNoel Geoffroy: And still have reinvestment opportunities.\nJulien Mininberg: Yes. In fact, even more reinvestment opportunity because of the fuel from Pegasus and not to get into our Investor Day now, but there's a very positive dynamic. Imagine more dollars coming in resulting in a higher gross margin than even the gains for this fiscal year, fueled by Pegasus, which also fuels the further reinvestment, which also fuels more growth, we start being at the idea not only of a flywheel, but have a higher sustained gross margin going forward.\nBrian Grass: Peter, you asked a question about cadence. So I would say, roughly speaking, if you want a platform off of Q2, maybe 0.5 percentage point around that in Q3 and then 1.5%, maybe a little bit higher in Q4, that's kind of the cadence of the increase in gross profit for the remainder of the year.\nPeter Grom: Thanks. Just one clarification on that. So the 50 basis points versus Q2, so call it [indiscernible] is the 150 basis points relative to Q3. Or is it relative to the Q2 number, just so I’m clear.\nBrian Grass: So the 50 basis points is relative to Q2. So like you said, low 47and then say1.5 points on top of that for Q4.\nPeter Grom: Okay. Yes. I was just making sure it was the 47, we're building the point half off of the low 47, not off of the Q2 number [Multiple Speakers] And then just a last question for me, just like more bigger picture. I mean Brian, you're pretty clear that you've embedded enough cushion in your guidance. But I would just be curious, it's been a pretty challenging environment to kind of predict what is going to happen. How would you characterize your visibility, right? I mean we're not that long ago where you were kind of expecting a return to revenue growth in 3Q and that kind of didn't play out. So I guess I would just bigger picture question. How much visibility do you think you have at this stage as you look out to 4Q and into next year?\nBrian Grass: I'd say, overall, it's good. I mean I get your point about we did make a change in Q3 that, I think, is a reflection of us staying close to our retailers and listening to what they're having to say and that's reflecting that adjustment as soon as we kind of get that visibility. And look, we can't perfectly predict retailer adjustments at the beginning of the year. So hopefully, what it shows is, us being very responsive to talking to our retailers, and some of them are very focused on student loan repayment and others aren't as focused. And so that's even another layer that we have to get in and understand because you can't make a blanket statement that all of them are adjusting to that, but some of them are. And I would say we're -- it's a reflection of us staying close to our market and reflecting that visibility as soon as we have that opportunity. And hopefully, that gives you some confidence because, like I said, at the beginning of the year, you can't have predicted that this would come up and the retailers some adjusting to it and some not adjusting to it and which ones and all of the puts and takes. So I mean based on kind of the heap of macro puts and takes and things going on right now, I think we're managing our forecast and our visibility as well as we can.\nPeter Grom: Got it. Thank you so much Brian.\nOperator: Our final question is from Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nLinda Bolton-Weiser: Yes. Hi. So I was curious about your view on putting some cash towards share repurchase versus further debt repayment. And knowing the macro environment and some of these things going on that you just talked about, it's a little surprising that you did the share repurchase already $50 million. I guess, I'm just kind of wondering, have you used all your ammunition? Or is there some ability to do more here with the stock down 9%. Maybe you could just comment on your thoughts there?\nBrian Grass: No, I don't think we've used all our ammunition, and we think that the share repurchase was a good investment. And the primary thinking is that even with the repurchase of our shares, we were still able to get to the better end of our leverage target by the end of the year of 1.85 times. And so we thought it was a great thing to do to return some capital to shareholders. We also had a reasonable view on the sale of our El Paso facility and the proceeds that, that would generate, which was also factored into the thinking and helps us be in a very strong balance sheet position to be able to do it. So I view it as a win-win. We're able to get at the very low end of our leverage target for the year, and we were able to repurchase shares. To me, those are both positive.\nJulien Mininberg: In terms of timing, I couldn't agree more. Remember, we're going to for the long game. I know a lot of people on this call are too. We like our prospects a lot. I think of the basics. Distribution is growing. Investment fuel from the Pegasus savings gives us the ability to not only expand margin, but also to invest in further drive from innovation and the other basic flywheel drivers in the company. That has the ability to expand not just profitability but revenue, which creates operating leverage, do that at a higher gross margin, do it all at a sweeter mix, so to speak, from a profit standpoint give room for acquisition and as should you see growth in the company and more acceleration of the flywheel, we believe the answer is yes. So the short term that Brian described it creates opportunity lower leverage ratio below 2 times, that he's talking about certainly means that we haven't spent our allocation for this depending with the market, the market is skittish right now, and yet that long-term proposition is fundamentally sound and exactly our expectation and plan makes you want to buy of stock, at least for us.\nLinda Bolton-Weiser: Okay. That’s it from me. Thank you.\nNoel Geoffroy: Thank, Linda.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for closing comments.\nJulien Mininberg: Yes. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We're very pleased with the quarter and to be in a position to reiterate our guidance for the full year outlook for fiscal 2024. We look forward to speaking with many of you later this week as we make our various calls and also providing detail on our longer-term strategy during our Investor Day on the 17th of this month. So with that, I'll simply say thanks very much and have a wonderful day.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."

The release can be obtained by selecting the Investor Relations tab on the company's homepage and then the Press Releases tab. I will now turn the conference call over to Mr. Mininberg.\nJulien Mininberg: Thank you, Jack. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Today, we would like to talk about our first quarter results, provide color across our business and update you on our continued strong progress on Project Pegasus as well as some other company initiatives. We will also discuss our outlook for the full fiscal year. Starting with the quarter, I am pleased to report that our results, including our sales and adjusted earnings per share were better than we expected despite continued pressure on our categories from lower consumer demand and shifting buying patterns. We're also pleased to improve our margins, make further progress on inventory reduction and deliver significantly improved cash flow. Looking at revenue, we saw outperformance from key leadership brands, including OXO, Osprey and PUR as well as from Curlsmith. Several of our leadership brands are improving share in certain categories in the United States, including technical backpacks from Osprey, kitchen utensils and storage containers from OXO, pharmacy humidifiers for Vicks, nasal aspirators for Braun and seasonal heaters for Honeywell. Our prestige hair care liquids, which features some of the highest margins in the company, grew during the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year. International also outperformed during the quarter driven by Braun. Our strategic choice to Double Down on International continues to pay off. For perspective, our consolidated first quarter revenue grew at a 6% compound annual growth rate compared to the pre-COVID base of fiscal '20. During the quarter, we also made good progress on margin, significantly improving gross profit margin and expanding our adjusted operating margin. We also delivered outstanding operating cash flow in the quarter, well ahead of expectations, driven by better-than-expected sales and significant progress on reducing working capital. I am very pleased with how well our organization is executing on the very -- various initiatives we have announced designed to significantly improve cash flow in fiscal '24. In line with our stated objective, we used our cash flow to further reduce our debt, putting us in a better position to deploy additional capital sooner. Turning to our outlook. We are maintaining our expectations for net sales and adjusted earnings per share for the full fiscal year as well as our key cash flow and balance sheet targets. We expect to deliver, including a return to adjusted earnings per share growth in the back half despite expected pressure on our categories and consumers for the remainder of the fiscal year. That consumer pressure includes inflation, interest rates that are expected to stay higher and increasing household debt, all of which are headwinds to discretionary purchases. On a positive note, we are seeing that retailer inventory rebalancing has largely normalized following the significant adjustments affecting nearly all consumer discretionary categories over the past year. Our retail partners are now increasingly matching their orders to consumer demand, where we have syndicated point of sale data, and in retailers, where we have specific point of sale data, we are seeing demand normalize in some of our categories and settle at or above pre-COVID levels. Before turning the call over to Noel and Brian, I would like to comment on Pegasus. As you may recall, Pegasus is designed to improve operating margins, cash flow and operating and organizational efficiency. I am very pleased with how well our associates around the world have embraced the Pegasus structural changes and its financial goals. On the structural side, the specific changes we announced in January are working. The new North American regional market organization is expected to take our sales and shopper capabilities to new levels. In our business segments, our brand and category teams are now even more obsessed with delighting consumers. Similarly, in shared services, our global operations teams are implementing new standardized tools and fully owning our supply chain end-to-end. On the savings side, the set of work streams we are executing under Pegasus are nicely on track. In all cases, our people are flowing to the work, they are demonstrating their adaptability, demonstrating the power of our culture and executing with excellence. We continue to believe these initiatives will improve profitability and provide significant fuel to make additional growth investments in our flywheel that are intended to drive sustainable long-term growth and value creation. I will now turn the call over to Noel, who will speak more about further progress on several business initiatives, including some that fall under the Pegasus work streams. She will also speak to our business segment performance.\nNoel Geoffroy: Thank you, Julien, and good morning, everyone. Echoing Julien's comments, I am proud of our team's focus, dedication and achievements to date from a wide range of initiatives. I'd like to highlight several of those here including Pegasus. Specific to Pegasus as expected, we are seeing significant momentum and savings in line with the previously announced target. This continues to help us offset some of the anticipated cost headwinds this fiscal year. Further, the new capabilities and our go-to-market structure, analytics, operations and finance are expected to help improve our performance and simplify how we work in fiscal '24 and beyond. As a reminder, about 25% of our Pegasus savings is scheduled for this fiscal year, with the largest portion of targeted savings scheduled for realization in fiscal '25 and the remainder in fiscal '26. We intend to use the savings to fuel our value creation flywheel, investing in brilliant marketing and even more consumer-centric innovation to delight consumers and shoppers and further enhancing the capabilities of our regional market organizations and global shared services. We also continue to look for ways to accelerate the savings, so that we can reinvest in growth more quickly. One of the key structural changes from Pegasus was the creation of our North American Regional Market Organization or NARMO. On our fourth quarter call, we highlighted the benefits of this organization including securing new distribution, implementing joint business plans with our biggest retail partners and even shopper data to better identify and act on relevant insights. We recently held our first ever NARMO sales meeting focused on educating, collaborating, sharing best practices and rallying behind our brand plans and multi-year innovation pipeline. The meeting was full of energy, pride and collaboration and I'm pleased to report that the team has identified and is securing meaningful additional growth opportunities that we expect to contribute to sales longer term. Another Pegasus initiative relates to our design to value or DTV initiative. Our DTV approach combines consumer insights to understand what they value most, competitive insights into how other companies' products meet consumer needs, and supplier insights into new technologies and the cost to manufacture. We use this process to elevate and build better. Our team is energized and has several new design to value exploratory initiative inside. These include additional platforming across several different products to standardize select componentry and raw materials as well as new design engineered to deliver better performance at a lower cost. We are making significant progress on our previously announced nearshore sourcing initiative to grow with existing and new supplier capabilities outside of China. This will help us diversify geopolitical risk, enhance our responsiveness and reduce inventory. These moves also create value as they can provide quicker (ph) transit times, greater speed to market, scale advantages and process standardization. During the first quarter, we implemented a major piece of our multi-year nearshoring strategy successfully relocating some production of Hydro Flask bottles to the Western Hemisphere. OXO Pop containers are also expected to begin nearshoring by early fall of this year. I'm also very proud to share that our new Gallaway, Tennessee distribution center completed in March was recently awarded the prestigious LEED Silver certification. In addition to its environmentally friendly design, this new facility has significant levels of new capability and automation that will enhance multiple areas of our business for years to come. We now have greater ability and capacity for inline customization and personalization for direct-to-consumer Hydro Flask orders. This enables consumers to make their bottle or tumbler fit as unique personality and needs through engraving customer color combinations and custom accessories like strap, lid and boot style. Most recently, in June, we increased our personalization options by adding 86 new designs that consumers can choose from. We are also scaling up our automatic carton packaging system. These machines create custom shipping boxes from continuous feed corrugated cardboard. Each shipping carton is perfectly sized to fit each order. This real-time format change is managed automatically and directly from a database. The equipment offers high levels of flexibility, automation and speed of processing and can create one box every few seconds. Our made to fit shipper incorporates bumpers into the packaging, protect items from damage during transit, while reducing the amount of packing material used. The packaging also offers EVM sealing and resealing for frictionless returns. We launched this better and more efficient initiative on Hydro Flask bottles and are meaningfully reducing carbon emissions and cardboard required for using less filling materials and reducing the customer transport volume queue by almost half for our bottles. This capability offers a better consumer experience, improved operational efficiency and less waste. I would like now turn to our first quarter business results. Consolidated net sales declined 6.6% and core adjusted diluted earnings per share declined 19.5% in the first quarter. As Julien highlighted, these results were better than we anticipated. Let's start with Home & Outdoor. Osprey performed very well in the quarter, driven by a number of factors including our improved inventory position compared to fiscal '23 when COVID-related factory closures curtailed supply. We also benefited from new product introductions and accelerated demand in the travel category both in the U.S. and abroad as well as strong online point of sale and replenishment. Osprey also expanded its number one share position in U.S. backpack (ph) in the most recent three-month period. The gain was driven by improved supply and product innovation, such as improved spike in hydration packs and extended its technical packs to empower people of all shapes and sizes to embrace the outdoors. We expect Osprey to continue to benefit from our better inventory position, to strengthen the travel market, our strong innovation and expanded distribution in both existing and new customers in fiscal '24. The OXO brand also outperformed the market in core categories, even as the overall home category trends continue to normalize from COVID highs and consumer spending shift toward necessities, travel and services. Sales were also impacted in the quarter by the timing of some club programs, which fell into the first quarter last year, but will fall later this fiscal year. For additional perspective, the kitchen gadgets and dry food storage categories and OXO sales remains solidly ahead of pre-pandemic levels. OXO saw strong point of sale and replenishment from key brick-and-mortar retailers and also benefited from new distribution, including sell-in for test of OXO Soft Works at Walmart. OXO's market share growth in both kitchen gadgets and dry food storage in the most recent three month period was also driven by new product innovation. One particularly successful innovation that launched in May is the OXO Grilling Prep and Carry System designed based on the consumer insight of reducing trips from the inside kitchens to the grill. The 4.9 star rated set features nesting containers to prep, marinate, transport and serve grilled meat and vegetables. It has garnered strong attention on TikTok and earned a ringing endorsement by the kitchen of highly respected third-party which called it a game changing OXO fine that is a must have for grilling season. Turning to Hydro Flask. In brick-and-mortar, the brand faced continued pressure in the quarter from overall softness in the insulated bottles category. Consumer preference continue to shift away from bottles in the U.S. where Hydro Flask is by far the leader to tumblers where the brand has a smaller presence. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, Hydro Flask executed a soft launch of the new travel tumbler on June 21 exclusively on hydroflask.com with great colors, the unique ability to customize with engraving and a flexible straw. We are excited by the strong consumer response and are optimistic about growing this new addition to the Hydro Flask family. In March, Hydro Flask introduced a first of its kind stainless steel bottle trade in and recycling program specifically designed to ensure Hydro Flask products are recycled in an easy and responsible way. The process is simple and straightforward. Consumers register the Hydro Flask bottle receive and print out a shipping label and drop it off at the nearest shipping location. No packaging required. Hydro Flask recycles the products and the consumer receives a $5 promotional code to use on a future purchase. This illustrates how the brand is participating in the circular economy and is providing a way for consumers to feel better about parting ways with their well-loved Hydro Flask. Turning now to Beauty & Wellness. In our Beauty portfolio, our hair appliance has maintained a strong position, even as the broader category continued to moderate compared to the prior year period. The Revlon Volumizer maintains above 4.5 star ratings with over 330,000 reviews on Amazon alone and multiple industry awards, including four additional awards in 2023 such as the Allure Readers' Choice Award. Appliance category softness was offset by good performance in our Prestige Liquid, which included a full quarter's contribution from Curlsmith compared to six weeks contribution in the prior year due to the acquisition timing. Both Drybar and Curlsmith performed well in the quarter and our new Hot Tools liquids available exclusively at Ulta are resonating with consumers and on track to meet our expectations. We have meaningful new beauty product introductions planned for this fiscal year, including new product line launches and line extensions, supported by commercial innovation as well as engaging promotions around major holidays. Drybar new launches include the smooth shot, paddle brush blow dryer, a new addition to our top selling Drybar detox dry shampoo range and a line of liquid products designed to offer more thickness and volume. Curlsmith also has a great lineup of new products including effortless waves, flawless finished hair spray, and a new anti-frizz-recipe line. Turning now to Wellness. Our previously announced few rationalization program disproportionately touched our Wellness portfolio. That impact was felt in the quarter on sales, but meaningfully improved the margin profile of the portfolio complemented by strong performance from high margin Vicks inhalant consumables. Looking at specific Wellness categories, we saw strong thermometry sales outside the U.S. as supply improves. This was offset by softer sales seasonal fans, air filtration, and humidification products as consumer spending shifted to other categories such as services and travel. Despite overall category declines, Helen of Troy's U.S. market shares remained strong in thermometers, inhalants and humidifiers with the number one position among branded products in all three of those categories. In water filtration, we saw some pickup in overall category growth in the first quarter and PUR made a positive growth contribution for Beauty & Wellness sales. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we saw incremental air purification device and filter sales due to the wildfire smoke that blanketed much of the U.S. northeast quadrant and parts of the Midwest in late May and throughout June. We are proud to be able to help consumers and service retailers when they need us most. As these wildfire continue, we will continue to serve the demand. Last, on the international front, we achieved sales growth driven primarily by the contribution of Braun, Osprey, Hot Tools and Curlsmith. Replenishment orders in select brick-and-mortar partners continue to normalize in line with point of sale. Braun outperformed our expectations as we were able to partially overcome continued supply constraints to help meet increased thermometer demand for the brand in EMEA and Asia. With that, I would like to hand the call over to Brian.\nBrian Grass: Thank you, Noel. Good morning, everyone. Looking forward to seeing some of you at the CJS Conference tomorrow. As Julien and Noel mentioned, first quarter results exceeded our sales and earnings expectations with year-over-year margin expansion despite unfavorable operating leverage. This outperformance, coupled with meaningful working capital improvement, drove strong cash flow and leverage reduction also ahead of our expectations at this point in the year. Consolidated net sales decreased 6.6% favorable to the 9% to 7% decline we provided in our outlook in April. This reflects the shift of approximately $5 million of sales we previously expected in the second quarter of fiscal '24 into the first quarter. As a reminder, our outlook includes expected declines from our SKU rationalization efforts and the impact of the Bed Bath & Beyond bankruptcy. We saw favorable performance from key brands in both business segments, international and the online channel. In Home & Outdoor, OXO exceeded our expectations despite the decline in club channel programs year-over-year and Osprey growth was driven by strong consumer demand for travel related products. In Beauty & Wellness, demand for Braun thermometry drove year-over-year growth, especially in international markets and high water filtration demand drove growth in PUR. Our prestige beauty brands, Drybar and Curlsmith continued to drive underlying growth and improve our mix with distribution expansion and innovative products that resonate with consumers. Gross profit margin improved 380 basis points to 45.4% compared to 41.6% in the same period last year in line with our expectations for the quarter. Year-over-year improvement was due to a more favorable product mix in Beauty & Wellness driven by Pegasus SKU rationalization and more favorable customer mix in Home & Outdoor, lower inbound freight costs and the favorable comparative impact of EPA compliance costs of 180 basis points incurred in the same period last year. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 8.6% compared to 6.7% in the same period last year. We were pleased to expand adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points to 13.9% despite unfavorable operating leverage. The primary drivers of this improvement were a more favorable product mix within Beauty & Wellness, reflecting the benefits of SKU rationalization, a more favorable customer mix within Home & Outdoor and lower inbound freight costs. These factors were partially offset by higher inventory reserve expense, increased annual incentive compensation expense and an increase in outbound freight costs. On a segment basis, Home & Outdoor adjusted operating margin decreased 30 basis points to 15.8% driven by higher distribution expense, increased marketing expense, higher inventory reserve expense and increase in outbound freight costs and unfavorable operating leverage, partially offset by a favorable customer mix and lower inbound freight costs. Adjusted operating margin for Beauty & Wellness segment increased 80 basis points, reflecting a more favorable product mix driven by our SKU rationalization efforts, lower inbound freight costs, lower distribution expense, reduced marketing expense and a decrease in legal fees. Net income was $22.6 million or $0.94 per diluted share. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS decreased 19.5% to $1.94 per diluted share, primarily due to higher interest expense and lower adjusted operating income in Home & Outdoor. Cash flow in the quarter was strong. We generated $121.1 million of operating cash flow with a sequential decline in inventory of $21.6 million among other working capital improvements. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $433.9 million on track with our objective to reduce inventory to $400 million or below by the end of fiscal '24. We generated $109.2 million of free cash flow ahead of our expectations for the quarter. We ended the quarter with total debt of $837.2 million, a sequential decline of approximately $97.3 million. Our net leverage ratio improved to 2.56 times compared to 2.81 times at the end of the fourth quarter. At the beginning of the first quarter, we swapped an additional $200 million of our outstanding variable rate debt to fixed rates, bringing the fixed rate total to $625 million or 75% of our total debt outstanding. At the end of the first quarter, our debt covenants allowed for additional borrowings of up to $343 million and the amount available for borrowings under our credit agreement was $638 million. We believe we remain on track to reduce our net leverage ratio to between 2 times and 1.85 times by the end of fiscal '24, not including any benefits from facility footprint optimization efforts that are underway. Turning to our outlook for fiscal '24. We are maintaining our full year expectations. While we are pleased to have outperformed our expectations in the first quarter, at this point in the year, we are maintaining our flexibility to use the over performance to fund incremental growth investments in our most attractive brand opportunities or as an offset to potential further consumer spending softness. We will continue to assess our algorithm for balancing investment spending and earnings growth as the year progresses. Our view on a significant or prolonged recession has not changed and that it cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore it is not included in our outlook. We are encouraged by the continued overall improvement in trade inventory on a sequential basis and believe that when consumer demand does strengthen, we are well positioned with a diversified product portfolio and sufficient inventory to serve that demand. We continue to expect consolidated sales between $1.965 billion and $2.015 billion in fiscal '24, implying a decline of 5.2% to 2.8%, which continues to reflect the estimated unfavorable year-over-year revenue impacts of our SKU rationalization efforts and the bankruptcy of Bed Bath & Beyond of approximately 3.4% combined. In terms of our net sales outlook by segment, we expect the Home & Outdoor decline of 1.7% to growth of 1% and the Beauty & Wellness decline of 8% to 5.8%. We believe we remain on track to deliver our gross margin expansion target of approximately 460 basis points at the high end of our guidance range as we drive improvement in product and customer margin mixes, disproportionately feed our highest margin businesses from an investment perspective and realize the benefit of lower commodity and inbound freight costs. We expect GAAP diluted EPS of $3.81 to $4.67, which includes the estimated balance sheet impact of the Bed Bath & Beyond bankruptcy of $0.17, an estimated restructuring charges of $2.75 to $2.43. We continue to expect non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $8.50 to $9, which implies a decline of 10.1% to 4.8%. Our adjusted diluted EPS outlook continues to include an increase in interest and depreciation expense totaling approximately $0.91 net of tax or a 9.6% growth headwind. Our outlook continues to reflect operational earnings growth despite unfavorable operating leverage. At the high end of our outlook range, adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow approximately 6.3% and margin is expected to expand by approximately 150 basis points despite incremental annual incentive compensation expense of approximately $27 million year-over-year, which represents an 8.2% growth headwind and 135 basis point margin headwind. Our outlook for operational earnings growth is driven by a better overall margin mix, lower commodity and inbound freight costs and cost savings from Pegasus, which remains on track. We expect Pegasus to be a force multiplier with benefits in fiscal '24 to include initial cost savings, organizational and go-to-market effectiveness, more efficient and effective marketing spend, and optionality to consider opportunistic incremental growth investments during the year. We continue to expect Pegasus to generate savings of approximately $20 million in fiscal '24 with additional savings expected from lower inbound freight and commodity costs. As previously discussed, the Pegasus savings will partially offset several structural headwinds in fiscal '24 including incremental depreciation expense of approximately $12 million before tax, related to our new state-of-the-art distribution facility, higher annual incentive compensation expense of approximately $27 million before tax, as we reinstate expected expense at target performance and higher interest expense of approximately $15 million before tax as we annualize the increase in interest rates in fiscal '23. This concludes our expectation of cumulative incremental rate increases of 100 basis points in fiscal '24. Moving on to our tax outlook. We now expect a GAAP effective tax rate range of 21% to 19% for the full fiscal year '24 and a non-GAAP adjusted effective tax rate range of 13.5% to 12.5%. In terms of quarterly cadence, we continue to expect the majority of our net sales growth to be concentrated in the third quarter of fiscal '24 and expect a decline of approximately 8% to 6% in the second quarter. This reflects the shift of approximately $5 million in sales from the second quarter into the first quarter that I mentioned earlier. We expect adjusted diluted EPS growth to be in -- to be concentrated in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal '24 as we benefit from lower inbound freight and commodity costs. We also expect to realize the benefits of debt deleveraging more fully in the second half of the year. Accordingly, we expect a decline in adjusted diluted EPS of 20% to 30% in the first half of fiscal '24 with near offsetting growth in the second half of the year. We continue to expect capital asset expenditures of between $45 million and $50 million for fiscal '24, which includes approximately $25 million for the completion of our new distribution facility and the full installation of the state-of-the-art automation equipment. We continue to expect that the final cost of the facility and its equipment will be within our original expectations. With lower CapEx needs in fiscal '24, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $250 million to $270 million and net leverage ratio improvement to between 2 times to 1.85 times by the end of fiscal '24. We continue to assess opportunities to further optimize our facility footprint, which we believe could unlock an additional $100 million to $125 million of cash flow that is not currently included in our outlook. In summary, we are pleased to reiterate an outlook that we believe is accretive to our current valuation with strong free cash flow, operational earnings growth and margin expansion despite a challenging consumer environment. We remain very excited about the opportunities that Pegasus provides to drive further performance improvement in fiscal '24 and beyond. Finally, we believe our strong cash flow and asset optimization efforts will allow us to continue to meaningfully reduce our debt leverage and consider capital deployment optionality going forward. And with that, I would like to turn it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking our question, also congrats on a nice quarter. So I just wanted to go back to the Hydro Flask brand. So there seems like there's positives and negatives right now for the brand. So your tumbler launch seems like it's off to good start. At the same time, we are seeing discounting in the channel for the product. So I just wanted to get a sense of just overall health of brand (ph) and your updated expectations for Hydro Flask this year.\nJulien Mininberg: Great. Good morning, Rupesh and hi, to everyone. Noel Please go ahead.\nNoel Geoffroy: Yeah. Hi, Rupesh. Good to hear your voice. Yeah. So on Hydro Flask, I would say, as I outlined in the script, we continue to see consumers shifting from bottles where Hydro Flask is by far the leader to the tumblers in the quarter. But as you outlined, we were really pleased to do an initial soft launch of our travel tumbler in June, so just past the end of the quarter, and we are really encouraged by the early sales results from that. Consumers are reporting -- they're really pleased with the functionality of what we've put out there, and we see it as a really nice momentum piece for us in the balance of this fiscal year. We also -- I mentioned a couple of other initiatives on Hydro Flask. We greatly enhanced our personalization and customization offerings, we got out there with the bottle return program. So a lot of positive news happening on Hydro Flask right now and we see that as strong building blocks to strengthen kind of the performance in the back half of the year across the brand in total and especially entering into the tumbler piece of the market that's been growing.\nBrian Grass: Just to handle the promotional question, Rupesh, I would say the promotional activity is kind of normal for us. We did a map pricing holiday during the quarter, and that's pretty much standard. And then, we do promotions really to get out of colors that we're discontinuing and get into new colors and new items. And so, I would call both of those activities, the MAP program and the kind of rotating into new products, both normal promotional activity.\nRupesh Parikh: Right. And just, Brian, related to Hydro Flask, I believe your expectation was for growth for the full year. Is that still the expectation?\nBrian Grass: Slight growth to flattish, I would say, and that's still our expectation. We're -- it's early days on the traveler. We're excited about the traveler, but we have not factored in a meaningful upside into our forecast from it. At this point, we are encouraged by it, but we're going to let it evolve. And I just want to point out, we did a soft launch online. The retailers are very excited about, but we want to let it play out a little bit before we start leaning in more.\nRupesh Parikh: Great. Thank you. I’ll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Bob Labick with CJS Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nPeter Lukas: Yes. Hi. Good morning. It's Pete Lukas for Bob. You gave us a lot of detail on Project Pegasus, obviously, seeing significant benefits to the margin profile. What has surprised you the most in terms of the rollout, either positively or negatively and what is the biggest things you've learned so far?\nJulien Mininberg: Yeah. Hi, Pete. Nice to talk to you and always a pleasure to have CJS represented as well. In terms of Project Pegasus, I think the most positive, as we've mentioned in our prepared remarks is how well the organization has embraced the full scope. This is not a standard built tightening exercise as we've talked from the very beginning back in October for Pegasus, this is a comprehensive restructuring and reinvention very similar to what we've done multiple times of always taking the company up to the next level, never waste a good crisis, as they say. So for me, the -- the single most important thing is how well the organization has embraced it, dug deep and has not only made the structural changes, but also aggressively pursuing the specific work of each work stream and their financial targets. And Noel, I suspect you'll be able to elaborate a bit on the Pegasus momentum.\nNoel Geoffroy: Yeah. I would echo Julien's comments, I think the piece on a program like this is always the question mark is, how will the organization react. And I'm delighted I mentioned in my remarks, the first ever North American RMO sales meeting that we just had to see the teams come together. The business unit is very focused on sharpening their brand plans, sharpening their innovation pipeline, the North American RMO and the audience excited about those plans coming forward with new growth opportunities and growth ideas as they look across the full portfolio was very, very heartening. And I think a testament to the choices that we made in the organizational structure. As I look at some of the other work streams, again, SKU rationalization was a big focus area and the team really took that to a great bottoms-up analytical rigor that has really helped us from a gross margin standpoint on parts of our portfolio. So that's been a real positive as they've embraced that work. We've got a lot more work streams that are still underway that will come. As a reminder, the bulk of the savings comes in fiscal '25 to fuel our initiatives in that time frame. And we're very pleased with the momentum that we see across all of the work streams.\nPeter Lukas: Very helpful. Thanks. I'll jump back in the queue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.\nDevin Weinstein: Hi. This is Devin Weinstein on for Olivia. I appreciate you taking our question and congrats on the another unexpected quarter. I wanted to ask a little bit more about your outlook for the year, specifically for 2Q, understood on the components impacting the $5 million impact on your sales outlook. But you did maintain the EPS guide for the first half to decline 20% to 30%. And I just want to understand some of the dynamics going into your 2Q outlook saying as sequentially, there should be some cost easing. It sounds like sell-in and sell-through are in a much better place. So outside of maybe the sales comp. What are some of the dynamics impacting that 2Q outlook that would get the first half to be down 20% to 30%?\nBrian Grass: Yes. So there are a couple of moving parts in the question. You're referring to sales and hopefully, that part of sales is clear really, the only change in our outlook came from this kind of $5 million shift that went into Q1. We originally expected in Q2. So hopefully, that's clear. And I would say, there's no other meaningful moving parts with respect to sales. With respect to adjusted EPS, the main driver -- so there's two components, right? We're sticking with our original guidance, which is 20% to 30% down for the full year. After posting Q1, it was a little bit better than expectations. We are expecting some spend shift, some growth investment spending that we didn't make sense to make in the first quarter that we now plan for the second quarter. And that's really why for -- the full first half of the year, we'll stay within the 20% to 30%, even though we were slightly better in the first quarter. We do expect to come down a little bit in Q2 as we spend a little bit more into the strength of good initiatives that we have going, including the tumbler rollout and new introduction.\nDevin Weinstein: That makes sense. Thank you. And if I could just tack on the second part of that question. You guys did call out some of the wildfire dynamics that impacted demand for air purifiers. Just curious what you're seeing quarter-to-date, when we've looked in the past, we've seen a good bump to your sales for some of the heightened wildfire seasons. So curious, if you're seeing that same sort of dynamic or perhaps if there's just been more air purifier purchases over the course of COVID and maybe people who want one, already have one of the household or if there's area for new customers that enter your brand?\nNoel Geoffroy: Yeah. In terms of air purification, as we've all seen in the news and experience, the Canadian wildfires have impacted us mostly in May and June. So a lot of that sort of happened after our -- the end of our first quarter. I will note, U.S. wildfires are actually below average at this point in the year. If you think about all of the snow -- heavy snowfall that was out on the West Coast this past winter, it's a slower start, well below kind of the second lowest in the last 10 years from a U.S. standpoint. So high in (ph) Canada, but lower in the U.S., you've got some offsets that are happening there. But that said, the air purifier category point of sale in the last couple of months is up. I would say air purification, the category has some relatively speaking higher retailer inventories. We've talked about in the past in pockets where there's still some higher inventory coming off of COVID, and this is one of those examples. So the good news is, retailers are working through some of that inventory. We did see point-of-sale increases for the category. We also saw some elevated point of sale in the last four weeks kind of past the end of the first quarter. We do have inventory, and we're really -- as I said in my remarks, really pleased to be able to help retailers and consumers during the time as it continues.\nDevin Weinstein: Super helpful. Thanks so much and congrats again.\nBrian Grass: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Grom with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator and good morning, everyone. So I have one maybe follow-up and then just kind of my real question, I guess, just a follow-up on 2Q. Just the outlook still implies a pretty wide range for earnings, especially considering we're pretty close to halfway through the quarter. At this point, can you maybe just help us understand the building blocks between the high end and the low end and maybe the key watch points or is it kind of fair to say that you would probably expect to be at the stronger end of that range? And then, I guess my real question is just shifting gears like, consumer demand. Obviously, a lot of concern around what that looks like as we move forward. But it seems at least based on what you just delivered this morning and then it can be faring better than you expected. So I just -- a broad-based question, but portfolio spend a lot of different categories. Can you just give us a sense of what you're seeing around the health of the consumer and broader demand? Are some categories seeing improved performance quicker than you would have anticipated or some more challenged? And just would be curious how the demand environment is evolving versus your expectations, especially considering that there are some other companies that are pointing to a more prolonged period of depressed top line growth? Thanks.\nJulien Mininberg: Hi, Peter. Julien here. Thanks for the question. Given there's two parts to it, let's split up the answer. So Brian will definitely be able to address the range on Q2, and then we'll talk the demand part just afterwards.\nBrian Grass: Yeah, Peter. The wider range is really centered around investment spending and the timing of that investment spending and there's a lot of moving parts as you called out when you were asking the question about consumer demand. So we have a lot of initiatives going and a lot of positive momentum going in the right direction on things like the traveler and those sorts of things. The timing of when that gets into the retailer and when we really want to drive demand can fluctuate between the second quarter, third quarter and so on. And so there is a range of outcomes for the second quarter that is largely based on the timing of our investment spend when it will follow exactly. And in a matter of weeks, could make a shift between Q1 and Q2, and that's really what we're dealing with here because that is such a new item, and it's actually hitting retail towards the end of the second quarter and it will hit some retail before other retail. And so hopefully, you can imagine that there's a period of time that could overlap just a matter of several weeks, which could make a difference to the quarters. And that's why there's kind of a wide range of outcomes. We can't perfectly predict when the timing will be exactly above that. And so there's a little bit of a range there for the second quarter.\nJulien Mininberg: Great. And on the demand subjects, I think the simplest thing we can say is that everyone on the call, I think, in the market broadly is aware of the choppiness in predictions pressure that's on the consumer at a macro level, so the famous inflation and higher interest rates, the higher for longer speech that the Fed is reiterated month after month. And in the case of these categories to your specific question, we're in a broad set of categories. So some of them are just feeling the pain of that discretionary reduction as buying pattern shift. Others like Outdoor, for example, are seeing the benefits of the megatrend of Outdoors. Prestige Beauty is generally doing better and then the world of COVID flu, it's -- we're off season right now. It's hard to tell and these things go up and down. In terms of what it means for us, I think the simplest thing I can say is, we just reiterated our sales guidance today and all of that was considered when we put that number forth.\nPeter Grom: Great. Thanks so much. I’ll pass it on.\nJulien Mininberg: Sure. Thank you, Peter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Susan Anderson with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\nSusan Anderson: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and very nice job on the quarter. I was curious on the inventory levels, it's nice to see them down so much. I guess, are you guys still working towards your goal to be under $400 million by the end of the year? And then just curious on the SKU rationalization and kind of where you're -- like how much of that is completed at this point and how much of it is left for the rest of the year? Thanks.\nBrian Grass: Yeah. I think we're still on track with our goal. The implied in our cash flow range of $250 million to $270 million. Obviously, to be at the 270, we'd have to be at the $400 million or maybe slightly below. If we could end up maybe a little bit higher than that, which would put us in the $250 million cash flow range for the year. So I think we're comfortably within that range. We -- like I said, we could end up at 410, 415 by the end of the year. If we do that, it would be a good reason for it. It will be because we're leaning into opportunities and we want to have the inventory to be prepared to shift to those opportunities. And then, if we don't have incremental opportunities like, that then we'd be likely closer to the $400 million. So I think we would toggle within that range by the end of the year, and we're definitely on track to do that.\nNoel Geoffroy: Yeah. And then in terms of SKU rationalization, as we mentioned, overall, the SKU rationalization initiative touch the wellness portfolio more than the others, but that's where the impact was felt the greatest and it did start to impact us in Q1, as we mentioned in the remarks and I would expect to see that kind of continue and take into our outlook for the remainder of the year as those choices kind of flow through -- flow through throughout the remainder of the year. Again, the emphasis is more on wellness than the others, although there's some impacts across the board as we looked -- we really did a comprehensive look bottoms up of the entire portfolio.\nSusan Anderson: Great. And then, if I could just add one follow-up on the hair appliances. It sounds like you mentioned that Prestige was performing better. Was that also in the appliances? Are you seeing Drybar perform better than the lower cost tools? And then, I was curious, I know you rolled out that lower cost tool at Walmart. I was curious how that's performing? And then if there's any newness also coming in hair tools as we kind of look to the back half that to maybe re-jump start that category? Thanks.\nNoel Geoffroy: Yeah. Sure. So in hair tool, yes. I would say overall, if we look kind of big picture Prestige or the higher end hair tools are performing better than the kind of mid-tier hair tools. So Drybar, et cetera., in that realm is performing stronger as you think about kind of a more affluent consumer having more discretionary spend to be able to continue to purchase in those areas. We do have a lot of new innovation coming out. The one I mentioned in the remarks on Drybar is a smooth shot paddle brush that kind of continues up in that one-step insight that has worked so well for us, that's a new one that's coming out there in addition to a range of very different Drybar Liquids. When it comes to the mass part of the business, we have gotten the new planograms in to some of our mass merchandisers that I've mentioned in some of the past quarters. And we're seeing point of sale pick up very nicely as we've gotten that new range in. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing there.\nSusan Anderson: Great. Thanks so much. Good luck for the rest of the year.\nNoel Geoffroy: Thanks, Susan.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Anthony Lebiedzinski with Sidoti & Company. Please proceed with your question.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and nice start to the fiscal year. So just a quick follow-up first as far as the SKU rationalization. I guess we were to think about this in baseball terms. Are you guys like in the early innings of that process or middle or how should we think about that?\nBrian Grass: In terms of cadence of impact, Anthony, we're in early innings because we're really just realizing a lower weighted impact in Q1. It will get a little bit heavier in terms of impact through the remainder of this year. So it just so happens it was kind of spread where the majority of the impact will fall in this fiscal year. It's a little bit lighter in Q1 and get a little bit heavier Q2 through Q4, and then we'll be through it. Now as we talked about in the past, this is something we're going to continue to do. We don't know at this stage if it will be meaningful enough that we'll continue to call it out going into fiscal year '25 based on whatever we find through the results of the process, but it will be a continuing process that we'll have in future years. But the majority of the impact from this initial SKU rationalization effort will be in fiscal year '24. It was a little lighter in Q1 and it will get a little heavier in the remaining quarters.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Got it. If I could squeeze one more question. As far as your outlook for M&A, just how should we think about that? And then, as far as acquisition multiples, have you seen any changes?\nJulien Mininberg: Yeah. So Jack will speak a little bit to acquisition multiples the spoiler alert, they're generally coming down. Obviously, interest rates are going up and valuations coming down, it's broadly known, but not specifically deal by deal, just it's a macro comment. In terms of our capital allocation, which is to me as a broader question, we're very pleased that our strategy is working, which is to reduce our inventory, improve our cash flow. You saw that in the numbers that we reported today where we've made significant progress and not just in this quarter, but now also on top of the big progress that we announced in April for Q4 of last fiscal year. As we continue towards the guidance that we reiterated today, it opens up possibilities for additional capital deployment. So per our strategy, M&A on the form of acquisition and also the potential for opportunistic buyback and we consider these things all the time. In the case of operational needs, we don't be on the big warehouse have another big (ph) in the short term, so that helps us as well. And I will give it to Jack on the subject of what's out there.\nJack Jancin: Yeah. So Anthony, we're seeing more deal flow has been picking up recently than maybe over the last six months and expect that there will be even more as the rest of the balance of this year continues. I think for us, we're going to continue to stay in touch. We're going to look at the different options that are out there. Part of when it's right for us to do it is going to be when the organization is ready, that we're still in the midst of Project Pegasus. It is going really well. And what we don't want to do is created any additional compression. We'd rather do that well, do it right. And then what our -- some of our priorities are to get that levels down. That being said, we're seeing with some of the assets that are transacting out there, we are seeing multiples coming down. As Julien had mentioned, and expect that good assets will probably cost, a higher multiple than others. But in general, we're seeing multiples going down.\nAnthony Lebiedzinski: Understood. Thank you and best of luck.\nJulien Mininberg: Great. Pleasure, Anthony.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Linda Bolton-Weiser with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question.\nJulien Mininberg: Hi, Linda.\nLinda Bolton-Weiser: Hi. Hello. Congratulations on a nice quarter. So I was wondering if on the gross margin expansion, it was really strong. And you mentioned there were some -- there was a benefit from lower EPA repackaging costs. Is there any way to quantify the rest of the expansion? Like, how much was mix, how -- what was the net of the freight or commodities? Is there any way to quantify the whole gross margin expansion in the quarter?\nBrian Grass: I mean, we gave you, I think it was 180 basis points of expansion related to the EPA, the lack of having those costs year-over-year, so that's roughly half. I think you could or a little less than that actually. I think you could split the remainder up between the margin benefits and commodity and freight costs, I think it's fair to kind of do a 50-50 split of the remainder.\nLinda Bolton-Weiser: Okay. And then I think you kind of mentioned somewhere in your commentary about the facility rationalization, those excess distribution facilities that you have now? Is there any additional movement on what might be done with those or anything to report on that front?\nBrian Grass: Yeah. I would say, they're at different stages in the process. There is one the smaller of the two that is further along. We have formal indications of interest and are working towards something that's more definitive and we're making good progress on that one. So I'd say there's one that if we can make everything aligned, there could be a closing in the third quarter. And then the other one is not as far along, but we're still moving on a very good path. And we'll report -- if we have something to report, we'll share that with you at the appropriate time, but we're making good progress on both.\nJulien Mininberg: There's a big picture comment here. We've been saying for a couple of quarters that with the opening of our new state-of-the-art big facility, the 2 million square footer in Tennessee, it creates these opportunities. So hopefully, people are not surprised that we're now optimizing. I think it's where we've used multiple quarters of the footprint. So there's multiple possibilities, as Brian was talking about. And I think it's good news, it's good for ROIC, it's good for efficiency and then, ultimately good for cost.\nLinda Bolton-Weiser: Great. And then finally, can I just ask on the Hydro Flask on the consumer shift in preference from bottles to tumblers, like, what exactly is driving that? Is that more in off this sedentary behavior in your tumbler instead of the bottle? What is driving the underlying consumer preference at this point?\nNoel Geoffroy: Yeah. My feeling Linda is the functionality of it for a range of different activities that the consumers taking on. I mean I think probably one of the biggest ones is sitting in a cup holder. So as consumers are going from activity to activity, whether that's to the office or to kids sporting events or to the gym or the grocery store. I mean you name the activities that your average consumer is kind of transporting themselves or their families around fitting into a cup holder having a handle the ease and the preference of drinking from a straw. I think it's the combination of things. Now any one of these things can be available in a bottle, but there's something about this particular travel tumbler design that kind of encapsulate all of them in one. This in the cup holder, has the handle, has the straw and it's just really resonated and fit into consumers' lives.\nLinda Bolton-Weiser: Got it. Thank you very much.\nJulien Mininberg: Pleasure, Linda. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nJulien Mininberg: Great. Thank you, operator and thank you, everyone for joining us today. We're very excited about the quarter and beginning to demonstrate the consistency that I know everyone is looking for starting with us. We look forward to speaking with many of you in the coming days and weeks. There are several forums, whether they're conferences or NDRs and we're out of our quiet period now. So we're looking forward to talking about them, start talking during those and also other conversations with many who would like them. So with that, we say thank you and have a wonderful day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
