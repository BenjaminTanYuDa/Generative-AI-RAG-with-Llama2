        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the Viasat Fiscal Year '24 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Mark Dankberg, Chairman and CEO. You may proceed, Mr. Dankberg.\nMark Dankberg: Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. So with me, I've got Guru Gowrappan, our President; Shawn Duffy, our Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Blair, our General Counsel. So first, I'll have Robert provide our safe harbor disclosure.\nRobert Blair: Thanks, Mark. As you know, this discussion will contain forward-looking statements. This is a reminder that factors could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. Copies are available from the SEC or from our website. Back to you, Mark.\nMark Dankberg: Thanks. Okay. So we encourage reading the shareholder letter that we posted on our website earlier this afternoon for more details. And we'll give an overview of the main points, and then we'll allow plenty of time for questions. I'll start with a quick overview of our results and status on our satellite fleet and then Guru will go into more depth on the quarter.  Our 3 main priorities, as described in that letter, including the Inmarsat integration, and update our outlook. Our financial results for the third quarter were good. Revenue of $1.1 billion, was up 73% year-over-year compared to revenue from Viasat continuing operations last year. Inmarsat's contribution was about $443 million, up 12% year-over-year on a standalone basis.  Combined growth was 8% year-over-year. Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $383 million, up 214% relative to adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations last year. Inmarsat's contribution was $260 million, up about 17% last year. Combined adjusted EBITDA grew about 11% year-over-year.  Awards were also very good at $1.2 billion for the third quarter, resulting in $3.7 billion in backlog, and Government Systems also has about $6.4 billion of unawarded Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity, or IDIQ, potential contract value.   from our results, we're continuing to grow and win business in our core target market segments, including selected enterprise and government mobility services.  We continue to compete with our customers that value 4 main attributes. An expansive view of connectivity that integrates not just reliable, measurable and affordable speed and bandwidth, but also includes hardware, software and service products that are tailored to optimize those customers' unique requirements. And also where we bring scale, not only in bandwidth and coverage but also in operational support and/or partnerships that add value in key verticals and in important geographic regions.  Three is where we earn trust of similar customers and partners through years and decades of performance and technology innovation; and finally, those customers recognize our history of identifying, applying and evolving both the right business models and technology for our target markets.  I'll cover a few business highlights, including applying our existing infrastructure to new seamless nonterrestrial network, industry standard services through partnerships with Skylo and Ligado, expanding our hybrid in-flight connectivity network agreement in Europe with Deutsche Telekom, scaled up government cybersecurity production and winning and expanding some key government satellite services and new technology programs.  We continue to deliver leading in-flight connectivity service quality metrics, supporting our airline customers' initiatives to increase passenger engagement and offering scalable free WiFi with high-quality performance metrics, even at the busiest airports and now preparing for increased geographic coverage on important routes, such as from the continental U.S. to Hawaii.  And next, I'll give a quick update on our satellite network, starting with progress on ViaSat-3 Flight 1. We've completed in-orbit testing and taken over operation, Flight 1 performance other than the affected antenna is nominal or better. We're configuring now for operational service and integrating, analyzing and measuring performance. Based on results to date, we're targeting commercial in-flight connectivity service in the first quarter of fiscal '25.  We've already demonstrated peak downstream data rates into consumer terminals in the 200 to 300 megabit per second range. The bandwidth allocation features of ViaSat-3, such as optimizing delivery to hotspots dynamically across the service area in real time support our product -- productivity initiatives. The Flight 1 antenna root cause investigation was completed in the third quarter. Based on its findings, we're implementing corrective actions on the F2 antenna.  The F2 satellite is otherwise complete. The antenna with corrective actions is expected to be completed, thoroughly tested and delivered this calendar year, and F2 is expected to be launched in the first half of calendar '25.  The ViaSat-3 F3 remains unaffected, and we expect it to launch late this calendar year. We also have GX-10a and b, which are hosted payloads on polar satellites, and they completed their thermal vacuum testing and are expected to launch together mid-calendar year 2024 this year. They will improve coverage and performance for polar government and commercial routes.  By next summer of calendar '25, we expect to have those 4 new satellites in our constellation to scale mobility services. Additionally, the GX-7, 8 and 9 satellites are being built by Airbus and are expected to be completed beginning early calendar '26 for additional geographic coverage and peak demand depth. Those highly flexible satellites will further improve our ability to optimize capacity and deliver high-quality, reliable services to our mobility customers. So with that, I'll hand it over to Guru to cover our third quarter results in more depth.\nKumara Gowrappan: Great. Thanks, Mark. I'll cover 3 key topics: Q3 financial performance, integration and transformation and an update on our combined outlook. We are executing on our strategy and delivered strong core financial and operational performance during Q3. Core revenue and adjusted EBITDA, both grew year-over-year by 8% and 11%, respectively, driven by our mobility and government businesses.  Some of the key highlights from the quarter include: Government Systems had another quarter of strong demand for our information assurance, high-speed network encryption products and tactical SATCOM products, which drove product revenue up 55% year-over-year. During the quarter, we supported the U.S. Air Force in a major exercise called Mobility Guardian 2023. Viasat provided interoperable communications through next-generation hardware and software products and systems to ensure robust and resilient connectivity.  Our government business also had a fantastic quarter of awards, which were up more than 50% sequentially. While we can see lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in the business, the backlog is over $3.7 billion, adding confidence to our outlook. Recent trends in Satellite Services continued with strong growth in commercial IFC, ending the quarter with 3,500 aircraft in service, up over 17% year-over-year on a combined basis with over 1,400 aircraft in backlog. U.S. fixed broadband revenue declined as fewer residential subscribers were partially offset by higher ARPU.  We continue to reallocate bandwidth to support our rapid IFC growth. Subsequent to quarter end, we expanded our relationship with Lufthansa Group, adding over 150 aircraft on our hybrid EAN network alongside their existing Ka satellite fleet. It's a great example of the integrated network solutions enabled by adding Inmarsat and the teams are working together really well.  We also began launching in partnership with Skylo Technologies and Ligado, the world's first global direct-to-device network-enabling mobile network operators devicemakers and chipset manufacturers to take 3GPP Release-17 compliant products to market for the first time with nonterrestrial network satellite service within our global L-band network coverage.  And finally, on the list of highlights, our new business momentum is robust. We are winning in the large and growing mobility and government markets. Our government business has very unique solutions that enable critical operations for the U.S. government and others. It is bolstered by IP that uniquely address these complex ecosystems that are evolving fast and where security and resiliency are at the forefront.  Some key indicators are government product growth at 55% year-over-year, IFC installations 17% year-over-year, total awards at $1.2 billion, backlog of $3.7 billion and unawarded IDIQ value of $6.4 billion.  Now some more color on the financials. Third quarter 2024 revenue was $1.1 billion. This was up 73% compared to revenue from continuing operations of $651 million in Q3 FY 2023, including Inmarsat in both years, Q3 2024 revenue was up 8% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in Government Systems products and IFC service.  Net loss totaled $124 million for Q3, up from $47 million net loss in the year-ago period, primarily due to increased interest expense associated with the Inmarsat acquisition and the nonrecurring Inmarsat acquisition-related charges. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $383 million, an increase of 214% year-over-year from continuing operations, including Inmarsat in both years, Q3 FY 2024, adjusted EBITDA was up 11% year-over-year as good cost management leveraged our top line growth.  Sequentially, net leverage increased 0.1x to approximately 3.8x estimated combined LTM adjusted EBITDA as of Q3 FY 2024, substantially favorable to plan at the time the Inmarsat acquisition was announced. We have significant financial flexibility with approximately $3 billion of liquidity, including $1.7 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on our balance sheet at quarter end and no near-term funded maturities.  Importantly, we have a fully funded path to positive free cash flow. Finally, insurance recovery claims of $770 million are proceeding. Claims for ViaSat-3 F1 and I6 F2 were filed before calendar year-end. We expect to receive proceeds over the next few quarters.  Subsequent to quarter end, we have received more than $200 million to date, with the majority anticipated to arrive in fiscal 2025. Overall, this was another strong quarter for Viasat. As Mark mentioned earlier, I will touch on 3 priorities we discussed in our letter, mainly around integration and transformation.  First, building operational momentum and financial performance of our core business. Operational momentum is reflected in the financials I just covered. Aviation continues to be our fastest-growing area with good progress in aircraft served and passenger engagement and in the scope of services we deliver that help our customers use connectivity to benefit their unique business models. We are proud of our reputation for predictable, reliable and measurable service quality. Our new order pipeline remains robust.  Our service -- services businesses also benefit from an innovation and an innovative and differentiated portfolio of hardware and application software products.  Our second priority is leveraging the Inmarsat integration to achieve operating capital and revenue synergies to reduce costs and expand the scale and scope of our products and services. We took a big step in Q2, integrating space and ground infrastructure, operations, go-to-market, engineering and supporting teams, reducing people resources is really painful, but necessary to sustain our growth and achieve the financial metrics we expect.  We expect about $100 million annual cash savings by start-up FY 2025, better than the $80 million target when the acquisition was announced and sooner by about 2 years. We're also integrating our global networks and support to further improve service quality, scale and resilience and to achieve the capital synergies to drive positive free cash flow.  The third priority is sustaining mobility business growth while advancing the inflection to positive free cash flow. Our strategy is to measure and drive asset productivity by best matching bandwidth delivery to our target customers, geographic and peak time demand needs, especially in the world's mobility hotspots such as major airports and maritime ports. We are leveraging our extensive global operating data and applying machine learning techniques to dynamically optimize our existing satellite fleet as well as our forthcoming 7 Ka-band satellites under construction and third-party assets.  We're also using unique technologies to enhance video streaming quality and efficiency, a dominant factor driving bandwidth usage growth. Our revised capital budgets reflect the opportunity we have to scale productivity, cost savings, while simultaneously driving further measurable increases in service quality.  Now moving to the next topic on outlook. We exclude -- in terms of outlook, we exclude satellite impairment charges and the nonrecurring benefit from the litigation settlement announced last quarter from our guidance. For FY 2024, we expect revenue growth in the high single-digit percentages over FY 2023 for the combined company in a range of $4.1 billion to $4.25 billion.  For FY 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-single-digit percentages over FY 2023 for the combined company. We are now expecting adjusted EBITDA in the top half of our previous range, $1.275 billion to $1.3 billion with continued growth in FY 2025 in both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. Capital expenditures are expected at approximately $1.7 billion in the current -- our current satellites under construction.  In Q3, our investments in our satellite network projects and success-based CapEx, which both drive growth, where over 2/3 of our total capital spend as compared to less than 1/3 associated with other maintenance and general CapEx activities. In FY 2025, we expect CapEx to decline to a range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion, inclusive of a placeholder for the potential funding of an I6 F2 replacement. Capital expenditure guidance does not include the expected $770 million benefit from insurance recoveries.  So on a net basis, our planned growth spending fits well within our capital structure and liquidity framework. Note that we include capitalized interest in our CapEx guidance, which is approximately $200 million per year. We are working on reducing leverage and optimizing our balance sheet and that is closely tied to our capital investment plan, post-merger and taking advantage of the capital synergy opportunities we mentioned earlier.  Before wrapping up, I have two important updates to share. We felt it was time to scale our Investor Relations program, given our nearly doubling in size post-merger. So I'm happy to announce that Lisa Curran has joined our team as VP of Investor Relations. Lisa brings a unique breadth and depth of experience across sectors and leading companies through growth transformations. And I'm sure Peter -- Pete Lopez will facilitate introductions with all of you over the coming weeks. We've talked with a number of you about our plans for a Viasat Investor Day and listen to your feedback on multiple fronts. We've heard you and we will instead focus more immediately on enhancing our reporting disclosures and investor outreach, including giving more insight on our growth businesses.  We look forward to getting more of your feedback. We are aware that we are competing for your capital every day, we have conviction in our path ahead, and we want you to match our confidence. We expect to provide an update on our next earnings call.  Now our path to positive free cash flow in the first half of calendar year 2025 is driven by sourcing growth from our large and growing markets, including mobility and government. Ongoing execution on our sizable backlog, meaningful cost rationalization and prioritize CapEx spending, which benefits from the natural decline as we launch our satellites.  We are driving cost structure improvements with synergies, scale and benchmarking. Our operational performance in Q3 was very good, and we are on track to achieve substantial synergy value and expect the combined company to grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA in FY '24 and FY '25. And to be clear, our FY '25 growth is based on a full 12 months of Inmarsat in FY '24. With that, I'll pass it back to Mark.\nMark Dankberg: Okay. Thanks, Guru. And at this point, we'll be happy to take some questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ric Prentiss with Raymond James.\nRichard Prentiss: First thoughts are with you, your employees and families with all that rain, weather you've had out there. So I hope everyone is okay.  On the business side of things, I appreciate the update on the Flight 2. It sounds like first half calendar '25 and the Flight 3 actually before that kind of late 4Q calendar '24, help us -- so is there any more ground network or any more investment that needs to kind of occur as we kind of think through that? And have you gotten any insurance yet for the Flight 3? And then I'll come in with another question.\nMark Dankberg: Okay. On the capital investments, I think where we are is about -- we're about 85% through the total capital investment plan that we had when we started the ViaSat-3 program. So about 15% to go, and that includes both the remaining space and ground -- initial ground segment.\nRichard Prentiss: And then insurance for Flight 3...\nShawn Duffy: Yes I think you have that -- yes, so we're still working on that. We filed claims. Things are looking good, but I think you'd expect that probably be in FY '25.\nMark Dankberg: Yes, part of the process for insuring the third flight is going over the status of Flight 1. And we'll do that through questions and responses with the insurers now that we filed our claim.\nRichard Prentiss: Okay. And then, Guru, you kind of pointed out a little bit that you're looking at how best to use the bandwidth that you're bringing to bear with all these new birds, both on the Viasat side and the Inmarsat side. Can you help us from a high level maybe understand how much capacity should we be thinking that you're bringing into the marketplaces?  And then as you think about what we call GAME, government, aviation, maritime, enterprise, but then also rural consumer, how should we think about that capacity where you might want to apply it and what those growth profiles look like -- I'm making it a more complicated question, help us understand the competitive dynamics in those silos of who you feel you're most pressed against?\nMark Dankberg: Okay. Okay. So there's a lot in there.\nRichard Prentiss: A lot there, yes.\nMark Dankberg: Well, so the first part is -- and one of the things we emphasized early on when we were first entering the business was the performance of each individual satellite. And now given the size of our fleet and the fact that we have multiple satellites covering individual places, one of the main things that we are now working on is using each incremental satellite to effectively increase the capacity of the whole fleet more than what you would get from just that first satellite, and that comes from the way that we operate the fleet as a whole.  So I mean, so the -- think of it this way, the basic idea is that if you look at satellite coverage, just like cellular coverage in each beam of any satellite, the areas right in the middle of the beam that are really -- that are the most efficient, and there are places at the edges of beams that are less efficient. So the fact -- since all of those patterns don't line up on all the satellites, one of the things that we can do is reallocate the way we think about allocations of user terminals to satellites by doing that in the most efficient way possible.  And that is much easier to do with mobility terminals than it is with fixed because mobility terminals are already able to be handed off from satellite to satellite at any time. The other thing, which goes to the part about competitive dynamics, is that one of the things that we always talk about and you can measure pretty easily is that the high demand markets have very high ratios of peak demand to average demand.  So think about airports, especially a big airport with a lot of connecting flights, 3 or 4 times a day, it might have 10x the demand that it has on the average at those peak times. So our more recent satellites that have dynamic bandwidth steering or more dynamic bandwidth steering than we've had in the past have an additional benefit of being able to move those beams around among the different places that have those high peak demands.  And the other thing is we have plenty of data on the differences in those peak times. So for instance, the peak demands in Atlanta aren't necessarily the same as they are in Chicago, Dallas, Houston or other hub airports. So we can then optimize our bandwidth to match those patterns. The main -- the biggest overall trends in these mobility markets are really increasing both the amount of bandwidth that individual passengers use and then a number of passengers that are engaged in using WiFi.  So that's kind of the change that we've really catalyzed. And it's -- I mean the way we kind of explain it to airlines is you don't really get any credit from passengers for having WiFi if they don't use it, right. So the big challenge has been how do you scale up the engagement without having bottlenecks at these hub airports.  And we think that's a really -- that's a big dynamic that is playing out first in the U.S. and is expanding internationally. There are similar effects going on in maritime markets in the way they're manifested in maritime markets depends a lot on the type of ship, whether it's a leisure ship or think of it as a personal ship or enterprise ship.  And if it's an enterprise ship, is its main function moving people? Or is it moving cargo. As an example, so what we're doing is, is working on each of those areas and then you can imagine you also have to work on the combination of those areas because a lot of the big airport are also major maritime ports. And so those are the dynamics. Basically, what we're working on is that match of supply and demand, we can do that in two ways.  One way is to optimize the fleet using some of the techniques that I talked about at the beginning. And the other one is to be really thoughtful about the customers that we choose to serve so that we can deliver those -- the performance that they're counting on. Does that cover those points that you had?\nRichard Prentiss: Yes. And it sounds like you feel good about the amount of bandwidth you're bringing to bear and the ability to -- the time at the right time of market -- time of day, sorry, and geographic market and try and convince people, you should be using this stuff to kind of spur demand.\nMark Dankberg: Yes, it's all of those. And we've been refining our ability to do this for years. It was those kind of our original go-to-market value proposition in the in-flight space in the U.S. We have years worth of data. The data is constantly evolving, but we've got our fingers on that. And then we also are augmenting that with industry-based data that helps us deal with perturbations to those scheduled users and for those types of vessels or planes that aren't scheduled. So you have to combine all that stuff. But we feel like that's the direction that service providers are going to need to go to deliver the certainty at those enterprise and government customers want.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nikhil Aluru with JPMorgan.\nNikhil Aluru: If I could ask a question on IFC, you guys mentioned the 1,400 plane backlog. Can you help us think about how quickly that you're able to activate those and what the pacing might look like as they come online? And then more higher level on IFC, Mark, you touched on the go-to-market. Maybe if you could give us some color on what the competitive intensity has looked like? Is there anything that you feel like you need to change potentially around pricing or promotion in the IFC business to maintain this kind of growth that you've been run rating at?\nMark Dankberg: Okay. Sure. So the rate of deployment is -- it is a little bit unpredictable. The main factors -- one of the biggest factors is the delivery rate of new aircraft from OEMs, especially Boeing and Airbus. They have a lot of -- so they have a lot of demand, and there's been supply constraints, including some of their major components. We've ranged from 200 or 300. In some quarters, we've done as many as 500. But we're looking at going from currently around 3,500 to probably around 4,200 or so by the end of next fiscal year. So that would be a little over a year from now.  But that -- and then that -- I think that's a reasonable assessment based on current new delivery rates and how those delivery rates affect our customers' retrofits. If they don't have new planes that sometimes slows the rate at which they'll take existing planes out of service for retrofits. I think that's a pretty reasonable estimate.  And then on the -- your other question about what the growth drivers are? I'd say -- for us, kind of the biggest -- so let's say, I'm going to talk about a few things.  One is the in-flight connectivity business tends to be [indiscernible] regional carriers have -- they have different ways of approaching their customer base than, say, global long-haul carriers. And then some of the premium carriers generally are driven really by revenue per seat mile compared to very low-cost carriers or low-cost carriers that can be driven by CASK. So the -- I think that it's not really a good idea. So I mean it's not the way we approach it. We don't really approach it as a one-size-fits-all market.  What we do see is kind of a dominant theme, which probably will play out over the next few years, and it's happening on a quarter-by-quarter basis is that some of the competitive dynamics that we first saw in the U.S. market are starting to spread internationally. That is especially this notion that the airlines don't really get any credit from their passengers if they don't use the connectivity system. So really think of it as the main trends are increasing passenger engagement. And then to increase passenger engagement, you generally need to offer them something that they want and more and more of that something -- that includes video. So that drives bandwidth demand.  The -- and then the big issues really are when that happens, how do those airlines have confidence that you can deliver? That's what has led to having us sort of well-defined service level agreements that we and the airline can measure. And then the other ingredient that we've been increasingly successful at is helping the airlines monetize that engagement. Different airlines have different strategies for monetizing it. But if they don't monetize it and they just add more costs, that doesn't work for a lot of airlines.  So the idea of building the increasing supply of bandwidth and the increasing engagement into a business model that works for each airline. That's one of the main things that we've been focused on. And one of the areas that we're going to aim to try to provide investors with more visibility on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Crawford with B. Riley.\nMichael Crawford: A couple of questions regarding the L-band. First, can you elaborate on your 3 geostationary smallsat L-band satellites that you're developing and whether that may contain some of the discontinued ViaSat-4 IP?\nMark Dankberg: No. The L-band satellites -- those 3 new L-band satellites were started by Inmarsat prior to the merger being completed. They do have some pretty innovative bus features. They're very low-cost geosynchronous satellites, which are interesting for a variety of reasons, but they're not based on ViaSat-3 IP. Those 3 aren't.\nMichael Crawford: And those might launch in 2026?\nMark Dankberg: Yes. I think they're going to -- intended to be in service in by the -- by 2027. Part of it is they will have reasonably orbit raising time. So we've got to work through the launch and the orbit raising and bringing into service mission, but those are ballpark correct at this point.\nMichael Crawford: Okay. And then separately on L-band, could you just elaborate more of what you, Skylo and Ligado, each are bringing to the table on this NTN direct-to-device service and whether that requires a special device such as like a formerly Bullitt phone or a TAT phone that -- or would this would be to any iPhone or Android phone?\nMark Dankberg: Okay. Yes. So what is happening in the device market is expanded interest in this integration of terrestrial and satellite networks. And satellite networks are often referred to as NTN or nonterrestrial networks. The -- you have to think of motivations of different parties here. But the device makers -- and think of it as device makers, mobile network operators, over-the-top companies that provide services -- data services to smartphones as well. And then -- or other devices. And then also think about it from the user's perspective.  So the device makers are really looking to integrate a next generation of modem chips. That's what's standardized in this 3GPP standard. There's also some specifications around satellite frequency bands. L-band being one of the most prominent for delivering these services. And then the devicemakers are working to seamlessly integrate this handoff from terrestrial cellular networks to satellite service. And that is -- so that's the general theme what you'll see. And what you'll probably see are initially some functions that are for remote -- basically remote emergency or remote location type services.  And then also just remote coming now will be remote messaging and communication services that are built into devices. The idea would be if you have a device that benefits from cellular connectivity that you would use the satellite connectivity to extend that range and what we think is also fill in black spots in coverage. Some part of -- and this is to be determined, but some part of the market is in people that you know are far away, often deserts or mountain ranges where there wasn't and probably won't ever be cellular coverage.  But a lot of devices are disconnected just even though they are near terrestrial cellular coverage, but in a dead spot or a black spot or shadowed by a mountain or hill side or similar things like that. So one of the big things going on in the industry is whether you want to serve those people with existing cellular terrestrial frequencies that are allocated to satellite, or -- and this is the part that we're aiming for, and we think makes a lot of sense is if you can augment terrestrial cellular with licensed satellite spectrum that will fill in all these black spots, and you don't have to take -- you, the carrier doesn't have to take any existing spectrum out of service. They have to take terrestrial spectrum and dedicate it to satellite use.  That's -- so that is -- that's what these 3GPP standards are about is enabling that capability. We think, ultimately, that's the way to both get scale and make the services more attractive. So now Skylo has put together kind of a network and back office solution that lets us start delivering those services pretty much right away. We're doing tests with some really interesting devices. We're working with Ligado to help scale what we can do in the U.S.  And worked with Ligado for years. They have a very -- they've kind of the most advanced L-band, ground-based beam forming satellite. We helped develop that, and we also help them operate it. And then with Inmarsat, we can extend that globally across all the rest of our fleet. So that's what's going on now. I'd say the main thing you'll see kind of the near future are device makers that choose those chips that have the satellite NTN capability starting to talk about their products and bring them to market probably later this year.\nKumara Gowrappan: A couple of quick clarification points, Mike. One, this is, as Mark said, it's still in market discovery and development mode, and we don't have any incremental CapEx associated with this deal, just for clarity.\nMark Dankberg: And right now, we think this will start slowly. Ultimately, we think it will build, as Guru said. I think market discovery is a good way to describe it.\nMichael Crawford: Okay. Just one final question, more on the financials. Just given the quarter-to-quarter variability in your gross margins for products and services, how -- what was in the mix to cause that variance this quarter? And how should we be thinking about that and say, the March quarter and also next year is regarding gross margin on products and services revenue?\nShawn Duffy: Mike, it's Shawn. So I think if you think about this quarter, there's a couple of unique things. One is we had a little bit of favorability on the mix in our government business. And so that yielded a little bit improved margins. And on the service side, we also had -- we had a kind of a contract negotiation that we were able to resolve with the customer and so that had some favorability as well. So those are things I would say that I'm not expecting to keep going into the next quarter. And then also, we get a little bit of benefit from the acquisition accounting and the flow-through of that, and that's going to start to meter down as well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Koontz with Needham & Company.\nRyan Koontz: Appreciate your commentary, Mark, about the major long-haul versus regionals there and different strategies. Maybe if we take step back, can you maybe characterize kind of how you view those markets in your kind of targeted western markets of where we are in penetration for long haul and regionals? Number one.  And second question is that you've talked before about wholesale partnerships to fill bandwidth needs. Is that still on the table of looking a relationship with other providers to fill any gaps you might have with the change in plan for F1?\nMark Dankberg: Okay. Sure. Yes, I'd say that if you want to see what the future of in-flight is, one is, if you look at the region -- I don't like regional, that would be like the U.S. market. Looking at the U.S. as a domestic market compared to international flights to and from the U.S., that's a good proxy I'd say. On the domestic part, the domestic mainline fleets are typically single-aisle planes, maybe a couple of hundred on the range of a couple of hundred passengers. And some, there's a mix of seat-back entertainments and no screens.  So you're seeing, I'd say, a pretty fair -- very high penetration of those or many flights where we'll serve well over 200 devices at peak times. And I'd say we're serving both entertainment and connectivity options. And one of the main themes is going to be greater integration between those sort of reflecting what people do, but -- at home, well first they're watching entertainment and still doing -- communicating with friends or social media or other things on their devices.  In the long-haul business, that -- the long-haul market has been, I'd say, it's a little bit behind. And that has been because the planes have a lot more people. So high engagement, high bandwidth, means higher capacity of links. And so that's an area that I think we're going to do well in, but we're really with Inmarsat and the new ViaSat-3 satellites, really entering that now, and we're working with our customers to bring similar experiences to the -- to those large twin-aisle long-haul aircraft, as have been in the, say, the U.S. domestic market or intra big domestic markets in other parts of the world, like Australia, Europe, Brazil, some of the other markets that we've been in.  Also, you're going to see -- because seatbacks are such an important part of that, I think that's where you'll also see a lot of innovation in combining the entertainment and connectivity parts. The part that's still really to be penetrated is the low-cost carriers because their focus on cost per seat mile really is -- it's a big . So building up these monetization strategies, I think, is going to be a big factor in the low-cost carriers, both on the regional domestic fleets and on the long haul. Does that give you some sense of what those dynamics are?\nRyan Koontz: Yes. When you talk about complementary revenue that you -- things like advertising in places like that where you can kind of boost revenue per seat? Or what sort of other monetization schemes are there?\nMark Dankberg: Yes. So the -- well, one of the tricks is really the whole purpose of this is to increase passenger engagement and then basically think of in-flight connectivity is an amenity like other amenities and it's got to carry its weight for those airlines, right. So the idea is come up with monetization strategies that are -- that help overall with passenger engagement. Advertising is one mechanism, but there's quite a few others that we've been testing with other airlines.  And some of them involve promotions with interesting online services or destination-driven things. There's just a very broad range of monetization opportunities. And I think our approach -- and I think we've been fortunate here in working with some really savvy airlines that have different approaches to it. I think one of the things you're going to see pretty much by definition is if every airline does the same thing, then no airlines have a competitive advantage. So a lot of this is really around how they brand and monetize their operations in general and the partners that they use, which often are associated with their root structure and their -- the values that their brand conveys. And I think we'll give a little more detail on this, but it's -- I think it's one of the biggest opportunities in in-flight connectivity.\nRyan Koontz: That's really great. And any comments on the kind of wholesale needs you might have with other sat operators?\nMark Dankberg: Third-party? Yes. Especially, one of the main ways in which we've been working with third parties is on international markets where you have kind of flag carriers, and there doesn't have to be a flag carrier, but basically local regional carriers and then you also have regional satellite operators that are often tied to their regional governments and their ambitions in space. And one of the things that we've been able to do is work with those partners. I think you can see more of this on a -- think of it as a partnership, roaming wholesale basis where they can bring their space assets into service for their needs, and they can also address international flights where their own carriers go global and where other global carriers go to their regions.  And that -- we think that's a really interesting formula that also helps deal with this issue of reinforcing those hotspots. And it's also very extensible into the maritime industry. So those are themes that really underpin a lot of these wholesale agreements or third-party partner agreements that we mentioned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Quilty with Quilty Space.\nChristopher Quilty: Real quick first, a question for Shawn. I'm assuming the CapEx figures exclude capitalized interest?\nShawn Duffy: Yes. So thanks for asking, Chris. So the number that we gave you for both this year and next year do include that capitalized interest, which was about $200 million.\nChristopher Quilty: Okay. Good. That's even better then. Great. Second follow-up question on the I-8 satellites. Apparently, they've got electric propulsion, but that doesn't prevent you from doing a direct injection if you want them to get to orbit quicker. Is that correct?\nMark Dankberg: Correct. Yes. We will do a launch mission that's really based on when we need them in service, the services they'll provide in the overall economics and trade-offs of that. But -- right. We can -- we have and can shorten the orbit raising time by choosing the launch vehicle. And we're going to keep that option open.\nChristopher Quilty: Got you. And the I6 F2, I think I got that right, is that fairly standard? I mean, you're not going out on a limb and doing something major different with that replacement and it's more of an off-the-shelf replacement from an existing or the existing vendor? Or do you see this as an opportunity to look to add new technology into that satellite?\nMark Dankberg: Okay. So there were some specific missions for Inmarsat that were combined on that satellite. The I6 satellites, as an example, combined both L-band and Ka-band payloads. So given where we are with the combined company and our other assets, what we're really looking for is just the L-band portion of that payload. So -- and that is -- it's -- I wouldn't call it commodity. But it's -- we could -- there's several different Inmarsat and other L-band satellites that we could use as the basis for that.  Right now, we're really just looking at our overall L-band fleet and our overall L-band needs and a migration strategy that's around the safety services that are supported by our fleet, the aviation services which are expanding and supported by our fleet in making the decision on the best way to fulfill what that was -- what that satellite was going to do. And we'll report on that, but we did think it was prudent to include a placeholder in FY '25 for the cost that we would incur with the replacement.\nChristopher Quilty: Got you. Final question, and it's a little open-ended, but R&D like we very rarely talk about R&D as a line in the income statement more about specific projects. But when you look at the combination of the 2 company, there's a lot of -- 2 companies, there's a lot of things you can do in terms of products, I think of terminals and gateways and modems and different things that need to be harmonized between the two.  Are there any anticipated step-ups associated with R&D investments, forget the government stuff, which is funded R&D? Or do you just see sort of regular way investment consistent with what the 2 companies had been doing individually? Or is there a period of time here where you need to spend more to get some of the products and services to market quickly?\nMark Dankberg: Right now, the main -- one of the main themes, as Guru described, it's really operational synergies with R&D being an important component of that. So one example of that is we have 2 different networking systems, and we're in the process of converging and that's in our R&D plan. We also have a number of these improvements that we described that our networks operating more efficiently.  But the overall -- our overall R&D spend, we think, is going to stay in rough range of around 3.5% to 4%. And some -- we're basically aiming two big themes. One is synergies and then the other is productivity improvements and then think of it as service enhancements, a lot of which go around these missions that we described that our customers are doing. That would be like for in-flight connectivity, that's -- the -- think of it as a synthesis of the connectivity and the entertainment portions. There's similar but different types of R&D activities that we're doing for applications on the government side in the maritime space. But those are the main [indiscernible] drivers.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Edison Yu with Deutsche Bank.\nEdison Yu: First, just housekeeping. Did I hear correctly about the Analyst Day that it is being pushed out? Is that what you were trying to communicate?\nKumara Gowrappan: This is Guru. Yes, so I'll just say two things. One, we've had interactions with many of you, and we've had feedback on disclosures and overall reporting, and we've been taking that feedback and working through that. So our focus is really addressing some of the key questions that we are getting in, and we'll address that in the next earnings, which means we are not going to do the Investor Day that we had originally thought of in March, and we are in parallel thinking to what a new Investor Day would look like.  So we'll come back to you when we have an update there. But we didn't want to delay key questions that we're getting around disclosures and overall reporting, which we'll address in the next earnings call.\nEdison Yu: Understand, understand. Just a couple on the business. Just curious on the cash flow. There were a couple of discrete items called out as a headwind. Any way you can kind of quantify what those were? And do those kind of headwinds go away sequentially?\nShawn Duffy: Yes, Edison, this is Shawn. Yes, I think that one of the things to keep in mind is, in Q3, we had kind of a lift in -- our cash flow requirements related to the tax payments that we needed to do for the TDL transaction, and we had a little bit also over on the U.K. side. So when I think about it, kind of Q3 to Q4, I think I would -- we'll have our interest payments in that quarter, maybe that's about $33 million. You could see our working capital requirement, probably around the $50-ish million or so in isolated there.  But I don't think we don't have any material tax payments coming into Q4. So that's a good way to think about it.\nEdison Yu: All right, great. And then last question, just on the cost. I realized we boosted the savings potential to $100 million for 2 years. Are we looking at trying to maybe take more? Obviously, you had some more time to dig into the Inmarsat piece. Should we think about potentially some upside to that $100 million as we move forward?\nKumara Gowrappan: Edison, I would say, so if you look at what we talked about on the $100 million starting FY '25, a lot of the focus there was on headcount and bringing the 2 teams together from go-to-market all the way through technology. So we feel really good with that. Now what we are focused on right now is non-headcount related, which you think about procurement and supply chain and some of the external spend that we do, we are now doing our analysis and working through that. So we do expect opportunities there in terms of savings, but we haven't quantified those yet. We're working through that.\nShawn Duffy: And Edison, if I can add one -- just one my point. Just keeping in mind that in Q3, alongside the risk that we announced with -- as we were rightsizing on the people, we saw some of those payments from in this quarter 2. So that elevated Q3 a little bit as well.\nOperator: That is all the time we have for questions. I will turn the call back to Mark Dankberg for closing remarks.\nMark Dankberg: Okay. So thanks a lot, everybody, for joining us. I would like to leave you with just a few important takeaways from third quarter. One is that the results were good. We generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth. We're winning new business in our targeted growth markets. I think, hopefully, you can get a sense of the competitive environment that we're in, in the way that we are targeting specific enterprise in government and mobility markets.  The Inmarsat integration program is ahead of schedule and ahead of budget. And we are balancing growth, innovation and profitability. So with that, I look forward to updating you all on our continued progress next quarter. And with that, I'll hand it back to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

        "content": "Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to Viasat's FY '24 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Your host for today is Mark Dankberg, Chairman and CEO. You may proceed, Mr. Dankberg.\nMark Dankberg: Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. So with me, I've got Guru Graben, our President, Shawn Duffy, our Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Blair, our General Counsel. So, Robert could you please start us with our safe harbor disclosure.\nRobert Blair: Sure Mark. As you know, this discussion will contain forward-looking statements. This is a reminder that factors could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. Copies are available from the SEC or from our website. Back to you, Mark.\nMark Dankberg: Okay. Thanks. So we encourage reading the shareholder letter that we posted on our website earlier this afternoon for more details. I'll start with an overview of the main points, and then we'll have time for questions. Our main objective today is to bring you up-to-date, organize some information and provide clarity on our plans. So I'll start with a quick update on performance in the quarter, which was really good. Overall, up well into double digits on revenue and adjusted EBITDA on a combined operating basis. I'll give an update on the status of the two satellite anomalies. They have the financial implications of putting those behind us and describe the go forward plan. And then, I'll give a quick reminder of our overall strategy and why we're well positioned for growth, primarily in the $108 billion market for commercial and government global mobility. So after that, Guru will go into more depth on the quarter with business highlights and financial results give a little bit more color on the Inmarsat integration and give an update on our fiscal year '24 and '25 growth outlook. Just for context at the beginning, we have a good track record of identifying and building profitable and enduring positions in a succession of specific, somewhat esoteric market segments, including against much larger competitors. And we think the sale of the tactical data links business earlier this year to a leading aerospace and defense company for about $2 billion, it's indicative of our ability to build long-term value, while also transforming target market segments. We've been targeting global mobile broadband for over a decade, and we've had a big impact on the commercial in flight connectivity market in the U.S. We aim to leverage our technology and domain knowledge and the extensive operational data that we've accumulated, along with Inmarsat heritage to lead specific segments of this rapidly growing market for commercial and government global mobile. We can do it by focusing on quantitative performance metrics that are critical to our customers and bringing together the asset skills and ecosystems needed to win on those metrics. Our financial performance in the second quarter demonstrates strength in global mobility. Core operating financial results were good across the business, both at Viasat and with legacy Inmarsat. Excluding the onetime benefit of a legal settlement, operating revenue was up 16%, year-over-year on a combined basis. And then excluding that onetime mitigation benefit in the satellite impairment charges, operating adjusted EBITDA was up 20%. Our aviation business continues steady growth. Our customers' fleet of planes is up to 3,350 and still growing, passenger engagement is growing, and we've got a robust pipeline of new orders. Information assurance products for secure government data centers and antenna systems are also growing very well. Maritime is growing modestly and we see opportunities to build momentum there. Our outlook is also quite good. We anticipate continued growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA during fiscal year '24 and fiscal year '25, and to reach free cash flow positive in the first half of calendar '25. So go up to the satellite anomalies, those, on ViaSat-3 Flight 1, and Inmarsat 6, Flight 2 this summer were two totally different events. And they were setbacks, but we have plans to deal with each. Now I6F2 will result in a total write-off. A claim for about $349 million will be submitted to insurers shortly. I6F2's near-term contribution to revenue was expected to be small. It was part of a longer term planned evolution of Inmarsat's redundant global l band coverage to a newer generation of satellites. We have a provision in our updated capital budget to replace that mission of I6F2 in a timely manner. ViaSat-3 Flight 1 is impaired. And as we disclosed recently, we expect it will have less than 10% of nominal total throughput. We expect to file an insurance claim this calendar year for about $421 million. The anomaly affected what's called the feeder link antenna. The rest of the satellite has operated nominally or better to date. Our focus has been on characterizing the affected antenna so we can compensate for the anomaly optimally. We've made a lot of progress there. The satellite system is, software defined on the ground, which gives us a lot more tools that we can use. We can use them to optimize available throughput for global mobility, especially by dynamically steering coverage beams on moving airplanes and ships, and to the busiest airports, seaports, or wherever there's instantaneous demand is greatest. We also can effectively increase the capacity of our other satellites in our fleet for global mobility by the way we use each of the ViaSat-3s including Flight 1. Our fixed U.S. business though depends more on the volume of bandwidth than on dynamic beam steering, so we expect it will decline until we launch and position the next ViaSat-3. We expect to grow in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 nonetheless, driven by the backlog and outlook in global mobility and government. ViaSat-3 Flight 3 has a launch contract now for the fourth quarter of calendar '24, about a year from now. Either ViaSat-3 Flight 2 or Flight 3 would replace Flight 1 over the Americas, and then Flight 1 would be relocated. Report on the Flight 1 antenna root cause, and then the corrective actions for Flight 2 from the antenna manufacturer is planned for next week. The Flight 2 satellite is awaiting corrective actions to the effect of the antenna and then integration with the completed spacecraft. So, we'll give an update on that schedule next quarter. The other satellite update is that we don't anticipate additional material investment in ViaSat-4, and we've written down that asset. It was designed prior to the Inmarsat acquisition when fixed services were a higher priority. Given the timing on the ViaSat-3s and our focus on mobility, its need date is farther out than originally planned, so deferring capital investment now saves several 100 to 1,000,000 of dollars in the near-term and accelerates our free cash flow generation, and it improves profitability. We expect that key technology work that was performed on ViaSat-4 will apply to a future broadband satellite flight that'll deliver better returns in mobility applications. The end result is a write-off of the three satellite assets of about $900 million net of insurance. The schedule for Flight 1, remember the build schedule for Flight 1 was much longer than for Flight 2 or 3 due to both COVID issues and learning curve. So its cost was higher than the others. The bulk of the write-off is due to flight ViaSat-351, ViaSat-652, about $350 million of capitalized interest. So just I just briefly touched on our strategy before we go to Guru. And just to me, be sure. Our strategy is to lead specific government, commercial, global mobility market segments that have common characteristics that drive value creation for our customers and for us. So, we're looking for broadband customers whose connectivity is directly coupled to operational needs or wants and where customers are motivated to understand and measure the quality of connectivity that they need for those purposes. And we're looking for customers that want contractual assurance they get the connectivity activity they need for their missions over all the times and places their platforms travel. So that means measuring the times and places where connectivity is most stressed those congestion hot spots that can undermine achieving their operational purposes. We can attract and serve those customers by meeting specific, granular service level commitments, and then giving them the data and insight they need to optimize their own financial performance. We think that describes a large and growing portion of the global mobile market, our success in flight connectivity, the outcome of applying that strategy over a journey of discovery and we take in with our airline customers. There is quantifying the demand elasticity and value creation for different forms of in flight Wi-Fi service offerings and then measuring highly concentrated demand at peak times at busy airports that comes with high passenger engagement and where other services haven't really performed reliably. And then finally, as good connectivity becomes more widely available across airlines and routes, it becomes critical to each airline to both differentiate their brand and their value propositions from other airlines while also capturing the value that's created by that connectivity. So, we can apply these points to multiple market segments. Once a few 100s customers understand the significance of connectivity measurements over entire routes and the hotspot challenges and then translate that into competitive advantage that tends to drive change across entire market segments. The dynamic global coverage and beam steering of the ViaSat-3 constellation even with an impaired Flight 1 as well as the capabilities of the upcoming GX789 series support our strategy. So this continues to resonate with customers and it's resulting in new business globally, including some examples this quarter such as Korean Air, Malaysian Airlines, Atlantic Offshore, Porter Airlines, and with the U.S. Space Force, and more. The other important element of our strategy is to better leverage Inmarsat's global L-band leadership. L-band is very well suited to low cost, highly reliable, weather resilient coverage for emergency voice and operational data, and there's growing opportunity to integrate both satellite and terrestrial coverage for Internet of Things and mainstream mobile devices. There's already substantial overlap in the customer base between our broadband and L-band markets, and there's good opportunity to further differentiate our integrated service offerings. So our near-term growth outlook is good, and longer term's even more exciting. As part of our comprehensive review upon closing the Inmarsat acquisition, we're refining our strategy to make sure we're focused on the right market segments and refining value propositions that resonate with customers. And as we complete and deploy the capital investments to take those value propositions global that we generate the cash flow we're aiming for. We're planning an investor day in March of 2024 where we'll go into more depth on the analytics and the customer journeys, describing that underpin our approach. So now, hand it over to Guru, who'll talk about our second quarter.\nGuru Gowrappan: Great. Thanks Mark. I will cover three key topics today, our Q3 financial performance, integration and transformation and an update on our combined outlook. We are executing on our strategy and delivered a strong core financial and operational performance during Q2. Core revenue and adjusted EBITDA both grew by double-digits year-over-year driven by our government, aviation and maritime businesses. Legacy Inmarsat and Viasat both performed well with strong contributions. Some of the key highlights from the quarter include, Garmin Systems had another quarter of strong demand for our information assurance encryption products, which drove product revenue up 50% year-over-year. And during the quarter, we were awarded a proliferated LEO satellite based services contract by the U.S. Space Force as part of their 900 million IDIQ program. Services will be comprised of our current and future satellite constellation capabilities as well as the partner LEO MEO Networks to deliver integrated multi orbit solutions that may include space relay services. Next, UK National Cybersecurity Center evaluated our next generation data test cryptography solid state drive for top secret classification, which was successful and we are only hardware encrypted SSD using the industry standard interface and form factor to attain the status. Recent trends in satellite services continued with strong growth in commercial IFC which ended the quarter with 3,350 aircraft in service, up 19% year-over-year on a combined basis and 1,600 aircraft in backlog. U.S. fixed broadband revenue declined as fewer residential subscribers were partially offset by higher ARPU. We continue to reallocate bandwidth to support our rapid IFC growth. In addition, we announced several commercial air customer updates as Mark mentioned earlier, Malaysia Airlines selection of our IFP solution for its new Boeing 7378 aircraft, Korean Air's selection of our IFC solution for its upcoming Airbus A321neo aircraft and Additional orders for both IFE and IFC solutions on Porter Airlines' new Embraer E195-E2 aircraft. Maritime revenue continued modest growth. The total KA band mobility platforms which include vessels and aircraft grew to over 19,000 up about 2% sequentially. Finally, awards for the quarter were up 15% Year-over-year to $1 billion backlog was $3.6 billion at quarter end. We have a couple of one off items in Q2. In the commercial network segment, we recognized a non recurring benefit to product revenue of $95 million and adjusted EBITDA benefit of $86 million as a result of litigation settlement. In the prior year period, we recorded revenue of $56 million and adjusted EBITDA of $51 million related to the same litigation. We also announced $900 million of net asset impairment charges primarily related to the previously announced satellite anomalies which includes approximately $350 million of capitalized interest. Now some color on the financials. Q2 FY 2024 revenue was $1.2 billion. This was up 85% compared to revenue from continuing operations of $664 million in Q2 FY 2023. Excluding the nonrecurring litigation benefit from both years and including Inmarsat in both years Q2 2024 revenue was up 16% year-over-year. Net loss totaled $767 million for fiscal Q2 which increased from $48 million net loss in the year ago period primarily due to net asset impairment charges related to satellite anomalies. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $486 million, an increase of 210% year over year from continuing operations. Excluding the nonrecurring litigation benefit from both years asset impairment charges and including Inmarsat in both years, Q2 FY 2024 adjusted EBITDA was up 20% year over year. Sequentially, net leverage decreased to approximately 3.7 times estimated combined last 12 months adjusted EBITDA as of Q2 FY 2024, which is a 0.2 times sequential improvement and substantially favorable to the plan at the time the Inmarsat acquisition was announced. We have significant financial flexibility with more than 3 billion of liquidity, including approximately 2 billion of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet at quarter end and no near-term maturities. And we have a fully funded path to positive free cash flow. In addition to our solid results, we were also proud to be recognized by the U.S. government at this year's G20 Summit for our work to help close the gender digital divide and bring internet access to women in remote areas of the world. You can find a more complete review of our results in the shareholder letter that we posted today. Overall, as you heard from Mark as well, which this was an excellent quarter for Viasat. Now moving to the next topic which is integration and transformation. Our integration of Inmarsat and the transformation of our combined organization is going well and is ahead of the plan bringing greater certainty that we will deliver and exceed our synergy goals for the Inmarsat acquisition. Last week, we took the required labor actions to achieve annual operating expense savings of approximately 100 million beginning fiscal year 2025 which positions the Company for improved profitability going forward. This timeline represents a multiyear acceleration relative to our targets. Separately, the benefit to capital expenditures was included in our FY 2025 guidance of 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion announced last month. We expect to incur 45 million of onetime costs related to these actions. As financial discipline remains a top priority, we are working every opportunity to improve our cost structure and operational efficiency, including taking a closer look at our third-party procurement spend, more disciplined capital expenditure and benchmarking to accelerate the timing and magnitude of free cash flow. Now transitioning to outlook. I'll wrap up with a high level summary of our financial outlook. We're excluding satellite impairment charges and the nonrecurring benefit from the litigation settlement announced today from our guidance. For FY 2024, we expect revenue growth in the high-single-digit percentages over FY 2023 for the combined company with revenue growing to a range of 4.1 billion to 4.25 billion. For FY 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-single-digit percentages over FY 2023 for the combined company. We expect FY 2024 adjusted EBITDA to grow to a range of 1.25 billion to 1.3 billion. In FY 2025, we continue to expect both revenue and adjusted EBITDA to grow. FY 2024 capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 1.7 billion then decline in FY 2025 to a range of 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion inclusive of a placeholder for the potential funding of an I6F2 replacement. Capital expenditure guidance does not include the expected 770 million benefit from insurance recoveries. Note that we include capitalized interest in our CapEx guidance. Our path to positive free cash flow in the first half of calendar year 2025 is driven by sourcing growth from our large and growing markets which includes government, aviation and maritime Realizing realization of our sizable backlog, meaningful cost rationalization and a disciplined CapEx spending which benefits from the natural decline as we launch our satellites. We are driving cost structure improvements with synergies, scale and benchmarking. And the magnitude of free cash flow is expected to increase meaningfully as we place ViaSat-3F and F3 3 satellites into service. So there you have it. While we've had unfortunate satellite setbacks, we have a very good hand and we are optimizing and growing the strong assets we have. Our operational performance in Q2 was excellent and we are on track to achieve very material synergy value then expect the combined company to grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA in FY 2024 and FY 2025 while creating a powerful global mobility and government business. And to be clear, our FY25 growth is based on a full 12 months of Inmarsat in FY24. With that, I'll pass it back to Mark.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take the first question from Phil Cusick, JPMorgan.\nPhil Cusick: Hi, thank you. I guess a couple if I can. First, was the decision to move away from the ViaSat-4 and focus on mobility, a statement on the viability of home broadband from satellite or is that more of a just timing and capital needs? And then second, can you talk about the plans For the cash on the balance sheet and the insurance proceeds coming in, there's some debt at a discount, does it make sense to pick off that or do you want to have this cash on the balance sheet for a long time?\nMark Dankber: Okay. Yes. First on the ViaSat-4, we have been targeting the mobility broadband market for, well, for about as long as we've been in you know, since we launched ViaSat-1. And, you know, it was because the Customers value the services better. We're not dealing with or competing with government subsidies. And the other thing now that that's really come to light, especially, you know, in our experience in flight and the data that we have from Inmarsat in the maritime business Is that that you know, dealing with that mobility factor, and concentration of demand is a is a really hard and tricky problem. We think we're really well suited to do that. And whereas the original design of ViaSat-4 that we started really was about large bulk amounts of bandwidth at low cost. What we're really going to be leveraging is its global coverage and the ability to put that demand, in the same patterns as the customers’ usage requires. So, we feel like we can do better, and that we've got 7 other Ka-band satellites that will be launched over about the next three years. So we felt it made complete economic sense to focus on those, the mobility markets, and then bring, a new broadband mobility satellite to market following those later on at the end of the decade.\nShawn Duffy: I can hit your question on the cash, on the balance sheet. So I think a couple of things. One, just one -- given the credit markets, want to stay in a very good liquid position and keep that liquidity and agility on the balance sheet. I think if you think about the net carry given the investments we've been able to make and net of the tax impacts of the interest expense. And the benefits we get there, it's not as painful to carry that flexibility. And so, that's kind of, a guidepost for us right now.\nOperator: Next up, we'll hear from Mike Crawford, B. Riley Securities.\nMike Crawford: In commercial networks, you have this Cisco settlement off of the sold jury award that you won against Acacia when its cofounder install some coding structure and email that to their employees. But so now you've got two settlements, but also there's this ongoing licensing and royalty requirement that I guess is going to improve ongoing commercial network EBITDA. Is there any way you can quantify what that might be or how long that might last?\nShawn Duffy: Yes, Mike. We do have some ongoing benefits from the agreement, but the terms of the agreement are confidential. So we can't really give you the details there. We have included the benefits we expect in the outlook though.\nMike Crawford: Thank you, Shawn. And then, regarding, the status of, I guess, the ViaSat-3, F2 and F3 satellites. So is there you're waiting to attach the final reflector component? Like, how is there a way you can quantify the timing some of these steps so we know when potentially that could be at launch, let's say, if you got it all clear to move ahead say, next week?\nMark Dankberg: The schedule for integration of the reflector once it's delivered to Boeing is pretty clear. That's the thing that we're going to get more information on next week is what that lead time will be for the reflector delivery. We have a, I think we have a very good understanding of what step in the deployment process, failed, and how to avoid that, on the next deployment. And then, there's a there's potentially even additional measures that we could use to back those up. That's what we'll find out, and we'll have that discussion. I think it'd be better to get the data before we speculate. The Flight 3 has been on the same schedule for quite a long time. I think since the last time we reported, we executed a launch contract and that's for the Q4, which was really driven by launch vehicle availability launch window availability. So that one, I think, that one, we're pretty confident in. Then the issue will just be, if it turns out that the two satellites end up being very close together, to figure out how to prioritize or the extent to which we could do them both at the same time if that was the case.\nMike Crawford: And then just maybe two really quick ones. You mentioned Space Force mobility services. Is that something that's new and is that something that would be show up in government systems or satellite services?\nMark Dankberg: That would show up in government systems and it's, yes. It is new. It's new for us, and it's, a little bit unique to our networking services, more of networking technology and our services, both.\nMike Crawford: And then the last one, just, did I hear correctly that the IP from ViaSat-4, even though it was supposed to give you some kind of sevenfold increase in capacity versus say a ViaSat-3, there's no way to put any of those innovations in any of these next 7 Ka-band satellites that are launching, but it would, first we would see what would be in the mobility satellite after that, is that what I heard?\nMark Dankberg: Yes. So, I mean, the seven satellites that are under construction are all in very, well, at least the ViaSat-3and the GX10s are pretty close to completion. The GX7, 8, 9 are also already they're well underway. So, they don't go, those techniques will go into the next generation broadband one. And the main thing that we're really focused on is getting very large field of view in this dynamic beam hopping and improving not just the raw capacity, but the capacity that we deliver overlaid on top of the demand distributions that we're seeing in these mobility markets, which are we spent, some time discussing on our shareholder presentation in September, but those, being able to match those patterns is really, really valuable. And so that I think we think that's a better metric for value creation.\nOperator: Next up, we have a question from Ric Prentiss, Raymond James.\nRic Prentiss: First, appreciate the guidance kind of clarity helping us understand growth rates, but also dollars that really helped us. So there's a lot of moving pieces here obviously. One question on Guru, I think I heard you say that the fiscal '24 revenue guidance would exclude let me just ask the question this way. Does the revenue guidance include or exclude the litigation and the revenue?\nMark Dankberg: Go ahead, Shawn.\nShawn Duffy: Yes. That excludes the non-recurring part of that, Rick.\nMark Dankberg: The growth percentage.\nShawn Duffy: Yes.\nGuru Gowrappan: And the range and the growth percentage.\nShawn Duffy: Yes. That excludes the effect of the nonrecurring litigation. Yes, I was going to say, Ric, and just one thing to clarify, in the dollars, only include 10 months of Inmarsat.\nRic Prentiss: Whereas the percentage are apples to apples, 12 month, 12 month?\nShawn Duffy: For a trend, yes.\nRic Prentiss: Right, exactly. Okay, good. Yes, because in the shareholder letter, I picked up that the EBITDA was excluding the litigation and so the revenues excluded us. On growth in fiscal '25, is there any way to tease out kind of a zip code? Are we talking low-single-digit, mid-single-digit, high-single-digit teams? What should we think about, what does grow revenue and EBITDA in fiscal 2025 mean? And that would be, I think, a 12-month over 12-month comparison also?\nMark Dankberg: Yes, Ric, we are not commenting on that at this point. I think we are looking at next quarter. I think next quarter will give you more clarity. It'll be closer. We'll be closer to it and we'll be on a given better range.\nRic Prentiss: That helps a lot. And then piggybacking on first question a little bit there, I mean for a long time, heck even when I was in the industry, I used to think of satellite, the best use of bandwidth, the best staying for your buck was to go after these better margin areas, we call it the game, government, aviation, maritime and enterprise. As you think about how you're running the business. Is there a different way than just lumping a lot of stuff into satellite services that might be more informed to help us understand the businesses or how you manage the business both in financials and on metrics, because it does feel to me like the government, aviation, maritime, and enterprise are probably the better segments to go after, but it's hard from the outside really modeling it and understanding it.\nMark Dankberg: Yes. So, I think, Rich, if I'm understanding your question, it's just how are we thinking about things looking forward with this segment. And I think one thing, you can see the service growth in our government business, so, I do think you get some insights there. But I think the way that, we look at the business going forward. I think that's something we're going to continue to think about as the business evolves.\nRic Prentiss: And last one from me is. As we think about the zip code thought, fiscal 2016 seems a long way away and appreciate the thought of what happens from fiscal '24 to '25 on CapEx. We get the question a lot about what is maintenance CapEx versus kind of the growth CapEx as you put satellites up there. So anyway you can kind of help us start thinking about what an ongoing maintenance level is for the business and then also, what '26 directionally might be in total CapEx?\nShawn Duffy: Ric, I think the best way to think about that is just what we've talked about is as we get the satellites into service. We're going to continue to see the CapEx tick downward. And so, that's what we would back from '25 to '26 as well. Our maintenance CapEx or I should maybe a better way to say it is, our satellite CapEx is the dominant part of our capital spend. And so as we finish off on those fleets, that's how you're driving that efficiency downward going forward.\nMark Dankberg: I can add a little bit. The maintenance CapEx, think about that. The dominant factor is the per capita subscriber bandwidth consumption, net of ARPU gains. So that is most evident in the consumer markets. In these mobility markets, it's still present and things like when you think of, in flight connectivity and passenger video consumption, you'll see some of those same effects, but not to the same extent that you'll see them in residential. So, those are part and if you look at kind of our history, having been in the satellite services business for over 10 years. One of the things we we've been able to do is still get greater productivity out of our satellites largely from migrating a lot of the bandwidth from mobility, from residential to mobility. And then the other thing that we've done in general really well is improve the yield of the satellite. That is the gigabits per megabyte investment in the satellites or the satellite utility by better matching supply and demand. So you have to kind of look at all those factors to end up teasing out maintenance CapEx from growth CapEx, but we've been able to drive growth from our CapEx, I think to a pretty high degree, and I think we'll do even better, on a go forward basis with the emphasis on mobility.\nGuru Gowrappan: Yes. I think one other point I would add, Ric is, if you look at what I mentioned on CapEx, you said FY24, 1.7 billion and the range for '25, 1.4 to 1.5. And then as you know, big set number of satellites are getting done in the next few years as you heard from Mark. So we do expect FY26 to come down as we launch these satellites so from a broader guidance perspective.\nMark Dankberg: I mean on an absolute dollar perspective.\nGuru Gowrappan: Yes.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And we look forward to the Investor Day coming up at March as well?\nMark Dankberg: Yes. We will.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Quilty, Quilty Space.\nChris Quilty: Investor Day in Carlsbad or New York?\nMark Dankberg: New York.\nChris Quilty: Okay. Carlsbad is nicer, but New York is easier to get to. Question for you, the number of aircraft net adds looked a little light in the quarter. Is that primarily just seasonal or timing? And can you give us the thought of kind of what to expect on a go forward net add rate, either in the back half of the year or going into next year? And then a broader question on the IFC, just what's the general pipeline looking like now in terms of aircraft or airlines that are new to IFC still coming on board. Is it a strong pipeline? Has there been weakness because of interest rates or fuel prices or just general temperament of the market?\nMark Dankberg: Okay. On the first part, I'd say there are two, I mean, if you just look from a macro perspective, there have been two kind of drags on installs, from the airline's perspective. One is the delivery rates of new aircraft, which have been kind of behind schedule from both of the major OEMs. And we've done well on new lines fit contracts. And so the line fit, the line fit, which is driven by aircraft deliveries, that's lower than lower. I mean, if you just look at the OEM's delivery issues and that you can kind of gauge how that would be allocated among the different airlines, some of whom are big customers of ours. And the other one has been, just the fill factor on existing flights, which has kind of, still sort of discourage the airlines from we're slowed down some of the retrofits on the existing fleet. And I think there's some of that is seasonal. So on the one hand, when Shawn mentioned seasonality before for the invite space, if that part's good for us because, more passengers and it's driven more demand, and it's been good for revenue, but it has slowed down installs a little bit. The backlog's still, really strong. And we'd say that the pipeline of new airlines is good. I think that the kind of way to put it is that the U.S. market has been probably the most forward leaning on in flight connectivity. I think that it's also becoming clear that there's monetization strategies, right. That it's not just, and it doesn't have to be just an expense for the airlines. And so that is really drawing in a lot of interest from airlines that maybe were on the sidelines before. And if they can both get the amenity and figure out how to better monetize it. That's a good combination. And I think that is spreading more globally.\nChris Quilty: Clarification, the CapEx guidance for next year, did you say the 1.4 to 1.5 includes a possible provision for an I6 replacement?\nMark Dankberg: Yes, that's correct.\nChris Quilty: And timing wise, I guess, you've got two modern L-band satellites, the I6F1 and the Alpha Bus, The I4s or 17 years old. If you get an order in next year on that satellite, we're looking at three years. Does that leave enough time wise coverage on the L-band capacity given the age of the legacy satellites?\nMark Dankberg: Yes.\nChris Quilty: Running good on fuel?\nMark Dankberg: Yes. And you know we also have, besides, I mean, besides the existing fleet, we also remarks had, I think, right around the time of the acquisition, announced a fleet of 3I8 satellites that'll be arriving kind of in that same time frame, maybe a little bit earlier.\nChris Quilty: And how much capacity would those have because those are small GEOs?\nMark Dankberg: We're having good reporting the capacity on the L-band satellites. But the thing that we are focused on is, when we talk about next generation L-band, the big thing is increasing the capacity of those satellites dramatically. The I8s were really aimed at extending the existing safety, basically, the safety and emergency services. And so that's good, I think, in terms of, shoring up the existing fleet. But part of our CapEx budget on a go forward basis and part of what we're talking about in ecosystem building is to really modernize that whole fleet. And we'll talk about that separately when we're ready.\nChris Quilty: And final question, I mean, as you're moving away from the I4 and -- sorry ViaSat-4 and the sort of massive capacity toward satellites that are more agile mobility capable. Does that mean it's more likely that you'll buy something off-the-shelf from Thales Alenia Space or Airbus that have Software defined satellites that they've already fielded or is it something that you're likely to do internally because of some design capability that you have internally?\nMark Dankberg: At the time that we do it, we will definitely look at what's available off-the-shelf for sure. But we haven't seen so far or we haven't been seeing things off-the-shelf that have the capability of the technology that we're doing on ViaSat-3 or we're doing on 4. So we're going to do a comparison. One of the things we also will be able to do by holding off a few years is we do we will be able to do some risk reduction. But when I say risk reduction, schedule risk as well as budget risk, reduction. So we intended to go a lot better in terms of scheduling budget, on the following ones. And then also, there's some really interesting technologies that we can test, that that can also reduce cost and improve productivity. So those are the things that we're looking at, but there's some -- so far, on ViaSat-3 absent that anomaly, everything's worked well. And four was just an enhance the app, so that technology, that's something that we can draw on, if things play out the way we expect.\nChris Quilty: Currently, did you say whether the EMEA satellite was going to Americas and the Pacific Bird to EMEA, or have you decided that yet?\nMark Dankberg: Yes. We have options on both, and, yes, we're really focused on meeting the needs of our mobility customers, and that's how we're going to prioritize them.\nOperator: Edison Yu from Deutsche Bank has the next question.\nEdison Yu: First, as you kind of peel away at Inmarsat, do you have any updated thoughts maybe on the various pieces that may not be strategically important, especially on the l band side, now just curious, any thoughts there?\nMark Dankberg: No. I mean, we are really we are very interested in the L-band. I think that Inmarsat has applied L-band into some variety of very different market, so there's U.S. defense, there's international government applications, there's really interesting voice and data applications, and there'll be safety ones. What we see is, if our long-term objective really is to grow with the direct to device market and the IoT market. And when I say IoT, it's really going to be the shared terrestrial and mobile, these devices that can operate off both terrestrial and mobile. We're aiming to, to be able to bring some of those to market soon, and then, we do think that the things that we do to the satellites to enable that and really, kind of boost the existing mobile satellite services market substantially. So we're really interested in the services. Oh, the whole range of services that Inmarsat performance now. We think that's a good foundation, for somebody who wants to go in you know, for anybody who wants to go into these, kind of direct to device markets.\nEdison Yu: Understand. And you mentioned, D2D, and I think you've kind of alluded to some potential, paths into, getting in there. Do we have any kind of updated thoughts about D2D going forward, maybe on the using that extra L-band?\nMark Dankberg: Not yet. We're work we are working on some, and I expect that we'll have more to talk about next quarter, but we're not going to say more about it today.\nEdison Yu: Got it. And then just one last one on IFC. So, I think there were some announcements from one of Inmarsat's customers, Qatar Airways and Starlink. And there was a little bit confusion, I think, at least from our end or on the public end. Can you maybe just go over exactly what kind of happened there with Starlink, is it, did they, like, ship that over or what exactly is going on?\nMark Dankberg: Well, I think, probably best to ask them. I don't think we want to speak. We don't want to speak for them on this.\nOperator: Next question comes from Louie DiPalma, William Blair.\nLouie DiPalma: What percentage of revenue will the residential fixed broadband be by the end of fiscal 2024 as it seems that you're deemphasizing it?\nShawn Duffy: So, I think what we've talked about in past, is that part of our business with the combined with Emerson and so forth is less than 15%, and as we continue to prioritize our bandwidth and work with our supporting the growth in our IFC business. You'd expect that to continue to go downward.\nLouie DiPalma: Have you disclosed who the third ViaSat-3 launch contract is with? And also for that, launch, I think you said in the fourth calendar quarter of 2024. Have you been able to procure insurance for that launch?\nMark Dankberg: On the launch provider, we will put out a press release. I mean, generally, we want to cooperate with the launch providers. Just to make sure that they approve the release, for it. So we'll do that, in the near future on the insurance.\nShawn Duffy: Yes, I can jump in there. So, on the second satellite that insurance is already done, just as a reminder, Louie. And we're starting to work on the next one. And I think that that's kind of in process, but we're good to have the second one all wrapped up.\nMark Dankberg: And then just to add on to that. I mean, the insurance, the insurers tend to be very detail oriented. So, the review that we're going to have next week with the antenna manufacturer even though it's a different satellite, that's a different antenna manufacturer for Flight 3 than Flight 2, insurers tend to be -- they're really interested in the details, and so I think that having those details available will help them understand and what happened and it'll help us with that place in the insurance.\nLouie DiPalma: And as it relates to the fiscal '25 CapEx guidance, is it a good estimate to assume that the I6 replacement satellite would cost around $400 million. So if you don't, I'd like to go ahead with that that you could just subtract it from the 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion number of and what could be your CapEx for fiscal '25?\nMark Dankberg: No. For fiscal '25, what was in the budget would be the portion of replacing that mission that would have been spent in that fiscal year.\nLouie DiPalma: Okay. Do you have an estimate on what that would be?\nMark Dankberg: No. We're not going to do that yet. We are evaluating multiple options, and we're aiming to simplify it. So, again, we're not -- we are going to make sure that we make the right decision. We're not ready yet. And so, it just would be premature to give us to give a dollar value for that.\nLouie DiPalma: Okay. And one final one. As it relates to, direct to device, it seems that Inmarsat was previously partnering with Skylo and they've established chip partnerships with Samsung's Chip Arm and MediaTek. Have you continued those partnerships such that you would in effect be the direct to device partner for Skylo's in the future initiatives?\nMark Dankberg: Yes. I mean, I think you're going to see kind of ecosystems evolve around the direct to device. And they're going to include the device makers and chip makers, spectrum holders, satellite operators, and others. And the ones that you described are all attractive, members of those ecosystems. And I think, as we've mentioned before, we think Inmarsat got a really interesting role to play, especially in, their same role to play, especially in there will be different generations of standards. The current one, which is the narrowband IoT, next you know, non terrestrial network. I think you'll see those come to market soon, like, within quarters. And yes, there's definitely a role for us to play there.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And I'll hand the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nMark Dankberg: Okay. So, thanks everybody for joining us this afternoon. Just want to remind you of a few important takeaways from the quarter. We felt the results were really good, generated 16% year-over-year revenue growth and 20% year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth on like for like basis. We're doing well on the Inmarsat integration program. We're kind of ahead of schedule and had a budget so far. We've got a -- we think we have a clear and good value proposition on global mobility that's built on meaningful and granular service level commitments even in the most challenging places and times. That's resonated with customers, especially in the very competitive U.S. in flight market, and we think the same kinds of analytics insights and bringing confidence to global markets in aviation, maritime and government, we think that's going to work for us. We're confident our business will continue to grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year '24 and '25. We'll give more additional guidance on that, next quarter for FY25. And we're aiming to become free cash flow positive in the first half of calendar year '25. I've taken a lot of the steps that we think we're going to need get there, and we think we'll get meaningful and sustainable free cash flow during fiscal '26. So with that, I look forward to updating you all, on our continued progress next quarter. And I'll hand it back to the operator now.\nOperator: Thank you. And once again, everyone that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."

You may proceed, Mr. Dankberg.\nMark Dankberg: Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for joining us for our call today. With me, Guru Graben, our President, Shawn Duffy, our Chief Financial Officer; and Robert Blair, our General Counsel. So before we start, Robert will give a safe harbor disclosure.\nRobert Blair: Thanks, Mark. As you know, this discussion will contain forward-looking statements. This is a reminder that factors could cause actual results to differ materially. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in our SEC filings, including our most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Copies are available from the SEC or from our website. Back to you, Mark.\nMark Dankberg: Okay. Thanks. So we encourage everybody to read the shareholder letter that we posted on our website earlier this afternoon. It will have a lot more detail. We'll give an overview of the main points upfront, and then we'll have out plenty of time for questions. So the first quarter results were very good. The Inmarsat acquisition closed in May and contributed one month to our first quarter results. Year-over-year consolidated continuing revenue grew 36% to $780 million and adjusted EBITDA grew 87% to $183 million, with good performance across the business. Viasat's standalone revenues grew 12% and adjusted EBITDA grew 13% year-over-year. New awards and backlog were good, and momentum has continued into the second quarter, especially in connectivity. On a go-forward basis, we'll refer to consolidated and segment results for the combined company and adjust for continuing operations that is appropriate. Post-merger, we're starting with a stronger-than-anticipated balance sheet and even stronger than what we expected when we closed the [indiscernible] back in January. And we're making good progress on the integration and are on track to achieve our overall synergy goals and aiming to improve on those. Also, I'd like to mention that Andrew Sukawaty, who is formulary Inmarsat's Chairman, and Rajeev Suri, who is the Inmarsat's CEO, joined the Viasat Board of Directors, and we're looking forward to their contributions. So I'll start with a little more color on the ViaSat-3 Americas situation and our response. Then Shawn and Guru will add some color on financial results, operations and our outlook, and then we'll go to the questions. So last month, we reported an anomaly with a deployable antenna on ViaSat-3 Flight 1. Since then, we've been working with the antenna supplier and the satellite manufacturer to more fully assess situation for the first flight and the implications for Flight 2. I'll discuss contingency plans in a minute. But given those plans, I wanted to point out that we do not currently anticipate that fiscal year 2024 financial results will be significantly affected by Flight 1 performance. FY 2025 will be affected by the performance of Fight 1 and the timing of the corrective actions on Flight 2. But given current information, we believe we will continue to grow in fiscal year '25 as well, but not to the same extent we would have without the anomaly. While we're making steady progress, we expect that analyses that are underway to provide more definitive insight and we'll provide updates when we have more information, which we currently estimate will be when we report earnings next quarter. So I'll give some additional color on the background of the antenna. Manufacturer is a major aerospace supplier for the decade allowing successful space deployments. The antennas from a product line with a history of 100% successful deployments on a number of missions, including 5 on Inmarsat satellites. The F-1 antenna was both partially and fully deployed with nominal results several times during manufacturing and testing. The Flight 2 satellite uses the same antenna, but the Flight 3 uses a completely different design from a different manufacturer, and that satellite is unaffected by the flight on anomaly. Via-1 satellite is insured and insurance is already placed on Flight 2. Inmarsat's heads, prior stand-alone outlook had no dependents on BiSat-3, of course, and we still do expect to capture revenue synergies with the ViaSat-3 fleet. So we've got 4 main work streams underway. One is to work with the antenna manufacturer and our satellite supplier to determine the root cause of the reflector anomaly and the appropriate corrective actions for Flight 2. We have a plan to collect additional data and incorporate that into the deployment fault analysis. We also expect to have more information to report regarding corrective actions from Flight 2 and an update on schedule next quarter. Second is to assess the performance of the satellite with the antenna as it is, initial end-to-end measurements with the effective antenna indicates the rest of the satellite including the innovative payload and ground infrastructure built by ViaSat are operating as expected or better. We have a plan for additional measurements that we expect will give us more definitive data on the throughput of the satellite, including the effects of the anomaly. and the potential operational mitigations and we're targeting to drive an act on that next quarter also. Third is to assess the potential of improving the antenna deployment on Flight 1. The outcome of this will depend on the results of the first 2 work streams. And again, we expect to provide an update next quarter. And then fourth is to mitigate the effects of the Flight 1 anomaly on our global mobility business, especially via optimizations of our existing fleet, optionality in the near and longer-term orbital locations of each of the ViaSat-3 satellites and additional third-party capacity as required. These plans are already well underway, and we're confident we can continue to support our global mobility customers as we do today and going forward. U.S. fixed broadband today represents about 13% of revenue that business will be the ones primarily affected by the anomaly. We'll be better able to assess that impact next quarter also. Importantly, for ViaSat-3 Flight 2 and Flight 3, our tests and measurements to date and increased confidence to those parts of the ViaSat-3 system that are where the new innovations are. Long schedule of Flight III is unaffected, and we'll provide an update on Slide 2, inclusive of corrected actions, as I mentioned, next quarter. The Inmarsat acquisition expands our inomed Ka-band fleet to a total of 13 Ka-band satellites, including Fight 1 and an i6 Fight 2 satellite, which was launched earlier this year and is undergoing corporate rating. We made more Ka-band satellites under construction with 5 of those planned for launch before the end of calendar year '25. So we have a greater diversity of on-orbit technologies. And as we've previously discussed, an opportunity to substantially improve the capacity of our on-orbit fleet via ground network technology and optimizations. That was of our objectives with the acquisition, and we believe will show the benefits associated with that through our resilience and growth in both the near and long-term time frames. So with that, Shawn will go into some of the financial.\nShawn Duffy: Thanks Mark. Some brief color on the financials. Q1 revenue was $780 million. This was up 36% compared to the revenue from continuing operations of $575 million in Q1 of FY 2023. The results include Inmarsat's one-month revenue contribution from the acquisition date of approximately $134 million. We estimate that the combined Viasat and Inmarsat revenue for the quarter, including the pre-acquisition period, would have been about $1.046 billion, an increase of about 11% year-over-year as both companies achieved double-digit revenue growth. Net loss totaled $77 million for the Q1, above the $40 million net loss in the year-ago period, due primarily to the non-recurring acquisition-related expenses, higher intangible amortization and higher interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $183 million, an increase of 87% year-over-year from continuing operations. Q1 FY 2024 adjusted EBITDA included a one-month impact from Inmarsat of approximately $72 million. We estimate that the combined Viasat and Inmarsat adjusted EBITDA for the full quarter, including the pre-acquisition period, would have been approximately $331 million, an increase of about 9% year-over-year. So, a little more color on Inmarsat. For the June quarter, we estimate revenues around $400 million and adjusted EBITDA about $220 million, about a third of which is included in our consolidated results for the quarter. Inmarsat revenue mix for the 12 months ended March 31 was 36% from government customers, 34% in maritime, 22% business in commercial aviation and 8% enterprise and other. That's a high-quality diverse revenue base, which fits well with Viasat business and our growth objectives in the mobility and government markets. Inmarsat's contribution has and continue -- will continue to be folded into our existing segments as follows. Government results will be included in our Government Systems segment and will be the individual largest revenue component in that segment, led by recurring Inmarsat Government services revenue. Inmarsat Maritime, Aviation and Enterprise revenues will be included in our Satellite Services segment. And as a result, mobility revenues will make up a strong majority of that segment's performance. And our Commercial Networks segment will be focused on equipment sales as it is today, with no meaningful contribution from Inmarsat. And you can find more complete review of our results in the shareholder letter we posted today. We ended the quarter with over $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments. We expect to maintain additional liquidity for our client, given tight credit markets, our mature schedule, the low rates on our outstanding debt and higher rates of return on the cash we hold in order to preserve the company's financial flexibility. And we expect growth and the realization of synergies will improve our cash flow from operations over time. And on last item. The debt we issued related to the financing of our Inmarsat transaction, approximately $1.35 billion is currently held by the issuing bank. We'll provide marketing support for them when and if they choose to go to market. But as a reminder, the interest rates on the debt are already set based on the original financing commitments from 2021 and will not be impacted by the transaction. So, with that, I'll pass to you Guru.\nGuru Gowrappan: Great. Thanks Shawn. I will cover three key topics; one, double click on overall operational performance; two, talk about our new combined company and exciting possibilities it opens up for us; and three, combined outlook. Now, as you just heard from Shawn, financial results in Q1 were excellent with healthy year-over-year growth across the businesses. Government Systems had another quarter of strong demand for our information assurance products, especially including our high-speed data center order in. And during the quarter, we earned an additional Type-1 certification for our next-generation ground to space intrusion product. During the quarter, we signed AUD187 million contract with Southern Positioning Augmentation Network to support improved satellite-based positioning and accuracy. And in Satellite Services, US fixed broadband revenue declined due to fewer residential subscribers, partially offset by higher ARPU as we continue to reallocate bandwidth to rapid IFC growth and update to new service plans. In Commercial, IFC and service aircraft grew 18% year-on-year on a combined basis to 3,230 aircraft. Passenger usage also increased driving of revenue per aircraft. And our quarter end, contracted backlog in commercial IFC stands at approximately 1,600 aircraft. Momentum has continued at a pace to-date in Q2, including additional new airlines and additional aircraft for existing customers. Inmarsat had achieved 11% growth year-on-year growth in clean express levels. We're excited about having greater diversity and scale market outlets in global mobile broadband. In this quarter, we announced Fleet Reach coastal LTE service, which is designed to augment uninterrupted high-speed broadband to merchant, offshore, energy, and fishing customers when sailing near the coast or docked in port. Commercial IFC equipment deliveries continued to be a strength this quarter and are reported in our commercial segment. Terminal deliveries are a good leading indicator of commercial IFC service growth and support our FY 2024 and FY 2025 outlooks. So, overall, this was an excellent quarter with the closing of the acquisition, strong financial performance, and an important step forward. Now, to the combined company. I would like to start by reminding everyone why we are so excited about the possibilities open to us as a combined company, and then I'll provide an update on where we are with the integration. Let's review why this transaction is so compelling strategically. first, it accelerates our global mobility and government strategy. This strategy is focused on the best and fastest-growing markets, including aviation, mobility services, maritime, land mobile, and enterprise. Second, Inmarsat brings global Ka- and L-band coverage with a robust satellite launch roadmap that both augments coverage and add resilience and redundancy. We are excited by future upside from valuable L-band spectrum assets, including the IoT and direct-to-device opportunities. Third, Inmarsat's well-established business greatly enhances our global distribution. The combined company has a large installed base of existing customers across a broader portfolio of markets and products that will provide greater overall resilience to our financial performance. This is also a compelling financial combination. We both have strong businesses today, but together, we are enhancing our future free cash flow that's supported by an estimated $1.5 billion in synergies on a post-tax and PV basis. Now we intend to be aggressive considering all options open to us as we build the business that focuses on markets where we can win and scale cost effectively. In terms of revenue, we are already seeing revenue synergies take from across key business units such as government, aviation and maritime. In terms of cost efficiencies, we are focused on achieving and accelerating our targeted cost synergies. In FY 2025, we expect to achieve about half of the forecasted $80 million in annual cost synergies. CapEx synergies remain a key lever for value creation as well. We are targeting $110 million annually a few years out. Now behind the actual numbers, we are integrating capabilities with an eye to being the best of the best from the perspectives of people, business processes and our partner and supplier ecosystem. I should add here that, culturally, we have already seen the two companies are a great fit, and that's very important. We recently formalized our go-forward leadership team. It's focused on scale, capturing the benefits of our technology and furthering enhancing the measurable value we deliver for our customers. We are committed to delivering a successfully integrated operating model while continuing to maintain momentum and delivering value to our customers and shareholders, and we are excited by the many opportunities ahead. We think it is important to spend this time to communicate how we view the significance of this combination and how that informs our diligent approach to integration Now moving to combined outlook. I'll wrap up with a high-level summary of our financial outlook. There is more on this in the shareholder letter as well. For FY 2024, we expect revenue growth in the high single-digit percentages for the combined companies relative to pro forma view of both for FY 2023. A simple view of expected FY 2024 adjusted EBITDA can be approximated by adding Viasat's stand-alone prior expectations of high single-digit to low double-digit growth for full year FY 2024 adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations to approximately 10 months of Inmarsat contributions, which we expect will grow slightly throughout the fiscal year. We expect growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA for FY 2025, including assuming a full year contribution from Inmarsat for FY 2024. Our expectations are supported by our healthy backlog and strong orders. We do anticipate that FY 2025 growth rate will be affected by the ViaSat-3 F1 anomaly, especially by the fixed broadband business, where growth will be delayed. But that's currently about 13% of our revenue, and we anticipate growth in rest of the business as it is not directly affected, and that is 87% of our business. Our positive free cash flow inflection point is targeted to occur in the second half of calendar 2021. Lastly, our plan is to hold an Investor Day before the end of our fiscal year, so we can share more details of our plans with you. So there you have it. We had a strong operational performance in Q1. We are on track to deliver very material synergy value, and we expect the combined company to grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA in FY 2024 and FY 2025 while creating a powerful global mobility and government leader.\nMark Dankberg: Good. Thanks. So with that, we'll be happy to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Simon Flannery, Morgan Stanley.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you very much. Thanks for all of the information. It sounds like you haven't yet determined whether the flight 1 is a total loss or not. Maybe we can just assume if the worst happens, what would be the timing of collecting the $420 million, what's the hurdles you have to go through to get that? And what would your mitigation strategy be? I think you've talked before about perhaps repositioning two and what about ordering an F4 satellite, how much would that cost? What sort of time frame would you put around that?\nShawn Duffy: Hey, Simon, this is Shawn. I can take your first question on the insurance. I mean, clearly, we're still -- it's really, really early in the process. We had a lot of success in our -- in the timing of our prior collections. -- . But I think that it's hard to speculate when know what happened right now. But I think that we things are early in the process to make infatuation around timing.\nSimon Flannery: And was that about 18 months, something like that before? .\nShawn Duffy: It was -- yeah, I think it was a little shorter of that, to be honest. It was a little inside of -- around the 12-ish mark.\nSimon Flannery: Okay.\nMark Dankberg: And then in terms of some of the other questions that you asked, the -- we don't want to put out any assessments or statements of what we think the capacity will or won't be including going down to zero without having more facts. And I think we have -- we do have plans that cover all of the things that you asked, but obviously, what we would do for a as an example, what we'll do for a replacement satellite depends a lot on what the performance of this one is. And we expect to be able to take measurements on that. We as I mentioned, we have been able to get end-to-end measurements through the satellite. So that that's where we're starting from is to quantify those. I don't really want to speculate, but we do have plans that range from what we would do if we got very little or no capacity to what we would do if it turns out to be more closer to what we originally expected. And I think we won't -- so some of those -- to the extent that some of the plans involve forks in the road, we're not going to go through fork-in-the road without having the data that's supporting.\nSimon Flannery: Understood. And you've already called out the impact on the consumer broadband business. What happens to the IFC business? Sounds like that's still growing rapidly. Are you going to have to work with the airlines to mitigate some of the -- their demand as to bring the planes on, do you think you can handle the backlog as it comes on without the new satellite?\nMark Dankberg: So we can handle the backlog, at least for some period of time, but we can handle all the backlog that we have. Not all of it depends on this particular satellite. But the main thing we've been doing to handle our backlog so far is transferring business, transferring bandwidth from the fixed applications to be to the mobility business. So we have that going forward. And we also mentioned we have a -- we have a lot more additional maneuvering room using some of the Inmarsat, we have the potential to relocate satellite. We're -- but we're not going to make premature judgments on what we need to do, until we get the data that supports it. And we're -- that will be completely fine for our mobility businesses actually for an indefinite period. But certainly, through the period of time, it will take us to figure that out.\nSimon Flannery: Great. Thank you, Mark.\nMark Dankberg: Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Next up will be from Mike Crawford, B. Riley Securities.\nMike Crawford: Thank you. If the ViaSat-3 Americas point one is the total loss, isn't it likely that the satellite that you've been expecting to put up over Europe that it would make most time supported over North America first, until you could get another satellite up and then you can move that satellite over to its European or EMEA slot?\nMark Dankberg: Okay. Yeah. Yes, that is a possibility. I think that from our perspective, we will move satellites in a way that gives us the best shot at serving our customers, all of our customers' demands. So we have the flexibility to do that. It's it would be premature to jump to an operational scenario that assumes that the satellite has no utility. The -- what we are trying to do is we're trying to work through the financial scenarios that take that into account. But that's different than what the operational scenarios would be, because we have more time to work on those. And so we'll get the data for it. And then we'll make decisions.\nMike Crawford: Okay. One just maybe one more on that front, if you don't mind, so the APAC satellites configure differently with a different antenna. So pretty much that 1 I would imagine is going up over APAC regardless. And then, you've also been developing your ViaSat-4 payload. So wouldn't it make sense to maybe take some of those features to have like a ViaSat 3.1 come up over Americas eventually after the Flight 2, and Flight 3 satellites?\nMark Dankberg: Yeah. Okay. So just to be clear, any of the satellites can operate effectively in any of the locations. So that does give us more flexibility. There was -- there is the additional operational flexibility that's built into the Flight 3 satellite. That works in Asia Pacific, but it also works in other areas. But I don't want to imply that we've made any decisions on that, because we want to get the data before we make the decisions. On the ViaSat-4, there are some -- there are some significant improvements there that we could use as the foundation for a replacement satellite. But again, what we do there will depend on what we measure and analyze in the near-term. And I think that's the main thing I would encourage investors to think through is that we're going to make a sound methodical decision with real data. We'll be able to get the data and it will be a lot more, clear. And I know everybody wants to know quickly that knowing there's no consequences to us taking another couple of three months to get good measurement and then making those decisions.\nMike Crawford: Okay. Thank you. That makes sense. And then just a completely unrelated quick question. With that $4.8 billion of unwanted IDIQ that's not in your government systems backlog, I know where in the past, you've had a single award contract, you've been able to realize most of that. But is there -- can you break down how much of that might be single award versus multi-award where you're competing against others?\nMark Dankberg: No. There's a diversity of Syntel [ph]. I don't maybe we might get back to you a little bit more of a split there. But you're right about that is that some of those IDIQ contracts, a fair number of them are for -- they're a broad range of services, but they're pretty well-contemplated services or products that we would -- that are unique. Others are more or like for the broad agency announcement there are multiple bidders and the allocation of the words are less certain. But I don't think it -- I don't think we can give you a good breakdown of that right now on this call.\nMike Crawford: Okay. Well, thank you Mark.\nMark Dankberg: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Quilty, Quilty Space [ph].\nChris Quilty: Great. So the guy from copy space is going to go against form. I actually got a question about the government business, which is, I mean, good numbers here on the quarter and good order flow. Just at the high level, as you look out over the next 12 months in that business line, what are the things that you think of as the worry case of continuing resolution to upside scenarios that overall, when we think about the outlook there?\nMark Dankberg: Boy, it's hard to tie to some of these macro trends. We will know more by -- there's generally a lot of activity right around the end of the government fiscal year. So that will give us more insight. But some of the things that we're doing for instance, one of the growth areas that we highlighted this quarter. And it came up better than we expected was for high speed data center crypto appliances. And there, one of the things you can look at is just how much interest there is in AI and big data processing, and for government applications, if that occurs in classified levels, of course, that's going to drive some -- drive the demand for the types of products that we provide. And so some of those things besides just the way the budget is determined -- one of the factors will be how our customers decide to use their budget. And in things like these information assurance appliances, we have a lot more maneuver, right? I mean, because they can make decisions. The other thing is that we do have a lot -- this is part of what we're aiming for, a lot more of our government revenues and recurring services revenue. And those are much more predictable than individual contracts as timing might be affected by some of the budget realities. And that was one of our objectives as we like those types of revenues, which can change over several years, but our last subject to some of these kind of more short-term budget nuances. That question thing you were asking about.\nChris Quilty: Yeah. And just a quick follow-on to that. Have you now identified what sort of synergies you see between the Inmarsat government side and on the ViaSat? .\nMark Dankberg: Yeah, I'd say we -- because of the nature of some of the contracts we have, it takes a little while for us to get the details across there. But we're getting more and more exposure to that. And obviously, there's a bunch of similar -- there's a -- we have similar applications for similar but different customers and opportunities to extend things like geographic coverage areas or types of services or technology equipment across those customer bases. Those are the things we're looking at. I don't think we have -- and we have identified these revenue synergy opportunities in the government area as well as in the aviation area and starting to in the maritime area. But it's -- we're not going to give any specifics yet. I think we'll be able to comment more on specific values in the next couple of quarters or so. .\nChris Quilty: Got you. And if I can totally switch gears, the IFC business, you've had tons of customer wins both domestically here, some big international deals, some of which I'm assuming we're predicated on capacity that those customers were expecting. Are there any new customers Southwest is a big win. I don't know how far they are in that process that you're feeling pushback from those customers around how you're going to transition and provide the capacity needed .\nMark Dankberg: So the approach that we've been taking in the aviation business, which has been very successful for us is to provide very specific service level agreements that are end-to-end for their route system. So when we take on new customers, we look at their playing fleet, their routes, -- we look at the airports that they're serving, and we show them, here's the service level agreement that we can deliver. And here's why, how we know we can deliver that. And so we're going through the -- I think that kind of what is happening is we're going through all of those details again with our customers in light of the ViaSat-3 scenario. And there the -- yes, their initial question is, okay, can you still serve the planes that we have in the routes that we have going forward? And -- so far, that's gone, I'd say, quite well because we do have the resources to deal with the customers that we have. We may have, in some cases, we may end up with slightly different or somewhat different service level agreements for some routes or some portions of some routes. And those were going through with specific customers. But overall, I'd say that the qualitative reception has been really good because it's based on the approach that we've used. They understand the benefit of having the larger fleet -- and then the other thing that we did kind of mention is going into the second quarter, a large amount of which is since we did disclose the anomaly on ViaSat-1 our order book has still been really good. And that order flow includes both new airlines in different geographic regions as well as existing airlines. -- placing orders for new aircraft as well. And the large majority, I think of it as -- if you think about it as a different businesses, the Biosense business, the legacy Viasat portion was heavily North American oriented, and we have plenty of resources to serve that. We've been able to demonstrate that to customers, whether they're new line-fit aircraft or retrofits. And then on the Inmarsat order book tended to be more international, but none of their service level of premiums dependent on ViaSat-3. And so both of those are still proceeding. .\nChris Quilty: So if the -- it's pretty clear given where most of your customers' orders are that the next new capacity has to go to North America. Whether that's the next ViaSat-3 months or I think it's the GX7, the next Inmarsat. But short of that, I mean, it's the best case scenario a year or depending on the strategy, three years if you build something new, would you -- if you have to burn down and you've been burning down a lot of the consumer subs, do you hit a point where at a year to two years out, it's just not worth trying to scale in that business?\nMark Dankberg : No. The short answer to that is no. Remember the things that we've been emphasizing and I think at our airline customers do understand more than, I mean, to a great extent because they're so logistics focused. What really matters is not just the amount of band we have about where we have it. And so those -- that's what we're doing is we're able -- we are we have the route map. Of course, we take into account that the routes aren't 100% deterministic, they take different routes depending on whether the schedule issues at times. So what we build a demand map from that and then when we work on supply and for supply, we -- one of the good things, if think of it as this way, is that if you -- if the real problem is reinforcing the areas with the highest demand, then when we add multiple satellites across the fleet that gives us a lot of maneuvering room for reinforcing the high demand areas. What we are doing, and we had already -- and we mentioned this before, we'd already done partly because the were concerns about additional schedule delays is we do have agreements with partner operators to reinforce both North America, in some of the ocean crossing routes and in the other high-demand areas. So we already had some of those agreements, we'll probably execute those, and then we have our other tools. And I wouldn't one thing I wouldn't tell you is what we're talking about financially, what's our outlook without one, it's not the same, the same. We won't have pipeline. So I think, again, the fact that we can communicate through it is hopeful, but I don't want to take any assertions about what capacity will be until we get more hard data. We'll be able to do that in November. .\nChris Quilty: Got you. On that note, I guess maybe I say my condolences, it just sucks. You guys have worked hard at this, been innovative and to have that kind of binary outcome on a component just it sucks.\nMark Dankberg: Thanks. Appreciate that. But we're working through it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ric Prentiss, Raymond James.\nRic Prentiss: Yes. Good afternoon, everybody.\nGuru Gowrappan: Hi, Ric.\nShawn Duffy: Hi, Ric.\nRic Prentiss: Obviously, it's been a busy earnings day, earnings season. It seems like we've at the year on this last week. A couple of questions, if I could. Obviously, I'll echo Chris' comments, but maybe not use some four later words, but just say clearly disappointing the anomaly -- perhaps you're working through it. I might have missed this, but did you talk about the review process of what this doing to Flight 2 time frame. I would assume -- you want to make sure everything is good. But when should we expect Flight 2 would be going up?\nMark Dankberg: Yes. So one of the work streams that I did mention is we are really the antenna manufacturer is the most knowledgeable. They are the ones that are leading the root cause analysis. We're participating in the spacecraft manufacturers participating. So we are still connecting and analyzing data to get to root cause. We think we will have more insight into the corrective actions based on our root cause analysis, probably by next quarter. Those corrective actions will -- that's what will determine help us determine when the launch date is for the next satellite. And it's good -- again, we shouldn't speculate on what they will be, but I'm sure you can imagine that the corrective actions can range from benign to more complex. And there's no basis to choose one -- any one time frame or another without the data from the root cause analysis, which is -- it's underway. There's a schedule for and we'll be able to report more about the time frame of a Fight 2 launch next quarter. It was pretty close to being able to launch when we had this antenna anomaly. So that's probably the corrective actions for the antenna will be -- the manufacturer determining when the new launch date is.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And I remember or maybe remind us previously, the path to positive free cash flow was going to be certain was it six months after Flight 2 was up, or what was kind of the previous thought of when free cash flow positive was going to be?\nShawn Duffy: Hi, Ric. This is Shawn. So I think what we had earlier was kind of in that spring early 2025. So we're still shooting to be in 2025, but probably in the back half.\nRic Prentiss: Right. Okay. And excuse me, if you've already provided, but did you provide some CapEx guidance? I know you had Viasat was separate. You had Inmarsat, you had to bring them altogether. You had to figure out what the arrangements were going to be. But how should we think about CapEx over the next -- this fiscal year and next fiscal year, at least?\nShawn Duffy: So on the CapEx side, I think, first, yes, we have only one month this quarter, you need to think about having a full set of three months for Inmarsat for the rest of each of the quarters of this year. So probably a good way to think about the rest of this year is it's $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion to kind of close out for both companies for the next kind of nine months. And then if you think about next year, I would say, we could see that coming down a bit year-over-year relative to this year.\nRic Prentiss: Okay. And obviously, one of the big events in our universe was the DISH buying EchoStar. A couple of questions there. Is that an asset you would have been interested in or were shown. And part of what they talked to on the DISH EchoStar call was the excitement about both direct-to-device but also private 5G network. So if you could maybe expand on that.\nMark Dankberg: I'm going to pass on the first question about acquiring I think right. Yes. On the -- so on the direct-to-device part, we have talked about that. We do -- we are optimistic about that. We are -- we're working it from a number of different perspectives, including how we evolve the business from using L-band for specialized satellite devices. And we don't think that goes away. But what do we need to do to our systems to really make the direct-to-device business scale. We think that's -- it's both an interesting technical problem and one that we think we're really well suited to deal with. And then the other implication, the other thing that I think people should keep in mind is in order to be able to close good to provide good service to off-the-shelf cell phones or smart watches or the type of devices that people are putting in that direct-to-device category you feel need a lot more throughput -- effective throughput from the satellites, which will also greatly, we think, enhance the demand for from more specialized mobile satellite services because we'll be able to deliver a lot higher speeds and more bandwidth into still very small terminals, but with antennas that are still -- I mean you look at a normal satphone, that's not a big device, but the antenna -- the satellite antenna on that device can be as much as five to 10 times better than a conventional cell phone. So that creates opportunities. And what we're looking to do as this direct-to-device business matures, we want to be able to still use the space system assets we have and all the capital we invest didn't monetize that to these other markets that we're really familiar with. So yes, the short answer is we think it's a really big opportunity. I think -- I mean you get into the details. And we do think it's going to play out over several years. But we think the end state is really, really attractive, and we think that the both assets resources, technology we have will help us be successful there. And I also don't think -- I mean, personally, I know people want to always position these things as sort of winner take all. I think that in order for the business to really be scalable there's going to be an opportunity for certain types of standards that will -- I think operators that can work within those standards deliver space systems that work well with them, ground technology that uses them. I think all that stuff will play into it being a big sector, not just a win for one individual operator. .\nRic Prentiss: Okay. Makes sense. We'll stay tuned. Everyone stay well.\nMark Dankberg: Thank you, Rick.\nOperator: We'll go to Ryan Koontz, Needham & Company.\nRyan Koontz: Thanks. I wanted to ask about the core maritime business at Inmarsat. And obviously that's been long time legacy strength of their and ask about the competitive environment, if that's changing at all. It seems to me there's, lower barriers to entry from the LEOs and Starlink. I hear about some progress from them in the maritime area. So any insights you can share in that space would be great. Appreciate it.\nMark Dankberg: Yes. So I think the maritime space is changing. I think a lot of that is because the entry barriers are low. The thing -- and this is actually a big part of what we're tooling across the mobility businesses as part of what we think makes the mobility business is interesting is, if you look at it from the perspective of where geographically, where is the demand? And then, what type of service are different segments of the maritime market looking for. That's where the opportunity is by because the big issue is we have spoken over and over on the in-flight space.\nRyan Koontz: Yeah.\nMark Dankberg: The real problem for airlines, especially, these are enterprise users who need to provide a predictable level of service. The big problem is not connecting an individual plan in play it's providing a predictable level of service in the places where the airlines congregate, which is a specialty hubs right? So the airport hubs. So what we are seeing in the maritime space is unsurprisingly congestion in major ports or the places where people are trying, these LEO systems especially early on. And a lot of that things like leisure, leisure boats where you're dealing with an individual that may use a ship sporadically or occasionally and where connectivity is nice to have, but it's not operationally important to the mission of those ships. So that -- those areas are the areas where ships are looking for end-to-end service level agreements at a predictable level and where you're already seeing congestion on some of these -- on the LEO systems. There's a real opportunity for us to both improve our services and to make them more enduring. And that's where we're focused. So it's a different segment of the Maritime business that meanwhile.\nRyan Koontz: Definitely helpful. Thanks Mark.\nMark Dankberg: Inmarsat has maritime customers across multiple segments. That's a segment that really has been the one that they've grown on the most. And I think that's the one -- we have the best opportunity to show what we can do.\nRyan Koontz: Got it. Thank you.\nMark Dankberg: Thanks Ryan.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Louie DiPalma, William Blair.\nLouie DiPalma: Mark, Chris and Shawn and Peter, good afternoon.\nMark Dankberg: Hi Louie.\nShawn Duffy: Good afternoon Louie.\nGuru Gowrappan: Hi Louie.\nLouie DiPalma: On the government defense side, there's been a lot of publicity regarding how the Ukraine war and geopolitical tension in Asia has triggered a robust demand for Starlink as a backup or even a primary source of defense connectivity. Has the Ukraine war also led to a surge in demand for Inmarsat's Ka-band services?\nMark Dankberg: I think, unlike other. I don't think we're going to go into great depth about what we're doing in specific defense communications. I can you don't -- you just read the newspapers and one of the things you can see is that, there is concern of multiple fronts about being overly dependent on single sources of connectivity for various reasons. And so I think a number of satellite operators are seeing demand different operators are somewhat uniquely positioned to serve different elements of that demand. So you could put us in that.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And along different lines. Mark, Legato was recently in the news regarding potential restructuring. Can you discuss the status of your and Inmarsat's relationship with Ligado. And is there the potential that Ligado could begin again making large payments to Inmarsat?\nMark Dankberg: Okay. So ViaSat and Inmarsat, each had a relationship with Ligado for quite a while, but in different domains. The Inmarsat relationship was really around the spectrum. And our relationship has been more around operational performance using their satellite. And I think what we're trying to do is bring those two things together. It's really going to be up to Ligado to determine how they want to proceed. I mean, not on their own, but we're discussing -- we're in discussions with legato about how best to proceed on both of those fronts. It's -- some of that depends on decisions that Ligado makes as well as choices that we did. So it's a little early to tell -- they've expressed -- I think one of the things that Ligado has expressed is interest in the long-term satellite business more than they have in the past. And so that's a basis for the further discussions. But -- it's just too early for us to comment on what the outcome of those discussions.\nGuru Gowrappan: The one piece, Mark, to add it, Louie this is Guru. I would say, we have excluded Ligado from our financial models. So repayments or return spectrum would be an upside. So we've not included that in our models.\nMark Dankberg: Yes. Thank you so much. That's been our position all along since we announced the acquisition. Thanks.\nLouie DiPalma: Great. And one final one for Mark, what is the process to make existing Viasat in-flight connectivity systems for your like North American airline customers interoperable with the Inmarsat network that also has coverage over North America.\nMark Dankberg: Okay. So it's a little bit of a nuanced problem. Either -- so think of it as one of the ways to start with and we can build on this is that -- so we can support both either network pretty straightforwardly. So, think of it as the -- there's a little bit of a nuance part of our fleet, and it becomes a little more -- it's a little bit of a newer part of our fleet. But basically, that we can make -- and you've seen this, for instance, with Inmarsat, where Inmarsat has used third-party satellites, we use third-party satellites. And what that speaks to is just the ability to adapt the networks to other satellites for some of the specific satellites, but not all. It's a little more complicated to do both networks at the same time in exactly the same place. But not, but there's a lot of places where we can do that as well. So, think of -- I mean, the simplest way to think about it is that the -- because they're not on the -- other than one special case. They're not really onboard process satellites. -- satellites are just repeaters. So, there is, from a basic interoperability perspective, we can run our network and Inmarsat can run their network over third-party satellites, including each other's or including different parts of each other's as we need to. The last piece is to be able to do to do much exact use both of them at exactly the same place at exactly the same time. And while we can do that, some cases, not -- that's the best pieces. Does that get to what you're asking about? Is that covers .\nLouie DiPalma: Yes. For your existing North American customers such as JetBlue, United, American Airlines, Delta, you've discussed how you need to add a certain amount of capacity to make up for the loss of ViaSat-3. And I was wondering if the Inmarsat capacity over North America can be 1 of those sources of capacity. And -- like for the aircraft that are being line set now, like -- have you already done the work to make the antenna like interoperable with both networks?\nMark Dankberg: Yes. So, there are a couple of nuances that apply to specific airplanes, something depending on the age of those airplanes, not so much the airline of the equipment that's on the airplane. So, there are -- what I'm going to strive isn't true across the board, but it's largely true. And it's especially more true for the newer equipment that we're deploying and the newer satellites that -- but yes, the short answer is we already have -- it's already in our capacity centered over the Americas that covers North and South America and the oceans to the east and west. And then think of it as going back to the answer that I gave on the floor to Chris Quilty, when we want to add airplanes to our service or our customers want to improve the service level agreement to our service. It doesn't mean that we need bandwidth everywhere, we need it in the places where we can forecast what the demand would be. And so we can drop on the inward SaaS fleet to solve a lot of that problem for us.\nLouis DiPalma,: Excellent. That makes sense. Yeah, that's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks, Mark, and Guru, Sean and Peter, take care. And good luck with the ViaSat-3 investigation.\nMark Dankberg: Thank you. I appreciate that. We'll give an update on that next quarter.\nOperator: That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to hand the call back to Mr. Mark Dankberg for any additional or closing remarks.\nMark Dankberg: Okay, good. Thanks. So again, thanks again for joining us this afternoon. I would like to leave you with three important takeaways. So one, we had a really good first quarter, strong financial performance, lot of that is based on the specific businesses that we're in and the backlog that we had, we expect to continue to grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA for this year and next year, even if we made a very conservative assumption about no contribution from ViaSat-1. It's not the same, just to be clear, that's not the same as a prediction about ViaSat-351. That's not the same as a prediction of what the ViaSat-351 will do. And then we do have a great long-term opportunity to create a lot of value. We can build on market-leading positions in these growing global mobility and government services markets for both broadband and the mobile device market. We've got material synergy opportunities that we're executing on, and we like building a diverse, resilient financial profile, and it does bring strong cash flow potential with it. So with that, we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. And I'll hand it back to the operator. Thanks.\nOperator: Once again, everyone, that does conclude today's conference. We would like to thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect."
