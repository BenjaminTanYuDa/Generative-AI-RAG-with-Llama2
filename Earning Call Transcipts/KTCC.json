        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Key Tronic's Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brett Larsen. Please go ahead.\nBrett Larsen: Good afternoon, everyone. I am Brett Larsen, Chief Financial Officer of Key Tronic. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today for our investor conference call. Joining me here in our Spokane Valley headquarters is Craig Gates, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tony Voorhees, our Vice President of Finance and Corporate Controller. As always, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we might make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the company's future financial performance. Please remember that such statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. For more information, you may review the risk factors outlined in the documents the company has filed with the SEC, specifically our latest 10-K, quarterly 10-Qs and 8-Ks. Please note that on this call, we will discuss historical financial and other statistical information regarding our business and operations. Some of this information is included in today's press release, and a recorded version of this call will be available on our website. Today, we released our results for the three months ended December 30, 2023. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we reported total revenues of $154.4 million, up 18% from $123.7 million in the same period of fiscal 2023. Revenue growth for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was driven by increased production at our U.S.-based and Vietnam-based facilities, as well as by the sale of approximately $8.1 million of inventory from a discontinued program. For the first six months of fiscal 2024, total revenue was $293.2 million, up 12% from $261 million in the same period of fiscal 2023. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, our gross margin was 8.1%, and our operating margin was 2.7%, compared to gross margin of 7.2%, and an operating margin of 2.9% in the same period of fiscal 2023. The increase in gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 reflects a favorable product mix for the quarter and improved operating efficiencies. In recent periods, our improved production efficiencies, strategic labor cost reductions, and the gradual stabilization in its supply chain have been largely offset by the strengthening of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar and increasing labor costs in Mexico and in the U.S. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, net income was $1.1 million, or roughly $0.10 per share, compared to $1 million, or $0.09 per share, for the same period of fiscal 2023. For the first six months of fiscal 2024, net income was $1.4 million, or $0.13 per share, compared to $2.1 million, or $0.20 per share, for the same period of fiscal 2023. As we've discussed, our profitability in the fiscal 2024 continues to be negatively impacted by increased labor costs in both the U.S. and Mexico and by higher interest rates on our line of credit. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter of fiscal 2024 by reducing inventory and contract assets, which are finished products, by approximately $48.3 million, or roughly 24% from the same time a year ago. These improvements in inventory levels primarily reflect increased component availability and our concerted efforts to drive inventory reductions. Total inventory turns increased to 3.8 times in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, up from 2.6 turns a year ago. We are pleased to see our inventory levels continue to become more in-line with our current revenue. At the same time, the state of the worldwide supply chain still requires that we drive demand for parts differently than in historical periods. Our customers have revamped their forecasting methodologies, and we have significantly modified and improved our material resource planning algorithms. As a result, we should be better equipped for future disruptions in the supply chain, even as we continue to manage inventory more cost effectively. During the second quarter, we also reduced our accounts payable, leasing obligations, and overall debt by a combined amount of $51 million from a year ago. At the same time, accounts receivable DSOs was at 85 days compared to 78 days a year ago, which we believe reflects some increased delays in collections from certain customers, despite continuing improvement of most customers with respect to disruptions from supply chain issues. Total capital expenditures were about $2.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024, and we expect total CapEx for the year to be around $8 million. While we're keeping a careful eye on capital expenditures, we plan to continue to invest selectively in our production equipment, SMT equipment, and plastic molding capabilities, utilize leasing facilities as well as make efficiency improvements to prepare for growth and add capacity, particularly in our U.S. and Vietnam locations. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we're seeing steady demand for most established programs relative to our second quarter. As previously announced, the large program with a leading power equipment company is now expected to resume materially in fiscal 2025 with a redesigned product. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect to report revenue in the range of $135 million to $145 million. While new programs continue to ramp in our Mexico facilities, efficiency improvements, a muted rebound to pre-COVID production levels amongst existing Mexico customers, and a continued pressure of a strengthened peso have combined to create an excess of overhead in our Juarez facilities. After careful consideration and analysis, we expect to incur a severance expense of approximately $1 million to $2.5 million from headcount reductions in our Mexico-based operations. These severance expenses are unfortunate, but a clear requirement. Among other considerations, the payback period for this decision is expected to be under a half of a year. Taking all these factors into consideration, we expect net income in the range of break-even to $0.15 per diluted share. In the second half of calendar 2024, we expect continued sales growth in the U.S. and Vietnam, and we have a strong pipeline of potential new business. Over the longer term, we believe that we are increasingly well-positioned to win new programs and to continue to profitably expand our business. That's it for me. Craig?\nCraig Gates: Okay. Thanks, Brett. During the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we continue to ramp many new programs produced in our U.S. and Vietnam facilities, and we remain profitable. We're also pleased to see improvements in our operating efficiencies, inventory levels, and other improvements made on the balance sheet. Moving into the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we continue to see the favorable trend of contract manufacturing returning to North America. As a result, we continue to expand our customer base and won new programs involving security products, medical devices, and military aerospace. Global logistics problems and China-U.S. geopolitical tensions continue to drive OEMs to examine their traditional outsourcing strategies. We believe these customers increasingly realize they have become overly dependent on their China-based contract manufacturers for not only product, but also for design and logistic services. Over time, the decision to onshore or near-shore production is becoming more widely accepted as a smart long-term strategy. As a result, we see opportunities for continued growth, and those opportunities are becoming more clearly defined over time. At the same time, we are seeing a sustained trend of a strong Mexican peso and continued wage increases in Mexican wages, particularly along the U.S.-Mexico border. As it has become clear that these changes in the base cost of Mexican production are longstanding, it has also become clear that customers have a different calculus for selecting a geographic location for business they are bringing back from China. For those customers who struggled with China production due to their flexibility needs, the decreasing cost differential between our U.S. and Mexico plants means they will probably choose one of our U.S. sites. There, we believe, they can enjoy the ultimate in flexibility, engineering support, and ease of communication. Meanwhile, for those customers whose requirements had adapted to the China model of limited flexibility, challenging communications, and slow-motion engineering support, our Mexico facilities remain the answer. Therefore, we are reconfiguring our Mexico sites to endeavor to be a lower-cost, high-quality, but more commodity-level service provider. Over the past 12 months, revenue from our U.S. production facilities has increased approximately 15%. In Q2 of 2024, production in the U.S. represented about 31% of our total revenue. While our Vietnam facility continues to be a modest contributor to our over-revenue at approximately 4%, production there has increased by about 29% over the past 12 months. Moreover, a growing number of potential customers are actively evaluating a migration of their China-based manufacturing to our facility in Vietnam. In the coming years, we expect our Vietnam facility to play a major role in our growth. While China growth has slowed and many companies have decided to take risk mitigation steps with their China manufacturers, the fact remains that many components must be sourced from China. Our procurement group in Shanghai, which serves the entire corporation, remains important for managing the China component supply chain on an ongoing basis. The combination of our global footprint and our expansive design capabilities is proving to be extremely effective in capturing new business. Many of our large and medium-sized manufacturing program wins are predicated on Keytronic's deep and broad design services. And, once we have completed a design and ramped it into production, we believe our knowledge of a program's specific design challenges makes that business extremely sticky. We also invested in vertical integration and manufacturing process knowledge, including a wide range of plastic molding, injection, blow, gas assist, multi-shot, as well as PCB assembly, metal forming, painting and coating, complex high-volume automated assembly, and the design, construction, and operation of complicated test equipment. This expertise may set us apart from our competitors of a similar size. As a result, a customer looking to leave their contract manufacturer will find a one-stop shop in Keytronic, which is expected to make the transition to our facilities much less risky than cobbling together a group of providers, each limited to a portion of the value chain. In fact, most of the new customers we have onboarded take advantage of the one-stop shop capabilities we provide.  We believe global logistics problems, China-U.S. political tensions, and heightened concerns about supply chains will continue to drive the favorable trend of contract manufacturing returning to North America, as well as to our expanding Vietnam facilities. We continue to see improvement across the metrics associated with business development, including a significant increase in the number of active quotes with reflective customers.   We move into the second half fiscal 2024 with a strong pipeline of potential new business. While we're seeing some improvement in our gross margin, recent wage increases, higher interest rates, and a strong peso will dampen our growth and profitability in the near term. Moreover, we will continue to rebalance our manufacturing across our facilities in Mexico, the U.S., and Vietnam. We remain very encouraged by our progress and potential for growth over the long term. In preparation for our future, we recently announced our leadership succession plan beginning June 30. I am very pleased that our board of directors named Brett to succeed me as president and chief executive officer. I expect to remain a member of the board. We are most fortunate that Brett joined Keytronic in 2004 and has served as our executive vice president of administration, chief financial officer, and treasurer since 2015. He has assumed ever-increasing roles and responsibilities over the past 20 years. Brett and I have worked very closely, and he has been a critical member of the management team formulating and executing our strategies over the years. In addition, Tony will be promoted to executive vice president of administration, chief financial officer, and treasurer. Tony has served in various financial management roles with us since 2010 and has worked closely with Brett for many years. I am confident Brett, Tony, and their outstanding team will continue to take Keytronic to new heights. This concludes the formal portion of our presentation. Brett, Tony, and I will now be pleased to answer your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bill Dezellem with Tieton Capital. Please go ahead.\nBill Dezellem: Thank you. First of all, congratulations to all three of you for retiring and promotions. So let's start with my normal first question. Would you discuss each of the three program wins in terms of size and then any interesting details around them, please?\nCraig Gates: Yes, the security products are between $10 and $20 million a year and that's with an existing customer. The medical devices are around, I don't know, $2 to $5. And military aerospace is around $3 to $10. So the medical devices and the military are both new customers.\nBill Dezellem: So many military and or aerospace products have very high level of qualifications that are required. Sometimes we wonder if it's to the point of excess and then next thing you know, a door blows off a plane and maybe it's not to excess. So my question is, did you go through, did you go through the process of getting the equipment and then getting some higher level of qualification than would be normal for, well, a security product or HVAC product or anything of those nature?\nCraig Gates: Yes.\nBill Dezellem: And would you like to expand on that further?\nCraig Gates: Okay. There are two aspects of that. One is we were concerned since this was, I guess, really our first significant military aerospace program in quite some time that the contractual requirements would be so far out of line that we could never reach a common ground with the customer. And that turned out to be unfounded. So even though we started a long way apart, it seems like that we're going to be able to make that work as far as a contractual relationship goes. Then as far as the actual manufacturing capabilities and qualification capabilities and in fact, in this case, specialized manufacturing equipment, we did go through a significant qualification period and analysis by our new customer to determine if indeed we could get there. And then some of that is going to continue to serve us well with other perspectives of military customers and aerospace customers.\nBill Dezellem: And Craig, is this a customer that is of a size that would give you the opportunity for a significant amount of business over the coming years if this program is successful?\nCraig Gates: Yes. It's one of the big guys.\nBill Dezellem: Great. Thank you. And then I believe on the last conference call, there was a fair amount of uncertainty that you interjected into what you were seeing in the macro environment and with your customers, many or I shouldn't say many, some of which that you said you were seeing a pullback in demand. At that point, I believe you said it was nothing that you were panicking over, but directionally the arrow was pointed the wrong way. This quarter, did we hear correctly that demand is stable? And so you would have a different perspective now than you did then? And I'm hoping you'll talk around those various points, please.\nCraig Gates: Okay. This quarter, we would say that the demand has stabilized. There are still ups and downs, but there's not a consistent down. We're still confused about the directions of the economy overall. Our customers are still confused. There has been, I think part of why we say our arrow is horizontal rather than down or up is that a couple of the larger customers had been tightening up inventory as they feared an oncoming recession or as they burnt off some COVID-driven inventory. And now that seems to have gotten behind them and us, and so they are increasing their orders again. But saying that, one of those customers, one division has hacked their forecast almost to a third of what it was while the other three divisions are increasing their forecast. So it's not a, I don't think we're at a time right now where we can say it's stabilized. It's just that right now the puts and takes are about balancing out. There's a lot of, go ahead...\nBill Dezellem: After you, please.\nCraig Gates: There's a lot of data that says that even though unemployment looks good, the actual job market is quite a bit tighter than what we've gotten used to post-COVID. There's a lot of data that people, everybody was, the great retirement, the great separation. That data has switched to people are staying in their jobs. The data that says that people, even though they don't like it, are coming back to the office would seem to contradict the data that says unemployment is very low. Wage increases seem to have taken a pause over the last quarter and a half. So it's very hard for us to say we have a handle on what's going to happen next.\nBill Dezellem: An those wage pauses, I presume you're referring to the US and that is not talking to Mexico, correct?\nCraig Gates: Correct.\nBill Dezellem: So let's use that as a segue to Mexico. Would you please expand on what you are doing in Mexico in the near term with the restructuring and then longer term how you are thinking about it? I'm really looking for more detail than you had in your opening remarks, please.\nCraig Gates: Okay. So, boy, Bill, I worked long and hard on those two paragraphs. I hope they were self-explanatory.\nBill Dezellem: They actually were and they actually created a whole bunch more questions.\nCraig Gates: Okay. Why don't you ask me a few of those questions and maybe we'll kick off that way.\nBill Dezellem: All right. So what was the trigger point that made you decide now is the time as opposed to six months from now or waiting longer to make the decision?\nCraig Gates: We started trying to look at all of the quotes we were seeing and really, really dig hard into where we are coming out on just pure cost versus our competitors. It's always a mix of service level, trust in the company, personal interrelationships, and everything else that goes into a win or a loss on a bid. But we decided it was time with the increasing wages and pesos that we needed to take a hard look at just separating that one component of a decision, which is price. And after we did that, dug into it hard, we started looking at that in relation to the choices people were making on where they wanted their product to go. And it's kind of an interesting thing. It's a split between the products that didn't ever really belong in China. And before COVID, we had a hard time and we did it. We grew the company doing it, but we had a hard time selling against the downsides or the upsides of China with the downsides of China. And now that people are paying more attention to the downside, they're willing to pay more to avoid those downsides. So a product that shouldn't have been in China because it was either an immature product or it was impossible to forecast the demand well or say changes in style required instantaneous changes in production, even though it went to China, it still had all those disadvantages. And when the company, the customer made the decision to come back, when there isn't that massive delta between Mexico and the states, those customers who really wanted all of that extra service are willing to pay for that service out of the states. And that's why we see the growth in our U.S. sites. And it's not only customers that went to China and then came back. It's customers who would have gone to China and are now happy that they don't have to. When I say they are happy, it's the folks that have to deal with the day-to-day business of getting product made and getting it to where it needs to be to get sold on time. So that, I guess, hurdle has increased to the point where we used to see new business opportunities for the U.S. sites that were in the one that was in the $3 million range. And anybody with a bigger volume than that, and I know volume isn't the same as revenue, but let's just say that as it is now. So those smaller programs were making it into our U.S. sites, but the bigger ones we were competing for out of our Mexico site only. And in the last year, we've seen a shift in that hurdle to where people are now wanting to put $10 million programs, $15 million programs into our sites in the states because they recognize the value of the service level that the states can provide at a price that is no longer so much higher than Mexico. On the other hand, that means that the hurdle rate to stay in Mexico has gotten higher and therefore the people who want to stay in China -- I meant to say Mexico, the people who want to stay in Mexico are willing to deal with the type of service they got used to out of China. So they're not willing to pay for the extra services that we had put in place in Mexico over time. And to make that clear, for example, if you're a customer and you call us up and say, hey, I know I had 10,000 widgets that I wanted next month. I need them next week. And the way we would make that happen is through a lot of people in the salary ranks who would hustle around and get parts across the border quickly and get lines changed over and monitor the switch and we would move employees and train employees and all that would happen and the customer would be happy, but it costs more. And now those customers who need that type of service are willing to pay U.S. prices. That leaves the folks who aren't willing to pay for those prices with our Mexico facility competing against other commodity type service levels out of Mexico. So that means we can take a lot of this added service cost out of our Mexico facility without harming the customers who were willing to pay for it before because they're not there anymore. They've migrated. Does that make sense?\nBill Dezellem: I believe it does make sense. Let me try to play that back to make sure that I'm hearing it correctly. Which is customers that are willing to pay or who demand a higher level of service are willing to pay the extra price for the U.S. The customers who want the lowest price, they're going to Vietnam, which you had built Mexico on a higher service model, higher service, lower cost, but not the lowest cost, and that really has left Mexico in a no man's land and therefore now you're needing to make an adjustment and it sounds like, if I'm hearing correctly, you are taking the extra cost that went along with the higher level of service out of the Mexican cost structure and will allow you to run the big programs and less changeovers taking place because those changeovers will probably be in the U.S. or the super low cost in Vietnam. Am I hearing that somewhat close?\nCraig Gates: Yes.\nBill Dezellem: I guess that leads to two additional questions and my apologies for dominating here so long. First of all, does that put Mexico in a strange place for now given that it's two-thirds of your revenue and yet a little bit of no man's land and then secondarily, how quickly do you foresee Vietnam filling up and I guess thirdly coming back to Mexico, would you anticipate that the changes that you are making with this restructuring will then accelerate growth in Mexico so that you otherwise wouldn't have been able to win because you just weren't positioned correctly?\nCraig Gates: The third question is the most important and that is exactly what we expect. We have already seen that as we've been pricing as if we had the new model completely put in place, which we will by the time these programs actually hit. That's the main impetus for doing this is that we have to have Juarez able to compete on a commodity basis. That doesn't mean that they won't be able to provide the extra services that some customers will want, but that will be on an optional pay by the time you use it rather than baked into the basic cost structure of Juarez. It's a switch from we're standing there ready and we'll do it for free to we can do it if it's important enough that you want to pay for it. That comes down to a split in the customers of people who make the decision and people who have to live with it. Typically the guy that makes the decision is mainly focused on price only and the folks that have to live with the decision are focused on the service level that they can get. As the makeup of the customers coming back from China has changed over the years, or as I should say, the makeup of the people that are interested in Mexico has changed over the years, the person making the decision that's interested only in price has got the louder voice, whereas in the past it was more of a shared decision. Because the people that are coming out of China have a sticker shock when they're ordered to move and they have to come to Mexico and our price and anybody else's price is more than China. They don't like it. Trying to sell a baked in service level that's better than China to the person who's only evaluated on price is an uphill battle. It didn't used to be as much as it is now. That's why we're making the change. I don't think it's going to drive any change in the attractiveness of Vietnam or the United States. I don't think the two are that much interconnected because they pretty much stand on their own right.\nBill Dezellem: Craig, does this put you in the enviable position where the upfront decision maker, you can win them because you have a lower price and then when the operator is basically being told you need to get something done and your job's on the line if you're not able to accomplish it, they can come to you and you'll have the ability and they say I don't care what it costs, loosely speaking, and you're able to charge for that. You win on both sides.\nCraig Gates: That's certainly the intent.\nBill Dezellem: One additional question and I'll step back in queue. Do you see a place for an additional facility or an additional geography within Mexico or somewhere else near and I'm thinking inland where the and when I say inland I mean non-border where the labor costs are lower and yet you can still have the relative nearness of Mexico or do you believe what you're doing here accomplishes all that you need from a geographic dispersion?\nCraig Gates: Well, any time over the last 20 years we've kept an eye out on opportunities deeper within Mexico and we continue to see after much analysis and hand wringing that the delta in direct labor wages that you receive by going deeper inland as you say to Mexico is mainly offset by the increase in salaries you have to pay to get people who want to work in salaried positions deeper into Mexico and then you have the further offsetting disadvantage of shipping time and the further offsetting disadvantage of getting engineers across the border and eight hours into Mexico. So as of right now we are staying pat on our ORES hand but that could change at any time as various factors that we don't control change. So we're prepared to change our decision but right now after looking at it pretty hard it appears that ORES is the right answer for us.\nBill Dezellem: Understood. I told you that would be my last question. I am going to renege on that and say relative to the restructuring that you're doing is this primarily the labor that you're laying off hourly labor or primarily salaried labor? \nCraig Gates: Well, here's a quiz. Which do you think it is?\nBill Dezellem: I would guess it would be more salaried labor is just how I'm thinking about what I thought I heard you say.\nCraig Gates: Perfect. That's exactly right. We are communicating.\nBill Dezellem: So if you are laying off that salaried workforce, essentially the fixed cost or some portion of the fixed cost there, when a customer who historically been able to say to you, gosh, I really need this quickly, how do you respond since it was in part because of those salaried people, I suspect some of them that will no longer be with you were making that happen?\nCraig Gates: So we're not laying them all off. We're laying quite a few of them off and we've already seen that the customers who need that and who are willing to pay for it create much less of a workload than what we were giving away as part of the total business proposition a year ago. So we still have the capability to do it, just on a smaller scale. And that scale is smaller because customers now have to pay for it in many cases versus getting it for free previously.\nBill Dezellem: Well, congratulations on the learnings. And it sounds like this is a little bit like the difference between going to an a la carte restaurant and a buffet that we probably do all of us tend to eat a little bit more at the buffet simply because we can.\nCraig Gates: That's a true statement. Part of it is learning, but part of it is what has changed in the marketplace as people have come out of China who were there before. So it's not so much learning as it is analysis of the change and reacting to it.\nBill Dezellem: Great. Thank you. I'll step back in queue and queue back in again.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The question comes from the line of George Melas with MKH Management.\nGeorge Melas: Good afternoon, guys. That was a very interesting discussion earlier with Bill. So thank you for that. Thank you, Bill. I have some questions that are much more numbers oriented. The $8.1 million in inventory sales, was that at no gross margin?\nBrett Larsen: There was no gross margin on it, but we were able to charge a few fees for the transportation and recycling of that. So there wasn't that much dilution in the actual gross margin when you offset those two.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. Because I was trying to see that if you had no profit on those sales, your gross margin really was $8.6 instead of $8.1. So if you exclude those inventory sales, what would have been the gross margin?\nBrett Larsen: Roughly about 8.3%-8.4%. Okay. So it's a little bit more than that.\nGeorge Melas: Okay, great. Looking at the off-ex, I think USG&A expected to be sort of flattish, but it was up. Your product development is at the lowest level it's been in three years, at 1.8. Is there some chargers? Can you help explain those numbers?\nBrett Larsen: We've taken a real serious look at of course salaried positions. The other is that there have been some changes in payroll benefits that we've been able to reduce some costs there as well. I would anticipate prospectively that we will see a slight increase to our op-ex, but nothing substantial. We really have taken a sharp pencil to our operating expenses.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. So essentially you see USG&A being relatively flat and maybe product development coming up just a little bit.\nBrett Larsen: Correct.\nGeorge Melas: Now I want to try to understand the guidance including the chargers. If I look at the guidance of 0 cents to 15 cents that implies a net income of 0 to let's say 1.6. And if I add back the chargers of 1 to 2.5, I think in the midpoint I get to roughly $2.5 million in what I would call adjusted net income. And to get to $2.5 million and if you have interest expense of $3 million and the tax rate of 20%, that implies an EBIT of roughly $6 million. And then if we add back the op-ex of $8 million, that implies a gross profit of $14 million, which implies a gross margin of 10. So I'm just trying to see if I got the numbers right or maybe where I'm off.\nBrett Larsen: No, we are expecting an increase in gross margin in this quarter. One, because of the layoffs, because of the actual cost reductions that are going to transpire. So roughly, you know, we mentioned it was going to take less than a half a year, so you know roughly 60% of those costs decreases 60% of the severance is offset by payroll cost reductions in the quarter. Additionally, we expect our debt to continue to decrease as we continue to drive inventory down. My expectation is that interest won't be $3 million. It'll be something less than that for this next quarter. And again, I think your op-ex of roughly $8 million is probably a good guess.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. But then that implies a gross margin that's well north of 9%.\nBrett Larsen: That's our expectation.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. So that would be a really nice improvement compared to just more recent quarters.\nBrett Larsen: Yes, we're we've been in a situation where we make money out of America and we lose money in Mexico and then we make money in Mexico and we lose money out of America and it looks like we're heading towards a position where we're going to make money out of all the sites. So hopefully that comes to fruition and we don't get another surprise.\nGeorge Melas: Okay, great. And the Mexican peso, I mean I was just doing the math, it's up double digits, you over here. It's down just a little bit a nudge sequentially.\nBrett Larsen: We do have some hedge contracts that will help us in Q3.\nGeorge Melas: Oh, you have some hedge. Okay. Because at some point I think you had stopped hedging, right? \nBrett Larsen: Yes, we entered into some hedges a few months ago that'll take us through the March quarter.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. So maybe we're talking a little bit about your hedging philosophy. It's just so damn hard to hedge and it's expensive. How do you guys sort of think about it?\nBrett Larsen: In an ideal world...\nGeorge Melas: I'm sorry.\nBrett Larsen: No, in an ideal world with ample liquidity and we would have hedged roughly 50% of three years Mexican expenses. We're far from that. We did take advantage of a blip in the softening of the peso that occurred a few months ago. I wish we would have made more contracts but it's difficult to project the future. Yes, when we can't figure out what the economy's going to do, then we can't figure out what the Mexican peso's going to do and we can't figure out what to hedge. So we do have some hedges in place that will help us during this third quarter and we'll continue to monitor the peso to the dollar and enter into more contracts if we can.\nGeorge Melas: Okay, great. Good. And just from a customer concentration perspective on the last quarter, we talked about just one customer right now being 10% in the 10% category. Is that still pretty much the case?\nBrett Larsen: That is still correct. We have one customer above 10%.\nGeorge Melas: Okay, great. And Brett, congratulations. We're excited about your promotion and wish you all the best. Thank you. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Bob Poole with Bricoleur Capital.\nRobert Poole: Hi, guys. Congratulations. It looks like things are all arrows, maybe except for revenues here in the very near term are pointed in the right direction, which is great. And of course, I'm referring to inventories down, margins up, and pipeline up. So that's all great. And with that, Craig, I would ask you, we haven't spoken before, but I've spoken to Brett, about the timing of your retirement. You've gone through the storm and it appears that the sun is coming up and you choose that as your time to step aside. Can you talk a little bit about the timing of the transition and then, Brett, if you would care to comment at all about what, if anything, you put as priorities under your new leadership.\nCraig Gates: Okay. Well, I'm 65. I've been working since I was eight years old, started my dad's trailer court. And I've had enough. So I actually was thinking about retiring quite a bit earlier and then COVID and everything else came along and I thought I needed to stay to make sure everything was, to make sure I could feel proud of how I was leaving the thing when I did leave. So this last year has not been as much as a glide slope as I hoped it would be. But as you say, we've had a major victory in driving inventory down. I think we've had a major victory in growing our U.S. sites and even with the wage increases and peso issues in Mexico, I think we're as you say, the arrow is up there and what's going to happen there is proven by the previous big wins down there. So my timing is strictly based on the fact that I'm 65 years old. I've got two grandkids that live in town and they get old really fast. So it's time for me to quit. There's no issue with where the company's headed. I'm very confident in Brett and the team we've got put together here. And as we said, I'm going to be staying on the board so it's not like I'm not like I got beat and I'm running into the bushes in defeat. And it was nice of you to leave Brett with a six times inventory turn goal.\nBrett Larsen: Yes, it is. I'll have to remind him that that never occurred during his tenure. I would reiterate that this was a well-planned transition. It's comforting to know that Craig will remain on the board and still provide a lot of the technical support that I think he adds so much value to. I would not anticipate any real sea changes in the direction we're headed. As Craig has mentioned, we are extremely impressed with the management team at Keytronic and we've been hit with a lot of things in the market including a very strong peso, considerable amount of inflationary pressure, interest costs, but yet still we continue to drive profitability and expect that to improve. This is really a well-planned transition.\nRobert Poole: Okay that's awesome. In the last quarter, Lee, conference call, you talked about making some changes in Mexico then that potentially were going to save you $5 million a year. I was expecting to see possibly some severance type things in the quarter just reported. Was there any severance or unusual expense in the quarter just reported?\nBrett Larsen: Nothing material. I think there was a small amount of severance but not to the level that we expect in Q3.\nRobert Poole: Would it be reasonable to tie when you talk about six months and you talk about the upper end of the severance range being $2.5 million, does that tie then to the $5 million a year savings in Mexico?\nBrett Larsen: Yes, roughly does.\nRobert Poole: If the severance is smaller, does that mean the savings is smaller or is the savings the savings and it's just a question of how much severance you have to give at the end of the day? \nBrett Larsen: I think it's a combination of all those things, Bob. We're still trying to make the final determination of what positions, trying to also ascertain the pipeline and how soon new programs will be started down in Mexico. There still is some unknowns there, but severance, whatever we do, there's a return of roughly a couple of quarters. At the high level, yes, you would expect to have some $5 million of savings annually.\nRobert Poole: If George's calculations are correct and they're consistent with my back of the envelope, Craig, thanks for getting the table set for and delivering this quarter hopefully the kind of profitability that you've been saying for some time was the eye-popping profitability that was out there for you guys to achieve. It looks like you're going to maybe do it in your last quarter. Congratulations for that and have a happy retirement.\nCraig Gates: Thanks. I'll talk to you one more time. This is my penultimate.\nBrett Larsen: He's not out the door yet. I'm happy that you will get to take the victory lap for George's quarter. That'll be great. I think George may be a little bit overexcited, but I still think things are headed in the right direction. I'm happy with the way I'm leaving it. I think George's math is pretty straightforward. We're going with George. \nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Bill Dezellem with Tieton Capital.\nBill Dezellem: On the line of questioning that was just there, I would also like to say congratulations and thank you for doing something a little bit unusual, Craig, which is leaving when things are on the upswing and positioning them well and then stepping aside so often. I think that CEOs leave at the top and then have a crumble after they leave or just the opposite end of the spectrum. Well done. Coming back to the Mexico-Vietnam phenomenon or situation, do you see customers moving production from Mexico to Vietnam or the Vietnam success in the future is really going to be from new business going into that facility?\nCraig Gates: It's a little bit more of a complicated answer. Vietnam is growing, but it would be growing much faster if we had more critical mass in Vietnam. We missed out on a big deal last quarter not because the customer was unhappy with what we had, but it was the old battle we used to fight when we first started in this deal, in this business, which was, well, I don't see that you're doing $100 million here, so I don't feel comfortable putting my $20 million here. So that's part of the stumbling block in getting a new site up and running and growing the way it should be growing on paper is there's a critical mass problem. We do expect one of our larger customers to move a significant portion of their business to Vietnam and that would be the business that they serve Asia with.  We're not quite done with that discussion, but I would expect that decision to be made probably by the end of June. And that would give us what we think is a required critical mass to make Vietnam be much easier to sell rather than trying to sell it before somebody can look at it and go, oh, I'm already buying into a known thing rather than I'm taking part in a growth of something new.\nBill Dezellem: Craig, how is it that the other contract manufacturers that are starting Greenfield and Vietnam are winning business?\nCraig Gates: It seems like that would be a, boy, this massive movement of firms wanting to go to Vietnam is the common problem. So I'm not sure who's winning what in other Vietnam locations, so I can't speak to that.\nBill Dezellem: No problem. And then one point of clarification that I think is super obvious, I just want to make sure that I'm not misreading, that your guidance for this quarter of the zero cents of earnings to $0.15 of earnings includes the $1 million to $2.5 million headcount reduction severance, which at the 20% tax rate equates to $0.07 to $0.18. So the zero to $0.15 includes $0.07 to $0.18 of cost. Is that correct?\nCraig Gates: Yes.\nBill Dezellem: Okay, great. Thank you. Appreciate the time and letting me come back into queue.\nCraig Gates: Yep. And if you're wondering, if you're too polite to ask it, but if you're wondering what the hell these guys can't do and how come they can't figure out what the severance cost is, the labor law in Mexico is quite a bit more convoluted or complicated than that here in the states. So it's an iterative process on determining how many, who, and how much it'll cost. So we're not feckless. We're just working our way through a pretty complex situation.\nOperator: This concludes today's question and answer session. I will now turn the call back to Craig Gates for any additional or closing remarks.\nCraig Gates: Okay. Thank you. We appreciate your time and questions. And Brett, Tony, and I look forward to speaking to you again next quarter, for me the last time and for Tony the first time. Bye. \nOperator: Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Key Tronic First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Brett Larsen. Please go ahead.\nBrett Larsen: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I am Brett Larsen, Chief Financial Officer of Key Tronic. I would like to thank everyone for joining us today for today's conference call. Joining me here in our Spokane Valley headquarters is Craig Gates, our President and Chief Executive Officer. As always, I would like to remind you that during the course of this call, we might make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or the company's future financial performance. Please remember that such statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. For more information, you may review the risk factors outlined in the documents the company has filed with the SEC, specifically our latest 10-K, quarterly 10-Qs and 8-Ks. Please note that on this call, we will discuss historical financial and other statistical information regarding our business and operations. Some of this information is included in today's press release, and a recorded version of this call will be available on our website. Today, we released the results for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we reported revenue of approximately $147.8 million, up 8% from $137.3 million in the same period of fiscal 2023. The increase in revenue reflects the continued ramp in production for new programs, particularly those produced in our U.S. facilities. Revenue is down sequentially from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 due to the customers' redesign of a large outdoor power equipment program, but we estimate that program to come back online later in fiscal 2025. The company's gross margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 7.4%, and operating margin was 2.2% compared to a gross margin of 7.6% and an operating margin of 2.4% in the same period of fiscal 2023. The margins in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 included severance costs of about $0.6 million as we reduced our workforce by over 100 employees in Mexico and in the U.S. The workforce reduction reflects some softening demand for a number of different programs for the next few quarters in Mexico and is expected to reduce operating expenses by more than $5 million on an annualized basis. Excluding these severance costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, gross margins and operating margins would have been approximately 7.8% and 2.6%, respectively. Our recent production efficiencies, strategic labor cost reductions and the gradual stabilization in the supply chain and labor markets has been largely offset by the strengthening of the Mexican peso relative to the U.S. dollar in recent months. However, in the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we are beginning to see the peso weakened to the U.S. dollar, which may translate into improving conditions moving forward. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, net income was $0.3 million or $0.03 per share compared to $1.2 million or $0.11 per share for the same period of fiscal 2023. The year-over-year decline in earnings was primarily due to a $1.1 million increase in interest expense on higher interest rates and an unanticipated severance cost of $0.6 million or approximately $0.04 to $0.05 per diluted share. Net income continued to be adversely impacted by the strength of the Mexican peso. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended up the first quarter of fiscal 2024 with reducing inventory by approximately $43 million or roughly 25% from the same time a year ago, primarily reflecting increased shipments and a concerted effort to drive inventory reductions. Total inventory turns increased to 4x in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, up from 3.1 turns a year ago. We are pleased to see our inventory levels start to become in line with our current revenue. At the same time, the state of the worldwide supply chain still requires that we look out much further in the future than in historical periods. We are still recovering from the COVID supply chain chaos as our customers have revamped their forecasting methodologies, and we have significantly modified and improved our material resource planning algorithms. As a result, we should be better equipped for future disruptions in the supply chain even as we continue to drive inventory down. During the first quarter, we also reduced accounts payable, leasing obligations and overall debt by a combined amount of $22.7 million during the quarter. At the same time, accounts receivable remained relatively flat on increased revenues year-over-year with DSOs at 81 days, down from 91 days a year ago, which we believe reflects some improvement of certain customers with respect to disruptions from supply chain issues. Total capital expenditures were about $0.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and we expect total CapEx for the full fiscal year to be around $8 million. While we're carefully keeping an eye out on capital expenditures, we plan to continue to invest selectively in our production equipment, SMT equipment and plastic molding capabilities, utilize leasing facilities as well as make efficiency improvements to prepare for growth and add capacity. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we're seeing a continued increase in demand for programs based in our U.S. facilities and some softening of customer demand for our Mexico-based programs. As previously announced, the large program with a leading power equipment company, is now expected to resume materially in fiscal 2025 rather than 2024 with a customer redesigned product. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect to report revenue in the range of $135 million to $145 million and earnings in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 per diluted share. In the second half of fiscal 2024, we expect increased demand for our Mexico-based programs and continued growth in the U.S. and Vietnam. We also have a strong pipeline of potential new business. Over the longer term, we believe that we are increasingly well positioned to win new EMS programs and continue to profitably expand our business. That's it for me. Craig?\nCraig Gates: Thanks, Brett. During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we continue to ramp many new programs produced in our U.S. facilities and remain profitable despite a temporary softening of customer demand for our Mexico-based programs. We're also pleased to see our inventories be more in line with current revenue levels and other improvements made on the balance sheet. Over the past four years, we have seen a 9.4% CAGR of revenue, largely driven by an increase in new programs predominantly in North America. During the same four years, we have seen our total number of new customer programs grow by approximately 100% from the number in fiscal 2020, while revenues increased by 31% over the same period. This has led to less concentration in any single customer and has enabled us to be less financially dependent on any single program. During fiscal 2023, we had only one customer that represented over 10% of revenues, and they represented only 12%. Meanwhile, our U.S. sites have added over $60 million in new program wins in the past 12 months as a direct result of continued onshoring. Moving into fiscal 2024, we continue to see the favorable trend of contract manufacturing returning to North America. As a result, we continued to expand our customer base and won new programs involving security equipment, sporting goods, environmental solutions and industrial control systems. Global logistics problems and China-U.S. geopolitical tensions continue to drive OEMs to examine their traditional outsourcing strategies. We believe these customers increasingly realize that they have become overly dependent on their China-based contract manufacturers for not only product but also for design and logistics services. Over time, the decision to onshore or nearshore production is becoming more widely accepted as a smart long-term strategy. As a result, we see opportunities for continued growth. Moreover, a growing number of potential customers are actively evaluating the migration of the China-based manufacturing to our facility in Vietnam. In the coming years, we expect our Vietnam facility to play a major role in our growth. While China growth has slowed and many companies have decided to take risk mitigation steps with their China manufacturers, the fact remains that many components must be sourced from China. Our procurement group in Shanghai, which serves the entire corporation, remains important for managing the China component supply chain on an ongoing basis. The combination of our global footprint and our expansive design capabilities is proving to be extremely effective in capturing new business. Many of our large and medium-sized manufacturing program wins are predicated on Key Tronic's deep and broad design services. And once we have completed a design and ramped it into production, we believe our knowledge of a program-specific design challenges makes that business extremely sticky. We also invested in vertical integration and manufacturing process knowledge, including a wide range of plastic molding, injection below gas assist multi-shot as well as PCB assembly, metal forming, painting, and coating, complex high-volume automated assembly and the design, construction and operation of complicated test equipment. This expertise may set us apart from our competitors of a similar size. As a result, a customer looking to leave their contract manufacturer will find a one-stop shop in Key Tronic, which is expected to make the transition to our facilities much less risky than cobbling together a group of providers each limited to a portion of the value chain. In fact, most of the new customers we have onboarded take advantage of this one-stop shop capability that we provide. We believe global logistics problems, China-U.S. political tensions and heightened concerns about supply chains will continue to drive a favorable trend of contract manufacturing returning to North America as well as to our Vietnam facilities. We continue to see improvement across the metrics associated with business development, including a significant increase in the number of active quotes with prospective customers. This unprecedented increase in demand for our unique mix of skills, location and people has enabled us to negotiate more favorable pricing terms and business parameters than in the past as well as to be much more selective in the new customers we bring on. While this shift in leverage will not manifest in the short term, its effect on our long-term performance should be profound. We move into fiscal 2024 with a strong pipeline of potential new business, and we're seeing some improvement in our gross margins. Production delays and softness in demand in Q2 and higher interest rates and a strong peso will continue to dampen our growth and profitability in the near term. Nevertheless, we're very encouraged by our progress and potential for growth in fiscal 2024 and beyond. This concludes the formal portion of our presentation. Brett and I will now be pleased to answer your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bill Dezellem with Tieton Capital.\nBill Dezellem: Thank you. First of all, let's start with the normal. You had four wins. What was the size of each of them, please? And then any commentary and discussion around each of them would be appreciated.\nCraig Gates: I would say, security equipment about $12 million, sporting goods $10 million and then hopefully another $8 million, environmental solutions $4 million, industrial control systems $3 million.\nBill Dezellem: And would you kind of walk through each of those for us? And just in terms of whatever additional information you can share besides the industry that they're in.\nCraig Gates: Sure. All of them take advantage of multiple capabilities that we have, so they're not just board stuffing. All of those are actually in the U.S. sites rather than in Mexico. And three of them are return quote opportunities from a couple of years ago, which is that interesting. I'm not sure if I can draw a conclusion from that, but we call them boomerang accounts, boomerang quotes. And all of them, four out of the five are PCBs and final box builds and some mechanics along with it.\nBill Dezellem: And so talk a little bit about those. I like the term boomerang, the boomerang quotes and wins, the dynamics there. Is it your understanding they went somewhere else and another CM failed or that they kept with their current situation and finally decided to make a change? What happened?\nCraig Gates: Well, that's why it's a little bit hard for me to draw a conclusion because there's a whole bunch of different stories behind each of them. So a couple of them we've been talking to for years and the programs we quoted on were new development programs, didn't ever win anywhere. And the other one, awarded the business to somebody else that didn't work out well and they came back.\nBill Dezellem: Thank you. And then, Craig, in your opening remarks, you referenced that the number of customers versus four years ago has doubled or is up 100%. How do you think about that? Because there is this trade-off between less customer concentration and yet the challenges of managing the smaller pieces of business. What are the dynamics around that as you think about it?\nCraig Gates: Well, there's a lot of different aspects to that situation, and it's hard to draw a real generalized conclusion other than the ones I've stated that it does tend to improve our leverage with the customer in negotiations when the customer knows they're not 15% of our business. We don't see a big delta in cost between running a $5 million program and a $40 million program in terms of support costs and overhead. It's actually a little bit easier to manage when it's on the smaller side because you don't have such massive amounts of parts that you're trying to keep your arms around. And it's also easier in that many times, these programs were not part of it, our business is not part of a big corporation that we can't get to somebody who will listen to the situation at hand and respond logically. So even though it seems like with the $50 million program, you should have a lot more ability to talk to people who have the power to make decisions. Oftentimes, that $50 million program is part of some billion dollar corporation, and you can't get to somebody who you need to talk to, to make logical sense on what's going on. So we don't see what's classically taught in the business schools that the smaller programs are less profitable. We probably see at least parity between them and probably an advantage going to the $10 million to $20 million program compared to a $50 million to $80 million program. That doesn't mean we're not always looking for the $50 million, $80 million program. But if you look back in history, other than a couple of them that have been long standing, they tend to be more flash in the pan than you would hope. So we are happy with the fact that we're growing in the $5 million to $20 million programs on a steady basis and much faster in that realm than we were three, four years ago.\nBill Dezellem: That's helpful. Thank you, Craig. And then you referenced a couple of times, I think you both did that the customers that you are manufacturing for in your U.S. facilities are showing strength, whereas the customers that are in your Mexico facilities are showing some weakness. Is there any conclusion to draw from the location at which you are manufacturing and the relative strength?\nCraig Gates: I'm struggling to do so. I would like to be able to give you an earth-shattering revelation on why at this point, Mexico was down and U.S. is up. I think it has to do with the fact that there's so much growth in new programs coming into the U.S. sites that although they have seen downturns in some of their customers, those downturns have been swamped by all the new business coming on board. The business in Juarez was unexpectedly dampened by the power equipment business having to go on hiatus while the customer redesigned the product. And so what should have been new business that was swamping out other small decreases in the other business in Juarez is not there right now. So I think that set of just individual circumstances is the driver rather than any kind of market or business overarching trend that you can point to or at least that I can point to.\nBill Dezellem: That commentary is appreciated, even though it's not the revelation that you had hoped you'd be able to share. I did hear where we heard of another company that saw weakness right after Labor Day. Curiously, it did correspond with Hamas attacking Israel and then things two or three weeks later returning to normal. Have you seen anything similar to that peculiarity that, that company saw?\nCraig Gates: No. When we talk about positive to negative phone calls we get from our customers and the ratio of those, we had a little bit of a dip four or five months back that we thought were worried was the signal for a broader base on coming recessionary freight train. Then that ratio flattened out, and we started to get hopeful. And then a couple of months ago, the ratio went bad again. But it has now once again flattened out. So if you look at it, it was a small step down, a medium step down, but now it's flat again. We're typically a front-end particular of what's going to happen. And right now, I can't give you any good indication that it's going to continue to get worse, it's going to stabilize or it's going to get better.\nBill Dezellem: All right, great, thank you. I will step back and queue and reenter, so others have an opportunity.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Sheldon Grodsky with Grodsky Associates.\nSheldon Grodsky: Good afternoon, everybody.\nCraig Gates: Hi.\nSheldon Grodsky: I have two questions that are unrelated. I'll start off with that power equipment manufacturing problem. That sounds like a pretty big disaster if it's going to be kind of held in abeyance for a year, does that relationship look like it's intact? I know you're not supposed to say bad things about your customers on these calls. But did they handle all the designs or do you in it together?\nCraig Gates: The way that many of our programs work is that we contract to provide design services, and that was the case with this customer. And in that situation, the customer will say, I would like you to design this bracket, it needs to be this strong, and it needs to withstand this many flexes. And we say, okay, and our engineers sit down in the CAD station, and we designed that bracket to meet that load and that number of flexes, and we put it on our test equipment, and we prove that it meets that load in that many flexes and customer approves the design, and we go out and we buy tooling and we manufacture it. When the product hits the market, and it turns out that the performance specifications that our customer gave us were underrated in some way and the part begins to fail. Usually, the situation is clear enough that we remain friends with our customer and the business goes on. And in many cases, the relationship has strengthened because as we go through the troubleshooting to determine what the problem has been and why our engineering team proves its metal under challenging and time-constrained conditions. And that's the situation that we're in with this customer today. I believe we are in a better position from a relationship standpoint than we were previously. And things are moving forward, and we are actually continuing to design next-generation product while this current generation product is being tweaked.\nSheldon Grodsky: I have an unrelated question.\nCraig Gates: I want to tell you, Sheldon, that I never did that. I want to tell you, I never explained that that way before, and I'm pretty proud of that. That's pretty good. So I hope that helps.\nSheldon Grodsky: It did. With regard to China, well, one little company that I follow has been having interesting problems suddenly getting export licenses, this kind of leads me to believe that the cold war between the United States and China is heating up. Have your people found situations where they either can't export to fulfill orders because of new requirements coming from the local communist officials or anything like that where that it's becoming a significant impediment to operations?\nCraig Gates: The reason that many of our new customers are new customers is that they have run into exactly that type of problem. So the trade war, you can read about what our President has said to their President and all those kind of things. But what really matters is what's happening to our current and prospective customers as they try to source product and do business overall. That means get new designs designed, get ramps either up or down, send engineers in there to help, all that has gotten dramatically harder in the last three, four years and continues to get worse. It's not static. It's actually continuing to get worse. What's interesting to us is that it's making the people that were more or less on the fringes of should we be in China or not. The people who don't have big money to throw at a problem when suddenly they can't get parts out of there for a day or a week or a month. It's making those people change their approach earlier than the folks who are bigger and have the wherewithal to kind of withstand the buffeting of the cold or as you call it. So that's why we see a lot of these $8 million to $10 million to $20 million wins that are happening for us because those are the people that are on the fringes and are the most severely impacted without the financial wherewithal to manage those impacts on a timely basis.\nSheldon Grodsky: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question will come from George Melas with MKH Management.\nGeorge Melas: Thank you. Hi Craig. Hi Brett. How’re you?\nCraig Gates: We are okay.\nGeorge Melas: Good. Okay. A follow-up to those questions on the smaller customers, you were sort of suggesting or telling us that you think that from a management perspective, maybe let's think about it from a numbers perspective. I think you're suggesting that from a gross margin perspective, they might be a little bit better because you have a little bit more leverage. From an SG&A perspective, that may be that they are equal to their larger peers as a percentage of revenue. So first of all, is that correct? Is that the right way to interpret that?\nCraig Gates: Yes. Additionally, customers that are on the very small end that have proven not to fit that model, we have been actively disengaging with. So there's been a trade of customers, specifically in our U.S. sites where those sites were struggling to maintain the revenue base that they had where those sites are now struggling to service the new growing revenue base that they now see. And as a result, we've been circling around and taking the bottom of our list of customers. And some of them we are ways with because they're just small and they have a much worse ratio of listings and overhead compared to the revenue base that we're enjoying with them. Some of them, we walk away from because they have proven to be untrustworthy, and we don't have to deal with it anymore. And some of them we walk away from because we don't see any type of future and we're concerned about their financial health. But that's a change. We haven't done any systemic pruning of our customer base since I've been with the company. We've done some a little bit here and there, but nothing as overt and as what's the right word... I don't know. Anyway, we haven't done...\nGeorge Melas: Purposeful, like so you really sort of have that is part of your strategy now and it's not sort of occasional or opportunistic because somebody really business you offer. It's just a process of pruning.\nCraig Gates: George, I would never make a decision based upon how pissed off I am.\nGeorge Melas: I wouldn't want you to because I think it can be pretty tough. So I don't know. Okay. All right. Okay. From a working capital perspective, these small customers, you tend to do a lot for them. So you do take advantage of a lot of your capabilities. Basically, it means a lot of parts. And how does that impact you from an inventory perspective? And also from an AR perspective, are these small customers, are you able to get slightly better terms?\nCraig Gates: Well, that's the interesting part of it, or interesting aspect of it. I didn't want to say parts because parts are coming into here. if you've got a customer who represents 15% of your business and that customer starts pushing you around in the sense of dumping a big forecast on us demanding that we buy into that forecast and then misses that forecast and then forces us to spend six months to a year in negotiating whether or not they're actually going to conform to the contract they signed and pay for those aged parts. That's a lot different than a $10 million customer who knows that they're a $10 million customer and are going to behave out of necessity as if they are in this together with us rather than taking advantage of our neediness. So even though more smaller customers results in a bigger parts catalog, it results in a lot more rational behavior in how we are forced to buy parts and how we can react when those parts do end up being excess for some time period. We have a lot more ability to enforce and I'm not saying that we're egregiously mean to these smaller customers. I'm just saying that we're in a lot better position to keep the relationship on an even fair and as anticipated in the contract basis, and we sometimes are with a customer that's 10%, 20% of our business. That's part of why we made the dramatic improvements in inventory that we see and we expect to continue to see. And the other part of it is that as COVID came and went, as the supply chain got horrible and now is just kind of horrible a lot of the standard behavior amongst our customers was challenged, and a number of them have made great improvements in how they think about forecasting and inventory because the sequence went along the lines of we're just going to keep driving, keep trying to buy parts because we know we're going to use a lot more. And then parts became available, demand started to shrink after COVID. And the response was, well, we're just going to not pay Key Tronic because they can't make us. And then when it turned into that, well, Key Tronic isn't going to be quiet. We're going to have to pay them. That drove some of these customers to look at their processes and say, well, wait a minute, if we're going to have to actually live up to the provisions in our contracts, we need to be a lot more mindful about how we forecast and order. And so that has changed for the better in a number of our customers. And then at the same time, I've talked about how we have dramatically improved our material resource planning based upon what happened, which was out of the norm for the past 20 years during COVID. So those two factors, I think, are going to continue to drive our inventories down, down, down to where we get to some pretty decent turns, which is massively important when money is no longer free like it isn't today.\nGeorge Melas: Right. So maybe can we try to put a number to that. What do you think your inventory turns? What would be your goal in the next 12 months?\nCraig Gates: Well, I have a goal, but I'm not making you a promise. So I rarely give you any kind of a forward-looking number, but I'm going to under that proviso. So I'm taking a note, George. So a year from now, if you start badgering me about this, I'm going to say it was only a note. I want to get us to over six turns. We're at four now. We went from three to four. And that's my goal.\nGeorge Melas: And I don't know much about how you manage MRPs and inventory turns. But what would enable you to get there? Are you talking about better forecasting from your customers, better MRP outdoors on your part. Because that would be really an improvement in the model than dramatic.\nCraig Gates: Yes. And I think both of those things are dramatic. So everything I laid out in the past 10 minutes of me talking, when you add all that up, that is a dramatic change in how all of this works. And we've just started to see it really drive things down from January through today. And our projections are that it's going to continue to do that. There may be some bumps and hiccups as we go, but overall, we continue to see that, I mean there are programs. We've got programs, George, big programs that we've got running so well. They're turning over 20 times a year. So mathematically, you should be able to get somewhere better than 4. If you can just keep all the, inventory is kind of a story of one damn thing after another. You can look at the top 25 customers and everyone that's not turning at 6. There's some damn reason why it's not. And it's not the math and it's not the process. It's something that happened. And so beyond the math and the process, there's the institutional discipline to look at every one of those damn things that happened and say, all right, we're never letting this happen again on any of our customers, not just this one customer. And as you start to drive the policing of making sure those one-offs never happen again, that starts to add up as well as all the process changes.\nGeorge Melas: And might I add that at the point in time, one of those customer programs continue to be on the list of those that are turning at far less than six turns. That's also the point in time when we are purposefully looking at, is this a good fit for Key Tronic?\nCraig Gates: So we're going back to customers and saying, you're turning at two times. That either changes or you need to find somebody different.\nGeorge Melas: And that is also, again, drastically different than how we've operated in the past.\nCraig Gates: And how we could operate in the past.\nGeorge Melas: Okay, correct.\nCraig Gates: Because we were too desperate to keep every customer we had.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. So I think that's some dramatic changes. It feels like always you have done so much for the customer, you have such breadth of capability, you've spent a lot in CapEx to be able to do all the different things. But never we're quite comped enough by the customer for all that you could do. So maybe now things are changing somewhat...\nCraig Gates: I think that's true.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. Not certainly another quick question. You said you're right that you see gross margin gradually improving. What do you mean by that? Because in this quarter, they didn't and so I just want to understand what you mean by that?\nCraig Gates: Well, this quarter, we didn't because we got hit by, it was a triple whammy so we got hit by the sudden hack of the power equipment program. We got hit by the peso suddenly getting a lot stronger because our government keeps printing money. And we got hit by the fact that interest rates have gone up dramatically because our customer keeps printing money. So those three unexpected events or not unexpected, the events out of our control. drove the gross margin this quarter down lower to where we wanted it to be. We had to respond quickly with the layoffs. And we took quite a bit of charge for inefficiencies as we had extra people around beyond just the severance cost. So this quarter was a bit of an anomaly in that three things combined without a lot of warning to hammer us.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. So where do you see gross margin going in, I don't know, let's think far in the future fiscal '25, what do you think they could be in terms of gross margin?\nCraig Gates: So we've always said we could be at 9%. We've been there every now and then. But again, it's one damn thing after another. But we believe 9% is achievable and should be able to get there.\nCraig Gates: Okay. And then Brett, a quick question on OpEx. OpEx is pretty low this quarter. Is there some explanation for that? Or...\nBrett Larsen: There was a small gain on insurance. I think it was $300,000 or $400,000, George, which dropped overall OpEx. My expectation is OpEx should be fairly flat in our second quarter.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. But if we can adjust SG&A, to simplify to make it easier to think about it, it was 5.8% this quarter. Is that a red rate...\nBrett Larsen: Let's see here. You've got SG&A of 5.8. Last year, it was roughly 5.7. Sequentially, it's down quite a bit. In our Q4, as we had mentioned, there was some bonus calculation that went through the quarter that propped up Q4. But my expectation is that Q2 should be flat to Q1 and a slight increase in Q3 and Q4 of G&A.\nGeorge Melas: Okay. Great. Okay. Thanks for that guys. Appreciate.\nBrett Larsen: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take a question from Bill Dezellem with Tieton Capital.\nBill Dezellem: Thank you. I want to come back to the inventory turns for just a moment. If we roll the clock back a decade back in 2013, and Inventory turns were up north of that north of 6x even up into the 7s. Pardon me for lack of memory here, what is different or what was different back in 2013?\nCraig Gates: Fewer customers, and you had an infinite supply of parts...\nBill Dezellem: Whereas now the supply chain and the challenge of getting parts in the door has created havoc.\nCraig Gates: Yes. And we're suffering and from the company's inventory position has kind of got long COVID in that what happened during COVID has taken almost until now. In fact, we still have some parts around that are a result of COVID. So what happened during COVID, we're still working our way through. And we've talked about this before, is that back in the teens, you could get just about any part you wanted in six weeks. And so the MRP systems were all designed to run with that as one of the variables. And then when COVID hit, it was the opposite of that. And none of the MRP systems actually had that as they're governing variable, I shouldn't say none. I'm sure there were some somewhere, but our certainly didn't and a lot of our customers didn't, and so that's what drove our inventory turns down as low as they went and that's why we're thinking we can get them back up to six even with more customers and longer lead times for parts.\nBill Dezellem: And Craig, you may have just touched on something that you had mentioned much earlier in the call relative to system upgrades. And I think you referenced your system upgrades and maybe even customer system upgrades. Does this all tie into what you're talking about right now? Or are those two totally different things?\nCraig Gates: No, that's exactly the same thing.\nBill Dezellem: And so the upgrades that took place in the systems that are planning out inventory is making the lead time actually a variable rather than a constant?\nCraig Gates: The lead time always was a variable, but it wasn't driving the algorithms as if it was a constraint as much as it should have been. More importantly, the way people understood the system and manage those lead times, we're not driving the system the way it should be working. So I'm not going to go into it. You can call me later, and I'll give you an MRP lesson if you want. But the bottom line is that the way we use the system and the way we've configured the system is much different than it was before we went into COVID. And the way many of our customers configure and use their system now is much different than it was before we went into COVID. I'll try to give you an example. So when we were in the midst of COVID, it took almost a year for many of our customers to actually revamp their thinking and realize that it wasn't a possibility to call us up and threaten and yell and abuse and become the squeaky wheel and get their parts. And that used to work. And so it was a big eye-opener for many customers that there was actually nothing that could fix this other than time. And no amount of yelling or degrading or threats or payments, some type of speed up payment, none of that was going to work. And that was a massive realization for everybody in the industry that has spent many of them their entire careers operating under the assumption that you could always get your parts in at least utmost eight weeks if you made enough noise. And so if you then take the ramifications of that and spread them back through the planning process and the algorithms that you use in your planning process, that's a profound change in thinking.\nBill Dezellem: That's helpful. And then you referenced the customer systems, is your sense that the customer systems, generally speaking, have now taken this into account. And so kind of that heavy lifting is done?\nCraig Gates: Yes. Many, many of our customers are now investing money in having us stockpile, some of the troublesome components for them. That was people used to give that lip service before COVID, but I can't think of anybody that actually did that before COVID. Even though we would talk about it every time there was an event when they couldn't get a product and they needed it, and there would be this kind of relationship, challenging situation, and we'd be yelling at each other on the phone and we'd be flying out to see each other, and we talk about, God damn, if we would just take these scary parts, I remember the title, we had a scary parts list. And so if we just take the scary parts that are on this list, and you guys would invest $100,000 out of your $40 million spend. If you put $100,000 into this, you guys wouldn't have the situation crop up again and again and again. And the response was always was, we're not going to do it, you do it. And we always say, well, we can't afford to do it, you do it and then it would never get done. That has changed. We've probably got 30%, 40% of our customers who are in some type of standby inventory situation with us where they have realized that in order to ensure their supply chain, they need to invest wisely in one, two, three or four parts that are their customary problem parts on their bill of material. That's a really big change.\nBill Dezellem: And they're paying for those parts?\nCraig Gates: Yes.\nBill Dezellem: Great. May I ask one more question completely unrelated to this. You made reference to the strength in the pipeline of business for the Vietnam facility. Would you talk around that a little more? And is the actual number of programs potentially moving to Vietnam from China higher than it was three months ago?\nCraig Gates: No. It's actually the potential programs moving from the States to Vietnam and skipping Mexico.\nBill Dezellem: So talk a little bit more about that and kind of your comment, I think, that you see Vietnam as part of the future growth of the company.\nCraig Gates: Yes. So Vietnam is less expensive than China and less expensive than Mexico. And Mexico continues to legislate higher and higher wages. And as they do that, more customers that were looking solely at Mexico as a way out of China are now willing to look at Vietnam and India. We haven't made a decision on India as of yet, but Vietnam is pretty close to India pricing and are ahead of the various supply chain issues that you see in India. So we have a number of big opportunities cooking for Vietnam. Vietnam got stalled out during COVID and is restarting in terms of business acquisition. So this is on the front end of it. But we're predicting that a year from now, there'll be a couple or three big wins to increase the size of what's going on in Vietnam for us.\nBill Dezellem: And these would be new customers to you, Craig?\nCraig Gates: Yes.\nBill Dezellem: And how about business moving from China to Vietnam, what are you seeing there?\nCraig Gates: Our business or business in total?\nBill Dezellem: Business in total?\nCraig Gates: We don't see as much as that as you would think because people tend to think of it's all Asia. We need to get out of Asia.\nBill Dezellem: Interesting. Okay. Thank you both for the time today.\nOperator: And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now hand the call back over to Mr. Craig Gates.\nCraig Gates: Okay. Thank you, everybody, for participating in our conference call today. Brett and I look forward to speaking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: Well, thank you. And that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation, and have an excellent day."
