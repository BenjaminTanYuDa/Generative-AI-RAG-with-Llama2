Now without further ado, I would like to pass the floor to IPA CEO, Dr. Jennifer Bath who will provide an overview of our quarterly results.\nJennifer Bath: Thank you, Mandeep, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter earnings call for the fiscal year 2024. In this quarter, we've yet again proven our capability to flourish amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment, highlighting the relevance and effectiveness of our strategy, along with our adaptability. Our strategic foresight and comprehensive suite of end-to-end antibody services that we offer have been instrumental in securing this consistent growth. A significant portion of our R&D efforts this quarter has been directed towards supporting BioStrand, our artificial intelligence subsidiary, reflecting our belief in its transformative potential for drug discovery. By strategically focusing our investments and maintaining prudent cost management, we affirm our commitment to innovation, operational excellence, and the strategic development of our company to meet the evolving needs of industry and our clients. The past quarter was a landmark period where we not only continued our trajectory towards revenue growth, but also achieved notable improvements in our profit margins. This progress underscores our journey toward profitability with a clear focus on sustainable and profitable growth. Strategic investments in our BioStrand platform and an increase in our manufacturing footprint in Europe have been pivotal in securing a larger market share for catering to the increasing demand for our services. This strategic alignment ensures that we are well positioned to lead in the drug discovery and development space propelled by BioStrand’s innovative AI driven software capabilities. Reflecting on our financial and operational strategies, we're proud to report a quarter of robust performance with a total revenue of $6.2 million, marking a 20% year-over-year increase. We are extremely proud to announce that this achievement marks our fourth quarter of back to back record breaking quarterly revenues at ImmunoPrecise Antibodies. This success is a testament to our strategic focus on sales, customer engagement, and operational efficiencies. Our BioStrand initiative has contributed to the success with early revenue from repeat business with large pharma companies, underscoring the compelling value proposition for our offerings. Our execution strategy underscored by strong customer relationships and effective marketing has not only facilitated growth, but also provided a feedback loop from our customers, enhancing our R&D focus on BioStrand and furthering our competitive edge. Our operational achievements are highlighted by the strategic implementation and integration of the BioStrand technology into our workflows, leading to significant scientific and commercialization advancements. The seamless integration and strategic expansion of our facilities, such as the Utrecht, and Victoria sites, along with notable growth in our Oss, the Netherlands facility, reflect our commitment to meeting client demands and driving revenue growth. The operational success is particularly notable in our B Cell program, contributing significantly to our discovery projects and revenue, showcasing the strategic and synergistic build of our company. Our scientific endeavors this quarter have been focused on expanding our VHH lead generation and offerings, and optimizing our in silico technologies, including the launch of LENSai epitope binning tool. These advancements not only reinforce our position at the forefront of VHH discovery, but also align our strategic vision of building safer, more efficacious drugs, faster, and with less risk. Our public speaking commitments at key technology industry conferences, such as HIMSS and Precision Medicine World conference in Silicon Valley demonstrates our commitment to innovation and our role as industry leaders, in part thanks to BioStrand’s entry into the market with validated in silico solutions. As we continue to invest strategically in BioStrand, aiming for a leading position in the industry with our upcoming software rollouts, we are mindful of our spending while ensuring these investments drive significant value and future revenues. BioStrand has developed a foundation AI model by integrating multiple large language models with its HYFTs technology. This model is designed to analyze complex biological data, particularly proteins, by identifying unique patterns and biological sequences, which improves the precision of a prediction and drug discovery and disease research. This approach allows for the creation of advanced products with reduced research and development costs compared to traditional AI solutions. BioStrand strategy involves balancing the growth of the CR revenue with the further development and integration of computational technology, contributing to advancements in the biopharmaceutical sector by accelerating the process of drug discovery and the development of personalized medicine solutions We are enhancing R&D efficiency through advanced data science. The foundation models prowess in transforming complex biological data sets into actionable insights with minimal computational expense is rooted in a suite of advanced data science methodologies. These methodologies are designed to optimize data processing and analysis, significantly reducing the reliance on extensive data generation and labor-intensive manual analysis. As we balance our steady CRO revenue growth with continued build-out and integration of in silico technologies, the advantage of the HYFTs allow us to be capital efficient while creating a hub of biotherapeutic intelligence. Now I'll hand it over to our CFO, Kristin Taylor, who will delve into the financial specifics of this quarter in greater detail, highlighting our strategic investments in BioStrand, our operational efficiencies, and our unwavering commitment to delivering on our customers' needs, a strategy that has not only driven our revenue growth, but has also strategically built our company for sustained success in the drug discovery and development industry.\nKristin Taylor : Thank you, Jennifer. I'll provide a brief overview of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 before touching on our financial position as of the end of the period, which was January 31st, 2024. As a reminder, all numbers I referenced are in Canadian Dollars unless otherwise noted. Starting with our revenue. For the three months ended January 31st, 2024, we achieved revenues of $6.2 million, representing a 20.3% increase in our revenue of $5.2 million in Q3 of previous year. year. Our year-to-date revenue was $18.1 million, reflecting a 20% increase from our fiscal 2023 year-to-date revenue of $15 million. Supporting this growth, our Utrecht, Netherlands site achieved year-to-date revenue growth of 32% year-over-year and is benefiting from expansion efforts in Q3 of last year, Our Victoria BC site achieved year-to-date revenue growth of 27% year-over-year and will be expanding its wet lab footprint in mid-calendar 2024. As for the impact of our ongoing expansion, our revenue history shows the results of our focus on continuing to identify and meet our customers' needs. We have demonstrated sustained profitable revenue growth from our wet labs at higher than market rates and continue to expand, and to address not only our customers' needs but also our stakeholders' need. We are continuing to execute on our wet lab expansion by adding much needed lab space plus investing in the further development and launch of our LENSai portal and SaaS platforms. This strategy not just supports even higher revenue growth but gross margin improvements as well. Now on to our operating expenses. Our research and development expenses for the third quarter were approximately $1 million and $3.1 million year-to-date, which represents a $10 million decrease from the previous year. This decrease reflects the completion of the investments required to build the Talem Therapeutics assets, and now primarily represents our investment in supporting the phased rollout of our BioStrand offerings. Year-to-date sales and marketing expenses remain flat and represent our synergistic sales efforts across our comprehensive antibody discovery and development services, along with efforts towards Talem to out licensing opportunities. And general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $4.1 million and $11.5 million year-to-date. This reflects the decrease from the previous year-to-date balance of $11.7 million as we continue to see results from our strategic cost cutting efforts, even as they continue to grow our revenue and our A.I. offerings. On to earnings per share. Our growth in revenue and reduction in expenses resulted in a net loss of $2.9 million or $0.11 per share for the quarter versus our third quarter of fiscal 2023 that resulted in the loss $4.7 million, or $0.19 per year. Along with this reduction in net loss, we also experienced a reduction in our overall cash burns. This reduction in cash burn supported us in finishing the third quarter of our fiscal 2024 with unrestricted cash of $6.2 million versus our second quarter cash balance of $6 million and our fiscal 2023 yearend balance of $8.3 million. Additionally, subsequent to the end of our third quarter, on February 23rd, 2024, the company established an at the market equity offering facility, and ATM facility with Clear Street LLC, replacing its previous ATM facility with Jefferies LLC. This new relationship with Clear Street brings additional support in both raising equity and identifying value-added partnerships to build long-term shareholder value. To provide additional funding for our R&D efforts and wet lab expansion, we initiated a small equity raise in December of 2023, as well as utilized our new ATM facility in early March, 2024. We continue to monitor our cash from operations, as well as the cost of capital versus returns on R&D investment to assess the need to raise funds. With our consistent revenue growth and the R&D efficiency of the LENSai Universal Foundation AI model, we are able to slow down or speed up our R&D efforts as we work to best meet our customers and our partners' needs while building shareholder value. With that, I'll turn it back to Mandeep for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Will McHale with Ingalls & Snyder.\nWill McHale: Good morning, Kristin and Jennifer. First quick one, Kristin, you mentioned that the company utilized the ATM offering in early March of 2024. Are you able to provide any more details on how much equity you raise?\nKristin Taylor : Yes, I am. As we reported in our SEC filing, we had net proceeds of approximately $1.8 million, and that is Canadian at an average price, net price of $2.09 a share.\nWill McHale: Thank you. Last quarter, the company talked about executing an LOI to enter into a transfer agreement for a Talem asset. What's the status of that program?\nJennifer Bath: Hi, Will, this is Jennifer, and thanks for asking about that. I'm sure that's a question on other people's mind as well. So the LOI, or Letter of Intent, pertains to entering into what's called a Material Transfer Agreement, or MTA, for one of our valuable assets in the Talem pipeline. The company that signed the LOI does remain interested in moving forward with the MTA. However, they've indicated that they must first complete their delayed internal laboratory activities that are required for them to actually evaluate the tall amount of [inaudible] when they arrive. Given that the MTA actually specifies a fixed duration as soon as it's activated, then their timeline for initiating the agreement is contingent on the completion of internal preparation so they're actually ready to receive the material. To simplify that, if they sign the MTA, they have exactly six months to do the analysis. If three of those months are taken up with completing their internal materials to do the analysis, then they have only three months remaining to complete all of the work within the MTA without actually doubling their fees. So they're trying to be strategic from that perspective. Of course, they no longer then have [inaudible] exclusivity on that target during that time. So related to that in parallel, we are pleased to share also that a top five pharmaceutical company has actually shown interest in the exact same asset. So they have also signed a confidentiality agreement or a CDA, and they've initiated discussions with Talem as well. So this development suggests there may be competitive interest in licensing the asset. So we're closely monitoring the situation, answering their questions, and we're committed to obviously pursuing the best outcome for our stakeholders. So we will provide updates as more information becomes available and as we make further progress.\nWill McHale: Got it. Thank you. It's been a year since announcing the Astellas collaboration. I realize that you're probably limited in what details you're able to share about the status of that, but I was wondering if you could comment on any sort of high level learnings from the program so far, specifically as it would relate to BioStrand and building their capabilities.\nJennifer Bath: Absolutely, actually, we'd be really happy to do that. So the developments in this collaboration specifically with Astellas are very broadly applicable to various aspects of what we do in the in silico antibody discovery and development. So for one example, for instance, the elements of the developed procedures are integrated into our recently launched LENSai epitope binning tool. In addition, for that collaboration with Astellas, we were able to leverage knowledge and insights that we obtained within our Talem programs. And then we refined our technology for detailed structural analyses of protein interactions. And then this development has brought along significant value to BioStrand. So it's enabled them to make targeted adjustments to antibodies such as in silico adjustments of exactly where an antibody binds and exactly how strong that antibody is going to bind to its target. And these capabilities are ones that enable us to optimize in silico generated antibodies and then refine them further to make sure that they are optimized for the intended use in the clinic. So really a number of very tangible, very applicable aspects that we've learned through this program that are now built into the capabilities of BioStrand.\nWill McHale: Great, that's a good transition to my next question. Is the company still on track to hit the milestones listed in its investor deck? I know there was a number of things targeted for the first half of calendar ‘24, also for all of ‘24.\nJennifer Bath: Exactly. Starting first half of the calendar ‘24, also as you mentioned, kind of going through the first half of calendar ‘25. And so again, thank you for asking that question. So regarding our progress toward achieving the milestones included in the, it's both structured AI and lab deals with a license fee, as well as securing custom LENSai software as a service deal, among others. And I am pleased to report that yes, we do believe we're still on track to hit these milestones. We've been very laser focused on accomplishing these milestones. And the progress that we've made today has been really buoyed by the positive momentum we gained in this year's partnering conferences, starting with Longwood and JP Morgan back in January. So not only did we have good valuable exposure, really at a time where we're seeing the industry get much more excited about moving into partnerships, but these have also facilitated very meaning discussions with these potential partners, where we're actively working with them to align company synergies and ways to explore the integration of our technologies and services in a way that's mutually beneficial. So it's definitely been supporting our active movement toward checking each of these investor milestones. And then the outcome from these conferences and these subsequent discussions have been quite promising. They've been reinforcing our confidence in that direction that we're heading. And we do remain committed to maintaining this momentum. So we're quite optimistic about our ability to deliver on the promises we've made to our investors and stakeholders. So rest assured, we are fully engaged in the efforts to not only meet, but also exceed the expectations that were set forward in that deck.\nWill McHale: Great. Well, look forward to seeing the progress in the next couple of months. Last one from me, I was hoping you might be able to comment on sort of the commercial applications of the foundational AI model that you announced last week. Is that something that could be licensed to clients to use or is this mainly going to be an internal development tool?\nJennifer Bath: Yes, that's a fantastic question. And so the quick answer to the last portion of that is really both. LENSai and then the foundational application of that is something that lends itself quite well to partnerships and collaborations. And we also see that as having very significant potential in really changing how everyone working with biological data is able to access and utilize that data in a more meaningful way. So much far beyond just the application of us using that as an internal tool for in silico antibody discovery and development, we really see it as being fundamental and foundational to everyone working with mass biologics in the space. So to give you just a little bit more detail on that, that's kind of my direct go to answer. But just to provide a little bit more detail we've created and constructed this comprehensive technology stack, right, and that's a lying really at the heart of this foundation AI. And the AI platform is designed for very broad applicability across the diverse services we offer at IPA. So a prime example of its effectiveness has been in that validation of the epitope binning, but also many other promising applications in the pipeline. And this quarter did represent quite a milestone really for BioStrand in utilizing these numerous in silico capabilities because we did receive enthusiastic validation not only from internal sources in terms of being able to validate the quality and the accuracy of the work coming out of the laboratory, but also from third party partners as well, which obviously was quite pleasing to them as well to see that they could really depend on in silico work, which obviously is quite a bit faster and cheaper and provides additional insights and then feel comfortable knowing that matches the wet lab data that's coming back. So in this kind of AI era, kind of both in the investment realm and also in the client realm where you have this kind of mantra of, I'll believe it when I see it, this has been really a massively rewarding quarter for not only IPA and BioStrand, but also for this pharma who are getting excited to see the validation of the in silico data coming out of BioStrand. And so the successes highlight not only the intrinsic value of us tapping into Talem data in our validation process, but it also really underscores the broad utility and adaptability of this foundation AI. And so just to wrap that up or kind of close that up maybe with something that I think is really tangible and applicable for people outside to really grasp that foundation AI role within LENSai, its introduction marks really a significant milestone with regard to our commercial strategy, because that Foundation AI extends LENSai’s capabilities into new realms. It provides a scalable and adaptable framework for data analysis and insight generation. So that LENSai is a foundational technology in the sense that it elevates the platform to the level of relevance and applicability, not only for life science and healthcare research, but anyone seeking to harness information from LLMs or generative AI or any other data-rich model. So it's not just about enhancing our existing offerings, it's about expanding the possibilities for what our technology can achieve in the marketplace. And with Foundation AI, LENSai is really poised to deliver unmatched value really to people harnessing data across a multitude of industries, opening up those opportunities for growth and innovation, and so it's really this strategic integration that the signals are moved toward a more dynamic, data -driven solutions that can adapt to customer needs and also to market changes.\nWill McHale: Great, yes, it sounds like a very promising breakthrough. I look forward to seeing the economic benefit for IPA shareholders as well. That's all I have.\nOperator: Our next question comes from a line of Swayampakula Ramakanth with H.C. Wainright.\nSwayampakula Ramakanth: Thank you. This is RK from HC Wainwright. Good morning, Jennifer. Coupe of quick questions. As Kristen said, the Utrecht and the Vancouver facilities in terms of revenues grew north of 25% in both of those facilities. And we have seen that growth come in quarter after quarter since you did the expansion. So the question is on resources in the sense, as you see this expansion every quarter or the last two, three quarters now, are you getting to a point where you're getting concerned about how much capacity you have in these facilities? Or do you still have enough capacity for growth, say for the next two to three years, if it grows at the same rate?\nJennifer Bath: Yes, I actually, I just, I love that question, RK, because it really does kind of tap into also the evolution of how we've gotten to this point with the needed expansion. Because for years, we talked about space utilization, equipment utilization, people utilization, automation, robotifying work, the ability to track different pieces of equipment from at home or at night so that we could have things running as much around the clock as possible and really optimize our efficiency without needing to do expansions and without needing to do significantly more hiring. So in the past quarters, one of the things that you'll see that we've put up a couple of times was our revenue growth actually versus the number of FTEs that we had. And so we were really, really pushing the envelope at the Utrecht sites and the Victoria sites in particular where we were full to the brim with every piece of equipment being utilized, every square inch of each floor client being utilized. And then really at the point in Utrecht and in Victoria, British Columbia also where we had clients that had to sit in the queue and sometimes that was four months before we could actually bring those clients in. Now, I am happy to say that we have actually moved into that expansion realm with all three of our major production wet lab facilities. So Victoria did transition last January into a new facility, but that facility does actually require some additional remodeling and additional transition. It was something that we did not move into a brand new prepared facility. And so there is some duplication of some of the overhead associated with that with Victoria, but it's duplication from the Victoria site and it's also touch on the Oss site that you've already been seeing. And so with regard to any additional overhead associated with that, we've already been making those investments, they've already been incorporated into the lot of financial sales that you're seeing. And we've managed that by being very strategic with regard to our pricing increases, having more of a focus on our profitability and our profit margins in order to offset that. So I think we've done that very strategically. So we've now started moving into that facility in Victoria where that expansion with regard to the footprint is significant and then also these additional room for expansion where we'll actually be moving three full size laboratories into one laboratory to gain additional cost synergies and efficiencies. And then in Utrecht, we actually saw the same thing. They doubled the square footage of their manufacturing facility. That's part of, as Kristin mentioned, what enabled us to really grow the revenues as rapidly as we did there this year, because they don't any longer have these longer wait times for clients. And then the layout of the space is also just much more efficient with regard to the footprint and the production chain. And so with regard to that, we actually had been double paying and duplicating on the space to this one which was finished being built. It's now been a year ago, October, since we've completed that. And again through optimizing our profit margins, and being more operationally efficient, we've really managed to do that without it really impacting our profit margins and our profitability, our profit in general, from those programs. And then the last one is Oss in the Netherlands, and they've actually done a full complete sweep move from their old facility into their new facility. And that was really spurred in part by the fact that the building that they were previously existing in was actually being rebuilt and the majority of the tenants were being moved over to the new building. But we do gain a lot of operational efficiency there and the space that we're moving into there, no doubt, will be able to accommodate us for many years to come. So I think right now where we're sitting, we went really very strategically as long as possible working with the minimum floor footprint, and a minimum number of personnel and just really kind of push ourselves to get to this point. And now I think these investments we've made are quite strategic, quite financially doable for us, but absolutely set us up for many years to come with regard to capacity. We won't see any need to further expand those capacities anytime soon.\nSwayampakula Ramakanth: Perfect. And then I know in the press release, you stated that you're starting to see some service revenue out of BioStrand. If you can kind of expand on that, because since you all had BioStrand for almost a year and a half, two years, I know you're doing a lot of tools building I'm sorry, I'm sure you're doing much more than that, but I'm sorry to use the word tool building. But at the same time, I know you're trying to generate some revenues, but for people like me to understand how much energy is being spent on gating that segment into revenue growth versus already getting some revenue out of that. I just want to understand where you are in that whole process.\nJennifer Bath: Yes, actually that is a great question. So with regard to BioStrand and where the emphasis is there on the development, as you mentioned we've been building these modules and these tools, really different components of LENSai in response to what our clients tell us that they need in response to what they believe would give them better insights earlier on so they can fail faster or succeed faster with better products that are more likely to be successful in the clinic. And so really, if we go back to two years ago, these were not capabilities that BioStrand had, we have the fundamental technology of LENSai powered by the HYFTs and this pattern recognition, with still the vectorization of the actual structural patterns to be completed and embedded. And as we continue to gain insights off of that and really turn our focus more specifically to biologic research associated specifically with therapeutic antibodies that was a significant part of that energy and effort put into that first 24 months, where we've been taking that and move that into the integration of these wet lab capabilities. But all-in-all, during this period of time where we're performing those capabilities and building those modules, those are also are all parts of LENSai. And that LENSai remember being a tool that will be rolled out to our clients and then subsequently also to the public to enable people to not only utilize these tools within their own laboratory, but also to be able to encompass larger aspects of what we're able to do with LENSai. So going back to the foundational technology and the ability to use LENSai to gather insights again for multiple LLMs and other resources, as well as to be able to use that for data management. And so we have these components that we've been building in and with regard to, as you mentioned, the revenue generation from these repeat clients. We have repeat clients that are certainly adding these capabilities into the workflow as they build novel drugs with our therapeutic wet lab arm, which is fantastic. We get that feedback. We have that learning loop. The HYFTs become more enriched and more informed as we continue to build the robust nature of LENSai. But in addition to that, we do have pharmaceutical clients that are using us in a very different type of capacity, both in the partnership model, as well as direct fee for service work directly at BioStrand and not quite as integrated into the wet lab capability. So I think when we first started talking about the power of LENSai, and again, going back to this idea of foundation AI, where it really is able to integrate these foundational layers that can improve insights and speed and applicability of other algorithms, other models in the industry, meaning that those insights within LENSai, they not only -- they're not just direct tap-in that people can do in LENSai, but they also complement other technology. So they're not necessarily competitive with these other technologies. So it's in supplying these types of tools for people to leverage both technological and biological aspects to enhance what they're learning, which is also a major part of our partnership goals and collaboration goals with these different groups. And just as a really specific example, for instance we had mentioned previously really using LENSai to answer questions in the biological space that haven't been able to be answered in the wet lab. And that's why with the initial partners we took on, we took on partners who had really complicated programs that couldn't, they could not actually solve in the wet lab capabilities or wet lab capacity. And so far, not only I've alluded to already after one of the questions from Will McHale that not only we really gained these wonderful insights that's helped us to further build our tools, but we're also having these wonderful successes in the lab, doing things where still so many people today refer to these as things that people will be able to do in the future with AI technologies things like really enhancing the developability of the asset, right, the potential safety and the lack of toxicity as it moves into the clinic. These are things that we're refining and optimizing and using as we go through these partnerships. And in one of the partnerships in general right now, they now have brought forward their third and significantly largest program for us. And I think it's worth emphasizing that in these types of partnerships are absolutely a focal point for us. It's not just the integration of capabilities in the lab, these partnerships, foundationally, really help us demonstrate that we can tackle these obviously significant problems in the sciences and the biological industry and drug development using LENSai. And at the same time, we're simultaneously building these additional tools. And so this group that's come back for the third and like I said, significantly larger program, probably the most rewarding part of that for everyone at IPA is hearing their verbal feedback on BioStrand's work, where they have just directly told us, hey, we have worked with, just anecdotally, we have worked with a lot of different AI companies out there to try and solve various tasks or answer various questions. And then working with BioStrand, this is the first group is what they tell us, where the data that comes back and the data that they validate in their lab is actually spot on with the work being turned down at BioStrand from an encyclical perspective. So that type of external validation, wet lab validation, and to have a group, a large pharmaceutical company really say, wow, this is the first time we've seen this, this is really it. This is really meaningful for us because now we know we can trust the data, that little AI skepticism that's out there for so many people was really resolved. And that's what led us to actually then getting this even larger, much more comprehensive program, which for us is incredibly rewarding. So it really is this balance of continuing to do the wet lab work, continuing to build that LENSai module, but these partnerships, these collaborations with these pharmaceutical companies, and we do believe that also over the next couple of quarters, we're really looking to push also more into the technology industry for those collaborations as well. For us, we really believe these are incredibly meaningful. We not only gain additional insights, but we're furthering to develop these relationships and get the validation we need to really show that this is real. It really does impact and change how we discover new drugs.\nOperator: This concludes today's question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Jennifer Bath for closing remarks.\nJennifer Bath: Great. Thank you so much, Mandeep. So, first of all, as we wrap up today's discussion on our third quarter earnings call for fiscal year 2024, I'd like to underscore the strategic execution and resilience that have defined our journey thus far. Our achievements this quarter are not just numbers, they're a reflection of our unwavering dedication to innovation, strategic foresight, and operational excellence. With a significant 20% year-over-year revenue increase, our results speak volumes about our ability to navigate complex market dynamics and deliver on our promises. Our journey toward reduced net losses now at $0.11 per share is a clear indicator of our financial discipline and operational efficiency. This improvement is pivotal as it signals not only our capability to manage expenses wisely, but also our ongoing journey towards sustainable profitability. The strategic investments we've made so far, particularly in BioStrand and our expanded footprints, are laying down the foundation, not just for growth, but for transformative impact on the drug discovery and development landscape.

Reflecting on the effectiveness of this approach, the company's second quarter financial and operational results reveal a third consecutive record quarter with revenue of $6.2 million. This number represents an 18.6% increase above the same period last year. We continue to see strong growth across several areas of our service offerings, including our laboratory B-cell select platform and our manufacturing facility with its expanded capacity. Importantly, our strategic efforts have enabled us to be successful in growing revenue while also reducing our cash burn from $1.6 million in our first quarter of this fiscal year to $700,000 this quarter. Our subsidiary, BioStrand, recognized approximately $165,000 of early revenue this quarter, stemming from LENSai-driven client programs as they continue to progress toward the next phase of their launch of their LENSai portal and software as a service or SaaS platform. With our Talem assets, we remain committed to our strategy of driving revenue through out-licensing opportunities. I am excited to share with you today an update on one of our Talem assets that was highlighted in September's earnings call. We have recently received and executed a letter of intent to engage in a material transfer agreement for that asset. We also continue to leverage Talem’s other previously announced strategic partnerships, which are contributing to our contract research revenue and generating new client opportunities for BioStrand. The macro environment for the drug discovery industry continues to be challenging. Industry-wide biotech funding is down over 60% from its peak in 2021. It is against this backdrop that we are especially pleased with our consistent revenue growth during a time when many of our peers are reporting significant revenue decline. You may ask, why is IPA bucking that trend? We believe that there are several reasons why we are outpacing that industry trend. First, as indicated, many of our pharma and biotechnology clients are looking to consolidate their R&D with vendors that they know and trust, and who have made the investments in technologies of the future. As a result, given our breadth of services, we are capturing additional wallet share from some of our largest clients. Second, having expanded our manufacturing footprint in Europe to meet our clients' needs, we continue to see increased demand in our antibody manufacturing capabilities. Coupled with our industry-leading B-cell select offering and based on client conversations and ongoing sales orders, which are up 83% over the same quarter last year, we are optimistic the trend in our revenue growth will continue. In this turbulent financing market, we have focused on enhancing operational efficiencies and enforcing strategic budget reductions to manage our cash burn. As demonstrated by our consistent revenue growth over the last quarters, our cost-cutting efforts were carefully executed to support our long-term goals without compromising our growth or operations. This has included a strategic reduction in non-ROI generating employees over the past 12 months, a decision made to streamline our cost structure, while maintaining our business's momentum and effectiveness. Our financial results reflect the success of these measures. In these first two quarters, we've seen $10.6 million reduction in operating expenses compared to the previous year. This has been achieved in part by the completion of investments in our Talem assets and without impacting the positive cash flow generated by our laboratory division. These budget cuts are not just about reducing costs. They represent the philosophy that we have had for many years to continue to evaluate and evolve to meet both the needs of our clients, to remain at the forefront in our field, and to be pragmatic as the macro environment continues to evolve. By concentrating our investments in these areas with the highest potential returns, we are positioning ourselves for long-term growth and enhanced shareholder value. I would like to take a moment to discuss the progress, strategy, and goals of our non-laboratory subsidiaries. The BioStrand business we acquired in April of 2022 possessed highly differentiated underlying technology, but was relatively early in its commercialization efforts. Since the acquisition, we have committed resources and made significant progress toward building commercial products. We believe we are in a very different position relative to many other AI and bioinformatics companies in our industry. Our wet lab have over 600 pharma and biotechnology clients, including 19 of the top 20 global pharma companies. We have decades long relationships with many of the most important companies in the industry. We know our clients workflows, and we understand what they demand from a scientific standpoint. The software product BioStrand is developing are designed to meet these needs. To put it bluntly, we believe we are building AI products that our industry partners actually want and need, unlike many other AI companies in the healthcare industry. BioStrand plans to roll out its AI software to existing clients with secure portal access, offering an array of in-silico tools and additional analytical services to further analyze their data from IPA programs. The initial focus is on seamlessly introducing clients to this platform with an emphasis on providing value and utility through advanced and silico discovery services. The gradual integration of clients is designed to familiarize them with the platform's capabilities, setting the stage for upselling more sophisticated services and tools. The SaaS model is being designed to ultimately encompass comprehensive data management and analytical tools, making it accessible to a wider audience beyond the initial client base. This broader public rollout will follow the initial client centric launch, ensuring that the platform is thoroughly tested and refined based on initial user feedback. This dual approach, starting with a targeted client introduction followed by a broader SaaS rollout, is designed to ensure seamless integration into existing customer workflows. It allows BioStrand and IPA to collect critical feedback from early users, which is invaluable for the ongoing development and optimization of the platform. The goal is to support profitable growth while continuing to enhance the platform's capabilities to meet the evolving needs of clients in the dynamic field of drug discovery and development. Much of our historical cash burn is attributable to our investments in R&D, particularly those in the therapeutic assets for Talem. It is important to note that we've completed our significant investments several quarters ago, and our current focus is now on exploring avenues to monetize these assets. As indicated during our fiscal 2024 Q1 earnings call, Talem engaged in discussions with an interested party regarding the potential therapeutic candidate for an incurable progressive disease. Based on the partner's review of Talem's most recent data, we've received and executed a letter of intent to enter into a material transfer agreement within a six-week period. The MTA enables the partner to conduct an in-house review of the asset that is under contemplation for an out-licensing, as well as exclusive rights to the asset during the duration of the agreement. The future of drug discovery is evolving toward the integration of the in silico or computer-based and wet lab processes through comprehensive integrated solutions providers. Recognizing this trend early, the company has already invested in aligning its operations accordingly, anticipating that these proactive investments will yield long-term value for our investors. Now at a significant turning point, IPA welcomes strategic leadership changes and policy implementation. Mitch Levine, our new board Chairman, brings valuable experience from his roles in the life science industry, as well as financial management. Joining him are Dr. Barry Springer, Dirk Witters, and Chris Buyse, enhancing the board's expertise in biotech innovation, finance, and public life sciences, respectively. These appointments, along with recently adopting our new majority voting policy, demonstrate our commitment to strong governance and shareholder engagement. Now, I'd like to turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kristin Taylor, to discuss our financials in further detail.\nKristin Taylor: Thank you, Jennifer. I'll provide a brief overview of our financial results for the second quarter before touching on our financial position as of the end of the period. As a reminder, all numbers I reference are in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted. Starting with our revenue, for the three months ended October 31, 2023, we achieved revenues of $6.2 million, representing a 19% increase from our revenue of $5.2 million in Q2 of the previous year. Our year-to-date revenue for fiscal 2024 was $11.8 million, reflecting a 20% increase from fiscal 2023 year-to-date revenue of $9.9 million. Supporting this growth, our Utrecht, Netherlands site achieved year-to-date revenue growth of 43% year-over-year and is benefiting from expansion efforts in Q3 of last year. Our Victoria, BC site achieved year-to-date revenue growth of 17% year-over-year, and will be expanding in early calendar 2024. We're seeing the impact of these expansion costs on our gross margin, along with the new BioStrand revenue, which in its early stage of limited commercialization has lower margins than those targeted at full rollout. We're also seeing the impact of inflation and we are reviewing pricing changes for the start of the calendar year as part of our overall initiatives to bolster gross margin. Now on to our operating expenses. Our research and development expenses for the second quarter were approximately $1 million, representing a $4 million decrease over the same period of the previous year. This decrease reflects the completion of the investments required to build the Talem assets and now primarily represents our investment in supporting the phased rollout of our BioStrand offerings. Sales and marketing expenses for the quarter are up approximately $100,000, in line with our rising revenues. And general and administrative expenses for the quarter are $3.3 million compared to $3.8 million for the second quarter of the previous year. This reduction reflects our strategic cost cutting efforts onto earnings per share. Our growth in revenue and reduction in expenses resulted in a net loss of $2.6 million or a loss of $0.10 per share for the quarter. This compares to our second quarter of fiscal 2023 that resulted in a loss of $7.4 million or $0.30 per share loss. Along with this reduction in net loss, we also experienced a reduction in our overall cash burn. This reduction in cash burn supported us in finishing the second quarter of our fiscal 2024 with unrestricted cash of $6 million versus the previous quarter end of $6.7 million and our fiscal 2023 year-end balance of $8.3 million. Based on this reduced cash burn, we believe our cash position is sufficient to operate our business through the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Additionally, subsequent to the end of our second quarter, on December 8, 2023, we closed on an underwritten public offering of 1,265,000 common shares with estimated net proceeds of approximately 1.1 million. While it is currently a challenging and high cost equity environment for life science companies, we initiated the small common stock raise to address current customer demand for additional wet lab capacity and to provide additional R&D for our higher growth BioStrand initiatives, both of which we believe support long-term value creation above the cost of capital. With that, I'll turn it back to Sarah for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, Kristin. Before Jennifer adds any closing remarks, we would like to open the floor to any questions from analysts and investors. [Operator Instructions] Your First question comes from the line of Arthur He with H.C. Wainwright. Your line is open.\nArthur He: Hey, good morning, everyone. This is Arthur on for RK. Thanks for taking my question. So the first question is regarding the rollout of the LENSai portal. Before you taking that to all IPA clients right now, what additional steps or effort you need to complete before the rollout?\nJennifer Bath: Thank you for your question. This is Jennifer. I'm happy to answer that question. So first of all, one of the things that is being done here is, we are still adding a couple of features to that portal for the client rollout, as it will have numerous features that the clients can use to analyze the actual data that they're getting from all of our different web lab sites globally. We're also testing that portal internally across multiple sites to make sure that we've basically removed any bugs or any challenges that could exist during the client rollout so that we know that it's entirely ready for that push out to our clients. Aside from that, we're actually getting fairly close to having the final portal available for the client. So it's part of the front end user capabilities and being ready to push that in a secure environment with the username and passwords for our clients to access it.\nArthur He: Got you. Thanks. So within that, in the background, how we should expect the public launch for the SaaS platform, is still within the estimate you guys provided for it, which probably is in the second half of next year?\nJennifer Bath: Yes. So yes, we are still on track for the same dates that we previously provided. And how we envision that is, after the portal has been in use by our existing clients, we will continue to add additional features through that portal, as well as advertising the ability for those clients to come in directly for the fee-for-service capabilities for more complex programs. And then we will roll out that SaaS platform, which is essentially a much more sophisticated version of the portal, both to our clients and then to the public. And again, just to re-emphasize that the SaaS platform in and of itself is also managing our capability for data management and data organization, while also giving access to LENSai to our clients. And as just previously mentioned, yes, that continues to be on target for the previous time frame we have provided.\nArthur He: Awesome. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the rollout.\nJennifer Bath: Of course. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Will McHale with Ingalls & Snyder. Your line is open.\nWill McHale: Good morning, Jennifer and Kristin, and congrats on the solid set of financial results.\nJennifer Bath: Thank you.\nWill McHale: To start, I guess just looking back at the performance of the company over the past 12 or 18 months, there have been a number of things that have been discussed on the conference call, things such as expectations around out-licensing deals and time to ramp revenue from BioStrand partnerships that haven't fully materialized as the company expected initially. If you were to kind of give a postmortem or look back on why things haven't exactly materialized as expected, what would be the explanation?\nJennifer Bath: Thank you. Thanks for asking that question, Will, because I suspect that you're not alone in having that question with regard to BioStrand partnerships and out-licensing expectations for Talem. And so, while there's probably a couple of different factors, I think there's one key factor that we definitely can be confident has impacted those prospects and clients and partnerships. And a lot of that has to do with the undeniable post-COVID market slowdown. We know that it had a very tangible impact on our partners and our clients. We observed a notable shift in their operations. Oftentimes they shared that very directly with us. Many of them temporarily had to pause programs or pause partnerships. Many of those clients also saw consolidation in the industry and many of the pipeline companies either merged or ceased operations or even delayed further investments. And of course, those pipeline companies are our primary target for these types of opportunities. Additionally, the challenging financial landscapes also made it really difficult for these biotech firms to secure the necessary capital for in-licensing and continuing their research endeavor. So we really saw a significant slowdown in those efforts and a lot more conservative spending as a lot of those pipeline companies kind of halted those activities. However, I think it is important to note also that there are emerging signs of a shift in this trend. We're beginning to see a gradual resurgence in activities, in conversations and investments in the sector. As indicated, I think, really by the recent letter of intent received by Talem. And the change, even though it is gradual and will be gradual, I think it's a positive indication of recovery and a return to more robust operations for our partners and our clients.\nWill McHale: Thanks, that makes sense. And I appreciate the color you gave in the script about the overall biotech funding environment. Hopefully it's a change in 2024 as we move forward. A quick question on capital allocation. The company has spent a lot of money on Talem assets and issued a bunch of shares to acquire BioStrand. Looking at those totals now are more than our current market cap, which is sort of depressing to see. But how are you guys thinking about just these investments creating shareholder value? And I guess you can also address the raise last week too. It was a pretty depressed valuation. What are sort of the thought process on ROI with these decisions?\nJennifer Bath: Sure, Will. This is Jennifer again. I'll take that question for you. So, yes, so first of all, I think it's essential to acknowledge that these are substantial investments we've made in Talem and for the acquisition of BioStrand. And these investments, as well as the recent fundraising are at a valuation that we don't believe and may not currently reflect our intrinsic value. So first of all, I'd like to touch just a little bit then on the strategic rational behind these investments. Really both Talem and BioStrand bring unique and complementary capabilities to IPA. Talem has obviously been the subject of internal investments as we've invested in assets within TOLUM. And then BioStrand’s technologies are pivotal in enhancing our core competencies and diversifying our product offerings and expanding our market reach. So really going back to fundamentally the mission that we have continued to articulate in the end-to-end services in discovery and development for BioStrand. The BioStrand offerings are really an integral and important part of that aspect of what we are offering as we continue to listen to our client needs. And so the strategic integration of that, we really believe creates a more robust platform for potential significant synergies. We also believe this creates long-term value creation. While the current market cap and recent fundraising reflect a momentary evaluation in a volatile market, the investments in both Talem and BioStrand are projected to yield returns in the future. And that includes expanding into new markets, accelerating product development, and leveraging cross-selling opportunities across our end-to-end spectrum of services. And I think that's something that we really should not overlook as that ability for us to go ahead and tie really directly into the existing clients that IPA have which are extremely loyal and already utilizing our services at IPA which really make a great market entry for us. Then just lastly with the acquisition of BioStrand and then combining that with Talem's capabilities, we do think that there are numerous different market segments and customer segments that we are able to tap into. So it's not just about increasing revenue streams, but also building more resilient and also diversified business models for IPA.\nWill McHale: Got it, thanks. So it sounds like you're saying the raise last week, while not at an ideal valuation was necessary because we have to make these investments now to meet the market opportunity. Is that the gist of it?\nJennifer Bath: Yes, Specifically on the raise, that's exactly right. Well, there are several opportunities that we feel are really important to capitalize on here in the short term that we really do believe provide substantial revenue returns for IPA. And in particular, the two that we really highlighted with respect to this decision that wasn't taken lightly with regard to the issuance of the common shares is the expansion of our facilities, in particular in Victoria, where again, similar to what happened in Utrecht, we are at client capacity, and we have client demand for increased number of services, increased number of programs for our clients in both B-cell and also actually in protein production there in Victoria and then the other one was isn't with BioStrand. That market is moving really quickly, BioStrand is moving really quickly and we feel it's imperative to make an investment in BioStrand for this push for the LENSai portal and the SaaS model due to the high projected return in benefits to IPA.\nWill McHale: Got it. Thanks. One more quick question. As you look at BioStrand and kind of the product roadmap there, how closely are you evaluating whether it's new features or functionalities in conjunction with existing CRO clients?\nJennifer Bath: Can you repeat the question one more time, Will?\nWill McHale: Sure. The question is, as you look at BioStrand's product roadmap and kind of the different features and modules you're building, are those a result of direct requests from clients? Or how do you determine exactly where the next feature or module is going to be built?\nJennifer Bath: Yes, that's a fantastic question. So first of all, as I mentioned earlier in the script, we're always in very close communication with our clients, with the project leads at these industries. With many of them, we have several decades of relationships with them. And they're very open and clear about what their needs are, what their pain points are. I mean, going back to even the mission that we put forward with IPA with regard to the end-to-end discovery and development services, that's exactly why we did that, because we were answering to these pain points that our clients had, and that's exactly what we're doing with BioStrand. Before the acquisition of BioStrand, there were a number of areas where we were just absolutely certain that a really good AI platform could help us to address some of these needs that our clients had. And obviously after the acquisition, it really became clear as our clients continued to articulate this, that there were several things that they were seeking. Part of it is the speed with which we're able to do some of the work that's currently done in wet lab environments, and some of the work that we currently were not offering in the wet lab environment. With artificial intelligence, we're obviously able to tackle some of those requirements much more rapidly for our clients, which is one of their major pain points and one of their major demands. But in addition to that, we've seen this real shift in the industry too, where we've tackled a lot of the easier targets for many different diseases. And those diseases in our clients are coming with more complicated targets that oftentimes just don't lend themselves very well to wet labs or require a combination of a lot of in silico tools along with wet lab. So there's two different things that we've heard directly from these clients that, BioStrand has really initiated platforms and modules to begin solving. And so part of that is, to be able to consolidate those activities, to be able to have all that in silico work done at a very high quality, along with the wet lab at one location, which reduces their dependence on annual software subscriptions. And then the other component of that is really introducing AI capabilities that can solve some of these problems that can't be solved in the wet lab, like targeting these much more complicated membrane-bound proteins, oftentimes that are associated with deadly or chronic diseases. And I think one of the examples we gave in the past is a fantastic example of a stellate. How do we target proteins on a tumor where there's a microenvironment that's significantly different than what you would normally find within the human body. And that's just not something that people have been able to do very well within a wet lab. And it is a solution that BioStrand is able to begin tackling with LENSai, which is an absolute result of our desire and our history of listening to clients and understanding better exactly where they're going and what they're telling us they're going to need to be successful in the future.\nWill McHale: Got it. That's really helpful. It seems like for a lot of the startup SaaS world, the biggest sort of hurdle is finding product market fit. And the fact that we already have such a long relationship with these clients and the CRO, it seems like we kind of already have that. So that's super exciting to hear. I will drop and let whoever's next in the line ask questions. Thanks, Jennifer.\nJennifer Bath: Thank you, Will.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back to Jennifer for closing remarks.\nJennifer Bath: Thank you, Sarah. So, as we conclude this earnings call, I would like to reiterate the key points that demonstrate our strategic progress and financial resilience. In the first quarter, I discussed our strategy and related initiatives aimed at driving growth and value creation. Now in the second quarter, we continue to deliver on these initiatives. Our focused efforts on laboratory expansion, the advancing commercialization of BioStrand, and monetizing Talem are yielding tangible results. This is evident in our financial performance marked by our revenue growth of 19%. This increase not only reflects our operational efficiency but also underscores the effectiveness of our strategic decisions in a challenging and dynamic market environment. Moreover, we've seen a noteworthy improvement in our net loss, which now stands at $0.10 per share. The investments we are making today in key value creation initiatives are laying the foundation for a strong and sustainable future. We are strategically deploying our resources to areas with the highest potential for growth and return, ensuring that we are well positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities. As we move forward, our focus remains on executing our strategy with precision, maintaining financial discipline, and continuing to drive shareholder value. Thank you for joining us today and for your continued support.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining."

To be specific, our consolidated revenue grew 21.3% year-over-year. In addition, we saw our protein manufacturing facility make strategic use of its newly expanded facilities, demonstrating an impressive growth of 44% year-over-year. As we will expand on shortly, our record revenue was met with significantly higher net income before taxes when compared to Q1 of last year, a difference of approximately $6 million. Another positive back-to-back quarter trend. Lastly, we are happy to state that our quarterly burn slowed to CAD1.6 million in this first quarter. These results mark continued growth in the face of headwinds that have presented challenges within the life sciences market in general. We believe that our success in this quarter is a testament to the resilience and dedication of our management team as well as the robustness of our contract research services. We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders and are hopeful about the opportunities that now lie ahead. We are excited to update our valued shareholders on two significant developments that are integral to the new and promising strategic vision being tracked by our new Board members and management. First, we have filed an F-3 form with the SEC move that allows us to register securities for a shelf offering, a move that makes it easier for us to attract U.S. investors and access U.S. capital markets. This strategic action is part of our ongoing effort to strengthen our financial position and set the stage for the successful implementation of our unified strategic vision. We believe these steps will greatly benefit IPA and our shareholders as we embark on this new invigorated journey. Thank you once again for joining us today. We look forward to sharing more details about our performance and our plans during this call. I'll now turn the microphone over to Dr. Barry Duplantis for updates on client relations and business development.\nBarry Duplantis: Yes. Thank you, Jennifer. As discussed during our recent 2023 fiscal year-end earnings call, the diligent efforts of our fiscal year 2023 sales initiatives are now bearing fruit in fiscal 2024 revenue figures. We are delighted to report a remarkable 21.3% year-over-year Q1 growth in revenue. And once again, this growth has been predominantly propelled by exceptional performance of our protein expression services and our industry-leading B-cell select platform. Moreover, our focus on sales orders, which is a recurring highlight of our earnings discussions, has yielded exceptional results once again. We have observed a significant year-over-year Q1 increase of 59%, primarily attributed to an outstanding sales performance in the month of June, which stands as the highest in IPA history. In specific terms, June sales orders of $3.51 million represented an impressive 125% surge compared to June of fiscal year 2023. The positive trend continued into July with sales orders reaching $1.56 million, marking a substantial 64% increase over July of fiscal year 2023. I'd also like to remind the audience, the sales orders are primarily composed of antibody discovery programs as the majority of our protein expression revenue bypass this financial step. We maintain a high level of confidence in our future prospects, driven by the combined momentum of new BioStrand-base fee-for-service discovery programs and our upcoming participation in fall conferences. These conferences will provide an excellent platform to showcase our seamlessly integrated wet lab and in silico capabilities. This strategic alignment positions us well to sustain this robust growth trajectory. As discussed during our previous earnings calls, the partnership between BioStrand and BriaCell is in its final phase, compromising wet lab evaluation of the output of the in silico work. We completed the wet lab analysis and are currently compiling the data for reporting to BriaCell. And with that, I would like to hand it over to our Chief Scientific Officer.\nIlse Roodink: Yes. Thank you, Barry. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to delve into our recent strategic advancements and ongoing research initiatives with you all. Over the past quarter, we have honed our service packages, emphasizing the synergy between our lab techniques and computational methodologies. This fusion is particularly pivotal due to the early phases of therapeutic development. While traditional methods have served us well, our evolved approach leverages above algorithms and data analytics, aiming for a more streamlined and potentially cost-effective process. Our infrastructure allows us to efficiently and seamlessly manage multiple projects concurrently amplifying the potential value for our clients. We are gearing up to showcase the synergistic power of computational technology and high-quality laboratory research to form the selection of functional derisked antibodies. During the speaker presentation in the AI and computational Discovery and Development Presentation track at the Festival of Biologics in Basel this October. Alongside this, we will be touring key European hubs, interacting with industry thought leaders and elucidating the capabilities of our latest platforms. In a collaborative stride with BioStrand, we have fine-tuned our service offerings to accelerate and optimize therapeutic lead nomination by integration of developed and cynical prediction technologies for epical billing of target identification and screening alongside in silico risk assessment into our well-respected laboratory services. This spectrum encompasses hands-on lab services augmented with AI-driven computational solutions. Our commitment remains unwavering as we continually adapt to the dynamic scientific landscape. Our B-cell discovery technology also have taken a leap forward. We've incorporated robotized method, enabling precise electrification of individual B-cells based on their unique functionalities. This automation not only expedited process, but also paves the way for potential treatments that regulate these cellular responses. We are eager to share these insights at the Festival of Biologics in Basel. Bispecific sector is on an accelerating trajectory, a persistent challenge has been ensuring the structural integrity of molecules. To tackle this, we have been refining our novel purification technique at our facility in Utrecht. This method integrates automation, ensuring consistent and high-quality production of bispecific. Complemented with our expertise, we are poised to cater the burgeoning demand. Neoantigens, which are elder proteins primarily found on tumor cells have peaked the interest of the medical community. IPA has been focused on developing novel methodologies to detect antibodies that specifically target with neoantigens. Leveraging our bispecific capabilities, we are working towards providing a comprehensive solution for clients keen on exploring this exciting therapeutic avenue. Our journey is characterized by thorough growth and naval adaptation by keeping a pose on industry trends and harnessing our technological expertise aspire to be trendsetters in the realm of accelerated AI-driven biotherapeutic development. I will now turn the microphone over to Dr. Jennifer Bath to provide some operational updates on IPA.\nJennifer Bath: Great. Thank you so much, Ilse. I'd like to share with you today some operational updates, in particular around our artificial intelligence and its integration into our wet lab capabilities. At the heart of our progress, is our commitment to enhancing our AI capabilities, in particular. We have developed a revenue strategy that leverages the power of our unique and patented technology, much of what you've heard about in the previous quarterly earnings call. This strategy focuses on combining our digital or in silico services with our renowned laboratory services. First, we are proud to mention that our digital services stand alone and in addition to that offer immense value to both new and existing programs. We are truly excited to showcase these new and distinguished services on-site at corporations throughout Boston and Cambridge for approximately a week long period at the end of this month. With regard to new platform capabilities, we are excited to say that we've recently secured projects utilizing multiple features of our platform, such as predicting the characteristics, safety and effectiveness of antibodies. Given the value of these features can add at various stages of antibody development, we've now made them a standard part of our service offering. IPA also now employs a novel digital analysis of antibodies and other proteins, focused on assessing potential clinical risks very early on. We can quickly screen countless antibodies and provide our clients with actionable reports. This in-depth analysis helps our clients make informed decisions about their clinical strategies. BioStrand has already completed several paid projects in this area, paving the way for a consistent revenue with our partners. Lastly, we are thrilled to introduce a groundbreaking feature in our LENSai platform. Now boasting a cutting-edge combination of our proprietary neuro-symbolic engine and advanced large language models, such as ChatGPT. This breakthrough allows us to answer some of the most challenging questions in life sciences with unparalleled precision and speed with the accuracy and transparency of LENSai and the dialogue function of ChatGPT. The type of questions cover a broad range and can either be general in nature or they can be very specific by the user. Our unique approach ensures accuracy and clarity and addresses the life science industry's need for both precision and explainability. We've already demonstrated early validation with internal research, and we are rolling this service out as we speak. I'd now like to turn the call over to Brad McConn, our Chief Financial Officer, to give you more insights into our financials from this first quarter.\nBrad McConn: Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone. I'll provide an overview of our financial results for the year before touching on our financial position as of the end of the period. As a reminder, all numbers I referenced are in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted. As we mentioned, IPA recorded total revenue of $5.7 million during the three months ended July 31, 2023, a 21.3% increase compared to the same period last year. Both our protein production and B-cell select platform realized impressive results during the quarter with our Utrecht and Victoria sites growing 44% and 25.5% year-over-year, respectively. Gross profit for the quarter totaled $2.8 million, an increase of $0.3 million compared to the prior year. While gross profit margin was 49.1% compared to 52.9% in fiscal 2023. Operating expenses totaled $7 million in Q1 as compared to $12.6 million during the same period last year. Research and development expenses totaled $0.4 million, a decrease of $5.7 million compared to fiscal 2023. This decrease is primarily related to a significant reduction in spend on the poly to antibody combination therapy as compared to last year. Research and development expenses during Q1 include $0.3 million in salary costs, including share-based payments that was allocated to research and development, along with $0.2 million in research expense. Sales and marketing expenses totaled $1.1 million during Q1 of fiscal 2024, which represents a small increase of $41,000 compared to the prior year. Expenditures during the first quarter included $0.8 million in salary costs, including share-based payments that was allocated to sales and marketing, along with $0.2 million in advertising costs. General and administrative expenses totaled $4.6 million during the first quarter as compared to $4.2 million during the same period last year. Increases include $0.1 million in salary costs and $0.1 million in interest recorded on the company's leases. Finally, amortization of intangibles decreased $0.3 million. As the intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisition of our of location, were fully amortized in the first month of the quarter. Moving on to other income. IPA recorded other income of $0.4 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $0.3 million during fiscal 2023. Other income included $0.3 million in grant income, $0.1 million in interest and other income and $0.1 million in unrealized foreign exchange loss. All told, IPA recorded a net loss of $3.6 million during the three months ended July 31, 2023 compared to a loss of $9.4 million during the first quarter of last year. Moving on to the balance sheet. IPA has held cash of $6.8 million as of July 31, 2023, compared to $8.4 million as of April 30, 2023, a decrease of $1.6 million during the quarter. If we look at our last five quarters, our burn was $10.6 million during Q1 of fiscal 2023, $5 million during Q2 of last year, $3.7 million in Q3, $3 million in Q4. And finally, as I mentioned, $1.6 million this quarter. During the period, cash used in operating activities totaled $0.7 million. While cash used in investing activities included $0.1 million in equipment purchases and $0.1 million for a deferred acquisition payment in connection with the BioStrand acquisition. Along with $0.1 million in proceeds from the sale of our investment in QBQ Holdings B.V. Cash used in financing activities included $0.4 million in lease payments. And with that, I'll turn it back to Julianne for Q&A.\nOperator: Thanks, Brad. Before Jennifer adds any closing remarks, we would like to open the floor to any questions from analysts and investors. Of note with the numerous live and virtual investor conferences this week, several investors and analysts have sent over questions in the past day, which we want to ensure are addressed, if they were not already clearly covered in the script content. In those instances, I will be reading those questions aloud for the members of the IPA management team. [Operator Instructions] And our first question on the phone line comes from Ramakanth Swayampakula from H.C. Wainright. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nSwayampakula Ramakanth: Thank you. Good morning, Jennifer. So a couple of quick questions. Just at a high level, I want to understand how the BioStrand acquisition, now that you have had BioStrand for more than a year now. How are you monetizing it? And also what – when should we expect BioStrand revenues coming from BioStrand to be material?\nJennifer Bath: Hi, RK. Thanks for joining us, and thank you for your thoughtful questions. So first of all, with regard to answering this question, in particular, also for those who may not have been with us at the end of the last fiscal year, earnings call, our most recent earnings call. I'll first like to point back and reference that fiscal year earnings call where we gave the outline of the three main pillars for monetizing BioStrand and along in addition with that also some milestones with timelines and revenue. As a brief summary here for the audience, for you RK, we have focused on the combined AI and wet lab services as a primary focus for the short-term revenue. And these are the service offerings that also inform and improve LENSai as they're being utilized for these clients. That LENSai is at the heart of everything we do, including all of our other pillars and service offerings that we are rolling out. We also again present a longer-term vision for our SaaS model, utilizing the analytical tools and data management to a life science companies and handling massive amounts of data to be organized and managed if they still choose. Also, they can use that to be analyzed using LENSai, and again, LENSai giving them the opportunity for that unparalleled and invaluable insight into these massive amounts of data, which right now at most companies are just being stored and actually costing the company's money without them being able to use that for analysis. And the other component there was this opportunity for companies to partner with BioStrand or in silico discovery programs, partnering relationships that obviously are invaluable to us because they provide us with a wealth of insight and data for BioStrand for training LENSai, but they also carry with them that opportunity for additional downstream financial payments, in the event that a partner chooses to carry forward with a program. So with regard to those shorter-term services, as I mentioned, we are really now embarking on a very focused output here where we are going into companies starting at the end of this month, specifically to showcase these services which to date have been available online and presented at a conference. But what we have noticed is an interest in multiple large pharmaceutical companies and midsized biotech companies and really getting to understand more how we compete with a few companies out there that offer these services. We have not given a timeline for when we expect, of course, that material revenue stream from that. But what we can say and kind of echoing back to some of the things that Dr. Duplantis has shared with us here. We're seeing that increase in interest. We continue to see queues with groups receiving both quotes and then executing on those to convert to sales orders. So the trend for us with regard to that shorter-term revenue certainly looks quite good. With regard to the SaaS model, we did give us some timelines around that with regard to the commitments that are required for investment in time, we're really looking at probably 12 to 18 months for the actual launch of the SaaS model. Most of those activities can be done internally by BioStrand on a service offering as well. So we are offering those opportunities for clients who want organization and management, but where we really see that potential for a massive shift in revenue and a major increase in the profit margins associated with that, of course, are around the official launch of that Software-as-a-Service. So we're really looking at around 12 to 18 months there and what we have outlined in the fiscal year earnings call was really the five-year trajectory with regard to how much of the market we believe we could corner and what that meant for BioStrand with regard to revenue. So hopefully that answers your question, RK.\nSwayampakula Ramakanth: I have one quick question. So very recently as you are just talking about it, the HYFT based in silico screening platform. I'm just trying to understand what sort of inquiries are you getting on this? And if there is at least a project or something that you can give us so that we understand as an example of what ability or what capability that you're actually providing, which is better than what you used to provide?\nJennifer Bath: Yes, absolutely. So yes, Barry I was going to say – I'll turn that over to you, but maybe start that – yes, but I'll start that real quickly with just making sure I tie that into this previous statement that a lot of that is also connected to a lot of the interest we have been getting into this targeted approach as well in the Boston area, specifically in response to many of these companies wanting to see the actual data we've produced on these platforms. Absolutely, Barry I will definitely turn it over to you as Head of Sales and Client Relations to give some further insights into those inquiries you receive.\nBarry Duplantis: Okay. So we have gained traction, and we are expecting revenue to begin shortly for programs using HYFT based screening. The primary type of increase that we're getting into this type of offering and BioStrand technologies in general are often based off of biological challenges that cannot or have not been successfully addressed in the wet lab. Examples of the type of programs that we're looking here or I guess, one of the easiest ones that comes to mind is situations where an in vivo platform for immunization or an in vitro platform for screening, where the targets that our clients are looking for are represented differently in the final stage than they are when we produce them as reagents. So in these traditional wet lab techniques, the gap between the reagent and the final – what the final product has to be is quite different. So that obviously makes it difficult to create antibodies that specifically target the final confirmational stage. So that's a lot of where the inquiries are coming, and that's what the HYFT based screening platform is designed to overcome.\nSwayampakula Ramakanth: Thank you, Barry. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Thank you for your questions, RK. Our first written question comes from Robert Wasserman from Benchmark Capital, and it reads, what is the current disposition of the Board? And how will that change following the annual meeting? With the pending resignation or non-election of Dr. Kuo, who will be the Chairman?\nJennifer Bath: Great. Okay. Well, thanks, first of all, to Robert Wasserman for providing that question. So first of all, I think what I'd really like to start with there is that the current Board, obviously, it has transitioned here over the last couple of weeks and it's working very constructively together, very collegially together to ensure that we focus on the strategies that are in line with the company's highest priority. In addition to that, we are working actively on rejuvenation of the Board for the upcoming AGM. Our focus is on bringing in seasoned professionals who have demonstrated excellence in establishing and steering prosperous companies in pioneering new therapeutic solutions. A good example of that is that Dr. Springer, who has now joined us. Mastering capital markets and harnessing the power of artificial intelligence. And then also a real key focus for us here are individuals who have adeptly guided NASDAQ-listed companies. And as for the chairperson position following Dr. Kuo’s anticipated departure of the Board is still in the process of deciding that. But we absolutely will keep our stakeholders informed as soon as a decision is reached.\nOperator: Thank you, Jennifer. His next question reads. Can you provide more color or info on the sales order for future fee-for-service stat $4.65 million that you mentioned on the 4Q earnings report. Is that a quarterly annual or longer-term figure or a combination of all three?\nBarry Duplantis: Yes. Thank you. I'll answer this one again. So the reference was to the total sales orders for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023. So sales orders are a recurring topic of discussion. And just to reiterate their significance, these represent future financial projections derived from agreements with clients during that specific time period. IPA then recognizes revenue from these sales orders as the work progresses on the associated project typically spending a 10 to 12-month period. It's essential that we emphasize that these are projections. And while they are our most reliable forecasting metric, the actual revenue generated by a program can vary up or down from the initial sales orders dependent upon the program's performance and then obviously, ongoing sales efforts within a program. So I also noted earlier, too, that the figures for sales orders do not encompass our IPA Europe Utrecht site as its workflow doesn't necessitate that financial step.\nOperator: Thank you, Barry. Robert's last question reads. Can you provide more detail on the R&D expense number relating to internal R&D efforts versus collaboration type programs?\nBrad McConn: Yes, sure. So I could take that one. When we think about our R&D spend, we have really two primary areas of expenditures and that can be on projects in Talem, which can be either purely internal or done with a partner. And then the other main area of focus is on the advancement of our fee-for-service offering. And so as the stage of those Talem assets has progressed and we're kind of through the heavy research and development portion of the project, we've gained significantly reduced R&D spend there. And as such, our R&D spend today and certainly, probably over the last couple of quarters is weighted much more towards the advancement of our fee-for-service offerings.\nOperator: Thank you, Brad. Those are all the questions from Robert. We have some questions from Will McHale from Ingalls & Snyder, and his first question reads, what is the opportunity to convert traditional wet lab CRO work to BioStrand in silico work? And how does that change the economics for IPA?\nBarry Duplantis: I'll answer this one again. So as mentioned earlier in the Q&A, BioStrand allows us to tackle biological problems that haven't been successfully addressed in the wet lab, this has been the central point of discussion with our partners in terms of the antibody discovery aspects of our service offerings. So we view these opportunities as additive to traditional wet lab work rather than a replacement, at least for the foreseeable future. That being said, it is worth highlighting the dedicated efforts of Ilse and team in driving the seamless integration of wet lab and in silico applications. This is particularly well done in the context of antibody characterization and risk mitigation. This effort will enhance the attractiveness and the strategy between both approaches and creates a compelling solution for our partners.\nOperator: Thank you, Barry. Will's next question reads, what is the long-term vision for data management platform? How does that fit with the CRO business?\nBarry Duplantis: Once again, I'll tackle this one. Priority in the technical development at BioStrand has been put on the analytical capabilities for antibody discovery and development. But this has not prevented us from also making progress in the development of the data management platform itself. So it's a crucial element that reinforces the synergy between our AI capabilities and the wet lab by streamlining our own data integration and processing. Moreover, this platform, we can not only offer to clients data management and organization capabilities but also analytical tools. Clients who engage with our platform will automatically immerse themselves in our ecosystem, experience the advantages it brings while also gaining access to a suite of SaaS tools available on the platform. This presents us with multiple opportunities for cross-selling and upselling, thereby enhancing our revenue potential. Moreover, it enables us to represent results in a secure and private environment, ensuring the utmost confidentiality for our clients. Additionally, it facilitates multiple presentation options that support an easy and interactive user experience, enhancing our client’s engagement and satisfaction.\nOperator: Thank you, Barry. Will's last question reads, could you provide any updates on Talem out-licensing?\nIlse Roodink: Yes, shall I take this question. This is Ilse. Yes as Brett already indicated, the bulk of our research and development and the efforts related to the assets Yes. They are considered largely complete, and we are looking into the out licensing of options happily. We have compiled comprehensive data packages for each, and our team is active to be in the process of seeking suitable licensing opportunities. Maybe it's worth note here that Talem has engaged, an interested party regarding one of the three priority programs, which we mentioned in the last earnings call. And for this program, we are currently in the process of conducting a final verification assay.\nOperator: Thank you, Ilse, and thank you to all who were able to join us today. I will now turn the call back over to Dr. Bath for any concluding remarks.\nJennifer Bath: Wonderful. Thank you, Julianne. As we wrap up today's earnings call, I think one thing we'd like to do is just really reflect on the transformative journey and ImmunoPrecise Antibodies than what we're embarking on here. The challenges of the past quarters have not deterred us. And instead, they've paved the way for a new era of growth and transformation. Our vision is sharpening. Our strategies are undergoing continuous refinement and our team continues to expand in strength and diversity. With the induction of esteemed professionals like Chris Buyse, Barry Springer and Dirk Witters to our Board, this underscores our unwavering commitment to excellence. We anticipate sharing insights into our evolving strategy and vision, which are currently in the process of being honed with our shareholders in due course following the AGM. This quarter's financial performance stands as a testament to our resilience and our burgeoning potential. With consecutive record revenues and strategic expansion, we've showcased our capability to not only navigate challenges but to flourish in the face of them. The dedication of our management team and the robustness of our services have been pivotal in achieving this success. We're also excited to highlight the two significant milestones that resonate with our strategic vision. The recent F-3 form filing and with the SEC is a calculated move to fortify our financial standing and broaden our reach to U.S. investors. This, along with the ongoing enhancements to our Board, emphasize our dedication to growth and excellence. To our esteemed shareholders, the enthusiasm and drive within our management team for IPA's future are unmistakable. We're not just hopeful, but we're assured about the journey ahead. With the recent changes the expertise we've incorporated and our forward-looking strategies. The horizon does look bright for us. Our commitment to delivering unmatched value remains steadfast. And we're poised to venture into the next exciting phase of growth and innovation. I think more than anything, we'd like to express our deep appreciation and our gratitude for the unwavering trust and support of our shareholders. Thank you again so much for joining us today.\nOperator: This concludes today's earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
