I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Shealy, Founder and CEO of Akoustis.\nï»¿Jeffrey Shealy: Thank you, Ken. And welcome everyone to our FY 2024 fiscal second quarter conference call.  Revenue in the December quarter was within our guided range of flat sequentially. During the December quarter, we had two customers that each made up greater than 10% of our reported revenue. XBAW-related sales accounted for the top 5 customers and 7 out of the top 10 customers. Our top 10 customers made up 58% of revenue. Our top 25 customers made up 74% of revenue.  In terms of regional sales, 3 of our top 10 customers were Asia based. Our top 36 customers made up 80% of our revenue, with 40% of our sales coming from Asia, followed by 47% of our sales coming from North America and 13% of our sales coming from Europe. Finally, our top two customers were Asia and US-based customers, respectively, and collectively made up 30% of sales.  Last year, we commented that the buildup in channel inventory, particularly at our Wi-Fi customers in the Asia region, would adversely impact our revenue in the second half of calendar 2023. Our revenue met our guided targets for September and December quarters. Today, we believe we have worked through the inventory issues from 2023, and we expect demand returning in Wi-Fi with strength in Wi-Fi 6E and first production demand in Wi-Fi 7.  Consistent with our early guidance for fiscal Q3 on last quarter's investor call, we reiterate our expectation to return to record quarterly revenue for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, up 18% to 25% sequentially.  The company continues to focus on expense and cost savings to significantly reduce cash burn moving forward. Ken will detail our ongoing activities and impact on reducing our cash burn during his upcoming comments.  I would now like to take a moment to discuss updates involving the company's activity related to the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Regarding CHIPS Act funding, there are two detailed updates to share with investors.  First, during the December quarter, we became members of three microelectronics ME Commons Hubs focused on electronic warfare for the Department of Defense. Membership to these hubs is critical as it allows access to be part of the hub proposal team for new government research programs.  We currently have two active EW proposals under one hub membership, with one of the proposals potentially worth several million dollars annually, beginning in the second half of calendar year 2024. Furthermore, we are currently pursuing memberships with additional ME hub centers, and we'll detail our efforts and progress moving forward.  Second, the CHIPS Act of 2022 included a provision for a 25% refundable investment tax credit, or CHIPS ITC, on investments in facilities that manufacture semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment that were placed in service after December 31, 2022. We currently estimate the amount of the refundable tax credit applicable to Akoustis to be $3.7 million to $4.7 million over the next 12 to 15 months.  Next I would like to discuss several updates in our primary target markets beginning with Wi-Fi. Our first milestone for the December quarter in Wi-Fi was to receive a design win in a next generation Wi-Fi 7 solution with a tier 1 US-based carrier.  Our carrier partner has awarded us design wins for two high band XBAW filters for Wi-Fi 7. Further, we received prototype orders to support a production ramp in the second half of calendar year 2024.  Our second milestone was to secure multiple design wins for our tier 1 enterprise class customers Wi-Fi 7 suite of routers. We announced this design win last week along with visibility on volume orders to support the production ramp. We support this new platform with a suite of advanced filters covering both wideband and narrowband solutions. Also, our first mass produced aluminum scandium nitride single-crystal XBAW filter is to be qualified for production for this customer's application.  Our third milestone was to secure a design win for a Wi-Fi 7 solution with a tier 1 enterprise class OEM. We announced this completion of this milestone in our January 10 press release. This customer is our second tier 1 customer to adopt multiple wideband and narrowband solutions covering 5 GHz and 6 GHz Wi-Fi 7 for a 4x4 multi-user MIMO AP platform. We received prototype orders to support a production ramp, which is slated to begin in the second half of calendar year 2024.  Looking ahead in the March quarter, we expect to ramp XBAW filter production for two programs in Wi-Fi 7 at a tier 1 enterprise class customer. In addition, we expect to ramp XBAW filter production for Wi-Fi 7 with a tier 1 enterprise class OEM and we expect to secure a design win for a Wi-Fi 7 solution with a tier 1 enterprise class OEM.  Next, I would like to discuss our recent developments in the 5G mobile market. During the December quarter, we recognized filter sales, which incorporated our WLP package to our tier 1 RF component customer. This customer was a top 10 customer on a revenue basis.  Also, in the December quarter, we expected to deliver the first of three Wi-Fi filters to our tier 2 5G mobile RF front end module making customer. We've contracted with this customer for three filters. We shipped the first of three filters. The second filter is releasing to the fab this month. And the third filter is currently in the design phase of the process.  Finally, we successfully engaged a fifth mobile partner offering our XBAW process and foundry for their module and discrete product needs. We have shipped this partner multiple XBAW dye for engineering evaluation, for a future multiplexer application for the mobile market.  Our anticipated milestones for the March quarter include deliver the second of three revised Wi-Fi filters to our tier 2 5G mobile RF front end module making customer.  And now, I will discuss our progress in our network infrastructure business. During the December quarter, we completed the redesign of our new and improved 5G band 41 and 5G US 3.8 GHz network infrastructure filter solutions. We successfully sampled the band 41 filter earlier this month, and we currently are evaluating the performance of our 3.8 GHz filter in engineering as we prepare for sampling.  During the quarter, we experienced softness in XBAW filter shipments to our 5G network infrastructure customers. However, we expect modest growth of shipments to return in the March quarter.  For the March quarter, we expect to secure a foundry order for development of up to four 5G/4G LTE XBAW WLP dye with a tier 1 SATCOM provider. Second, we expect to gain approved supplier status and achieve a design win with a tier 1 infrastructure customer, and finally, we expect to complete in our development and deliver band in 104 samples to a tier 1 network infrastructure customer.  Finally, before handing the call off to Ken, I would like to provide an update on our defense and other markets business. During the December quarter, 2 out of our top 10 customers were in our defense and other business category. And I will begin with an update on our published milestones for the quarter.  First, as we announced on January 29, we secured a BAW filter design win for an automotive wireless battery management system, or WBMS, solution using a tier 1 IC reference design. We expect a production ramp in the March quarter of calendar 2025.  Second, we completed the qualification of the optimized second XBAW resonator for a key customer in the timing control market. Now that this qualification is complete, the design is released for limited production. The resonator is used in a tunable oscillator application scheduled for production in the second half of calendar 2024.  Third, we delivered our first X band BAW filter using Akoustis' advanced XP3F technology to a tier 1 defense customer. We met with this customer last month and receive positive feedback and expect this engagement to continue for X band phased array radar applications.  As previously mentioned, our biggest success in the defense and other market segments was the introduction of our new XP3F technology, which incorporates a new revolutionary patented multi-layer nano material that incorporates our single-crystal piezo electric material. This new nano material was developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, to scale the XBAW technology to frequencies up to 18 GHz.  During the December quarter, we began work on our multimillion dollar phase 2 contract option, which extends our current DARPA COFFEE program and funding through December 2024.  During the December quarter, we continued shipments supporting a new DARPA contract unrelated to the DARPA COFFEE contract, which requires high performance custom resonators for timing control applications. This customer was a top 10 customer for the December quarter.  In addition, we submitted a proposal on a new multimillion dollar program with the Office of Naval Research to fund RF filter multiplexers incorporating our XBAW and P3F materials technology, which, if awarded, could be announced as early as Q2 of calendar 2024 and begin in summer 2024.  In our GDSI business, we serviced 148 customers during the December quarter, and the average customer spend is approximately 17% over the same quarter last year.  As mentioned earlier, Akoustis has established memberships with three regional hubs, and GDSI has at least five additional applications pending with remaining hubs, which we expect to convert to memberships by Q2 of calendar 2024. One key customer milestone for the quarter was the successful completion of a supplier quality audit for an FDA approved diagnostic chip aimed at real time PCR results. Finally, GDSI saw double-digit increase in new quoting activity over the prior quarter, which we will push to convert to new orders to grow the business.  For the March quarter, in the defense and other market segment, we are expecting to deliver the new XP3F PDK to two customers for ongoing foundry engagements and complete the design and sample of a new 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi CPE automotive XBAW filter to multiple customers.  And now I would like to hand the call over to Ken to go through our financial highlights. \nKenneth Boller : Thank you, Jeff. For the second quarter ended December 31, 2023, the company reported revenue of $7 million, which is in line with our prior guidance and flat over the prior quarter ending September 30, 2023. However, this represents an increase of 20% year-over-year.  On a GAAP basis, operating loss was $15 million for December quarter, driven by revenue of $7 million, offset by labor costs of $8 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.2 million and other operational costs totaling $10.8 million.  It is noteworthy that our labor and other operating costs have declined sequentially. As a result, GAAP net loss per share was $0.21.  CapEx spending for Q2 was $1.6 million, completing our New York fab tool capacity expansion project to 500 million filters per year. Cash used in operating activities was $11.3 million, which included additional payroll costs associated with our expense reduction efforts, increased legal costs and increased AR and other, which will be converted to cash in the March quarter.  The inventory channel build-up in Wi-Fi is behind us and we continue to receive design wins and introduce new products. As a result, we have backlog to support a return to record quarterly revenue in the March quarter, with quarterly sales expected to be up 18% to 25%.  On the expense front, we have undertaken aggressive expense reduction and cost saving measures that we estimate will reduce our operating cash flow burn rate by 30% to 38% sequentially in the March quarter. Furthermore, with the expense reductions and cost saving actions in place, we expect that operating cash burn will drop another 30% to 40% in the June quarter.  Given the top line projections, the CHIPS ITC refunds and full impact of recent cost savings, we continue to expect operating cash flow breakeven later this year in the December quarter.  The company sits with a strong balance sheet after the recent completion of $11.5 million underwritten common stock offering announced in late January.  And I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for his closing comments.\nJeffrey Shealy : Thank you, Ken. The market opportunity for our patented high frequency XBAW and XP3F filters continues to be substantial. We currently have approximately 189 issued patents and patents pending, providing a substantial IP moat around our technology.  We continue to work aggressively to achieve each of our stated objectives, and we will continue to provide updates on our execution against these objectives as we progress.  I want to emphasize to investors that management continues to focus on improving our income statement. As per our guidance, we expect to achieve record quarterly revenues in the March quarter. We are diligently pursuing product cost savings to lower operating expenses and improve gross margin. We have undertaken necessary steps to reduce our operating cash burn in the coming quarters. We believe this is prudent in the economic environment that we are facing.  Further, I appreciate our employees for their hard work, passion and dedication and working together to position our company for growth in the quarters ahead.  Finally, I also wish to thank our shareholders who continue to support the company.  And with that, I would like to open the call for questions from the investment community. Operator, please go ahead with the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Anthony Stoss with Craig-Hallum Capital Group.\nAnthony Stoss: Nice progress. Maybe for Ken, can you talk about, I guess, the new revenue per quarter for breakeven in Q4, what you think gross margins might be in that quarter to get you to breakeven? And also, maybe just kind of lay out a linear what you expect OpEx each quarter throughout the year?\nKenneth Boller: We comment a little about revenue for operating cash flow breakeven. I will say that we had significant expense reductions starting in the September-October timeframe, and we continue to do so. We have about $14 million annualized reductions. Now we have additional cost savings that push those reductions above $20 million annualized. So that also somewhat brings down the need for the gross margin and the revenue in the quarter of operating cash flow breakeven. But I still predict that to be in the â come down a little bit in the $11 million to $15 million range per quarter of revenue to achieve operating cash flow breakeven. And that would also assume a margin of 20% to 25% in that quarter.  On the OpEx side, I think you touched on that as well. Those numbers have come down and they are going to continue to come down as well. I predict our operating expense line on our GAAP financial statements will be more in the range of about $10 million per quarter by the time we get a full quarter of annualized savings and that we get operating cash flow breakeven.  And we talked about margin improvements as well. We're undertaking a number of measures internally to improve our margins. We're focusing on some of our existing parts where we have high laminate costs. Some of those costs, we can bring down on the laminate side as much as half of what it currently is. We also are introducing a number of new products. We have about 17 products in production currently. That number is going to go to more than double the next year. So we're introducing more products and all those products have a lower cost structure to them, particularly on the backend side as they're smaller form factor.  I think I answered all your questions. If I missed one today, let me know and I'll go back on it.\nAnthony Stoss: Jeff, I'd love to hear your views. It sounds like the inventory on the Wi-Fi is now normalized. Maybe from a design perspective, what you see? And if you're going to double your products going into next year, what do you think about design activity or number of wins?\nï»¿Jeffrey Shealy: You touched on several things. Let me start with the Wi-Fi inventory. I think we emphasized that in prepared comments. We started seeing that lift with orders as well as ongoing design wins. And we started seeing that back in the October-November timeframe, and that's why we were comfortable kind of providing the guidance back to growth and record quarterly revenue.  In terms of just estimated, we provide in the prepared comments what we expect milestones at least over the next quarter. You can see additional design wins there. But in terms of number of design wins over the next year, let me ask Dave to kind of touch base because he's a little closer to customer. \nDavid Aichele: A couple of comments I'll make, just following up on Jeff's statements. The two Wi-Fi 7 design wins that we just announced, those are in enterprise class programs. And there's some custom filters that we've done for these two customers. And they will turn into standard products that we're going to market to the rest of the industry as well.  The dollar content in these are almost 2x what we have with Wi-Fi 6E programs. So I think that's significant. That's what we're trying to track now is significant design wins that we'll see appreciable revenue.  In addition to the other design win we announced with the Wi-Fi 6E program, which is more of a consumer based, the volumes on that are good. A lot of these are with the new products that Ken mentioned that were released.  The two that are getting the most traction right now that we expect to see multiple design wins per quarter with Wi-Fi 7, now that certification is approved and moving forward and there's a lot of momentum â there was some slowdown last year on Wi-Fi 6E transition into Wi-Fi 7. So, we see that picking up. And these two parts are in a smaller form factor that's going to service the 5.5 and the 6.5 GHz.  We also have investments that we're making on 2.4 GHz as well, so that we can bundle all three. We focus mainly on high frequency, but recognizing that we do have demand down at lower frequency as well, we can service that.  So we expect this momentum to be pretty strong through 2024 calendar year, with a lot of the Wi-Fi 7, and you can expect us to make every quarter announcements on the design wins and give you guidance on one of those projected ramps.\nOperator: Our next question is from Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities.\nCraig Ellis: Congratulations on getting the cost structure down and moving closer to cash flow breakeven. I want to start with a follow up to the prior question. So it seems from the prepared remarks and the comments just provided in Q&A that a lot of the momentum in in Wi-Fi is around enterprise products. And so, I was hoping to get some further color on what you're seeing on the consumer side and how you would expect the mix of consumer and enterprise to play out as we go through this year.\nDavid Aichele: A lot of our activity has been with the enterprise and the system volumes are not as high in the hundreds of thousands. But as I commented earlier, the dollar content is pretty significant with these, particularly when you're looking at filters that can range in the 20 to 30 per system.  And we've got a unique position here that we're enabling these systems based on our product portfolio of narrowband and wideband. So, that's good to continue to increase our customer base there and it's usually pretty sticky. Once you have a customer in this sector and you maintain a good customer intimacy and technical support, you will continue to support the new design wins. The one market segment that you didn't mention, though, that is pretty strong for us also is the carrier side and we just did a press release yesterday, and that was for a Wi-Fi 7 program that we got designed into. And if you look at that press release, it lists this subscriber base that they have up to 32 million.  So, those type of volumes that we see on the carrier side, both for Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7, puts it up competitive to the type of volume you see on the consumer side. And then, the press release we did several weeks ago was for the consumer grade.  So we are starting to penetrate the consumer grade. That's been a lower priority just based on â it is usually more price sensitive and they go after older technology. But we're seeing that those architectures go into higher MIMO count. And also, with the requirements of Wi-Fi 7 due to latency and the channel bandwidth, the higher performance BAW filters in the smaller form factor is more critical. So their negotiations on price is less important. It's more on performance. \nï»¿Jeffrey Shealy: I just wanted to follow on Dave, summarize the Wi-Fi segment. One of the things I wanted to make sure we added in here was just some of the momentum in the defense and other markets. And that's really been driven by what's going on not only with our success in the COFFEE program â I think we mentioned that prepared comments, not only starting up the phase 2, but there's definitely a follow on activity to that at the systems level. And we alluded in the prepared comments on some momentum in the contract.  That also is supported by these research hubs that are in place that we have current proposals in place. We're pretty bullish on being able to secure funding â a follow-on funding for the XP3F technology, which, as you know, allows us to access much higher frequencies.\nCraig Ellis: The follow-up is for Ken, and it's really just a clarification on two things. The first one related to those comments. Ken, as we think about sequential revenue growth and the scope 3Q, it would seem that it stacks up as being significantly led by enterprise Wi-Fi followed by defense and then networking. Is that the case? Can you just clarify what the CapEx outlook is for calendar 2024? And to the extent there's any linearity profile that you can share, that would be helpful too.\nKenneth Boller: I'll spend a little bit on CapEx spend. So we've been mentioning over the past few quarters that we're completing our 500 million filter capacity expansion. That has been completed. We have that capacity. Certainly, we talked about operating cash flow breakeven and the revenues needed. But that capacity is well beyond what that revenue is. We do not anticipate any real material spend in CapEx for the remainder of calendar year 2024. There are a few open projects that we'll finish. There are a few CapEx items I just come across on everyday business as machines possibly break down or we need a new small type of equipment like an analyzer or something of that sort. But I expect that spend for the remainder of the year to be in the hundreds of thousands per quarter or less.\nï»¿Jeffrey Shealy: I guess, Craig, to your question on the Q3 revenue, just trying to give you visibility on that, we're â good, strong backlog to that. And that's why you've seen the guidance being in that 18% to 25%.  The good news is that the slowdown we saw, and we talked about the inventories under control, we started seeing the pick back up on some of the legacy Wi-Fi 6E programs as they make transition to the Wi-Fi 7 program.  So one example is our enterprise tier 1 customer that we've announced in the past. Their volumes are picking back up on the Wi-Fi 6E and we're already starting to get appreciable Wi-Fi 7 preproduction orders that we're ramping. And then the same thing with carrier Wi-Fi 6E program has picked up from reductions in their inventories. So that demand is going on as they transition into the Wi-Fi 7.  So, that's three examples as we also have other customers picking up. And introduction in the Wi-Fi 7, we're starting to see significant pull on our two new products. So there's lack of activity there. The network side has slowed down. If you look at 5G overall, Nokia, Ericsson, others in that sector have had poor quarterly earnings, and so that has slowed down the 5G deployments. So there's still some demand on the small cells, but that's going to be less of a factor this quarter and next quarter we expect it to pick up with obviously the current products, but also some of the engagements that we made in the [indiscernible].\nCraig Ellis: Finally, Ken, you mentioned AR would improve in the fiscal third quarter? Do you expect that to fully normalize? Or does that play out through the fiscal second half of the year? \nKenneth Boller: Craig, at the end of December, we had some AR build up on our balance sheet. That was due to a lot of year-end orders that shipped out towards the end of December that we will collect in this quarter, Q3. There were also some timing issues, particularly with a large program that we have on the NRE side with the government. We can build them and receive money, according to a set schedule. So, that's also in our other receivables, other asset section, and we'll collect that in this quarter as well. And I expect that to normalize out throughout the remainder of the year.\nOperator: And our next question is from Suji Desilva with ROTH-MKM.\nSuji Desilva: Congrats on the progress here. Maybe a longer term question, Jeff. Given you have multiple segments that seem to have opportunity here and promise, what do you think in a year or two are the larger sort of segment contributors? I would think it would be mobile, but the defense programs sound like, with these hub memberships, they could be particularly as well. So, any kind of qualitative thoughts there would be helpful.\nï»¿Jeffrey Shealy: If you look at activity, I think we've outlined quite a bit, going from Wi-Fi 6E to Wi-Fi 7, you see not only the content increase, Dave touched on the wideband and narrowband portfolio that we have.  The other thing that maybe didn't come through is the ASPs. The ASPs in the Wi-Fi 7, that's favorable for us. So we're kind of mixing into new platforms, which certainly have starting ASPs that are higher. So we're very bullish with the content. Dave outlined 2x to 4x of additional content. So we're pretty excited about that.  If you look over in the defense segment, David indicated, it has slowed down. But we do see that picking up through the year. So, while it's small â and we do expect that business to roughly triple over the next year, if kind of you look at some of the internal modeling. So Wi-Fi, we expect very strong performance there. On the defense side, several contract programs, and we mentioned in the prepared comments that we would be expecting, if awarded, at least one of those contracts would begin mid-year. And we continue on with the phase two at DARPA. And then that has spawned some additional activity in the foundry. So that's strong. And also, some of the new spin-off programs that have come there.  You mentioned mobile. So I'll touch on that. We have been addressing. We've got foundry activity ongoing there, where we're providing filters for fully integrated solutions. We'll see how that plays out. But we mentioned in the prepared comments that we shipped the first filter. There's two additional filters that are in the design and fabrication phase. So that can be a contributor.  What I what I will say, though, kind of overarching is if you look at the model that we're charging to, the model would be upside to the model that we're projecting for the full year. And so, as we talked about getting the cash flow breakeven at the end of the year, and we do expect that cash flow to be a little lumpy going through the year because we got ITC credits and the timing of those, Ken mentioned some of the timing challenges. But, overall, the mobile would be upside to the plan. And with strong performance in defense, Wi-Fi as well as network on a percentage growth basis.\nï»¿Jeffrey Shealy: Jeff, that's very helpful caller on what's embedded in your expectations here. Second questions on the â I guess the new single crystal product you're sampling and just understand the competitive landscape again and whether the single crystal product expands your competitive advantage, just the color on that and whether that opens up markets or whether it's kind of continuous across the products you're doing into that new one.\nï»¿Jeffrey Shealy: I'll start with that and then ask Dave to kind of follow in. But that particular product that we mentioned that's going in a new Wi-Fi 7 design, we're utilizing that to obtain some performance enhancements that we think are differentiated. It is amongst the narrowband designs that we're selling.  Again, just a reminder, the Wi-Fi 7 incorporates both wideband and narrowband. We have multiple narrowband custom designs, which there really are no second source for. So, we're not having to compete with a second source on those. And so, that helps us with our bundling activities. So that's in terms of the single crystal.  And maybe Dave wants to add anything else there. \nDavid Aichele: Suji, I'll comment two things really with the single crystal, the development that we've been doing for the last couple of years to introduce [indiscernible] with the aluminum nitride, has enabled us to really service the narrowband and the wideband filters for certain market segments. So, the single crystal gives us some advantages on power handling with some of these applications where you've got this really steep rejection and a narrow transition window. Also, we've seen some improvement in harmonics, which are critical for some of these [indiscernible] type applications.  The other thing is, it's a building block of XP3F, which, again, is a unique feature of Akoustis. And the technical community recognizes that and that this is a manufacturing process with this multilayer nano material compared to other technologies that DARPA is funding. So, it's gaining pretty significant interests from the defense industry base, but also from the 5G sector that's looking at â or I should say, the cellular sector that's looking at 6G for FR3 and then also the SATCOM market.  So, the single crystal is a good building block for discrete devices and also for these high performance technologies like the XP3F.\nSuji Desilva: My last question is just an update, if you can, on the litigation with Qorvo, that'd be helpful.\nï»¿Jeffrey Shealy: Regarding the lawsuit Qorvo filed against Akoustis in Delaware, the case has reached a point where I can share Akoustis' view that the facts do not support the wide ranging allegations made by Qorvo. Akoustis filed a motion for partial summary judgment on February 1. And if granted in full, this motion would dispense with a majority of Qorvo's complaints, everything but the patent claims.  But I'll add that the company is well positioned on the patent claims. As mentioned in prior calls, the company has developed design updates to demonstrate with real world data that XBAW filters do not use Qorvo's patents.  The motion we filed also asks the court to confirm that these designs do not infringe one of the two Qorvo patents at issue. The other Qorvo patent expires this summer.  Akoustis also believes Qorvo's damage experts use faulty methods and assumptions to develop key parts of Qorvo's estimate of damages. Akoustis has filed a motion to exclude that testimony. This motion represents an additional challenge to key parts of Qorvo's claims.  Please keep in mind, even if the court ultimately does not grant Akoustis' motions, the defects in Qorvo's case will remain hurdles Qorvo would have to overcome at any trial.  Qorvo has filed its own motion for partial summary judgment, but this motion is limited to a ruling on the validity of Qorvo patents. No matter the outcome of the motion, Qorvo will still bear the burden of proving Akoustis products infringe Qorvo patents, notwithstanding all the engineering performed by Akoustis to support its defense in the case.  Now turning to the lawsuit filed by Akoustis against Qorvo in federal court in the Eastern District of Texas, this case is beginning to gather steam. As a reminder, this lawsuit alleges Qorvo is infringing a patent licensed exclusively to Akoustis by Cornell University, as described in past calls. Qorvo has filed a motion to dismiss the case and a motion to strike Akoustis' infringement contentions.  The Court held a hearing on Qorvo's motion to strike on January 10, 2024. After hearing both sides, the court denied Qorvo's motion to strike. As a result, this case is moving forward at full steam.\nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.\nï»¿Jeffrey Shealy: This is Jeff. I want to thank everybody for your time today. I did want to point out that one typo that we had in the prepared comments was â we actually sampled the 3.8 GHz and shipped samples of that 3.8 GHz and that was not the Band 41. So I just want to clarify that before we end the call.  With that, we look forward to speaking with you during our next update call to discuss the current quarter's execution against our milestones that we discussed today, as well as future expectations.  And with that, I'd like to wish everybody a great day. And thank you and goodbye.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation."

I would now like to turn the call over to Jeff Shealy, Founder and CEO of Akoustis.\nJeff Shealy: Thank you Ken, and welcome everyone to our fiscal first quarter conference call. Revenue in the September quarter was within our guided range of down 15% sequentially. During the September quarter, we had one customer that made up greater than 10% of our revenue. XBAW related sales accounted for the top five customers and seven out of the top 10 customers. Our top 10 customers made up 59% of revenue. Our top 25 customers made up 74% of revenue. In terms of regional sales from our top 35 customers, which make up 80% of our revenue, 53% of those sales came from Asian customers followed by 35% of sales came from North American customers, and 12% of our sales came from European customers. Earlier this calendar year, we commented on the build-up in channel inventory particularly at our Wi-Fi customers in the Asia region. As we stated on last quarter's call, we expected two quarters of slowdown as we transition and ramp to new Wi-Fi AP platforms, work through a slowdown in the infrastructure segment, and transition a portion of our defense activity to new contract business. Consistent with our guidance on last quarter's investor call, we expect revenue for the December quarter to be $7 million or flat sequentially. In reaction to the slowdown in the market, the company implemented two rounds of meaningful expense and cost savings plans to significantly reduce cash burn moving forward. Ken will detail our activities and impact on reducing our cash burn during his upcoming comments. However, looking around the corner, at the March quarter, we are seeing signals of inventory channel clearing. We are presently delivering new, lower-cost RF filter products and are receiving multiple new design wins and new Wi-Fi AP platforms with more RF filter content in early calendar 2024. As a first look, we expect to return to record quarterly revenue for the March quarter in the range of $8.3 million to $8.8 million or a sequential increase of 18% to 25%. We will update the March quarter guidance during next quarter's investor call. I would now like to take a moment to discuss updates involving the company's activity related to the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. Regarding CHIPS Act funding, there are four updates to share with investors. First, in mid-September, our Microelectronics Commons proposal focused on EW Tech Hub (ph) was not selected by the DoD. According to the September 20 announcement made by the government, the majority of the eight DoD Tech Hub awards went to major universities across the U.S. Second, on October 23, Senator Schumer announced that the Greater Rochester region was selected as a prestigious Tech Hub opening significant federal funds from the Department of Commerce to boost critical supply chains in upstate New York. Akoustis is a member of the Tech Hub consortium and will pursue meaningful opportunities with the Tech Hub residing in our backyard in upstate New York. Third, the CHIPS Act of 2022 includes a provision for a 25% refundable investment tax credit or CHIPS ITC on investments in facilities that manufacture semiconductors or semiconductor manufacturing equipment that were placed into service after December 31, 2022, we estimate the amount of the refundable tax credit applicable to Akoustis to be $3.5 million to $4 million over the next 18 months. And fourth and finally, regarding our proposed expansion of our domestic manufacturing footprint, including both semiconductors and advanced packaging at our New York campus under the Department of Commerce CHIPS for America program. We have completed a first pre-application with the DOC. The CHIPS Program Office or CPO of the DOC has received the pre-application submitted by Akoustis Technologies, Inc. The CPO recommends that we move forward and submit a revised pre-application addressing questions raised in our original application. Hence, our next step in the process is to file a revised pre-application once we complete a strategic review with our potential semiconductor partners, who require a partner to manufacture semiconductor materials, wafers, and/or packaging on our New York manufacturing campus. Next, I would like to discuss several updates in our primary target markets beginning with Wi-Fi. Our first milestone for the September quarter was to receive a design win for next generation Wi-Fi 7 with a consumer focused OEM. We delivered a total of three design wins on the consumer front with all programs currently planned to begin production ramp in the March quarter of calendar 2024. Two programs are 4x4 MIMO architectures and the third program is a 2x2 MIMO architecture, all utilizing our recently released Wide Bandwidth XBAW RF filter solutions in the high band spectrum. Our second milestone was to secure a design win for a next generation Wi-Fi 7 solution with a Tier 1 U.S.-based carrier. We remain confident that this carrier will launch with our filters on their platform, but we have moved this milestone to the December quarter in order to see volume shipments to validate our milestone. Our third milestone was to secure multiple RF filter design wins for our Tier 1 enterprise class customers Wi-Fi 7 suite of routers and access points. We have been aggressively developing and qualifying these parts for our customer and have made shipments to our customer over the past few months and expect to announce this design win in the December quarter. Also during the September quarter, we announced the introduction of our latest single crystal doped piezoelectric materials into a key product which is slated to ramp with an upcoming Wi-Fi 7 enterprise customer. These advanced materials are utilized to allow greater design margin and flexibility to the customer in the design of their system. While the overall Wi-Fi market has been impacted over the past 12 months by excess inventory and slowing Wi-Fi AP demand post-COVID, we see signs of reduced inventory in the channels for existing volume programs, along with new platforms launching in early 2024. Looking ahead in the December quarter, we expect to announce a design win for a next generation Wi-Fi 7 solution with a Tier 1 U.S.-based carrier. Further, we plan to secure multiple design wins for our Tier 1 enterprise class customers Wi-Fi 7 suite of routers, and we plan to secure a design win for Wi-Fi 7 solution with a Tier 1 enterprise class OEM. Next, I would like to discuss our recent developments in the 5G mobile market. During the September quarter, we made no new shipments to our Tier 1 RF component customer. The slowdown in shipments is due to a slowdown in marketing and adoption of the product in the China market, our customers' inability to secure a production slot on a new design program in the Tier 1 market as well as other market headwinds. During the September quarter, we expected to receive an order for a 2.4 gigahertz Wi-Fi filter for our Tier 2 5G RF front end module customer. We received not only an XBAW foundry order for the 2.4 gigahertz band, but the customer also added two additional high frequency Wi-Fi bands. This customer has completed previous design evaluation and has down selected the final design for release in the first half of calendar year 2024. With the slowdown and headwinds in the mobile market, we have been focusing our resources on near-term opportunities in the Wi-Fi, 5G infrastructure, and automotive segment. However, our anticipated milestones for the December quarter include, we expect to deliver the first of the three Wi-Fi filters to our Tier 2 5G mobile RF front-end module making customer, and finally, we expect to engage a fifth mobile partner offering our XBAW process and foundry for their module and discrete product needs. I will now discuss our progress in our network infrastructure business. During the September quarter, we experienced strong XBAW filter shipments to our CBRS customers targeting the U.S. market. However, we experienced minimal shipments in our small cell RF filters in the September quarter. Overall, we are seeing the 5G ORAN and RAN market slow in the December quarter as operators take inventory of existing deployments. We do expect the 5G small cell market to begin to improve in the March quarter and throughout calendar 2024 as carriers throughout the U.S., Europe, the Middle East, and Africa continue to deploy sub 5 gigahertz networks. Regarding our milestone from the September quarter, we received a design win for our XBAQ RF filters from a Tier 2 network infrastructure OEM for a massive MIMO base station. The radio design includes 64 TRX paths with one filter in the transmit path and one filter in the receive path. Altogether, we have 128 filters of content in the radio unit and expect production to begin ramping in the second quarter of calendar 2024. For the December quarter, we expect to complete the redesign and sample of our new and improved 5G Band 41 and 5G U.S. 3.8 gigahertz network infrastructure filter solutions. The redesign of these filters pushed into the December quarter, given engineering priorities related to near term Wi-Fi business. Finally, before handing the call off to Ken, I would like to provide an update on our defense and other markets business. It is noteworthy that six out of our top 10 customers are in our defense and other businesses category and I will begin with an update on our published milestones for the September quarter. First, we made steady progress on securing a design win for an automotive wireless battery management system or WBMS solution used in a Tier 1 IC reference design and we expect to close out this milestone in the December quarter. Second, we received a specification change from a key customer which delayed the start of the product qualification of our second XBAW resonator for the timing control market. At this point, we already started the qualification and plan to complete this product qualification in the December quarter. Beyond our published milestones, we achieved other notable milestones during the quarter in this segment. As mentioned in the past, our biggest success in the defense and other markets segment was the introduction of our new XP3F technology, which incorporates a new revolutionary patented multi-layer nanomaterial that incorporates our single crystal piezoelectric material. This new nanomaterial was developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, to scale the XBAW technology to frequencies up to 18 gigahertz. At the end of the September quarter, we were awarded a multi-million dollar Phase II contract option, which extends our current DARPA COFFEE contract to $4.8 million, including base and exercise options. The new Phase II contract extends the funding for the program through December of 2024. During the September quarter, we received a purchase order as a foundry supplier supporting a new DARPA contract unrelated to our current DARPA COFFEE contract, which requires high performance, custom resonators for timing control applications. Further, we completed initial wafer shipments from our New York Fab during the September quarter, and we expect additional shipments over the next few quarters. In addition, we achieved a design win at an international engineering and technology company supplying timing products for an electric meter application and we have received purchase orders for more than 300,000 pieces of initial volumes with scheduled delivery now into Q3 fiscal year 2024. For the December quarter and the defense and other market segments, we are expecting to achieve a design win of at least one of the following: crystal oscillator, BAW filter, and/or SAW filter used in an automotive wireless battery management system solution, used in a Tier 1 IC reference design. Also, we plan to complete the qualification of the optimized second XBAW resonator for a key customer in the timing control market. And we expect to deliver an X-Band BAW filter utilizing Akoustis advanced XP3F technology to a Tier 1 defense customer. And now, I would like to hand the call over to Ken to go through our financial highlights.\nKen Boller: Thank you, Jeff. For the first quarter and at September 30, 2023, the company reported revenue of $7 million, which is a decrease of 16% over the prior quarter and at June 30, 2023, but still represents an increase of 26% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, operating loss was $21.7 million for the September quarter, driven by revenue of $7 million, offset by labor costs of $9.4 million, depreciation and amortization of $3.2 million, and other operational costs totaling $16.1 million. As a result, GAAP net loss per share was $0.28. On a non-GAAP basis, operating loss was $19.1 million, and non-GAAP net loss per share was $0.27. CapEx spending for Q1 was $4.2 million, primarily to enhance our backend processing capabilities and complete our New York fab tool capacity to 500 million filters per year. Cash used in operating activities was $13.1 million, which included approximately $3.4 million of year-end expenses for $9.7 million net. In a December quarter, as indicated in our prior call, we expected revenue to be flat given the broader market weakness along with the associated inventory correction. We continue to receive design wins and introduce new products that we expect a return to record quarterly revenue in the March quarter of up 18% to 25%. We'll update this guidance during our next quarterly investor call. On the expense front, over the past several months, we have undertaken significant expense reductions and cost saving measures that we estimate will reduce our operating cash flow burn rate below $8 million for the December quarter. Given the top line projections, the CHIPS ITC refund, and a full quarter of cost savings, we currently expect operating cash burn to be below $6 million in the March quarter, with operating cash flow break even less than one year away. The company exited the September quarter with $25.8 million of cash and cash equivalents versus $43.1 million at the end of the previous quarter. I will now turn the call back over to Jeff for his closing comments.\nJeff Shealy: Thank you, Ken. We continue to believe the market opportunity for our patented high-frequency XBAW and XP3F filters is substantial. As of September 25, 2023, we have approximately 200 issued patents and patents pending representing a substantial IP moat around our technology. We continue to work diligently to achieve each of our stated objectives and we will continue to provide updates on our execution against these objectives going forward. I want to emphasize to investors that while we have been navigating the challenges to our top line revenue during the first half of our fiscal year, we have aggressively taken steps to reduce operating expenses and achieve cost savings on our products to lower our operating cash burn. We believe this is prudent in the economic environment that we are facing. Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to thank our employees for their hard work, passion, and dedication in working together to position our company for growth in the quarters ahead. I also wish to thank our shareholders who continue to support the company. And with that, I would like to open the call for questions from the investment community. Operator, please go ahead with the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Anthony Stoss with Craig Hallam. Please proceed with your questions.\nAnthony Stoss: Good morning, guys. Ken, let me start with you. Can you maybe outline OpEx just for December, and then March R&D and SG&A for each? And then, your comment about expected reach, breakeven in less than a year, what were the new kind of revenue per quarter to reach that breakeven be?\nKen Boller: Good morning, Tony. Yeah. I'll dive into some of those answers for you. So with the expense reductions and cost-saving measures that we've undertaken, in essence, we've cut about 20% of our operating expense. We won't see a full quarter of that until the March quarter, as some of those were undertaken earlier in Q2. So we'll start to see up to 10% to 20% in December, and then in March 20% savings in OpEx overall. The question on operating cash flow breakeven, we still are projecting that to be within the next 12 months, still within $12 million to $15 million of revenue during that time period. And some of that depends on mix. We are -- a number of our new products are coming into production during the next two quarters, over a dozen. And those products are of a lower form factor and have lower laminate costs and back-end processing costs. So we'll start to see not only a reduction in the overall cost from the cost savings plan that we did, but also an introduction of our new parts that are lower back-end in cost and those margins are â were now negative, will turn positive. And then by this time next year, we project to be operating cash flow breakeven.\nAnthony Stoss: Got it. And then, as a follow-up, maybe for Jeff. Just what gives you confidence in the $8.3 million to $8.8 million in March, and then again, ramping from there we get to your $12 million to $15 million? And then, Jeff or Ken again, where would you expect gross margins to kind of exit calendar 2024?\nJeff Shealy: Good morning, Tony. Jeff here. I think the confidence is coming from what we're seeing. We made in the prepared comments some discussion about what we're seeing in the Wi-Fi channel with inventories, particularly in the Asian market in our Wi-Fi segment clearing. We've seen firsthand some of the evidence of that. I think most importantly and maybe more importantly is that we have multiple programs that we've been focused on which are ramping in the Q1 calendar year, which is our March quarter, of course. So it's confidence in the transition of some programs in Wi-Fi. We also made -- mention of some transition in our defense and other segment. We had -- really had a perfect storm the first half of this fiscal year with some of the headwinds in the market with we were wrapping up certain contracts. So that's as well as the, some of the slowdown in the inventory built up in the channel. So for the March quarter, it's all about new programs in Wi-Fi, which we have high confidence in, as well as the defense and other segments kind of really picking up. And the infrastructure segment's been a little lumpy, but we've seen some signs of an ongoing recovery in that as we head into next year. And Tony, I'll comment on gross margins. So in the next quarter or 2 by March, we will turn positive margins and then exit our fiscal year above 10% margin.\nAnthony Stoss: Okay.\nKen Boller: And Tony, Iâll comment on gross margins. To the next quarter or two by March, we will turn positive margins. And then exit our fiscal year, with down 10% and then when we come to the operating cash flow breakeven time period of this time next year. We're projecting it to be 20% to 25% of the positive gross margin. And some of that, as Jeff just alluded to, is some of our product mix, we're also starting to see more interest in infrastructure and some of our base station products. So those, if you recall, have a very high ASP and very good margin. So that is a piece of the mix that we're talking about when we're going into those time periods in the future.\nAnthony Stoss: Great. Very good. Thanks, guys.\nJeff Shealy: Thank you,\nOperator: Thank you, Tony. Our next question is from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nCraig Ellis: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I wanted to follow up on the earlier questions and just better understand the dynamics in March. So it looks like revenue is going to be up about $1.3 million sequentially, led by Wi-Fi followed by defense. Within Wi-Fi, can you characterize the incremental gains in the consumer part of the market versus the enterprise part of the market for March quarter?\nJeff Shealy: Hey. Good morning, Craig. Let me pull Dave in and give you kind of what we see on the mix in Wi-Fi. Maybe I'll add some comments thereafter.\nDave Aichele: Yeah. Good morning, Craig. So it's finally an evenly split between the consumer side and the enterprise side. There's two dynamics that we're seeing. So we've got good traction with Wi-Fi 6E programs that we've done with carrier market that is going to start picking back up. It's gone through this inventory slowdown, so we expect that to pick back up. Plus, we've got, per the design win announcement we made in this recent call today, is that we've got two consumer programs that we've already seen substantial POs on for our new Wi-Fi 7 products that we launched probably about three -- five months ago. And then, the other one is, our Tier 1 enterprise customer is going to start ramping and also their previous platform is picking back up. They've had a slowdown probably for the past six months. So we have both of those coming together. Plus, we announced in the call today another enterprise customer that's also going to be planning to ramp. And both of these enterprise customers have a significant amount of filter content per system. So even though the volume of the system shipping are less than the carrier side, you still get very good dollar content and also total ASP per system. So I think it's going to be a balance between the 22 of them. We're still focusing on the big box retail side that we don't expect, any real growth contribution probably until the second half of calendar year 2024. So I put an emphasis mainly on the carrier of the enterprise side.\nCraig Ellis: Yeah. That's really helpful, Dave. Thank you. And then the follow-up question is somewhat similar but for the second half of calendar â24, first half of fiscal â25, guide. If we're getting to cash flow break even at mid-team's revenues, then our revenues are going to basically double through the year. So can you just help us understand what your assumptions are around mobile's contribution to that ramp and to the extent that it exists. How much of that is Tier 1 customers versus the Tier 2 that's ramping a little bit in the first half of calendar â24 and then beyond mobile just the relative contributions out of Wi-Fi defense, et cetera.? Thank you.\nJeff Shealy: Thank you. Okay, Craig. So, second half of calendar 2024, we see continued increase in transition in Wi-Fi. I think Ken had touched on some of the new products with a more favorable gross margin profile. That's going to be certainly a driver towards a cash flow breakeven. But it's continued ramp with programs in Wi-Fi, Dave gave some outline of what that looks like in terms of -- some of that mix. I did want to emphasize in these Wi-Fi programs we're moving from programs that we may have eight to 10 type filters in a Wi-Fi 6E to some of these programs. We have multiple products and up to more than 30 filters of content in the box. So Wi-Fi is a big part of that story. The other part that we're seeing is, we do see a recovery of network infrastructure as we go in the second half of 2024. We announced this morning a first massive MIMO design win in infrastructure that has, you're talking about in that particular design win, 128 filters in that with significant content in that. And the defense and others segment, which is core and key to us, continued strength there. We have new programs that we've been bidding. We did announce a second -- support of a second DARPA program there as well as some ramp in the automotive. We've been active in the automotive not only in the battery management, but also in the C-V2X, we've been very active marketing that product as well. You asked about 5G mobile. Our activity there is primarily in the tier 2 market. I think it's well documented, the headwinds that have been in the China segment. But our activity there that's supporting this is primarily in the tier 2 market. Anything else you want to add?\nDave Aichele: No, I was just going to comment, we're still very excited about the mobile market. We've got a handful of customers that are active. It's just certain dynamics that we're encountering right now. So I agree with Jeff's comment, as most of the revenue increase we'll see in the second half of 2024 is going to be with the tier 2 market. We hope with the activity that we'll see opportunities, back in with the tier 1 in 2025, 2026. But that's, something that we've got to continue to push with our tier 1 customers that we're engaged with.\nCraig Ellis: That's really helpful, guys. And then lastly for me before I get back in the queue. Ken, my connection was breaking up as you talked about the timing of what I believe was a $4 million ITC refund. When do you expect to realize that?\nKen Boller: Hey, Craig. So, yeah, so we -- that's actually over an 18 month period, $3.5 million to $4 million, that will be filed with our tax return this year and our tax return next year. And then, it's a projection of when we expect to get a refund from the IRS, how long that may take. But we would expect the first tranche of that to be roughly about half of that, a little over $1.5 million to $2 million for this upcoming time period and we expect that to occur in the March quarter, March of 2024.\nCraig Ellis: Got it. Thanks, Ken.\nJeff Shealy: Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question is from the line of Suji Desilva with ROTH MKM. Please proceed with your questions.\nSuji Desilva: Hi, Jeff, Dave, and Ken. The product cost improvements you talked about in terms of improving the margins and the laminate and so forth, what mix of the products as we go six months to 12 months out will be at that improved cost structure to target getting to break even?\nJeff Shealy: Good morning, Suji. We'll get both Dave and Ken on that. One from the product and obviously one from the numbers on financial.\nDave Aichele: Good morning, Suji. So, yeah, there's -- I would say that the mix right now for the next quarter, and quarter and a half is going to be more of the older products. But as we get the new products profiles ramping, you'll see that transition point probably three quarters out that you will start to see it move through, that the new products will take a higher percentage. And then by the, I guess, 12-month period, I would expect a majority of the products that we're shipping are a good chunk of it. It's going to be the new platform, the smaller form factor. A lot of the 6E and even the 6 programs are getting replaced, with the 7 at least with the customers that we're targeting. We'll have some legacy products that continue to ship. Some of the enterprise customers, they'll be utilizing these older generation products for two to three years out. So it's a transition period. It's picked into Ken's models too, as well, that you can touch on.\nKen Boller: Yeah. So we, like I said, there's about over a dozen new products that we're introducing over the next three months to nine months and then more to follow after that. And as Dave mentioned, they'll slowly be accepted by the market and be brought into our sales funnel. And as I mentioned earlier, there also -- is the new base station products. And those have a higher ASP and have a lower cost as well. So we'll start to see that funnel in more and then get to 25% gross margin in that range when we get to this time next year in the December quarter.\nJeff Shealy: And Suji, let me add, this is Jeff, let me add to that really three dynamics that's going on that margin improvement. Dave touched on the size. The laminate has -- our selection of laminate to lower cost laminates is certainly a selection criteria. And I do want to emphasize the work by the team in the yield category. So that it's those size of product laminate as well as the yields that's going to be driving gross margin going forward.\nSuji Desilva: Okay. Great guys. My other question is on the financial side. What's the CapEx budget expected maybe the next 12 months, calendar â24, whatever time frame you want to use, just understand? How capital intends the next phases.\nKen Boller: Yeah. So we've just completed our 500 million capacity -- 500 million filters per year capacity expansion and also beefed up some of our back end processing capabilities in this quarter. If you look at our financials, you'll see a footnote disclosure stating about $1 million f spend that is left. However, I would also tell you that we're looking to, we're looking into it and seeing what expenses we can defer or not do from that angle as well as far as a further cost reduction program. But at most, if you look at our footnote, it's a little over $1 million for the next 12 months.\nJeff Shealy: And, Suji, let me add to that tool capacity expansion. Those tools are predominantly installed and running. We have deferred on some of the labor, as we've been able to make strides and yields and that's, thatâs put some of the labor component that's driving some of that cost of goods, that's pushed some of that out and that's part of what Ken's referencing in terms of some of the savings program. So we've got the tool capacity and Ken add the labor and bring that trained up, generally speaking, in one or two quarters.\nSuji Desilva: Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.\nJeff Shealy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now hand the floor back to management for closing remarks.\nJeff Shealy: Thank you, operator and thank you all for your time today. We look forward to speaking with you during our next update call to discuss the current quarter execution against our milestones, as well as against future expectations. Thank you again and wish everybody a wonderful week. Thank you.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
