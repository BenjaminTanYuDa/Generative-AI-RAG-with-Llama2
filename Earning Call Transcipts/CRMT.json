At this time all participants’ are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vickie Judy, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\nVickie Judy: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to America's Car-Mart third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings call for the period ending January 31, 2024. Joining me today is Doug Campbell, our Company's President and CEO. We've issued our earnings release earlier this morning and it is available on our website, along with a slide of supplemental material. We will post the transcript of our prepared remarks following this call, and the Q&A session will be available through the webcast after the call. During today's call, certain statements we make may be considered forward-looking and inherently involve risk and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's present view. These statements are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform act of 1995. The Company cannot guarantee the accuracy of any forecast or estimate, nor does it undertake any obligation to update such forward-looking statements. For more information, including important cautionary notes, please see Part 1 of the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023, and our current and quarterly reports furnished to or filed with the Securities Exchange Commission on Forms 8-K and 10-Q. I will now turn it over to Doug for his introductory comments about our third quarter.\nDoug Campbell: Good morning, and thank you for joining us and for your interest in our Company. I mentioned in our earnings release that sales volumes fell short of our internal expectations during the quarter. There are times when the results you produce don't align with the level of effort or output, and this was one of those quarters. I want to acknowledge the hard work of our associates, because they do so much to take care of our customers and keep them on the road. I'm very appreciative of the effort put out by the team. I'll start by highlighting some of the positive items that occurred during the quarter and discuss more in detail the drivers of the sales decrease. Last quarter, there was speculation about direction of the credit loss and whether it would continue to degrade, flatten or even improve. Our associates have worked tirelessly to assist our consumers in navigating an ongoing challenging environment. Throughout the quarter, we reduced the number of unit losses taken when compared sequentially by 9%. As an industry backdrop, delinquency trends worsened throughout the quarter. However, we improved our 30-plus day delinquencies by 30 basis points. This drove a $3.9 million favorable adjustment in the provision for credit loss. We've now completed the planned roll-out of our loan origination system. As with the implementation of any large scale system that is built on change management, there were some challenges in getting it fully in place, but we're happy that those implementation challenges are now behind us. We now have two quarters with the LOS originations driving more money down, stronger consumer profiles and shortened term lengths. Let me make this point clear. The LOS is a game-changer for Car-Mart, and we're really excited about the system leaving its imprint on the fourth quarter and into the future. As mentioned in the press release, we also entered a strategic partnership with Cox Automotive, which will aid in vehicle movement, repairs, acquisitions and remarketing. I'll cover this more in detail, but let me start with revenue and sales. Revenue was down 7.9% for the quarter, driven by several factors. First, a 19.6% decrease in unit volume was the primary driver. Overall industry softness accounted for roughly half of that. Recall that in our second quarter report, we said that August and September volumes were up or flat, with October contributing to the decline. Those October trends persisted into the third quarter, with overall application volumes softening by 8.3%. The LOS implementation challenges mentioned, along with balancing volume and deal structure, also contributed to the decrease. The benefits of system updates to the LOS, along with an augmented marketing plan for the fourth quarter, are expected to win back some volume and deliver stronger outcomes. We also had two fewer selling days in the quarter because of holiday shifts. Our stores were always closed on Sundays, but the shift in days for Christmas day and New Year's day landing on a Monday, added two more closure days to the quarter when compared to the prior year's quarter. Additionally, there was severe winter weather in January, which necessitated closures of up to three days at roughly a third of our 154 dealerships in January, which kept consumers from shopping. These revenue headwinds were partially offset by a 16% increase in interest income and a 7.5% increase in the average retail sales price. That increase in the average retail sales price was driven equally by a mix of ancillary products sold and vehicle price. You'll hear more from Vickie on the specifics on the LOS here in a minute, but let me comment on the results of these deal structures. The credit losses that we're seeing on our loan originations are very positive when compared to the legacy system. However, I want to caution these results are very preliminary in nature, but that's rapidly changing, with now 10,000 originations performing materially different than the loans generated by our legacy system. We plan to share more specifics in the future, but words like substantial and material come to mind when we start to quantify their effect on both the frequency and the severity of loss. We've mentioned numerous times the importance of acquisitions and it being one of the strongest uses of the capital for our Company. We're proud to announce that the purchase of Central Auto in Hot Springs is complete, and we're actively pursuing other opportunities that we expect to close in the calendar year. I want to provide more detail on this critical initiative that we teased out in last quarter's report. As noted in our release this morning, we've entered into a strategic partnership with Cox Automotive to aid in driving efficiencies within our vehicle supply chain process. I personally have a long history with Cox and their leadership team across several organizations in driving large scale projects that have driven tremendous value. We've begun to leverage their digital and physical assets as well as their logistics services. This initiative will be centrally managed, removing the day to day burden of processing and overseeing the disposal and reconditioning of assets from our operations team. Strategically, we expect this to allow our dealership teams to have more time selling and helping customers navigate vehicle ownership. We believe this partnership will help address some of the affordability challenges that exist in our industry and we expect it will lead to greater value creation for our shareholders and customers alike. I'll now turn it over to Vickie to cover more details on our financials. Vickie?\nVickie Judy: Thank you, Doug. In my commentary, the comparisons that I will cover will be the third quarter of 2024 versus the third quarter of 2023 unless otherwise noted. As Doug mentioned, LOS has allowed us to improve upon our deal structure, with average down payments for the quarter trending up 30 basis points to 5.1%, also up sequentially by 20 basis points. Our originating term was 43.3 months, improved from 44.1 months sequentially, and for the second quarter in a row. They were up from 42.5 months compared to the prior year third quarter. The weighted average total contract term for the portfolio is at 47.6 months including modifications. The average age of the portfolio improved to nearly 12 months or almost two months better compared to last year. Our total collections increased 9.3%. The monthly average total collected per active customer rose to $540 from $519. This metric also improved sequentially. We originated contracts in the third quarter that are expected to produce cash on cash returns of over 66% and an IRR over 41%. We provided a table in the earnings release and a supplemental chart on our website that demonstrates our positive cash on cash returns over time. This data reflects our history of earning strong cash on cash returns in various market and macroeconomic conditions. We're very focused on quality of originations and deal structure to maximize these returns, and ultimately, our profitability. The gross profit dollars per retail unit improved 10.5% and the gross profit percentage increased 50 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to improved pricing discipline and repair expenses. There was also an increase in profit dollars sequentially and we expect further improvements in our gross margin as volumes rise and we have more affordable vehicles in our supply chain from the initiatives underway. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were 6.8% versus 5.9% last year and down sequentially 40 basis points. We were pleased with this, especially when considering the sales decline. We experienced an increase in the frequency of losses compared to prior year, which was about 55% of the increase, as well as an increase in severity. Severity continues to be impacted by the longer term lengths, although that has begun to stabilize. Recovery values for the quarter were approximately 24%. Accounts over 30-days-passed due improved in Q3, dropping 40 basis points to 3.3%. This was also a 30 basis point improvement sequentially. Our customers continue to face ongoing pressures related to the increased cost for housing, energy, childcare, auto insurance. However, that's slightly offset by lower inflation in some groceries and fuel. Sequentially, the Company decreased the allowance for credit losses from 26.04% to 25.74%, resulting in a benefit of $3.9 million to the provision. The key drivers of the adjustment were lower delinquencies at quarter-end and a lower overall inflationary outlook. In summary, the improvements we've made in deal structure, the higher average age of the receivables portfolio, lower delinquencies and our operational initiatives are expected to lead to better customer success and lower credit losses in the future. Moving on to SG&A. Sequentially, we were able to lower SG&A dollars by $1.3 million. The steps we took in the second quarter to reduce expenses contributed to this sequential improvement. It was slightly offset by increased collections cost related to repossessions. Our SG&A per average account was down 6.7% from $451 to $421. We're very focused on cost efficiency, while continuing to serve over 102,000 customers and providing quality service. Interest expense as a percentage of sales increased to 7% for the quarter compared to 3.6%. In dollar terms, interest expense increased $7 million due to increasing interest rates and an increase in the average borrowings of approximately $145 million over the prior year. Our funding and financing program remained strong. In December, we called our '22-1 notes and paid them off during the quarter. In January, Kroll upgraded all tranches of our '23-1 notes and the company completed its fourth securitization at the end of the quarter, issuing $250 million in bonds, with a weighted average fixed coupon rate of 9.5%. In February, we renewed and extended our revolving credit agreement to September of 2025, with a $340 million revolver, along with access to $100 million accordion feature. At quarter-end, we had $4.2 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $126 million in additional availability under our revolving credit facilities based on our borrowing base of receivables and inventory. Access to capital with our revolving credit facility and a successful securitization program gives us flexibility and a distinct advantage over many competitors. Our non-recourse securitized notes represent the bulk of our funding, and our cost of funds fluctuates with the level of interest rates and credit spreads. We remain committed to growth, thoughtful capital allocation and financial management, as well as improving profits and shareholder returns. Now, I'll let Doug close us out.\nDoug Campbell: Thank you, Vickie. February is off to a better start than last quarter. We're closely monitoring our consumer and the tax season. Initial refunds are up slightly year-over-year, but they're running a little bit behind last year. Affordability continues to be the biggest challenge in our industry. We're all competing for a similarly priced asset to provide customers with reliable and affordable transportation. Initiatives like the ones that we put in place will aid in addressing these issues and enhance our ability to grow as a company. We do have near-term challenges that we're addressing, such as striking the right balance between loan origination and volumes and our cost structure. We reported progress in the third quarter on key metrics, including gross profit, credit losses and loan originations, and we expect to make additional progress on these and other areas. We believe that our agility and underlying cash generative nature of our Company continues to position us for long-term profitable growth. We're bullish about Car-Mart's future, because our initiatives will be accretive to earnings and shareholder returns. We'll now open up the line for questions. Operator, please provide instructions to do so.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Good morning, guys. Just a first question, Doug and Judy, if you want to come on this as well. When you look at this, you're basically transacting in vehicles that are approaching $20,000 before, and pre-COVID, they were $10,000. I know there's obviously major inflation in used vehicle pricing, but can you talk about sort of the challenges and opportunity and what that really means? Because that really is -- has some very potential big implications for how the business is run and performance over time. And will it go back down over time?\nDoug Campbell: Yeah. I appreciate the question, John, and good morning. So, I think you're spot on. This is -- it's like a variant of a question we got last quarter, but I'll try and answer it slightly differently. That $19,000, $19,500 car is -- equals about a $570 payment today in terms of origination payment. When you look at that and you start to deconstruct that, a lot of that is price, a lot of that is what we've done with service contracts, which we've improved over time, and our debt cancellation product, which is a percentage of the transaction price. If we even went back just a year ago, and said, hey, let me normalize for what the management action items on taking price increases and adjustments to these items. The payment is actually today less than what it is a year ago, if I take away some of these management execution items. In addition to that, we believe car prices were coming down. All the indicators are pointing in the right direction for car prices to come down in the balance of the year. How quickly? That is sort a question mark around how quickly that comes down. But I think the back half of the year is really going to provide some relief for us and our consumers. Additionally, the initiative, like the one we mentioned with Cox Automotive, is going to go a long way in aiding us getting there faster and not so reliant on the marketplace to get there. Our ability to recondition and repair more vehicles to resell in an inexpensive way is going to help us drive down that price, and we think we can do that in fairly short order.\nJohn Murphy: Good. And that just leads to my second question. Can you talk about what exactly Cox is doing? And when you get into recon, there's all sorts of questions of what level you recon to? I mean, if you're reconditioning a three-year old vehicle, you want to get close to new. But if you're reconditioning a -- something that's closer to a 10-year old vehicle, there's a lot of questions as to where you're recon it to. So, you're outsourcing that. How do you make those decisions efficiently, and how much money can you save and what kind of increase in throughput could you get ultimately per store as a result of this?\nDoug Campbell: That's a great question. So, today, when we look at the business and we have partners that help us. They're helping us on a store by store basis. And so, you can imagine those agreements for repairs are written up sort of one-off and low volume. When you have a large scale partner who has a footprint that aligns closely with your footprint, and you can start to negotiate labor rates and parts rates and body repair rates at more commercialized terms for a player our size, I think there's still savings to be had and improve and drive a nicer product in the end. And so, that's our goal. We think there's a tremendous opportunity to do that. We're not trying to repair cars and make them like new vehicles. We have a standard, and we've been working closely with the Cox team over the last 90 days to get them up to speed on what that standard is.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Great. I got a few more questions, but I'll drop back in the queue. Thank you very much.\nDoug Campbell: Appreciate it, John. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of John Rowan with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Rowan: Good morning. My apologies if you went over this already, but can you kind of deconstruct the decline in unit volume? I know, obviously, you mentioned weather and a couple of missing days and kind of the timing of sales days in the quarter, but more so just looking at the declining unit volume relative to the reduction in duration, did that have a material negative impact on sales and also whether or not there is anything being driven by any changes in the competitive environment? Thank you.\nDoug Campbell: Good morning, John. I'll try and answer that. And no, no one sort of asked, so I'll try and reiterate some of the key points and add a little bit more color. So, we mentioned the environment was generally softer. We thought that was about half the decline. If you look at other competitors, other public retailers, they all reported being sort of down single-digits, some double-digits. And so, if you take that as a proxy, like, that's part of it. The other portion we mentioned comes from weather, and we had some closure days there, too. I think the biggest driver there is traffic. And so, we've gone and been on record about the ability to drive loan -- excuse me, application volume, and that's been really healthy. That's the first time we've seen a decline. But more importantly was that was the type of channel. So, when we give you that sort of report out on traffic, it's an aggregated view of floor traffic and online traffic and, what we call, application traffic. On iPads, we can see customers who are walking into stores. And so, some channels declined stronger than others. Other ones actually had improvements. And we know some of that's driven by marketing and the way we've sort of run the business in terms of the LOS. And so, to your point, we opened up term slightly from the prior quarter to aid in driving some more of that traffic. We also made some more iterations and adjustments in getting ready for the fourth quarter. That's what gives us some confidence that we can win back some volume. And if February is any indication, some of those changes are working, so.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. And you wouldn't attribute the change in traffic to competition?\nDoug Campbell: No, we're really not seeing that. I wouldn't say that's a major contributor at all.\nJohn Rowan: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nDoug Campbell: You're very welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment as we move on to our next question. And our next question is going to come from the line of Derek Sommers with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nDerek Sommers: Hey, Good morning. Just to kind of follow-up on the unit sales decline, 3% to 4% was attributed to weather, and roughly half of the remainder was attributed to kind of lower volumes. Was there any portion -- meaningful portion attributed to kind of credit approval rates just associated with the LOS implementation?\nDoug Campbell: Do you want to take that one?\nVickie Judy: I would say, there's certainly some of that. Anytime you restrict your underwriting, whether it's in terms of down or the terms, there's certainly going to be some impact from that. It's difficult to kind of tease all of those pieces out. But that's part of -- when Doug mentioned balancing originations, that's a piece of that.\nDoug Campbell: Yes.\nVickie Judy: And we're really trying to look at the customers and the score of the customers that we're allowing those longer terms for. And so, Doug mentioned that we made a few adjustments to that, and we're continuing to make adjustments to that, and reiterating, as we adjust to this new system.\nDoug Campbell: Yeah. I would also say, it'd be hard to measure, because on the approval rate line, you'd see a negligible difference, if any. For us, it's the deal structure. We do want that customer, but we want it under different terms. And so, whether that's how much money we're willing to finance for a certain rating of customer, whether that's how much equity position we want them to be in when they originate their loan, those are just different terms. It's not that they're not approved, but we want them to be structured differently. It's why the affordability component is so important, because if they don't have any more, the thing that we can do to assist them is get cheaper vehicles, right? And that would aid in getting more customers qualified under the new terms that we would like to have them.\nDerek Sommers: Got it. Very helpful. And then, do you guys have a timeline in mind for kind of full LOS implementation across your dealerships?\nDoug Campbell: Yeah. So, the LOS is implemented across all of our dealerships today, with the exception of our stores that we've acquired over the last couple of years. And they're in their earnouts, and so we don't want to tinker with them while they're during those periods, but they'll be tucked in underneath that shortly thereafter. But all origination volume for our base stores will be pretty much through the LOS. There's one last piece we need to address, which is cross-border state transactions where people drive from Missouri into Arkansas to get a car or vice versa. That's like 5% of the volume, but I think on a go forward basis, greater than 80% of our originations should come from our LOS.\nDerek Sommers: Got it. And then, just one more. Just any kind of commentary on February trends, tax refund, and what you're seeing with the consumer would be helpful.\nDoug Campbell: Well, we mentioned -- I mean, the tax data sort of out there. It was off to a slow start, where we saw refunds initially down. Now, they're up higher year-over-year, but they're still trending about a week behind. We stay really close to third-party tax partners and the IRS data and our application data. And we -- anecdotally from our stores, some of that data might be just shifted out to the right. And so, I'm encouraged, Friday -- excuse me, February, I said, started off -- we're off to a better start in the quarter than we were last quarter. So, that's indicating a move upward. And if some of that -- some of those sales are going to be pushed into March, which is -- that's a great thing. And we have a nice long March with five weekends in there as well. So, we're excited about a big month.\nDerek Sommers: Thank you, guys. That's all for me.\nDoug Campbell: You got it, Derek. Thank you.\nVickie Judy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. And our next question is a follow-up question from John Murphy with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Murphy: Hey, I just had two more. As you guys are looking at the volume decline versus what was stronger GPUs, is there the potential to take pricing down in GPUs a little bit lower to drive volume? And how are you making that decision in a new world order?\nDoug Campbell: Vick, you want to get that?\nVickie Judy: Yeah. We -- that's certainly an option. Most of the changes in the GPU were really where we've been focused on efficiencies around cost on the repair side and being more efficient there, as well as movement of our vehicles. But the pricing of that is certainly something that we'll also always consider as we move forward.\nDoug Campbell: Yes. I think...\nVickie Judy: That'll be a piece of continuing to iterate on this LOS.\nDoug Campbell: Yes. John, so, the historical gross profit average is really driven off a function of the sales price. If I just hold price constant, we're going to continue to make improvements in the gross profit that we're seeing through initiatives, some of that we can give back to win back volume. And so, we're trying to balance that with what are volumes in a normal run rate with this new LOS. And I think when we see that sort of normalize and get in a good spot, then that's certainly an option for us as well.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. And there's one other on the acquisitions, not totally new to the story, but sounds like they're going to ramp up significantly as you're going through this ramp in the LOS, and then thinking about integrating new store or acquired stores. How is that process working and how big is that team, and how does that actually work on the integration?\nVickie Judy: We do have a team. It's not a huge team. We just started building it out this last year. So, it's a smaller team. These acquisitions are also a bit unique, and we've talked about this before, and that this is a business that these owners have built up over a significant amount of time, and it's kind of their baby and their life's work. And so, the task of working through them, preparing to sell these takes them a bit of time. So, some of these we may talk to for a couple of years till they finally get ready to do this. But we do have several in the pipeline, several that we've been talking to for a couple of years or several months, and we have several in the pipeline that are getting close to being able to be closed on. So, that was in relation to our comment that we are expecting some others before the end of this calendar year.\nJohn Murphy: Okay. Thank you very much, guys.\nDoug Campbell: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time, and I would like to hand the conference back over to Doug Campbell for closing remarks.\nDoug Campbell: Thank you very much. Listen, I'm really excited about all the initiatives that we have underway. And again, I'm really thankful for the effort being put forth by our team. They keep getting back up and fighting our way and helping our consumers fight. The thing that we are myopically focused on is helping our teams and our customers be successful. And when you think about some of the initiatives and the Cox partnership, the alignment of our interest in just having customer success right in the center of everything, that's going to be a really great partnership. So, I'm excited about that. On the LOS front, I'm glad the implementation is behind us. And I think as we go forward, I'm really excited for what it's going to do to our business. We included another supplemental slide on our cash on cash returns. And if you look at the third quarter projections, we had a nice improvement. And that's showing the LOS and its influence on our -- on the financials of our Company already. So, really excited about that. And we're really bullish about the Company's future and these initiatives to be accretive to earnings and shareholder returns. So, I thank you for your time today and your interest in our Company.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect."

After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded.  I will now turn the call over to your host, Ms. Vickie Judy, America's Car-Mart CFO. Please begin.\nVickie Judy : Thank you, and welcome to America's Car-Mart's second quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today is Doug Campbell, who took over as our company's CEO on October 1, 2023. We've issued our news release earlier this morning, and it is available on our website. We've updated our reporting format with a simplified look, providing an efficient and easy comparison of important metrics against the prior corresponding quarter and commentary about our results. In addition, we will post a transcript of our prepared remarks following this call. And we are also going to be posting some slides to our website some supplementary materials. We are having some technical difficulties this morning, but those should be up shortly. And those will help further illustrate many of the talking points that we're going to cover in our call today.  The Q&A session will be available through the webcast after the call. We believe that this process will help enhance how we share our quarterly results with you, and we welcome your feedback. During today's call, certain statements we make may be considered forward-looking and inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's present view. These statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

I will now turn it over to Doug for his introductory comments about our second quarter.\nDoug Campbell : Good morning, and thank you for joining us and for your interest in our company. First, I'd like to thank our associates for their relentless focus on keeping our customers on the road. I also appreciate all the many messages I've received on my appointment as CEO. It means a lot. So thanks for that.  I want to take a moment to recognize the passing of Hank Henderson, one of our board members and CEO prior to Jeff Williams. His contributions here at the company and in the community, to his family will leave an indelible mark. He was a valued board member and a longtime shareholder. His pointed advice to me about the opportunity to be a CEO has a different meaning today. So thank you, Hank. During the quarter, we identified someone with a similar profile that has a long-term view of the business. As such, we've recently added Jonathan Bupa from Nantahala Capital Management to our board. He brings many years of experience within specialty finance, including subprime installment lending, on lending and lease to own retail. He is a shareholder as well, and we're excited to have him join our board.  Now I'd like to address the quarter. If I'm on the other end of this call, I'd had a lot of questions about the results and particularly credit losses. I'd ask you to bring into context that GAAP accounting requires us to report our results as a retailer with an accounts receivable balance of almost $1.5 billion originated over the last four years. As the business grows, the impact of reserves and credit adjustments on our portfolio originated over a four-year period becomes even larger in relation to the quarterly results.  The way we measure our business is the cash we collect over time, relative to the money that we put out on the street. And if you look over time, we've never had a pool of loans in which we earn cumulative cash returns less than 50% in excess of the cash outlay over the life of the contracts. What has changed is that it takes longer to recognize it. But 10 years ago, we put $1 out on the street and get approximately $1.60 back over time, and that's still the case.  Let me also tell you why I came to Car-Mart. Over the last 5 or 6 fiscal years, the business has generated almost $600 million in free cash flow. The company has repurchased $156 million in shares, growing, the net AR balance by $739 million, funded various capital expenditures of almost $78 million, while funding increased inventory of $79 million in a growing business. They've been able to do this because of the underlying pools of receivables that the company has originated, have consistently produced cash flows in excess of the cost to operate the business over time. This remains the case. Additionally, this segment of automotive is large and a growing part of our industry. The ability to really help consumers who have little to no access to credit from an industry leader with a great track record and abundance of opportunity made it attractive, especially when you consider the opportunity to feather in my skill set and industry best practices with Car-Mart's unique culture, it has power to take the business to the next level. And that's what I'm focused on. Today, we reported revenue increase of 2.8%. That was primarily driven from a 23% increase in interest income. Sales volumes were down 4.6% and but sales revenue only saw a decline of 0.4%. Diluted sales revenue was a product of a 5.6% increase in the quarterly average selling price, moving from $18,025 to $19,035 year-over-year. Approximately 40% of this increase was related to the vehicle selling price, but 60% was related to the increased revenue for ancillary products. Sequentially, the quarterly average selling price was relatively flat.  As far as sales volumes, we finished the quarter with 15,162 units versus 15,885 units sold last year. August and September had respectable volumes and collectively posted a gain in sales year-over-year, but October sales results were down. Several items contributed to the sales decline witnessed in October, and I'll talk about that not here. Web traffic was consistent and still posted gains year-over-year. And online credit applications for the quarter were also positive by 19%, yet there was a decrease in showroom traffic. Additionally, launching several states onto our new loan origination system, or LOS, was a contributing factor, I'll speak to more in a minute. Overall, we're trying to balance sales volume with our new system, onboarding new stores and introducing new underwriting guidelines. We spent the better part of last year rolling out the consumer application portal for LOS which allows the consumer to apply faster, have a soft credit pool during the application process and get a response via text as to the status of their application as well as centralized appointment setting. We're now in the second phase of our LOS rollout, which is related to underwriting and how sales are being originated.  During the quarter, we onboarded three additional states, bringing the total to five states, which accounts for about 45% of our revenue at quarter end. We started out the fiscal year rolling out the dealer-facing portion of this tool. As a reference, our legacy system had limited ability to influence outcomes but served as a stable platform to originate deals and manage associated costs. Our original intent was to roll the system out with similar underwriting rules as our legacy system analyst, allowing users to learn the system over time but giving us enhanced data and visibility. However, with a backdrop of increasing credit losses, we made the strategic decision to implement new underwriting rules, which primarily sought to decrease terms and increased down payments. The initial results were very positive.  When looking at originating terms, we finished at 44.1 months for the quarter. While this is up year-over-year, it's down sequentially by 0.6 months. It's the largest decrease we've seen since July 2019. The originating terms during the quarter for our legacy system were approximately 44 months and 42 months on the new LOS. Originating terms were down in both systems and both trended downward throughout the quarter. Average down payments for the quarter were 4.9% and relatively flat when viewed sequentially, but down 30 basis points year-over-year. Yet when comparing the two originating systems, we collected nearly 1 point more inbound payment on the new LOS generating 5.5% down and 4.6% at ALIS. This demonstrates how effective the system is and our teams are pushing for improved deal structures despite the seasonality we normally see with cash down payment percentages. The benefits of LOS are no longer theoretical. It's deployed in about half of our stores already and we couldn't think of a more opportune time to begin testing its capabilities. These combined results show that we can more quickly and precisely adjust parameters. And with any new system, there are growing pins. We are projecting to have the LOS completely rolled out in the third quarter prior to tax season. Ultimately, we're striving to achieve higher volumes with better deal structures to help our customers be more successful, and we're confident the investment will have long-term positive impacts.  While adding a level of sophistication to our underwriting is critical, a large part of our result is a function of our servicing efforts after the sale, which we must continue to execute at a high level. The gross margin initiatives we are focused on continue to bear fruit and improved materially year-over-year. Sequentially, there was a small decrease, but this was a function of the sales mix I discussed earlier. We also continue to improve the age and mileage of vehicles we're purchasing compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we were able to bring down our purchase cost average of vehicles despite the UAW strike and any noise it created.  If you reference Slide 4 in the supplemental material on the website, I've included two charts. In the first chart, our put our purchase cost average up against Cox’s MMR Index, which tracks price movement throughout the year on a set basket of goods. We're improving our timing here, which ultimately will reduce how we own that vehicle relative to a given book value at the time of contract origination. It's evident we're moving with the market better, despite us doing this with lead times of three to four weeks.  The second chart shows during the same period that we've improved the quality of the assets by purchasing newer and lower mileage vehicles. These are material changes, which lower repair costs during initial reconditioning and while under a service contract contributing to better gross margins. When combined with the inventory procurement and our marketing management processes implemented last year, we're delivering operational improvements for our customers and the company. We've made great strides in both our procurement and remarketing capabilities and a key driver going forward will be our ability to resell more of these vehicles that are repossessed. The opportunity today is considerable and continues to grow as newer vehicles cycled through our portfolio. We've engaged a national provider to perform reconditioning and improved vehicle quality, which will in turn help drive the overall average cost down, improve gross margin, reduced credit loss and enhance cash flow. We will launch this during the third quarter. This is also critically important to addressing the affordability headwinds for our consumers. I want to touch on net charge-offs and overall credit losses. Although the macro environment has seen some cooling of inflation over the quarter, the lingering financial and psychological effects of the worst part of inflation of 4 decades continues to impact our consumers. Goods and services are still far pricier than they are just three years ago, with the economic inflationary pressures on our customers now more prevalent in all areas of their lives.  Things like higher energy costs, food, housing and auto insurance, just to name a few. This is the largest contributing factor that drove an increase to the frequency of losses during the quarter of 24%. The unit losses on repossessions peaked in September and came down slightly in October. Our 30-day plus delinquencies also improved during that same time frame, which are both positive signs, but we remain cautiously optimistic about this movement. I will now turn things over to Vickie on more details on the financials.\nVickie Judy : Thank you, Doug. In my commentary, the comparisons that I will cover will be the second quarter of 2024 versus second quarter of 2023, unless otherwise noted. Our revenues for the second quarter were $361.6 million, up 2.8% from last year's prior period. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to the 23% higher interest income. As Doug mentioned, we did have a decrease in unit volumes. Our sales volumes became more challenging as we moved throughout the quarter, and most of this decline came in the last month of the quarter. Although we did have some operational challenges as we implemented our new LOS, there was also a dampening in the overall used vehicle market because of continued affordability challenges for our consumer. When combined, the softness in the market, the continued elevated vehicle prices and onboarding stores to the LOS, we have less predictability in short-term sales volumes than we would have otherwise expected to have.  With that said, the application volumes remain robust. Our LOS onboarding will be completed in the third quarter and the work we are doing to improve affordability should mitigate some of these challenges. The gross profit dollars per retail unit sold improved by 11.5% and the gross profit percentage increased 220 basis points, a result of the initiatives around inventory life cycle efficiencies from the procurement, reconditioning, wholesaling efforts and repairs after the sale. Sequentially, gross profit dollars improved slightly by 1% and the gross margin percentage was 30 basis points lower, primarily due to the lower sales volumes in October. We expect further improvements in our gross margin percentage as volumes improve, and we scale and fully operationalize our initial -- our initiatives. Due to our operational efficiencies, our inventory dollars decreased $16.5 million from the prior year quarter. Quarterly inventory turns improved to 7.1 compared to 6.7 annualized was $44.9 million or 14.9% of sales, up from the prior year quarter of $42.9 million, but down sequentially $1.6 million, from $46.5 million. The primary reduction sequentially was a $3.2 million stock reduction in stock-based compensation, partially offset by increased cost and collection expenses and professional fees related to the implementation of our new technologies. Since the quarter end, we have made adjustments to our operating expense structure. First, we reduced the size of our corporate workforce by 10% through a series of strategic decisions. We've also limited hiring, reduced our marketing spend and curtailed the use of some professional services. We will continue to evaluate spend at both the dealership and the corporate level, and we're committed to driving cost efficiencies in the business and implementing cost savings initiatives over the next quarter. That when combined with our technology and business investments, we expect to provide SG&A cost leveraging opportunities as we move forward.  However, we continue to serve an expanding customer base with over 104,000 customers, a 6% increase over the prior year quarter. SG&A per average account improved and was $424 compared to $439 in the prior year and $449 sequentially. On the credit losses, our net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were 7.2% versus 5.8%. This compares to our prior 10-year average for second quarter of 6.2%, and that includes the positive COVID periods. As a comparison to pre-COVID periods, our average net charge-offs for the five-year period pre-pandemic were 7% for second quarter. The frequency of losses accounted for over two thirds of the credit loss increase.  Severity was also higher than usual, caused by some rapid vehicle depreciation exhibited last year that made some of the originations in the calendar year of '21 and '22 pools experienced both higher frequency and severity of losses.\nDoug Campbell : That's a great point, Vicki. If you reference Chart 1 on Slide 5, we've indexed wholesale prices back to 2017 to show what happens over a three-year period with price in a normalized environment. I specifically called out two points to illustrate what happens with price between an origination and a default as an example.  In Chart 1, the periods I've identified for origination and default show approximately a 9% or 10% reduction in depreciation. Chart 2 reflects the wholesale price movement from 2021 to 2023 year-to-date. I've shown similar timing of origination and defaults and it clearly shows the price degrading in excess of 25%. This is why severity is more pronounced than normal. This is not a dynamic that's specific to Car-Mart but an industry-wide issue, which most lenders will have to contend with at some point.\nVickie Judy : Yeah. Thank you, Doug. Because of the nature of our contracts being shorter, it's our belief that we are witnessing some of this first. Many industry metrics, which measure delinquency and default rates, which have historically moved in tandem now show delinquencies continuing to rise without defaults moving at a similar rate. As a management team, we've decided not to deviate from our historical collection practices because of our deep experience in dealing with subprime customers. The good news is that we are through the largest percentage of losses expected from these pools. While these pools are challenging, nonetheless, they produce over 50% cash-on-cash returns and approximately a 35% IRR. As a result of the increased losses in our quarterly analysis, the company did increase the allowance for credit loss from 23.91% to 26.04% sequentially. The resulting in a $28 million charge to the provision expense. It's an earnings per loss -- earnings per share loss of $3.40 after tax. The structural changes to our portfolio over recent years, driven by higher vehicle costs and longer-term length as well as the current economic state of our customer continue to drive an increase in the provision for credit losses.  As our allowance represents an expectation of losses on a $1.5 billion portfolio, the result of a change can have a large impact on any period's quarterly earnings, especially based on our retail businesses sales in a given quarter. Our pools have consistently produced positive cash-on-cash returns and attractive IRRs. As vehicle prices have risen and terms have increased from approximately 30 months to approximately 44 months, our time to breakeven has been pushed out and IRRs have declined, although still at very good returns. Please refer to Slides 3 and 6 on our website to see how these pools have performed over time. Our accounts, 30-plus days past due were 3.6%, consistent with last year's quarter and improved from 4.4% sequentially. As a percentage of accounts receivable, our total dollars past due improved 213 basis points sequentially. This is especially important given that the quarter closed on a Tuesday which is historically the highest delinquency day of the week. The average originating contract term for the quarter was 44.1 months compared to 42.6 months and improved sequentially from 44.7. The lower delinquency should result in improved losses over the next quarter. Our weighted average contract term for the entire portfolio, including modifications, was 47.3 months compared to 44.8 for the prior year quarter and 46.9 sequentially. The weighted average age of the portfolio improved to 10.8 months. The percentage of our portfolio held by the highest credit quality customers continues to improve compared to the prior year and was flat sequentially.  You should expect us to be more aggressive on capital allocation going forward. During this quarter, we closed another location, bringing the total to three for the fiscal year. We will be adding a newly acquired dealership during the third quarter, moving capital from underperforming stores to higher performing assets, which has cascading benefits throughout the company. We will continue to review and monitor capital invested in each dealership and other investments to maximize returns. Our interest expense continues to significantly impact our earnings potential. Over 60% of the increase is due to higher interest rates, with the remaining as a result of an increase in average borrowings. The company's total securitized non-recourse notes payable was $489 million, net of $90 million in restricted cash related to these notes. We are also currently considering redeeming our first series of asset-backed nonrecourse notes issued in April of 2022 as we have satisfied the conditions to repurchase the securitized receivable under the terms of the note, subject to notification to the noteholders. This will free up some well-seasoned collateral. At quarter end, we had $4.3 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $86 million in additional availability under our revolving credit facilities based on our current borrowing base of receivables and inventory. Access to capital with our $600 million revolving credit facility, a successful securitization program and an active shelf registration gives us flexibility and a distinct advantage over many competitors. Many competitors may experience even more pressure in accessing capital in the future. Our non-recourse securitized notes represent the bulk of our funding and our cost of funds fluctuate with the level of interest rates and credit spreads. We've summarized the key drivers and their impact on EPS in the quarter on Slide 7. In conclusion, we remain committed to growth and prudent financial management. We're focused on delivering value to our shareholders through strategic investments, operational efficiency and a steadfast dedication to keep our customers on the road.  Thanks, and I'll let Doug close this out.\nDoug Campbell : Thanks, Vickie. We continue to optimize our footprint and leverage our investments in technology and infrastructure. Our ERP implementation begins next calendar year, which will reduce the need for several manual and redundant processes.  We are excited to have central auto sales as a new addition to our dealership group that we expect to close in December. We're actively evaluating several opportunities in our market geographies to acquire productive stores, which offer operators an exit strategy and continue their great work on servicing customers in their communities. This last acquisition has sales volume on par with our largest stores in the country, and we're excited to have some new partners to help us grow. Before we take questions, I want to reiterate that our team is extremely focused on executing our strategy for the back half of fiscal year 2024. Overall, we believe our keen focus on operational efficiencies, reducing costs and prudent capital management will enhance our competitive advantages. The overall macro environment remains challenging for Car-Mart's core customers, both existing and prospective, but they need the service we provide. While we're disappointed to show a loss during the current quarter, the underlying cash-generative nature of our business continues to position us for long-term profitable growth. Now we'll open up the line for questions. Operator, please provide instructions to do so.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Rowan of Janney Montgomery Scott.\nJohn Rowan : Good morning. Doug, I want to echo your sentiment on Hank, especially since I'm going to reference him here in one of my questions. You mentioned that the cash-on-cash return is still the same at 1.6 times than it was historically for the company. And I just want to make sure I understand that metric correctly and whether or not we have to adjust it for timing because you say it's the same, but it's taking at a 45-44 months duration, it's taking 50% longer to get to that return. I mean I remember my first meeting with Hank and when he was CEO and Jeff was CFO, he said, we're never going over a 30-month duration, right? Is that still the right metric to look at, given how much longer it's taking to collect the cash?\nVickie Judy : Yeah. So that's an undiscounted return, John. So again, putting $1 out and getting $1.60 back when you discount that back for the time in the longer term, that's when I was mentioning the IRRs, which are certainly lower, but still very positive.  And if you think about the last couple of years, and I think we've talked about this on a few calls, we could have chosen just to sit out of the market and not serve these customers, but we chose to go ahead and participate, extend the term. We're really working on the quality of the vehicle and have improved that since that COVID period of time. So again, overall and over time, it's still a good return on the output of those pools.\nDoug Campbell : Yeah. John, I'd also echo Vickie's sentiments, and I appreciate your commentary about Hank I'm sure if you went back in time and asked them, hey, can you envision a day we're going to sell 60-plus cars at $19,000 a piece, you probably would have pushed back on that, too. But the environment has changed. And I think with other large competitors closing, it creates opportunity for us as well. And we're feeling ourselves out for what that right term is. And I think that's why it's so important to have these new initiatives like the LOS, that will enable us to drive that and have some centralized thought about what terms should be and how we can actually get there.\nJohn Rowan : Okay. Your press release did mention some underwriting changes in October, impacting volume. I mean what were those? I mean, should -- obviously, with the rollout of the LOS, should we look for reduction in originating term. Obviously, the average contract term was up pretty sharply sequentially. I assume there was a heightened level of modifications in there since the originating term came down. Can you just kind of break those two pieces out and what the underwriting changes were?\nDoug Campbell : Yeah. The -- as I mentioned before, the underwriting change is primarily focused around term and down payment. We had made some mild adjustments at the very beginning of the quarter. And as we saw credit losses change, we pulled back and really wanted to focus on highly rated customers and down payment. We weren't sure how much effect that would have on sales. And so -- or really what we could execute on, and we were really surprised by the results.  I think we're still trying to figure out what that right term is because what we need to balance is that and sales volumes. Historically, we've served the customer that we underwrite and it provides a good return. But now we really are able to dial in and really focus on highly rated customers. And to us, that's the real upside of the opportunity to try and augment the portfolio. So we're trying to juggle all that while continuing to onboard the remaining stores that adds any clarity, John.\nJohn Rowan : Okay. And just can you address whether or not there was increased modifications?\nVickie Judy : We have not seen an increase in modifications compared to historical trends. No. And I think the overall portfolio term was up 0.4 months, including those modifications. So again, yes, we are working with our customers in this environment, same as we have historically. But I think we mentioned, too, that we're also ensuring that anything that's not going to be a producing asset or the consumer is not able to keep making payments, we're not kicking those down the road. We're taking our lumps as we go here.\nDoug Campbell : Yeah. One more thing on that. It's one of the things that Vickie called out when you look at delinquency rates and default rates and the divergence of those two, which historically have moved in tandem, our experience in working with these customers says, continue to run our play. Our deep experience, we have to trust our playbook and saying, things don't materially get better over time working with this tranche of customers. And we've got to cycle through these to our portfolio, if that's what it means. And so we're just -- we're staying focused on running our play.\nJohn Rowan : Okay. And then just two more. I'll lump them into 1 question. What's the outlook for share repurchases? Obviously, given the loss you reported here? And were they -- are you anywhere close to any amortization events in the ABS facilities?\nVickie Judy : Yeah. So share repurchases will continue to be part of our capital allocation as we look ahead. We do want to ensure that we're taking advantage of the opportunities that we have in front of us right now on these acquisitions and not miss out on any of those in the current market. But repurchases will continue to be a part of that.  On the ABL side, we are working on our renewal of our ABL currently. We have a good relationship with our banks. We keep them updated on our business and very transparent with them. They understand our business.\nJohn Rowan : Yeah. But I mean there's got to be a covenant in there. I just want to make sure you're not close to the covered in sort of a turbo amortization.\nVickie Judy : Yeah. No, we have availability triggers that we watch and review closely. And as I mentioned, we have $86 million of additional availability at the end of October. And we're not expecting to trip any covenant triggers there. And then we have our ABS that we're going to call here in the next days or so or less this month in December, which will bring some additional collateral into that ABL pool and then we're also looking at another securitization later in the month.  So we've got flexibility there. And then as I mentioned, too, we also have our active shelf out there should we need to use some other type of funding in the future.\nJohn Rowan : Okay, thank you. \nDoug Campbell : Thanks, John. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment, please. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Caintic of Stephens. Your line is open.\nVincent Caintic : Good morning. And thanks for taking my questions. First on credit, so I appreciate all the detail you gave with that. So the 30 days accounts 30 days past due came down quarter-over-quarter, yet the credit provisions went up. And so I'm curious what changed in your thinking that drove the credit provisions higher. In the press release, it says higher credit provisions were onetime. So I'm wondering if the higher credit provisions is related to say onetime higher credit losses that we experienced this quarter. And so reserves should come down as the back book of the portfolio comes down over time? Or is credit -- is the consumer deteriorating further going forward, so we should expect to keep this higher credit reserve rate going forward? Thank you.\nVickie Judy : Sure. So a large piece of that credit reserve analysis is just based on actual losses that have happened. And so when you see an increase of losses in the quarter like we saw, that's going to roll through the entire portfolio with an expectation that some piece of that continues. So some of it's just a math equation that results in that higher output.  As we look at our delinquencies, as we look at the pools that we have out there, yeah, there would be some expectation that as we move forward here, that would be able to be reduced at some point in time in the future. But we've got to work through what's currently in our portfolio, and we'll continue to review that quarterly.\nDoug Campbell : Yeah. I'd add also the increase in those unit losses during the quarter was really, really sharp. Again, I mentioned peaking in September coming down in October. And then, again, most recently in November, it came down yet again. So we're encouraged by that, but it's tough for us to sort of gauge where that's going to end up. But us keeping our delinquencies in line and seeing positive trends in terms of the unit losses, those are really good indicators. But we got to see what sort of pans out. The environment is still challenged for our consumers, and that doesn't seem to be going away anytime soon. We're doing everything we can to help them be successful.\nVincent Caintic : Okay. That's very helpful. And I guess maybe to put it another way, is there a way to say that, hey, your underwriting has changed such that you're targeting a certain loss rate that's lower than where we are now. Maybe if you could give some detail of what -- like I understand that the current book or the portfolio that was written this past year is probably the tough spot, but trying to get a sense of the forward portfolio that you are writing going forward. Are you targeting something that's lower than where the back portfolio is?\nDoug Campbell : Yeah. So there's a couple of drivers there, Vincent. I think about it this way. If we're targeting higher down payments and better rated customers, I would expect the loss rate to come down, especially when you feather in the fact that we're really focused on the asset, right, and how it performs in the portfolio, which should drive better recovery rates, right? But all that remains to be seen. We have to prove that out, but we're doing all the things to sort of get us to that future place.  So you're 100% right that I think that's where we're headed and that's where we want to be focused on. We don't know what that means yet, right? We need to get these cars cycled through and keep more of these cars and help drive cheaper cars into our portfolio also which help with default rates. So there's a lot going on, but we're trying to do all of those things to drive a differentiated results here than we've experienced recently.\nVickie Judy : Vincent, I would also add to that, that it is a subprime consumer. And we're working to structure the deals for success as best we can. But as you know, these consumers live paycheck to paycheck. And that's why our servicing after the sale and how we help them through those events after the sale are so important in how we service them. So again, we have to keep that in mind the consumer that we're dealing with in the aspect of that.\nVincent Caintic : Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then definitely on the sales activity. So the sales per store per month declining this quarter. I was wondering if you could give specifically October since that seemed to be the weakest in the quarter? And then how much of the impact was driven by the onboarding of the LOS system. You've gotten a lot of stores now within that. So I'm just wondering maybe what sales would have been without that onboarding? And just generally, how you expect sales to be going forward? Is there still more pressure plus your tighter underwriting or the changes you're making now we can see some sales growth going forward? Thank you.\nDoug Campbell : Yeah. I think Vickie touched on that in her remarks there about there being less predictability today. And I think that's really driven by -- partially by the rollout of the LOS. Our teams and our stores are learning how to use the system. It's new. We haven't changed it in over a decade. And so there's a learning curve there, which does impact some productivity, right? We're aware of that. The best thing we can do is continue to roll it out, roll it out quickly to support the stores as best as we can and then get that behind us. In addition to that, there was some softness in the environment. And what we're trying to do is reconcile okay, we were up again in online credit apps, 19%. Our unique visitors to our website was also up 23%. So like there's no shortage of demand right? What we're trying to do is balance the right customers in our portfolio and roll out this new system. There was a little bit of softness in showroom traffic.  And so we're trying to figure out, is that an us problem, right? Or is that driven by the environment. And it's really, really early to tell. It was a sort of sharp drop off in October. And so it sort of remains to be seen. We're trying to give ourselves some elasticity on the sales volume for the third quarter here because it's important to us to get the right customers in our portfolio, and that's the most thing -- that's the most important thing we're really focused on.\nVickie Judy : Yeah. And there is still the affordability challenge. I think Cox has come out that there's somewhere around 50% of the market that may be setting out due to affordability. So the improvements that we're working on in terms of the vehicle should help with that also.\nDoug Campbell : Yeah. I think that's a great point, Vicki. The -- I touched on that, the ability to sell more of our repossessions -- when we do that, our early indicators and our pilot is, we can shave a couple of thousand dollars off the transaction price for our consumer that we can generate demand when we scale that. And so that's why it's so important, and we're really focused on that. And that does roll out here in the third quarter.  So I'm not really answering your question directly, but these are all the things that are sort of in play. We know we can drive some of that. We know the top side demand is really strong. And we know we're also looking at underwriting restrictions and guidelines and trying to balance all of that with onboarding new stores. So I wish I could give you a more clear answer, but it's not on the demand side.\nVincent Caintic : Okay. Understood and that’s very helpful. Thanks so much. \nDoug Campbell : Thank you, Vincent. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Joseph of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKyle Joseph : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a few more on credit, if you will. I think you referenced that kind of we're back at kind of pre-pandemic average loss rates for the second quarter. But if we look back at kind of pre-pandemic reserve levels, I think they were more in the 24.5%, 25% range. Obviously, you're above that now. Is that a function of the portfolio duration or just the uncertain outlook? And then kind of in addition to that, any specific macro changes that trigger the reserve? Or is it more just a function of performance in the enduring inflation.\nVickie Judy : Yeah. I would say that most of it is based on the performance the severity is a piece of that increased reserve as well. And then there are qualitative factors, such as the inflationary environment that also play into that. So it's a combination of all of those things, Kyle that causes that reserve to need to be at a higher percentage.\nKyle Joseph : Got it. And then, yes, I think this was referenced earlier, but obviously, early-stage DQs [ph] continue to perform well. So is this the back book? And then is it just ongoing inflation that's driving lot less curing back book?\nVickie Judy : Yeah. I think that’s a piece of it, just the consumer and the environment they’re in, but I think where we ended the quarter, especially, like I said, our closing on a Tuesday, which is typically our highest delinquency day of the week and then looking at both our 30-plus being lower as well as our less than 30-day delinquencies being lower was a really positive sign.\nKyle Joseph : Got it. Thanks very much for taking my questions. \nKyle Joseph : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Doug Campbell for any closing remarks.\nDoug Campbell : Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining the call. We have obviously a lot going on, a lot of positive things for our company. We're really excited about our future and really focused on some of these high line items like our ERP and our LOS, which are tech investments that we've made over the last couple of years, all of which will help our customers be more successful. I think the affordability is a key part of this equation and knowing that we have a path to help engineer more affordable vehicles for our consumers and generate demand despite the external environment is also a big piece of that.  And then lastly, we're really excited about our acquisition posture. We were able to get one of these done. And when you can add stores that are on par with some of your larger stores in the country, how can you not be excited about that and the other ones that are in our pipeline, and some of them are two and three times the size of that. So we couldn't be more excited about our future. I appreciate everybody for joining the call, and thank you very much for your interest in America's Car-Mart.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."

Please see the company's website for the earnings release for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, along with the second news release about a leadership transition.  Participating on the call this morning are Jeff Williams, CEO; Doug Campbell, President; and Vickie Judy, CFO. I will now turn the call over to Jeff Williams, CEO. You may begin.\nJeff Williams : Okay. Well, thank you for joining us on the call this morning, and thank you for your interest in America's Car-Mart. I'm pleased to report that we delivered strong revenue growth for the quarter. We had solid improvements in many areas of our business. Near-term credit results are a challenge, and we'll discuss that in more detail in just a few minutes. Before we get into the details, I'm excited to cover our other news today that President, Doug Campbell, will succeed me as CEO effective October 1. Over the last year in his role as President, Doug has more than demonstrated his readiness for the new role. In my role as CEO and a board member, there are many responsibilities, but succession planning has been at the very top of the list for me, identifying a candidate with a strong cultural fit, the skill set to capitalize on opportunities and navigate the challenges ahead is why we first engaged with Doug almost two years ago now. Doug's appreciation of the company's culture, strong industry knowledge and being a change agent is why he's the perfect fit to lead us to the next level. Our transition plan will allow for a smooth handoff and I'll be here to fully support Doug as we move forward. So congratulations, and thank you, Doug.  I'll now turn it over to Vickie and Doug to review the quarter results, update you on the status of initiatives and provide an outlook on our business. Doug?\nDoug Campbell : Thanks, Jeff. I want to thank Jeff for all that he's done for the company over his 18 years of service and in particular, the last 6 years as CEO. We have continued to source inventory and grow our business despite the industry being very constrained and volatile over the last couple of years. While competitors are exiting the business unable to manage capital constraints, we have been investing in our business. It's in stark contrast with how others are managing through the environment and a testament to Jeff's both leadership and vision for the company in what has been one of the most challenging environments in the history of our industry. I owe Jeff a debt of gratitude for the time he has spent with me over the last year, and during that time, we've cultivated a fantastic working relationship that will serve us in facilitating the transition ahead. I'm equally appreciative to our Chair and our Board members who have been investing in my development and their feedback and guidance has been valuable.  On a personal note, I'm deeply humbled and thankful for the opportunity. As I look forward, I'm more enthusiastic about our future here at America's Car-Mart than it was a year ago. We're focused on the long-term health and success of our business and are demonstrating our ability to operate in any environment. Before we transition over to the quarterly results, I'd like to thank our associates who worked tirelessly to deliver improvements in sales volume, gross margin, procurement efforts, wholesale performance and reductions in repair spend. Their relentless pursuit to both put and keep our customers on the road continues to be a winning combination.  Let's start with sales performance. Our sales performance was strong, generating 15,912 units sold, which was up 2.4% over the prior year's quarter. Same-store sales base is up 8.2%. That had a nice impact on inventory turns as those moved up from 5.9 to 7.2 turns. Growth in online credit applications was up 19% for the quarter, which was mentioned in the press release. That accounts for about 70% of all of our applications. Overall, application volume was up 8.1% when including the contract that we see in our dealerships. This is especially impressive when you consider that we've now begun to augment our advertising spend because of the power of LOS and its ability to drive online traffic. The LOS continues to be the primary driver for our sales growth despite what is a down cycle for many with the remainder of the industry down in sales year-over-year during the same period.  Credit availability continues to be an issue for the industry and is tighter than previous year when looking at COX Automotive dealer track credit availability index. It has shown some mild improvement in the last month or two, but it's still worse when comparing it to pre-pandemic periods. This is a benefit for us as consumers now look to us for access to credit.  When I think about average selling prices during the quarter, they were up by 4.1% year-over-year. About half of that was related to the price of the vehicle. The other half was related to the ancillary products that we sell. On the last call, I discussed that the cars we were purchasing during the spring market were up about 3%, so there should be no surprise here. However, we also mentioned that the cars that we are buying are newer and have lower mileage. This ultimately makes it eligible for longer warranties, which generates more revenue in the selling prices. As a reminder, this is now even more pronounced when you consider the price increase that we made to our service contracts in December of last year.  The industry saw wholesale pricing decline sharply in May and June, while prices in July decreased at a more normalized rate. During the first quarter, our procurement teams lowered purchase prices sequentially throughout the quarter, contributing to a 3% reduction in prices from where we started. August wholesale pricing is showing price increases, which is at normal this time of year. It could be related to the sales strength we're seeing in the overall marketplace in August or low inventory days supply on the ground.  And I think some speculation of what will happen between negotiations with the UA team and the Big 3 in Detroit. We're keeping a close eye on that and what's transpiring and working to mitigate any effects and some of its effects there.  Gross margin came in at 34.6%, which was up 20 basis points compared to last year and up 120 basis points when I look at it sequentially versus the fourth quarter. We went into a fair bit of detail in the press release regarding gross margin and articulated what our plan was on the last call. So I don't want to be too redundant. But to put it simply, we're executing at an elevated level on the plan that we had laid out. We are now -- we are buying newer and lower mileage assets and those are trickling through our ecosystem. We're improving the performance of our operations teams as it relates to vehicle repairs and we continue to scale our reconditioning initiative, which has a target savings of $300 to $500 per unit.  We're seeing progress in all three areas, which isn't surprising, but I guess I'm really encouraged at the rate at which we're seeing in some of this benefit. We had estimated that we could recover 260 basis points of gross margin to achieve a 36% target that we alluded to on the last call. However, there are other opportunities that we're now exploring.  I'll give you an example. Transportation would be one of these. Last year, we changed the technology stack that we use to move vehicles throughout our ecosystem by optimizing loads and routes. We began to roll this out in the fourth quarter, but Q1 is the first full quarter we're seeing the benefit. It represented an improvement of 20 basis points in gross margin when compared to the first quarter of last year.  And ultimately, we're now saving about 15% on the way we move our vehicles. There are other opportunities with ancillary products, wholesale and repairs that we're looking at to drive even further improvements beyond what was initially indicated. Some of these opportunities can be realized during this fiscal year. Others will be more long term in nature. I'll now turn it over to Vickie, who will cover our financial results.\nVickie Judy : Good morning, and thank you, Doug. For the current quarter, our net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were 5.8%. That's compared to 5.1% for the first quarter of '23 and 6.3% sequentially. It is above our five-year average of 5% and our 10-year average of 5.6% for first quarters. Both of these include the low credit loss pandemic period.  For some comparisons to pandemic, our first quarter losses for fiscal year '18 and '19 were 6.1%. A little over half of the increase in losses contributed compared to the first quarter of fiscal '23 was due to the higher severity of losses and the remainder being an increased frequency in the losses. Our recovery values were down from historically high levels in the prior year quarter of 32% and held flat sequentially at approximately 27%. As of July 31, the allowance for loan losses was 23.91% of finance receivables, net of deferred revenue. And as discussed in the press release, our provision exceeded actual charge-offs by $14.8 million. We have over $125 million of deferred revenue on the balance sheet. And in addition, we also collected an additional $12 million in interest income, an increase of 27.3% when compared to Q1 of fiscal '23. We also mentioned in the press release the benefit of the LOS and attracting additional customers. It's also going to be instrumental in helping us improve deal structures and ultimately, the success rate of our customers once it is fully implemented across all lots. Our customer scores during the quarter remained consistent with the prior year. On the delinquency side, our accounts plus past due was at 4.4% compared to 3.6% in the prior year quarter. The month ending on a Monday versus a Sunday in the prior year contributed to part of this as well as the continuing negative impact of the inflationary environment on our customers. Total collections were up 12% to $166 million and total collections per active customer per month were $535 compared to $516 in the prior year quarter. We continue to work with our customers on payment options and modifications in an effort to keep them in the vehicle and successful on their contract. The average originating contract term for the quarter was 44.7 months compared to 42.8 for the prior year quarter and up slightly from 43.5 months sequentially. We added 1.9 months to the originating contract term compared to the prior year first quarter to assist our customers with an affordable payment.  Our weighted average contract term for the entire portfolio, including modifications, was 46.9 months compared to 44 for the prior year quarter. The weighted average age of the portfolio increased to approximately 10.4 months. The percentage of the portfolio held by the highest credit quality customers continues to improve compared to the prior year. On the SG&A side, we've been focused on identifying efficiencies in the business across the board. And as mentioned in the release, we had a savings with our SG&A spend of over $600,000 from the fourth quarter, excluding the stock-based compensation. A large percentage of the savings was in advertising. We continue to shift more of our advertising dollars to digital spend, which is more efficient and also help supplement our LOS efforts. Our customer count increased by 8.1% over the prior year to almost 105,000 customers. Our SG&A spend per average customer improved over the prior year first quarter and over the sequential quarter. Our investments are being made to better serve this growing base while improving the efficiencies as we move forward.  And although we continually evaluate our return on investment and allocation of capital, it becomes even more important in this environment of increasing funding costs. With that in mind, we did close two underperformed dealerships during the quarter to better allocate our available capital. We'll continue to review and monitor capital invested in each dealership and other investments to maximize returns.  At quarter end, we had $6.3 million in unrestricted cash and approximately $159 million in additional availability under our revolving credit facilities based on our current borrowing base of receivables and inventory. Our total securitized non-recourse notes payable was $711.8 million, with $86 million in restricted cash related to those notes. We closed on our third securitization in early July with net proceeds of $356 million and a coupon of 8.8%. And this paid off our revolving line of credit. Our total debt, net of cash to finance receivables ratio is at 42.9% and up from 41.5% at April 30. Interest expense increased $6.9 million with approximately 60% of that related to the increased rates over the prior year and the remainder a result of the increased borrowings. I'll now let Jeff to close this out.\nJeff Williams : Okay. Well, thank you, Vickie. The demand for our offering will continue to increase. Our model is the very best way to serve our high-touch customer base and the unique challenges that require a balance between face-to-face decentralized decisioning and leveraging scale where it makes sense. We're striking just the right balance, and that's more apparent as we continue to pick up market share. Current demand exceeds what we can supply. We believe that affordability will improve over time as basic transportation must be available for average consumers.  Currently, many customers are sitting out and will flow back into the market over time. In many respects, our customers are always in recession, which makes the current environment ideal as we focus on affordability and delivering outstanding service to keep our customers on the road. Foundational investments are nearing completion and will be leveraged, allowing us to become a more efficient data-driven company. We've not yet seen the benefit that will come.  We're on track to sell between 40 and 50 retail units per dealership per month in the next few years and eventually serve 1,000 customers per dealership. We believe credit results will improve, especially as we look at the opportunities with the LOS, increasing car quality and execution levels. We believe gross profit percentages will improve and will leverage SG&A as we move forward. And as discussed in the press release, we're in a unique period in the industry, and we have significant opportunities in the acquisitions areas. And we're talking to several strong operators with highly accretive opportunities, very excited about that. We have great days ahead and Doug is ready to lead our team forward. Thank you to all of our passionate associates who have signed on to our vision to be the best and dreams big about what we could be while taking care of our customers one at a time.  Thank you, and we'll now open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from John Murphy from Bank of America. Your line is now open. \nJohn Murphy : Good morning, everybody. Congrats to Jeff and Doug on the next legs of your careers here. I guess just a first question. When you think about the extension in contract terms to help with the monthly affordability equation, I'm just curious if you think that ever reverses? Or is this something that is now structurally in place and that we'll continue to see lengthening? Or has there been a period of time Car-Mart's history or over time where contract terms have actually shortened once they've been entered over time?\nJeff Williams : Yeah. We do see an opportunity in the future to reel back in and decrease terms as we go forward. Our customers' wages continue to go up. And I think the last few months, few quarters, we've seen real wage increases for our consumers. So we do feel like eventually, we can move that term in the other direction. But that's going to be based to a large extent on what happens with car prices and wages as we go forward and other inflationary pressures. But we would certainly like to really in term, and we do think there's a very realistic and real possibility of us moving that direction, especially as we look at the LOS and all the different features and functions and benefits we're going to get when that tool gets fully rolled in.\nJohn Murphy : That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on some of the comments that were made in the press release about the changes in purchase and disposition of vehicles. And I'm just wondering if you could sort of expand on what changes have actually occurred? And is it something where we're just looking at slightly newer vehicles that are being put into inventory that have lower recon costs, and that's the efficiencies that are gained and just what's actually changing there that's making that more efficient over time? Because I thought you've been pretty good at that historically, but it sounds like you see room for improvement.\nDoug Campbell : Yeah. Thanks for the question. I would say historically, we have been very good at that. It was, I think, my very first call on -- that I spoke about how we had used that as a lever to mitigate some of the costs. And we went to a little bit older car with a little bit higher mileage. And while it had its benefits upfront, there's a repair cost associated with that downstream, which has been somewhat problematic. And so what we're trying to do is get back to our historical norms.  But beyond that, we've seen efficiency gains what I would call that are more closer to pre-pandemic levels. And so the car we used to sell might have been nine or 10 years old, we're able to shave a year off that and improve the overall mileage by 10,000 to 12,000 miles, what I would call versus pre-pandemic. So the car inherently is a lower mileage car, which should generate less in repairs and ultimately, I think it gives us a second chance at retailing the unit, should we have to go down the repossession route. It creates a second chance to -- for the inventory to have another purpose in our business.\nJeff Williams : John, I would add in the last two or three years with the pandemic and the chip shortage and the used car issues and all the supply chain issues we had that there was some real disruption in our historical performance on product and procurement and is kind of working itself out at the same time that we're making some good improvements internally.\nJohn Murphy : All right. Thank you very much, guys. I'll get back in the queue. That's very interesting. Thank you.\nJeff Williams: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Kyle Joseph from Jefferies. Your line is now open. \nKyle Joseph : Hey, good morning, guys. Congrats Jeff. Let me know if you or everyone go play golf. Anyway, so kind of piggybacking on that last question in terms of gross profit margin. Obviously, used car prices have been elevated. It seemed like they may be coming back to earth for a while. But longer term, do you think the gross profit margin has changed systemically? Or do you think gradually over time and get back to where it was?\nDoug Campbell : Yeah. Thanks, Kyle, for the question. I think there's an opportunity to sort of have a middle ground there. But as we sort of called out earlier, maybe we set our expectations a little too low on that 36%, and we're realizing in real time. There's benefits beyond what we initially anticipated, especially when you consider items like transportation that maybe wasn't sort of initially on the table, but we're looking at any and all things in the business to sort of drive improvements there. One thing that I didn't mention in the last answer was what we own those cars relative to the book value. And if I just go back, if I used, I call it, this time last year to the current time. So over the last 12 or 13 months, how we own those cars relative to the book has improved 8% or 9%. So it's a combination of an improvement of how these cars are starting life in our portfolio. There's the improvement in a younger car with lower miles which all should have benefits downstream in terms of credit loss and fair market value retention, right? It sort of takes some of that risk and exposure off the table.\nKyle Joseph : Got it. Very helpful. And then, yeah, my follow-up would be the health of the underlying consumer. I know you mentioned the quarter ended on a different day and -- but at the end of the day, the low-end consumer still employed inflation pressures are easing a bit? How would you gauge the health of your underlying consumer?\nVickie Judy : Yeah. I don't think we're seeing any large changes yet. Again, to your point, unemployment still very low. They're working, wages are still good, hours worked are still good. But there are still a lot of inflationary pressures and just the adjustment to those inflationary pressures and the lack of stimulus that was there for a point in time.  So credit, the use of credit has gone back up for our consumers. We're seeing that kind of across the board. But again, our consumers are almost typically always in a recession, living paycheck to paycheck. So it's really just an adjustment and getting them back used to the higher car payments and keeping them in their car.\nJeff Williams : But overall, the health of our consumer is increasing quarter-over-quarter. As we move forward, we believe that's going to be a better situation for us as we go forward and as Vickie mentioned, unemployment rates are historically low and real wages are gaining some steam in the areas we serve and the customers we serve.\nVickie Judy : And I think a piece of that is, as Doug mentioned, the tightening in the lending environment, we are seeing a different cohort of consumers come down into our market. We continue to see that. \nKyle Joseph : Got it. Thanks Vickie, thanks, Doug, thanks Jeff. \nJeff Williams : Thanks, Kyle.\nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions]And our next question comes from John Rowan from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open. \nJohn Rowan : Good morning. Congrats Jeff and Doug. I guess some other larger lenders have postulated that with the potential for our strike, and you guys mentioned this in your prepared remarks a little bit, that there would be an increase in dealer inventory, guys would take up floor plan loans. Obviously, fiscal 2023 midyear, you were very heavy in inventory. Are you planning on raising inventory levels at all if this strike looks like it's going in one direction? And I'm not sure really -- obviously, everything flows downstream. I don't necessarily think there's necessarily an immediate shortage in used cars, but just curious if you think there'll be a ripple effect that could cause you to raise inventory levels?\nDoug Campbell : I don't -- so I think about it differently. It's a great question and certainly been on our minds. I don't know sort of which way it's going, but we're sort of trying to prepare ourselves for any variation of an outcome. I think ultimately, if you go back to the last strike on record, I think it was the GM strike, and you go track overall used car prices, which you saw was upward pressure, especially on those brands. I think it was a General Motor strike. If you go back and look at those brands, you saw a nice increase in pop and pricing is days supply diminished on the ground. It almost happened in real time because there's a lot of speculation in and around that.  And so when you have three automakers, right, potentially going on strike and the deadline is looming here, you have to sort of be ready for that, and it's going to be more than just the overall impact on those three automakers. It will just be a shortage of supply on the ground. If you looked at absolute supply in our industry, it's still really at sort of all-time lows. And so the instance of something like this happening could drive values up. And so for us, that is some headwind on the buying side. We can combat that with being more selective on the cars we buy. But to your point, I think what you're alluding to is, do we stock up for an event like that? I don't think that is necessarily a lever we would pull. However, I do think if there was some appreciation in value, it becomes a tailwind on the fair market values that we have for the cars that were taken back the repo vehicles.  So there's good and bad to us being having the lending side to this, and -- we're just trying to make sure we're ready. We don't know sort of which way it's going to go, but our job is to be ready for that, and we're looking at those options available to us now.\nJeff Williams : You mentioned on the last call, too, that a lot of competition that we have is struggling with capital. We had a couple of sizable competitors go out of business in the last six months or so, too. So there's some positive on the supply side in addition to some potential negatives too. So that all balances out. And we're pretty nimble on our procurement. So we'll be able to address and adjust any situation we see.\nJohn Rowan : Great. Thank you. \nJeff Williams : Thanks, John. \nOperator: And thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Vincent Caintic from Stephens. Your line is now open. \nVincent Caintic : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Doug, congratulations and look forward to working with you and Jeff, it's been a pleasure working with you for the past several years, and we'll miss you. So first one to zoom out just kind of a broad question about the CEO transition. And if you could walk us through that. It sounds like this process has been going on for the past few years. So I just wanted to kind of get a sense for why now is a good time for the transition and then Doug, anything in particular you'd like to focus on as we start your tenure?\nJeff Williams : Well, yes, as to the timing, this is just a good time in our history. We've -- we've been through some pretty difficult times. Things are still tough, but getting a little bit better in some of these long-term, highly complex, labor-intensive investments and initiatives we've had in place. Doug has been able to participate in those for the last year. And those are all coming into play and with Doug and his experience and his talent level.  It's just -- it's a perfect time for us as a company, especially with the transition being extended. There will be plenty of support, plenty of time to transition appropriately as we go forward. So this is just a good time for me, for Doug and for our company and our associates and shareholders. It's a good time in history to be making this change, especially with the transition plan we have in place.\nDoug Campbell : My first, obviously, opportunity to be a CEO of the company. And again, I'm humbled, but at the end of the day, there are a lot of associates who are relying on smooth transition -- shareholders relying on a smooth transition. And the more we thought about it, the longer Jeff stayed on to help assist with the transition for the things we know and especially on the credit side of the business of Vincent that it sort of made more sense to accelerate making the announcement and then having Jeff stand up for a longer period of time as opposed to postponing it and doing the transition to a shorter period of time. And I think leading to your question, I'll probably spend more time on the credit side of the business, the underwriting side of the business and see what improvements that we have there, especially given credit loss. And when I think about some of the improvements we made in other areas of the business, I'm excited to sort of roll up my sleeves and see what other opportunities are there as well.\nVincent Caintic : Okay. Great. That's super helpful. My next question, I wanted to touch on the shelf filing that was filed a couple of weeks ago and in some of the comments that were made in the shelf filing, particularly the kind of the unprecedented opportunities you might be seeing, if you could talk about that in more detail what you're seeing and sort of what you're looking for that makes you excited about those opportunities?\nJeff Williams : Yeah. The industry, obviously, has been in turmoil. We've had major competitors going out of business. There's a lot of folks that have been in the business for decades that don't have an exit strategy, don't have a succession plan, the cost of being in the business continues to go up. So there's a lot of very good, very strong operators out there of size that are looking for a succession plan or how to get out of the business. And so what we do and what we've offered on the acquisition side is appealing to more and more good operators, and we've got some good discussions going on. Very optimistic about being able to continue to pick up productivity and profits from our existing store base and then add this acquisition's effort on separate and apart from all the other good stuff going on. And it could be really a good point, a great point in history for us to be going out and getting more aggressive with acquisitions and we're setting ourselves up to do just that. And the shelf registration was just another aspect to that opportunity and giving us more options on the financing side, if and when needed, to support some acquisitions.\nVincent Caintic : Okay. Great. Thank you. And if I could maybe sneak one more in for Vickie. Just on the credit side, the credit reserves have been increasing and understandably about the mix and the term and so forth. Just as the way things stand right now, do you foresee that the credit reserves where we're at, is that sort of the right level? Or should we be anticipating just help term and mix things continue to change? Thank you.\nVickie Judy : Sure. Well, we continue to look at that quarterly based on historical numbers and what's happening in the current market as well as some forecasting for some economic events. So we did increase it slightly in the fourth quarter. We were able to keep it level this quarter. So it's hard to say quarter-over-quarter, but we're working on a lot of things. As we mentioned in the press release and in a few of my comments in bringing down term, working on down payments hopefully reducing some selling price finance as we move forward. So those will all be things that we're working on to hopefully offset the impact of any allowance increases. But that's certainly a possibility as we move forward here and depending on what happens over the next few quarters.\nVincent Caintic : Okay, that's super helpful. Thanks, again, everyone. \nVickie Judy : Thank you. \nJeff Williams : Thank you, Vincent. \nOperator: And, thank you. And I am showing no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jeff Williams for closing remarks.\nJeff Williams : Okay. Well, once again, thank you for listening to our call, and thank you for your interest in America's Car-Mart. Doug, congratulations again on your promotion to CEO. We'll have a smooth transition and we appreciate and respect all of our associates out there that have passion for what we do and support each other and support our customers at a very high level. So thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
