I'd like to welcome John Dolan, Chief Business Development Officer and General Counsel for PetVivo. John?\nJohn Dolan : Thank you, Chris. Greetings, and welcome to the PetVivo Holdings third quarter of fiscal year 2024 financial results conference call. My name is John Dolan, the Chief Business Development Officer and General Counsel at PetVivo. Today's call is being webcast and will be posted on the company's website for playback. Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that comments made during this conference call by PetVivo's executives may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Any statements I refer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events, including financial projections or future market conditions is a forward-looking statement. PetVivo's actual future results could differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements for any reason, including those listed in its SEC filings. PetVivo assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. PetVivo filed its earnings release and Form 10-Q with the SEC today, which provide a detailed discussion of our financial results. These documents can be found in the SEC website and the Investor Relations section of our website. I would now like to turn the call over to John Lai, the CEO and President of PetVivo. Please go ahead, John.\nJohn Lai: Thank you, John, and welcome. Also joining me today is Bob Folkes, our CFO. I would like Bob to begin by discussing some of the highlights and financial results for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024. John Dolan will provide an update on our clinical studies and I will conclude with sharing some additional thoughts on our business strategy and key focus areas for fiscal 2024, before we open the line up for questions. I will now turn it over to Bob.\nBob Folkes: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key highlights for the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 were the following: We entered into a non-exclusive distribution agreement with Covetrus North America LLC to distribute Spryng in the United States. We released clinical study results, which demonstrate the benefit and tolerability of an intra-articular injection of Spryng into the stifle joint for dogs with suspected cruciate ligament rupture, kind of similar to ACL tear in humans. We reported revenues of $596,000 as compared to $510,000 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. Revenues for the third quarter included a net revenue of $440,000 as compared to $457,000 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023 from shipments of Spryng to MWI Animal Health, a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen, who is a leading distributor of animal health products pursuant to our distribution and sales agreement with MWI. We reported $106,000 in revenue from shipments from -- of Spryng to Covetrus. And we also reported revenues of $49,000 on direct sales to veterinary clinics as compared to $54,000 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. We raised $1,248,000 on February 2, 2024, from the sale of approximately 1,386,000 units consisting of 1 share and 1 warrant. And we ended with $519,000 in accounts receivable at December 31, 2023. I would like to turn the call over to John Dolan to provide more color on this cruciate ligament study and on our additional clinical studies. John?\nJohn Dolan : Thank you, Bob. As mentioned in our earnings call in November 2023, the final results of our clinical study conducted by Ethos Veterinary Health, a nationally renowned operator of 145 world-class specialty veterinary hospitals was presented at the American College of Veterinary Surgeons Conference on October 12 through the 14, 2023, in Louisville, Kentucky. The study involved evaluating the benefit and tolerability of intra-articular injection of Spryng into the stifle joint of dogs with suspected partial or complete cranial cruciate ligament rupture. The final results of the cranial cruciate disease study provided by Ethos indicated significant improvement in 39 dogs injected with Spryng. All primary and secondary clinical endpoints related to pain, lameness and quality of life were achieved. It is our position that this clinical trial demonstrates that Spryng is a reasonable non-invasive alternative for patients with cranial cruciate ligament disease when patients and/or owner factors preclude surgical intervention. We also previously indicated in our earnings call in November 2023 that we anticipate the release of data related to two tolerant studies measuring the tolerability of dogs and cats receiving intra-articular injections of Spryng in their hips, shoulders, elbows and stifles. We have completed the release of the data from these 2 tolerant studies, both demonstrating that tolerance of dogs and cats injected intra-articularly with Spryng. This tolerability data is available to veterinarians and others on our sprynghealth.com website. Additionally, we have completed data accumulation for the first cohort of dogs involved in a clinical study, evaluating the efficacy of an intra-articular injection of Spryng to manage unilateral or bilateral coxofemoral, that's hip, joint osteoarthritis, an abstract highlighting the favorable results found in this first cohort of dogs. This study will be presented at the Veterinary Orthopedic Society Conference today on February 12, 2024. Actually, it happens this evening. Such results demonstrate that Spryng is a minimally invasive management option for dogs suffering from Coxofemoral, i.e. hip joint osteoarthritis. We anticipate the final data of this study to be released in approximately the fourth quarter of 2024.  The acquisition of clinical data proving the safety and efficacy of Spryng in a multitude of indications is incredibly important to PetVivo. The company has another three canine studies and two equine studies currently progressing or in anticipated progress with results from these studies planned for release in 2024. Furthermore, the company plans to organize and conduct more clinical studies to expand our library of data, which demonstrates the safety and efficacy of Spryng in a variety of indications. Such a library will assist our sales team to gain veterinarian acceptance of Spryng. I would like to turn it back over to John Lai.\nJohn Lai: Thank you, John. We have recently witnessed a strong movement of positive awareness by small animal veterinary doctors of our product Spryng. The awareness has been enhanced due to principal factors following positive results from the CCL study of clinical data that was presented by Ethos. And then this evening at VOS, Veterinary Orthopedic Societies Conference on hips, we expect to see another very good type presentation by the clinician. We've been getting peer reviewed articles such as Dr. Tammy Grubb. She is recognized as an expert in small -- well, canine pain management. She is a professor at Washington State University Veterinary School, and she basically did a peer review article in the Today's Veterinary Practice July issue of 2023, which she indicated that Spryng should be looked at as first use product, as well as also a good choice as an alternative for dogs that cannot take NSAIDs, which is about 5% of the population in the United States out of the 83 million dogs. We've also been getting numerous key opinion leaders mentioning Spryng at conferences. That's a very powerful way of really getting the word out to the small animal doctors. Our first one of the year in terms of multiple -- trade shows was the veterinary medical expo in Orlando mid-January where we had five veterinary doctors that were speakers mentioning the Spryng product, which was a very nice surprise that drew very good attendance and audience into our booth. And one of the things we're recognizing is that three years ago, when we were at this conference, many of the veterinary doctors approached the booth and was not familiar with Spryng.  Last year, they were familiar with it, but didn't know any vets that were using it. This year, they were familiar with it and knew vets that were using it and hearing really good things about and wanted to learn more and we were able to convert a lot of those into orders. Also, we signed Covetrus at the end of December. So that gives us the top two distributors, which gives a lot of confirmation of what they see this product potential is as we move forward. So we have the number 1 and 2 players in the United States in terms of distribution. Also, the combination of data, KOLs speaking positively about our product and allowing vet acceptance of Spryng in dogs and cats with the following events that have been happening. Finally, we plan to increase our social media focus by highlighting our clinical study results and positive outcomes from the use of Spryng. Now I would like to open the line to questions. Operator, can you please inform the callers how to ask questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] All right, John, it doesn't look like we have any questions that are coming up, so I'll turn it back to you.\n :\n :\nJohn Lai: Thanks, operator, and thanks, everyone, for your interest in PetVivo. We remain focused on getting Spryng into the market, so we can help companion animals suffering from osteoarthritis. Again, thank you for joining our call today."

I will now turn it over to Bob.\nBob Folkes: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key highlights for the second quarter fiscal year 2024 include, we reported revenues of $207,000 as compared to $223,000 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Revenues for the second quarter included net revenue of $143,000 as compared to $118,000 in the second quarter fiscal year 2023 from shipments of spring to MWI Animal Health, a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen, who is a leading distributor of animal health products pursuant to our distribution and sales agreement with MWI. We also reported revenues of $64,000 on direct sales to veterinary clinics as compared to $105,000 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. We also raised $2.35 million from the sales of the company's common stock and a convertible note offering and a registered direct offering in August of 2023. And we raised $1.7 billion in October and November of 2023 from the sale of 725,000 shares of the company's common stock pursuant to the ATM sales agreement with ThinkEquity LLC and in a private offering. And finally, we released clinical study results, which demonstrate the benefit and tolerability of an intra-articular injection of Spryng into the stifle joints for dogs with suspected cruciate ligament rupture, kind of similar to ACL tear in humans. And I would like to turn the call over to John Dolan to provide more color on this cruciate ligament study and on our additional clinical studies.\nJohn Dolan: Thank you, Bob. As Bob just mentioned, the final results for our clinical study conducted by Ethos Veterinary Health, a nationally renowned operator of 145 world-class specialty veterinary hospitals was presented at the American College of Veterinary Surgeons Conference on October 12 through the 14th 2023 in Louisville, Kentucky. The study involved evaluating the benefit and tolerability of intra-articular injections of Spryng into the stifle joint of dogs with suspected partial or complete cranial cruciate ligament rupture. An abstract highlighting the results of the first cohort of dogs in this study was presented at the Veterinary Orthopedic Society Conference in March 2023, which demonstrated that Spryng is a minimally invasive management option for dogs suffering from cranial cruciate disease. The final results of the Cranial Cruciate Disease study provided by Ethos indicated significant improvement in 39 dogs injected with Spryng. All primary and secondary clinical endpoints related to pain, leanness and quality of life were achieved. It is our position that this clinical trial demonstrates that Spryng as a reasonable, non-invasive alternative for patients with Cranial Cruciate Disease, CCD, when patients and/or owners factors preclude surgical intervention. We previously indicated in our earnings call in August 2023, that we anticipated that three of our Small Animal clinical studies were published within the next three or four months. Two of those studies were tolerant studies also referred to, as safety studies. These two tolerant studies have been caught in the review process of two reputable publications longer than anticipated. In view of the company's ongoing release, of efficacy studies, we believe it is important to make the data from the tolerance studies available to veterinarians. Therefore, we have decided that white papers on the tolerant studies will be created and publicly made available through electronic and print publication by the company. The results of such -- of each of these tolerant studies demonstrated the safety of Spryng. The acquisition of clinical data proving the safety and efficacy of Spryng and a multitude of indications is incredibly important to pet vivo. As previously suggested, the company has another three Canine Studies and two Equine Studies currently progressing with results from these studies planned for release in 2024. Furthermore, the company plans to organize and conduct more clinical studies to expand our library of data that demonstrates the safety and efficacy of Spryng in a variety of indications. Such a library will assist our sales team to gain veterinary acceptance of Spryng. I would like to turn it back over to John Lai.\nJohn Lai: Thank you, John. We have recently witnessed a very positive response from veterinary doctors, specifically in the Small Animal side. I was at the US Vet Show last week in New York City. And I would have to say, over 70% of the vets we -- when they saw the Spryng Shirt made comments about the product and that really sets us up nicely with having the MWI reps, they would to call on these Small Animal reps or Vet, I'm sorry. So the positive results that we got from Ethos that we presented about not us, but the Ethos clinician presented ACBS about six weeks ago really adds to help solidify the argument or the proposition that was made in the Tammy Grub article, which is a peer-review article on spinous being a first use product. The other part of that article was that Spring would be an excellent alternative or very good alternative to dogs that have a reaction -- negative reaction to NSAIDs, which is the gold-standard therapy. So, about 5% of the dogs out of the 83 million dogs would have an issue taking NSAIDs. And the argument there was that Spring would be a great alternative. And with this data, we're able to really start marketing to the small animal vets. We are also gathering a lot of key opinion leaders in the marketplace in the small animal side, which are talking about Spring at the various conferences. And that was one of the goals we wanted to get to a couple of years ago when we first went on NASDAQ, we talked about the importance of podium presentations at all these conferences that are coming up because it's the KOL, the key opinion leaders that talk about Spring, and now we're starting to get scientific data to support the first the first-use thesis, because the first-use thesis gives a much better opportunity for veterinary doctors to adopt versus using the product on the worst-case animals, which they call last use or disasters to try to save the dog from being put down. And we're seeing very good results from that aspect, but we want the vets to think about it beyond last use and go to first use. We are very excited about the American Association of Equine Practitioners Conference in San Diego this year. It's the -- starts November 30yj and ends December 2nd, it's the largest equine conference of the year. And we have two of our veterinary doctors that will be presenting. And so there will be -- Dr. Tom Yarbrough will be giving a presentation on -- which is entitled modern Wild West navigating the new classes of joint therapies. And Dr. Joe Manning will be presenting on achievements in intra-articular therapies experiences and novel collagen hydrogel microparticle at CEHF. A lot of words there. So, we're excited with the type of information and presentation. So, we expect that to be a very good conference in adding a lot more equine practitioners and clinics to our network. We also plan to have some of our clinical data from Ethos and Innovex at the various trade shows coming up in the small animal side. In January, we have VMX, which is the Veterinary Medical Expo. It's the largest conference for small animals in the United States, and that's in Orlando. And then followed by that is the WBC Western Veterinary Conference in February in Las Vegas. That's the largest show in the West Coast pretty much and then BOS, which is also in February. So, these three major shows were smaller animal with the data, and we talked about the white papers, for cats and dogs that will be published here will help provide a lot of ammunition for the sales team to call on the small animal veterinary doctors and -- may feel really good from the New York show that I would say over 70% of the vets have heard about spring, and they're happy to -- when they're called upon by the sales reps now wanting to learn more about it. Finally, we're going to be really pushing the social media awareness for the small animals. 55% of pet ownership is right now with the millennials and GenZ. And they're the ones that are spending whatever it takes to provide an improvement in quality of life and better health care outcomes for the animals. So we feel with the distribution or that the clinics that we have in the majority of the states and the number of clinics, we can take this approach now to drive social media. And also, we're able to convey the message to the pet owners that we're able to provide a much more efficient cost structure and in the long run, it helps the pet owner reduce the cost of working with osteoarthritis and other health issues and that over time, they're going to have better medical outcomes and savings because they don't have the side effects of the various other products. And with that, operator, I would like to open it up to Q&A.\nOperator: With pleasure. Yes. [Operator Instructions] Any questions [Operator Instructions] Thank you.\nJohn Lai: Since I don't see any questions, this is John Lai. I'll give a quick overview of the general market for the pet industry. So recent numbers, we've seen the pet industry are being put into many of the stocks that were COVID stocks -- sorry, I think I do see a question. So I'll answer the question before I talk about the industry.\nOperator: Wonderful. From an anonymous attendee, what's happening with the drastic stock drop?\nJohn Lai: So that was part of my overview of the industry. So the pet industry has become out of favor, because if you look at the macro numbers, pre-COVID, there was 68% homeownership or pet ownership. And then after the COVID, it was 71% recently, we saw the number of pet ownership dropped to 66%. And if you look at the microcap stocks specifically in the pet industry, under $100 million in the last 60 days, we have seen on average of 35% decline within the veterinary -- within the pet space. Now the difference here is other companies that are dropping are pretty much like me to companies. So if you look at Blue Diamond, the reduction of food sales went way down, and -- well, I shouldn't say I shouldn't pick on that, but as the premium products have come down to mainstream products. So they're buying the arena -- and so everybody is cutting expenditures down within the pet industry. So we're kind of lumped in. And if you look at the stock that were part of the COVID stocks, they took 80%, 90% hits in their stock. If you're looking at the pet industry, you're seeing in the small caps pretty much the same type of action. Now, obviously, I think we've put into the long segment within there because our product is quite disruptive, and it's actually saving the consumer money as well as providing better medical outcomes. And a lot of these studies are supporting that argument as well as Dr. Tammy Grubb he will review article talking about how our products should be looked at by veterinary doctors is first use and as alternatives to NSX, which is both of those segments are very large and a very large market potential for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Any other questions, feel free to use the chat your phone with those fronts in the chat or raise your hand if you want to do so. If there's nothing else could we please confirm the information and the contact details where attendees can require or get more information?\nJohn Dolan: An operator, I see one more item in the chat. I think it's directly to John. So you don't see a near-term rebound is the aspect?\nJohn Lai: So, as you know, when you get near year-end and you have this type of drop within the market, because it has been a horrible microcap market, the dispersion between the S&P 500 and the Russell 3000 hasn't been this wide in probably 40 years in terms of total return for each one of the respective indexes. So you tend to get tax loss selling. Now, every year, you're seeing tax loss selling occur, especially at the institutional level. So, it's likely we're experiencing some tax loss selling, and one would expect that to end relatively soon. And given the fact, we're getting all this clinical data and we've got all these major shows coming up, the AAEP at the end of this month of November and then early January and February, we got three major small animal shows. We believe, those are really good catalysts as well as the white papers being published. So there is a lot of enthusiasm among our management team as well as the salespeople, because we're seeing this data that now we can go after small animals. So just to give you an example, the equine space has about 8 million horses in the United States. In terms of dogs, there's about 83 million dogs. And keep in mind, if you look at the alternative use, I mean, the dogs that can't take NSAIDs and Spryng be an alternative use, 5% of that 83 million is a very good candidate from one, from an economic standpoint; two, from a efficacy standpoint. And then also, we have 60 million cats. So the cat safety study will be out in white paper form here relatively soon. So with all that, we really expand the potential market size. Operator, so there's no more questions. I think we can conclude the call.\nOperator: Correct. Yes. Perhaps just leave -- I did post communication channel, the website and an e-mail address so they can contact you. But if you want to reiterate another contract as you close off, that will be great. Thank you so much.\nJohn Lai: Yes. We have the info1@petvivo.com., always too, if you need to send a question e-mail-wise. And a lot of the shareholders actually know me pretty well, and they call me direct. So feel free to call, if you have any follow-up questions. And thank you for attending the call. This concludes the formal Q&A presentation.\nOperator: Goodbye."

I will now turn over the call to Bob.\nBob Folkes: Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Our key highlights for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, where we reported revenues of $117,000 as compared to $58,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Revenues for the first quarter included net revenue of $34,000 from shipments of Spryng to MWI Animal Health, a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen, who is a leading distributor of animal health products, pursuant to our distribution and sales agreement with MWI dated June 17, 2022. We also reported revenues of $83,000 on direct sales to veterinary clinics as compared to $58,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. We added Spencer Breithaupt, a veteran in the animal health industry and former member of the leadership team at MWI Animal Health, to the company's Board of Directors. We also raised $2.1 million from the sale of the company's common stock in a registered direct offering in April 2023. And also subsequent to June 30, 2023, the company raised an aggregate of $2,325,000 in net proceeds from two offerings. On July 27, 2023, the company raised net proceeds of $550,000 in a private offering of convertible notes. And then on August 9, 2023, the company raised net proceeds of $1,775,000 from a registered direct offering of its common stock, conducted concurrently with a private offering of warrants. So we continue to invest our resources to expand our sales and marketing efforts and clinical data to gain vet acceptance and increase revenues from the sale of Spryng. And now I would like to turn the call over to John Dolan to provide an update on our clinical studies.\nJohn Dolan: Thank you, Bob. We provided a detailed overview of PetVivo's clinical studies in our last earnings call on June 30, 2023. To summarize, PetVivo has a total of eight clinical studies in progress or that have been completed; six small animal clinical studies, i.e., canine and feline; and two equine clinical studies. We are fortunate to be working with a number of world-renowned research organizations, such as Colorado State University, Ethos Veterinary Health, and Inotiv, Inc. We anticipate that three of our small animal clinical studies will publish within the next three to four months. Furthermore, we are looking forward to the presentation of the final results of our clinical study conducted by Ethos Veterinary Health at the American College of Veterinary Surgeons Conference in October of 2023. The study is related to evaluating the benefit and tolerability of intraarticular injection of Spryng into the stifle joints of dogs with suspected partial or complete cranial cruciate ligament rupture. An abstract was presented at the Veterinary Orthopedic Society Conference in March 2023, demonstrating that Spryng is a minimally invasive management option for dogs suffering from cranial cruciate disease. The acquisition of clinical data proving the safety and efficacy of Spryng in a multitude of indications is incredibly important to PetVivo. The company plans to organize and conduct more clinical studies in addition to the ones in progress in order to expand our library of data that demonstrates the safety and efficacy of Spryng in a variety of indications. Such a library will assist our sales team to gain veterinarian acceptance in Spryng. I would like to turn it back over to John Lai.\nJohn Lai: Thank you, John. I would like to talk more about our business strategy and key focus areas for fiscal 2024: clinical studies from Ethos and Inotiv and podium presentations to support the upcoming national trade shows, and support the MWI small animal sales team. As to date, still, the majority of our sales around 90% are in the equine space. And we have not really pushed the MWI sales reps as well as our sales reps to go after the small animal clinics. With this data that we expect to be receiving over the next three to four months, it will open up the avenue and give the ammunition that's needed. Now the podium presentations and clinical or clinician presentations will be occurring, the first one, at the ACVS in October of 2023. That is a dog study. And then, also, in November of 2023, the AAEP, we actually have multiple presentations by veterinary doctors at that conference. And that is the biggest conference in the United States for equine vets. And the first of the year, I think it's the second week in January of 2024, is the VMX. We will have presentations there. And this conference, last year, when we had two of the speakers talk about Spryng, we ended up getting 2,700 badges scanned. So we feel we will get very good traction now that we have very important data as well as literature and supporting data for the small animal vets. And then in February, we have the biggest show on the West Coast. It's the Western Veterinary Conference in Las Vegas. And we also have presentations there. So we feel these are really large potential events that will create an adoption of many of the veterinary doctors. So we had a nice little surprise about five weeks ago. There was a peer review article that showed up in Today's Veterinary Practice journal. And there was the July-August issue. And it was written by Dr. Tammy Grubb. She is recognized nationally and internationally as an expert in canine pain management. She's the President-elect of the International Veterinary Academy of Pain Management. She will be taking charge as the President. She's also an adjunct professor at Washington State University. And she's been using our product, I believe, for about two years. But in the article, she made some very important comments that will help us from the standpoint of educating veterinary doctors. One of the biggest key takeaways was she stated that Spryng with OsteoCushion technology is a frontline-use product. And the second takeaway was that dogs that have an adverse reaction to NSAIDs, which there's 83 million dogs in the United States and approximately 5% of those dogs cannot take NSAIDs, that Spryng would make a very good alternative. And if we look at it from an economic standpoint, Spryng is one of the lowest cost options if your dog can't take NSAIDs and the one with the potential for the least amount of adverse events or side effects. But I want to address the front-use product. In past calls, I talked about how, when a small animal doctor or a dog canine veterinary doctor orders our product, they have a tendency to use it as a last-resort product. They've tried everything else. The dogs -- it's not functioning, or they're not getting any types of results that would be beneficial. And they're pretty much ready to put the dog down. And then they order our product, they try it, and then they see that it's doing extremely well. The dogs gain tremendous mobility and so on. And in the mindset of the veterinary doctors, this is a last-use product that's creating amazing results. But it takes a while for them to learn. And we're in the position to really, with all this data, all this outside peer-review articles and so on, it will make it where they're comfortable in using it as first use. So the general pattern is six months, they use it as a last-resort item. Then they start feeling comfortable for the next 90 days, injecting a couple of other joints. Then after a year, they start going, I'm very comfortable with this. And then at 1.25 to 1.5 years, they actually start writing in the checkup exits, saying, hey, this dog is likely to get hip dysplasia at age seven. It's something you should keep an eye on. And at the first signs, let's talk about the use of Spryng. So it becomes a much-earlier-use product. And by Dr. Tammy Grubb making the statement that we should look at this as a frontline first-use product is very meaningful. And I'm not saying it's going to replace NSAIDs. But it is a possibility of using it in conjunction as well as, also, we have seen in the real-world application, once Spryng is introduced, the need for NSAIDs is greatly reduced or eliminated. So just to give you a clue how big the NSAID market is, in the United States, it's 385 million in the last reported year. I just saw the numbers come out -- I believe it was Grand View Research -- for 2021. So moving on from there, we're anticipating we're going to get other types of articles that will come out or journal articles. And then going forward with MWI, having all this data will help us work with MWI to increase veterinary acceptance in the small animal side. And on the last call, we talked about the turnover at MWI, and that's looking like we're smoothing that out, and things are back in line. So we're also going to be using a lot of increased social media focus. And what I mean by that is we're going to be putting up a lot of actual real-world cases using Pinterest, Instagram, and so on. Because we find the amount of veterinary texts as well as the consumers -- they're reaching out to their vets. And we've been really focusing on that because now -- we did a news release. We're in 47 states, and we're starting to pick up good-size clinics in major cities. So we're very comfortable now, having the consumer reach out to their vets. And then their vets are looking around their current area, and they're finding other vets using the product. So that will really help us. And actually, we have been getting very good results recently with our social media. So I would now like to open the line up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Ms. Ribble.\nUnidentified Analyst: I don't know if anyone can hear me.\nJohn Lai: I can hear you, but there's a feedback.\nUnidentified Analyst: Is that better?\nJohn Lai: Yes, much better.\nUnidentified Analyst: Oh, perfect. I'm just curious like -- I know in the beginning of everything, and I'm new to this world. So thank you for putting up with my greenness. Just -- we keep talking about a timeframe when they're starting injecting smaller animals and blah, blah, blah. Just when is that exact timeframe is my -- I'm just not clear on.\nJohn Lai: Well, right now, veterinary doctors can buy the product, okay, for dogs and cats. We haven't pushed on that side because we talked about all these clinical datas and presentations on the small animals in September, October coming out. So we feel that's a big catalyst. But in the meantime, we're seeing a lot of great results occurring in the dogs and the cat side. And in many of the larger cities, we have multiple clinics using our product. Does that help answer the question?\nUnidentified Analyst: It does. And then I know you keep saying -- referring to smaller animals. But isn't the long-term intention to be on bigger animals as well or --?\nJohn Lai: No, we started off on the equine because that's an easy market for us. Because the veterinary doctors see the results right away. While when you're dealing with small animals, they like to have the clinical data to support whatever statements we can make. Plus, when they inject a dog, they may not see that dog for a year -- or six months to a year for the next checkup before they realize how well the dog is doing. So it's a much longer time adoption for small animals, but the market is significantly larger. So there's about 10 million horses in the United States, 83 million dogs in the United States, and about 60 million cats in the United States.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Awesome. Thank you.\nJohn Lai: Okay.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. I have a raised hand from a phone number ending in 4735. Please go ahead.\nJohn Lai: Hello.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hello, can you hear me okay?\nJohn Lai: Yup.\nUnidentified Analyst : Oh, hi, John. This is .\nJohn Lai: Hi.\nUnidentified Analyst : I've got a question. You had referred to something that I'm not familiar with because I'm relatively new to this field. It was called NSAIDs or NSAIDs. What was --\nJohn Lai: NSAIDs, yeah. So that's the standard treatment that veterinary doctor gives. It's a basically an anti-inflammatory.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay.\nJohn Lai: So with humans, it's like --\nBob Folkes: Advil.\nJohn Lai: Naproxen or something.\nBob Folkes: Advil.\nJohn Lai: Advil, yeah. Thank you. Yeah.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay, got it. How do you spell that?\nJohn Lai: The NSAIDs?\nUnidentified Analyst : Yes. How do you spell it?\nJohn Lai: Oh, N-S-A-I-D.\nUnidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. Yeah, thanks. I appreciate that. You referred to it more than once, so I thought, what is that?\nJohn Lai: Okay, no problem.\nUnidentified Analyst : And do you have an update on human trials?\nJohn Lai: No. We stated that on the human side, we'd done the necessary reviews of what the outside experts are telling us from a timetable. And then we would eventually, hopefully soon, announce our advisory team that's experts in this area, to give recommendations the path to go. Because the human trials -- so if you look at the OA market for humans on a global basis, about 240 billion a year as an addressable market. So to go through the human side, it's significantly more expensive, obviously. But we would not raise money within PetVivo Holdings. We would always raise it within the subsidiary, so it won't impact PetVivo's share structure or expenses. And actually, when we do raise money on that side, the overall operating expenses from PetVivo Holdings, the parent itself, would actually reduce a little.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. That sounds great. Thank you.\nJohn Lai: Yup.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. All right. No further questions. Thank you. This concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and you can find any information on the company site."
