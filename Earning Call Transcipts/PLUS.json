        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the ePlus Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would like to introduce your host for today's conference Ms. Erica Stoecker, General Counsel. Ma'am, you may begin.\nErica Stoecker: Thank you for joining us today. On the call is Mark Marron, CEO and President; Darren Raiguel, Chief Operating Officer and President of ePlus Technology; and Elaine Marion, Chief Financial Officer. I want to take a moment to remind you that the statements we make this afternoon that are not historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements and are based on management's current plans, estimates and projections. Actual and anticipated future results may vary materially due to certain risks and uncertainties detailed in the earnings release we issued this afternoon and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other documents that we filed with the SEC, including the Form 8-K we filed on October 6, 2023 recasting certain disclosures in our most recent annual report. Any forward-looking statements speaks only as of the date of which the statement is made and the company undertakes no responsibility to update any of these forward-looking statements in light of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, we will be using certain non-GAAP measures during the call. We have included a GAAP financial reconciliation in our earnings release which is posted on the Investor Information section of our website at www.eplus.com. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark Marron. Mark?\nMark Marron: Thank you, Erica and thank you everyone for participating in today's call to discuss our third quarter fiscal 2024 results. Our year-to-date performance has been solid with net sales growth of 6% outpacing the industry and our peers. Customers' adoption of digital transformation technologies, security solutions and IT infrastructure to support AI remain strong. Quarter-to-quarter top-line performance has been more variable than in prior years mostly due to supply chain fluctuations, which affected both customer behavior as well as our ability to ship equipment. Over the past few years large enterprise customers ordered equipment well in advance of expected need in order to safeguard their mission-critical projects. As a result we built a backlog of booked orders and as the supply chain eased we were able to ship this backlog equipment helping to drive strong 22% sales growth in the first half of the fiscal year. Following that wave of shipments, we saw some customers pause new orders in Q3 as they deploy these delivered products. As a result in our third quarter net sales were down 18%, but it's important to note that our gross profit held more stable and was down only 3.3%. A contributing factor to the gross profit was our service revenues, which were up 10.7% as we deployed projects for our customers. And our services gross profit increased 21% year-over-year driven by double-digit gross profit gains in both professional and managed services. Overall, our services gross margin was up 340 basis points and we had another strong quarter with our managed services revenue up 22%. Given the mission-critical nature of managed services we provide this business is characterized by recurring and predictable revenue streams. This revenue not only enhances our financial visibility, but also offers new opportunities for growth as we provide existing customers with additional managed service offerings that address their evolving IT needs. The services growth noted above along with solid product margins and strong contribution from our financing segment helped our consolidated gross margin increased by 410 basis points. It's also important to note that our year-to-date consolidated gross profit increased 9% on an increase of 6% in net sales. Net income declined 23.6% for the quarter and increased 8.4% year to-date. Net earnings were affected by lower product sales, higher acquisition related amortization expenses and higher personnel costs. We continue to invest strategically in building out our AI sales and consultative resources, AI optimized solutions and lab capabilities which underscores our confidence in our growth prospects. While sales cycles have lengthened somewhat we do not view this quarter's sales decline as a trend and our annual guidance remains unchanged. It is worth noting again that we faced a tough compare with gross billings up almost 30% last year in this quarter. We believe fundamental demand parameters remain intact and consider the variability in our quarterly sales this year, as primarily a timing issue on when and how deals fell between quarters. We expect sales growth in our fourth quarter enabling us to achieve the lower end of our guidance range. While still early in its evolution, generative AI represents a promising long-term growth opportunity for both our product and services business. We have deep credentials in the AI world and AI is in a new solution set for ePlus. We have been strategizing, building engineering expertise and aligning with top vendors for years. In March of 2018, we were named Elite Level as a deep learning partner for NVIDIA, we were also an early distribution partner for AIRI, the AI-ready infrastructure, architected by Pure Storage and NVIDIA, which recognized our vision and integration capabilities. We are excited about the possibilities for AI. And we recently announced our AI Ignite program that will help customers explore, adopt and optimize AI. It will help show what is possible with their data and applications, ensure their business and strategy is aligned and help drive scale, efficiencies and cost savings. Our AI capabilities including consulting, managed services and training enable our customers to implement complex AI architectures that are cost effective, scalable and secure. We continue to work closely with our AI partners to develop innovative AI optimized infrastructure for our customers, that can include working on voice recognition projects or autonomous driving initiatives, scanning physical images to provide a better patient experience or just help customers embark on their artificial intelligence and machine learning plans. Our financing segment reported solid third quarter results, fueled primarily by high transactional gains and portfolio earnings. During the quarter, we executed on several large contracts resulting in strong year-on-year volume growth, accompanied by even higher growth in the third quarter segment adjusted EBITDA. Financing remains an important competitive differentiator for ePlus, offering flexibility for our customers, particularly in more challenging economic periods. Acquisitions remain a key element of our growth strategy and we continuously evaluate potential opportunities that would enhance our offerings, strengthen our capabilities and expand our geographical presence. We were also pleased to complete the acquisition of PEAK Resources on January 26th. PEAK is a solution provider in Denver and the Mountain West, with enterprise customers and a corporate culture that parallels our own. This is another example of a geographic strategic acquisition that provides a platform for us to build out the Mountain West region. We believe we can deploy our broader solutions portfolio to their customer base, which should help drive incremental growth in the future. Our strong balance sheet including third quarter ending cash of $142 million, the highest level in the past seven quarters provides us with the flexibility to opportunistically pursue acquisitions that both align with our strategic objectives and are financially accretive. I'd like to thank the ePlus team for their continued dedication in a challenging operating environment. I will now turn the call over to Wayne to discuss our financial results in more detail. After Wayne’s remarks, I will provide our financial outlook for fiscal 2024.\nElaine Marion: Thank you, Mark and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide additional details about our financial performance in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Consolidated net sales amounted to $509.1 million compared to $623.5 million in the prior year quarter. Technology business net sales were $494.2 million, down from $611.8 million reported in last year's third quarter. The decline was due to lower product sales, as improved product availability in the first half of the fiscal year enabled clients to complete previously delayed projects. Service revenue grew 10.7% to $74.7 million, led by double-digit growth in managed services. Within our technology business, sales were broad-based across customer verticals. On a trailing 12 month basis, our two largest verticals continue to be telecom media and entertainment and technology representing 24% and 17% of our technology business net sales respectively. SLED, healthcare and financial services accounted for 16%, 13% and 10% of our technology business net sales, respectively, with the remaining 20% divided among other end markets. Net sales in our financing segment were $14.9 million, up from $11.7 million in the prior year due to higher transactional gains and portfolio earnings. Although consolidated gross profit decreased 3.3% year-to-year to $133.8 million, consolidated gross margin expanded by 410 basis points to 26.3%. All three of our technology segments contributed to the improvement in gross margin with product gross margin gaining 270 basis points to 21.9%, mainly due to a larger proportion of third party maintenance and services sold in the current quarter, which are recorded on a net basis. Managed services gross margin showed a 330 basis point improvement to 31.8%, due to scaled growth in these services. While professional services gross margin grew by 420 basis points to 43.3%, benefiting from a shift in mix to higher margin services. Consolidated operating expenses of $95.8 million, increased 4.2% year-over-year, reflecting the increases in salary and benefits from additional headcount as well as increases and acquisition related depreciation and amortization expenses. Our total headcount at the end of December 2023 was 1,897, up 152 from a year ago, partially due to the acquisition of Network Solutions Group completed in April 2023, which added 83 employees. Of the 152 additional employees, 133 were in customer-facing roles. On a consolidated basis operating income declined from $46.5 million to $38 million. Earnings before taxes were $38.4 million, down from $49.4 million reported in last year's third quarter. The decrease was due to lower sales as well as the benefit in last year's third quarter from foreign currency gains and a class action payment, which together totaled $2.8 million. The effective tax rate was 29% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 27.7% in the year ago quarter. Consolidated net earnings were $27.3 million or $1.2 per diluted share compared to net earnings of 35.7 million or $1.34 per diluted share last year respectively. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.18 compared to $1.38 in the year ago period. Our diluted share count at the end of the quarter was $26.7 million, unchanged from the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA decreased to $46.2 million versus $53.3 million in the prior year due primarily to a 23.3% adjusted EBITDA decline in the technology business. Moving to our consolidated results. For the nine months ended December 31st 2023, net sales grew 6% to $1.67 billion led by 6.5% net sales growth in the technology business. Gross billings in the technology business were $2.5 billion, an improvement of 3.4% versus the prior year period. Consolidated gross profit rose 9.2% to $420.4 million and consolidated gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 25.2%, due to improved margins for both product and services. Consolidated net earnings were $93.8 million or $3.52 per diluted share, representing increases of 8.4% and 8.6% respectively. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.2% to $153.6 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expanded by 9% to $3.99. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $142.2 million, the highest in two years as compared to $103.1 million at the end of fiscal 2023. Conversely, inventories declined to $218 million from $243.3 million at the end of March 2023, representing the lowest level in nearly two years. We've seen supply chain pressures continue to ease enabling us to fulfill prior customer orders and complete related services, which should support further inventory reduction over time. Further inventory turns continue to improve to 27 days compared to 29 days in the preceding quarter and 38 days at the end of fiscal 2023. Stockholders' equity increased 12.2% to $877.8 million from the end of fiscal 2023. Our cash conversion cycle was 54 days, compared to 51 days in the year ago quarter and 59 days at the end of fiscal 2023. Given this improvement, year-to-date operating cash flows were $143.5 million, compared to $147 million of cash used in the same period last year. While we expect our customers to be more conservative with their IT spending in the remainder of fiscal 2024, as Mark mentioned, ePlus remains well positioned in the market, given our strategic focus on higher growth end markets, and we remain confident in achieving the low end of our guidance range. I want to thank our talented ePlus employees for continuing to drive our solid financial performance for the first nine months of fiscal 2024. With that, I will turn the call back to Mark. Mark?\nMark Marron: Thank you, Elaine. Driven by our strategy targeting higher-growth market segments like cloud, networking, collaboration and security, ePlus has generated strong financial performance through the first nine months of our fiscal year. Specifically, fiscal year-to-date consolidated net sales are up 6%. Adjusted EBITDA is up 8% and diluted earnings per share has increased 9%, despite ongoing economic uncertainty and the associated impact on IT spending. Looking forward, we expect our fourth quarter results will improve sequentially from the third quarter, as customer sentiment is positive. As a result, we maintain our 2024 financial guidance with an expectation that we will achieve the lower end of the range driven by a re-acceleration of growth in our Technology business and continued positive momentum in Services. Even as the overall IT spending environment remains challenging, we remain confident in the strength of our marketing position and in our growth strategy. With our many industry partners, ePlus offers innovative, scalable solutions that cost effectively address our customers needs today and for the future. We remain committed to driving profitable growth and building long-term value for our shareholders. Operator, let's now open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMaggie Nolan: Hi. Thank you. Mark, you mentioned part of this quarter performance was influenced by timing of deals. Have you seen some of those deals closed so far in January, or how are you feeling about the ability to close those in the coming months?\nMark Marron: Yeah. Hey, Maggie, how are you? So, yes, we've seen activity pick up in Q4. We've already seen some of those deals close. And just to give you a quick recap on the quarter, Maggie. So first off, it was a volume issue. Our net sales was down 18.4%, but our gross profit was only down 3.3%. And a lot of that had to do with our strong margins, our Services uptick. We had a pause with our Enterprise customers, but we also saw an uptick in our Project Services. So there was kind of the offset there and then we had a nice Finance quarter as well. But really, what we're seeing, Maggie is what it came down to is timing issues between the quarters. So, if you think about it with the supply chain easing, we were up 22% in the first half. What we saw was the pause with some of our bigger enterprise customers, plus, if you remember, we kind of pointed out we had a tough compare this quarter, where adjusted gross billing -- sorry, our gross billings were up almost 30%, last year and this quarter. But with all of that, we expect growth to be back to a little bit normal ranges in Q4 and deliver a solid fiscal year and hit the low end of our guidance range.\nMaggie Nolan: That's really helpful, Mark. And then so one other piece of value that was you had talked about maybe there was some lengthening sales cycles and maybe that's some of the Enterprise commentary that you were giving, but you felt like that wasn't necessarily indicative of a trend yet. Can you elaborate on why that may not be a trend and what you're seeing out there in the market?\nMark Marron: Yeah, Maggie, you know, it's funny. What we saw in the calendar year-end, the end of our Q3 was not the normal year-end budget flush that we see. But since the fourth quarter, beginning in January has picked up. We've seen orders, pipeline, all pick up nicely. So some of the Enterprise deals have actually, some of the deals that moved push from Q3 into Q4 have closed and some of the time lines people seem to whether it's a budgeting issue or not have started to move forward a little bit quicker in terms of their sales cycle. Still not back to I'll call it pre-COVID levels if you will, as it relates to the sales cycle but definitely improved from Q3.\nMaggie Nolan: Thank you.\nMark Marron: Hey, Maggie. One other thing to just to point out, you note, it's an interesting time with the supply chain. So what we believe happened at least with us is we had a lot of customers that were deploying technology that we delivered in the first half, especially in this Q three. So it's a -- it really is a timing issue between the quarters with the supply chain deploying that technology and then customers starting to invest whether it's in security or AI or things along those lines.\nMaggie Nolan: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nMark Marron: Thanks, Maggie.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matt, your line is open.\nMatt Sheerin: Yes, thank you. Mark, I just wanted to follow up on Maggie's question regarding your outlook. I'm looking at my model here in going back seven years. You've been down sequentially every March quarter and it does sound like you didn't see the seasonal trends that you typically expect. So I guess a question other than that you've seen some pickup here in January. Is your backlog or any other sort of tangible evidence that you can point to this rebound here?\nMark Marron: Yeah. Hey, Matt, good question. So what we've seen is some of the deals that we -- I just discussed with Maggie that pushed from Q3 into Q4, the demand parameters have really not changed that as it relates, and I got to admit Matt, this is a little bit different than our normal seasonal Q3 to Q4 and a lot of this is timing. The other thing I'd ask you to kind of keep in mind as you go through your models, if you look at the first half, our net sales were up 22%. I think it was in the first half and our net sales year-to-date are up 6%. And our gross profits up 9%. So it's in line with what we were thinking for the quarter. A lot of it just came down to timing issues and a lot of it's supply chain related and customers pushing deals out from Q3 to Q4 for whatever reasons.\nMatt Sheerin: Got it. But it wouldn't seem that supply chain would be an issue, right? Because everyone saying that products are readily available. Cisco's talked about that, your networking sales were down 24% year-over-year. So I'm trying to figure out is it supply chain or just customers being more cautious?\nMark Marron: Yeah. Hey, Matt. Two things. If you think about it, what I'm saying on the supply chain is that a lot of customers in our first half we were up 22%. And some of our bigger customers were actually installing implementing deploying that technology as compared to buying new technology. So some of those bigger customers as you know had the wherewithal and the capabilities to order in advance. So that's what we're seeing in the quarter. And then if you look at it for the year, we're still up 6% on the net sales and 9% on our gross profit. So the other factor that comes into play is, if you look at our services, they were up 10.7% and our project services were up nicely both from a revenue and from a gross margin standpoint. So some of that ties to what I'm talking about with the projects being deployed as compared to buying new technology. The second part of that is what I had said to Maggie a little bit earlier is that some of these deals, some of these enterprise deals or customers pushed into Q4 and we've seen an early pickup, and we don't think the demand parameters are changing both in terms of our pipeline our backlog and what we're hearing from our sales teams related to their forecast for Q4.\nMatt Sheerin: I got it. Okay. And could you remind me on the revenue contribution from the in this quarter from the acquisition that you just completed does that have much of an impact?\nMark Marron: It was a Matt. It was immaterial to net sales, maybe 3% to 4% of net sales. So it was immaterial for the quarter.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. I mean but for the March quarter? I could you just you just you just closed the acquisition, right? So you have a quarter where revenues also?\nMark Marron: Yes, sorry that's immaterial to Matt. That's a small acquisition roughly 35, 36 employees. What it does for us it gives us a platform for the Mountain West. And they've got skill sets in the kind of data center cloud security space that we can we can build upon and then bring all the other things that ePlus brings to the table. So we think it's a nice platform to build on but it's immaterial for Q4. Okay.\nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Fair enough. And just relative to your EBITDA guidance for the year at the low end that would imply that your EBITDA or operating margin for the March quarter would be or an operating profit would be down year-over-year despite a good revenue growth because your revenue growth is going to be up double-digits year-over-year. So what's beneath -- what's happening there and why is that down?\nMark Marron: Well, I think, if you look at it Matt is probably some of the things that we talk about. We're investing for the future. So we believe we're a growth company. So we didn't touch on AI yet, but we've made some big investments as it relates to resources AI optimized solutions. We built out a lab a customer innovation center. So Elaine touched on our head count was up. I think it was 152 employees, I'd say about 130 to 135 were customer facing. So you'll see our salaries and benefits still up based on the investments we're making there. And then over time, I think you'll start to see operating leverage, but we still believe we'll be in the range on the adjusted EBITDA and the net sales on the low end that we talked about. \nMatt Sheerin: Okay. Very good. Thank you very much.\nMark Marron: All right. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: And your final question comes from the line of Greg Burns with Sidoti. Greg, your line is now open.\nGreg Burns: Yes. Just -- sort of a kind of follow-up on the on the product sales. Is just a little bit of a bottleneck, you saw this quarter. Cisco imply that maybe there was a couple of quarters like it was going to be longer duration here to work through some of this bottleneck of product that's been shipped but it seems like you feel that you're going to rebound pretty quickly in the next quarter. Can you just help us understand what gives you confidence there? I know you touched on a little bit, but Cisco in particular seem to think that it was going to be a little bit of a longer term headwind for them to work through this product -- product that's out in the market?\nMark Marron: Yes, hey, Greg how are you? So a couple of different things. So I don't I don't think we have the I'll say supply chain issues that Cisco has. Now, obviously it's a portion of what we do, but we've seen our open orders continue to go down on a regular basis overall. So I think some of it is open. Orders are getting closer. I won't say they're at pre-COVID levels, but they're a little more. I don't know if normalized, but at more natural levels that we think. So we've got a good handle on our open orders slash backlog. You know the supply chain easing really eased up a lot for us. I can't speak to Cisco, but for us in the first half if you think about it being up 22%, I don't think there were too many companies out there up 22% in the first half on net sales. So you had that supply chain easing. And then the other thing for the quarter is, we've seen the activity pickup. We've got the forecast from our sales team and the demand parameters really haven't changed for us. We feel we're in the right value added areas, with cloud security, network modernization, AI and all those services we're predicting. So that would be the reason behind it.\nQ – Greg Burns: Okay. And then with some your AI practice, AI Ignite is that mainly a services opportunity like a professional service opportunity. Is there hardware associated with that? And do you feel like you have the capabilities in-house to grow that business, or is that something that you need to maybe add inorganic expertise to grow that part of your business?\nMark Marron: Yes. So, Hey, Greg, a couple of different things there. One is in the early innings, if you think about it, but I think it's going to change how companies operate as they go forward in the future. The other thing and it kind of fits right in our wheelhouse. So if you think about converged infrastructure hyper-converged AI optimized infrastructure is the same thing, in terms of compute networking storage, and all the things that kind of plays to our strengths. So, a lot of that we have resources, but we have invested in additional resources. And I had mentioned the lab and the customer innovation center, but it's not just a services play. So, it's actually the services is the first part of it where we help them kind of explore, adopt and optimize AI. And that means, you know, are they ready for AI, envisioning workshops, really it's about the data. It's kind of a data strategy. First is, you've got all this data that's expanding exponentially, if you will. So then you've got to think through governance and risk. Once you've decided on your AI strategy, then it gets into what I call the IT optimized infrastructure, which is the hardware play and to be honest Greg, the -- it's a big play where it's a big opportunity in the market. So I think I'm saying what anybody else would say related to AI, it's early innings but it's both the services and a product play for us. And the product play kind of fits with our heritage and our history. And what we're good at\nQ – Greg Burns: Perfect. Thank you.\nMark Marron: Okay. All right, Greg, thank you. And everybody, thank you for joining us today for our quarterly earnings report. We appreciate that you took the time and have a good night. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the ePlus Earnings Results Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Kley Parkhurst, SVP. You may begin.\nKley Parkhurst: Thank you for joining us today. On the call is Mark Marron, CEO and President; Darren Raiguel, COO and President of ePlus Technology; Elaine Marion, CFO; and Erica Stoecker, General Counsel. I want to take a moment to remind you that the statements we make this afternoon that are not historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements and are based on management's current plans, estimates and projections. Actual and anticipated future results may vary materially due to certain risks and uncertainties detailed in the earnings release we issued this afternoon and our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other documents that we file with the SEC, including the Form 8-K we filed on October 6, 2023, recasting certain disclosures in our most recent annual report. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of which the statement is made, and the company undertakes no responsibility to update any of these forward-looking statements in light of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, we will be using certain non-GAAP measures during the call. We have included the GAAP financial reconciliation in our earnings release, which is posted on the Investor Information section of our website at www.eplus.com. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark Marron. Mark?\nMark Marron: Thank you, Kley, and thank you, everyone for participating in today's call to discuss our second quarter fiscal 2024 results. I will start with some key takeaways. ePlus generated solid results in our second quarter with consolidated net sales up 19%. This was driven by strong sales growth of 21% in our Technology business, which included 9% revenue growth in our services businesses. Diluted earnings per share advanced 14%, slightly lower than sales growth due to a shift in product mix, a decline in finance segment earnings given uneven deal flow and a tough compare year-over-year, as well as increased operating expenses which included investments in our key growth initiatives. Our second quarter performance benefited from continued market share gains and improved product availability that enabled us to deliver on orders from prior periods. Gross billings improved for the third consecutive quarter, totaling approximately $856 million, representing a 7.4% gain over the same period last year as we continued to drive organic and acquisition growth to capture market share. Our demonstrated ability to drive sales and earnings growth even in an uncertain economic environment underscores the strength of our strategic plan, our expertise across the broad technology stack and diversification across customer types and end markets. Through our comprehensive portfolio of innovative solutions and service offerings, ePlus enables successful and cost-effective outcomes that align with our customers' IT objectives. I was particularly pleased with our sales growth as we experienced increases across nearly all market verticals and customer sizes in the second quarter, led by the strength of our networking, collaboration and managed services solutions. Networking represented our best performing category as net sales grew approximately 62% year-over-year. This strong growth reflected three main factors: one, a contribution from our recently acquired Network Solutions Group; two, a continued improvement in product availability that enabled us to deliver on prior customer orders; and three, organic customer demand. The prevalence of hybrid work, distributed computing and the emergence of AI are driving growth for advanced networking architectures, and we are capturing share in this space through our innovative solutions and partnerships with leading OEMs. Continued customer investment in network monetization solutions is also contributing to our growth in this space. This includes building out AI-enabled infrastructure solutions and supporting AI implementation with advisory services around data modeling and governance and risk best practices. Our workspace transformation or collaboration net sales grew 41% year-over-year and has created market-wide recognition of our technology leadership in this space. For example, we were recently recognized as Reimagine Work Partner of the Year for the Americas from Cisco. This award recognizes partners who are excelling at hybrid work, customer experience, leading innovation and empowering collaboration with WebEx. We were also recognized for the release of our proprietary ePlus collaboration solution called Automated Virtual Assistant, or AVA. ePlus AVA is an in-house developed managed service that leverages automation and artificial intelligence to provide automated testing and reporting on the health of Cisco video devices, conference rooms and workspaces to ensure effective operations. Security was 18.5% of our technology gross billings in the trailing 12 months. Security net sales increased 7% in the quarter. Customers look to ePlus to better mitigate the risk, sophistication of cyber threats and want us to provide comprehensive risk management solutions. In October, we announced our holistic program called Compromise Nothing. This comprehensive program includes strategic assessment and advisory services and our managed service offerings. Our extensive capabilities distinguish ePlus in the security solutions market and provide attractive opportunities for us to build and expand relationships with both existing and new customers. Our services segments performed well with net revenue increasing 9% year-over-year primarily due to strong growth in our managed services, which grew 21%. Over the past year, we have focused on expanding our solutions and capabilities in managed services, which offer the advantage of recurring and predictable monthly revenue streams. We continue to see our customers shift their IT spend towards SaaS-based solutions given upfront cost advantages, ease of scalability and simplified maintenance requirements. The continued growth of our SaaS offerings such as Storage-as-a-Service and AVA remains a key growth driver for ePlus within our Managed Services business, along with our other annuity services and helps with visibility and predictability of future revenue streams and profitability. Strong double-digit growth in managed service revenue coupled with greater operating efficiency drove a significant improvement in the profitability of this business with gross margins increasing 460 basis points. Professional services revenue edged higher as growth in Project Services revenue was largely offset by a decrease in staff augmentation. This performance is consistent with customer IT spending trends, which currently tend to favor shorter-term projects that generate relatively fast return on investments. Additionally, we believe the growing adoption of automation and AI will drive more demand for cloud storage and analytics. To meet these needs, we are leveraging our capabilities in cloud and consulting, along with our partnership with AI leaders such as NVIDIA, Lenovo and Pure to help our customers design and deploy AI infrastructure solutions that deliver significant value over time. Our financing segment delivered a solid quarter, consistent with our expectation even as results declined on a year-over-year basis. As I noted in last quarter's call because this business benefited last year from specific financing deals, we anticipated that quarterly comparisons this year would prove challenging and create a tough compare. While quarterly or even yearly results in this segment can be variable, our financing business provides flexibility for our customers while delivering strong profitability. We remain committed to investing in our team and in our capabilities to capture future growth opportunities. We added a significant number of customer-facing employees year-over-year, with a particular emphasis on sales, professional services and technical support personnel. We have continued to build out our solution and service offerings around managed services such as Storage as-a-Service and AVA. Additionally, we've invested in the construction of our new state-of-the-art customer innovation center, which will enable us to showcase our breadth of innovative offerings and expand our warehouse and logistics capabilities. These investments, higher acquisition-related depreciation and amortization expense and lower financing segment operating income moderated second quarter growth and consolidated operating income. Despite a tough economic environment, we are pleased that consolidated quarterly net earnings increased 14.7% to $32.7 million. And in our Technology Business segment, operating income increased 12.5% to $35.9 million and adjusted EBITDA increased 17.1% to $45.5 million. I'd like to express my thanks to the entire ePlus team for delivering another quarter of solid financial performance. I will now turn the call over to Elaine to discuss our financial results in more detail. After Elaine's remarks, I will provide our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Elaine?\nElaine Marion: Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. I will provide additional details about our financial performance in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Consolidated net sales increased 19% to $587.6 million. Technology business net sales grew 21.3% to $571.9 million, aided by the fulfillment of open orders and the NSG acquisition. Service revenue increased 9%, reflecting continued strong growth in managed services, partially offset by modest growth in professional services. Sales remained broad-based across our customer verticals. On the trailing 12-months basis, our two largest verticals were telecom, media and entertainment and technology, representing 25% and 18% of our technology business net sales, respectively. SLED, health care and financial services accounted for 16%, 13% and 10% of our technology business net sales, respectively, with the remaining 18% divided among other end markets. Our financing business segment faced a particularly challenging comparison this quarter, and as such, revenue declined to $15.7 million from the prior year period primarily due to lower proceeds from sales of equipment, lower transactional gains and lower month-to-month rents. Consolidated gross profit increased 8.3% to $144.4 million, representing a consolidated gross margin of 24.6% compared with gross margin in the same quarter last year of 27%. The decrease in gross margin from the same period last year primarily was the result of product mix and lower financing business segment earnings. Within our Technology business, gross profit increased 12.4% to $130.7 million. Technology business gross margin was 22.9% compared to 24.7% in the year ago quarter. This decrease was mainly due to a lower proportion of third-party maintenance and services sales, which are recorded on a net basis. Services gross margin increased significantly with managed services gross margin improving 460 basis points to 31.1% and professional services gross margin expanding 270 basis points to 41.3%. The improvement in services profitability primarily reflected enhanced operating efficiency, driven in part by increased scale of our Managed Services segment. Operating expenses increased 11.6% year-over-year to $99.5 million, reflecting higher salaries and benefits due to additional headcount, depreciation and amortization expense from the NSG acquisition and increased spend on travel and entertainment and marketing. We ended the September quarter with headcount of 1,877, an increase of 148 employees, of which 118 were customer-facing. It should be noted that we onboarded 83 employees with the acquisition of NSG. Technology business operating income rose 12.5% to $35.9 million, while financing business segment operating income declined 26.4% to $9 million. On a consolidated basis, operating income grew 1.7% to $44.9 million. Earnings before tax increased 11.8% to $45 million as the foreign currency losses from last year did not replicate in the current quarter. The effective tax rate was 27.4% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 29.3% in the year ago quarter. Consolidated net earnings was $32.7 million or $1.22 per diluted share, reflecting increases of 14.7% and 14% respectively from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.40, up 8.5% year-over-year. Our diluted share count at the end of the quarter was 26.7 million, unchanged from the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted EBITDA in the technology business rose 17.1% but declined 26.2% in the financing business segment. As a result, consolidated adjusted EBITDA improved 6.5% to $53.6 million. That brings me to our year-to-date review. Consolidated net sales grew 22% to $1.16 billion for the first six months of fiscal 2024, primarily driven by 23.6% net sales growth in the technology business. Technology business gross billings increased 12.2% to $1.7 billion. Consolidated gross profit increased 16.1% to $286.6 million. Consolidated gross margin was 24.7% compared to 25.9% a year ago, primarily due to the mix in the product segment. Consolidated net earnings were $66.5 million or $2.49 per diluted share compared to $50.8 million or $1.91 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA rose 21.3% to $107.4 million and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share expanded by 23.2% to $2.81. Shifting to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents were $82.5 million at the end of the second quarter compared to $103.1 million at the end of fiscal 2023. As supply chain pressures continue to ease and product availability improved, we were able to deliver on prior customer orders and related services. As a result, inventories declined to $222.1 million from $243.3 million at the end of March 2023. Inventory turns continued to improve to 29 days compared to 32 days in the preceding quarter and 38 days at the end of fiscal 2023. Our cash conversion cycle was 51 days compared to 52 days in the year ago quarter and 59 days at the end of fiscal 2023. Given this improvement, year-to-date operating cash flows were $10.3 million compared to $119.7 million of cash used in the same period last year. While we expect our customers to be more conservative with their IT spending in the second half of fiscal 2024, as Mark mentioned, ePlus remains well positioned given our strategic focus on higher growth end markets. As always, I want to thank our talented ePlus employees for continuing to drive our solid financial performance. With that, I will turn the call back over to Mark. Mark?\nMark Marron: Thank you, Elaine. Through the first half of our fiscal year, ePlus has delivered strong financial performance. Our results highlight the continued success of our growth strategy and the advantages of our diversification and comprehensive capabilities. As we enter the second half of our fiscal year, we are beginning to see sales cycle timelines extend as customers prioritize cost optimization initiatives and reallocate spending accordingly. In this environment, we anticipate customers will focus on projects that deliver relatively fast return on investments while continuing to deploy solutions that enhance cybersecurity. ePlus has successfully navigated through a similar period of economic uncertainty in the past, and we remain confident in our outlook given our market positioning and focus on key growth verticals. As a result, we reaffirm our previously issued financial guidance for the current fiscal year. We continue to expect fiscal year 2024 net sales of approximately $2.23 billion to $2.33 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $200 million to $215 million, representing a margin of 9% to 9.2%. Our guidance assumes in part a continued easing and supply chain constraints that enable us to complete previously delayed customer projects. In closing, ePlus remains focused on building long-term shareholder value through the execution of our growth strategy and the efficient allocation of capital. Operator, please open the call for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Maggie Nolan with William Blair. Please go ahead.\nMaggie Nolan: Hi, thank you. I was hoping you could give us a little color on the mix within revenue of SMBs versus large enterprises and any different spending trends or expectations that you have across the different client types?\nMark Marron: Sure, hey Maggie. How are you? So as I think you know, we really don't focus on the S in SMB. So we're mainly a mid-market to enterprise play. Many of the solutions that we're rolling out across cloud, security, networking collaboration and now AI kind of fit in that mid-market, which is our sweet spot. With that said, from 500 employees and above, we were actually up, and our enterprise sales were up. I want to say for the quarter, net sales were up like 7% or 8%. So we actually had a really nice quarter related to our customer size segments. Our Top 5 verticals were also up both in net sales and gross billings. So nice execution by the sales team across the different customer size segments and verticals. Did that get what you needed, Maggie?\nMaggie Nolan: Yes, it did. And then when we think about the full-year guidance, what is your visibility into the guidance look like right now when you initially built the guidance, did you expect such a strong first half of the year as well as some of the commentary that you gave on kind of weaker IT budgets in the back half of the year, or has that changed over the course of the year since you set guidance?\nMark Marron: Yes, there's a couple of things, Maggie. So we're still very comfortable with our guidance. And if you think about it, our guidance as it relates to a compare to last year on net sales is actually up 8% to 13% depending on where we fall within that range. So that's a very strong uptick as compared to the market overall and as compared to our peers. A couple of things went into it. Yes, we did expect a stronger first half. A couple of things to kind of call out at a very high level. One is Q3 this year -- sorry, last year for tech is going to be a really tough compare for us. So we were -- our net sales were up over 28% last year in our Q3. So it's kind of a tough compare, if you will. And we were starting to see some sales cycles extend and customers watching spend from a cost optimization. So there's a few things there that kind of factor in to our thought process, but still feel good with the guidance that were given and did expect the first half to be a little bit higher.\nMaggie Nolan: Got it, thank you for the update and nice quarter.\nMark Marron: All right. Thanks, Maggie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Greg Burns with Sidoti & Company. Please go ahead.\nGregory Burns: Yes, when we look at the Technology segment sales, how much of that was organic versus inorganic?\nMark Marron: Yes, approximately 25%, a little over that was acquisition related. The other 74%, Greg, or so was organic. What you saw there, Greg, in our numbers, just high level. You saw some supply chain easing specifically in the networking space. Networking was up big. I think it was up 62%, if I remember correctly. Collaboration was up nicely as well. So some of our workspace transformation, some of the things going on in networking are starting to roll out nicely, and the team did a nice job of executing there. But it was roughly three quarters, organic, a quarter acquisition related.\nGregory Burns: Okay. To that idea of the supply chain easing, how much of the networking or product revenue as a whole was from you drawing down your backlog versus net new business?\nMark Marron: Yes. Hey Greg, that's hard. The only thing that I can tie it to, our inventory levels were down about $22 million, but there was an awful lot of new deals, both booked and invoiced in the quarter, and it's a really tough one to figure out what was backlog -- what was open orders versus net new effectively.\nGregory Burns: Okay. Thanks. And then I guess just lastly, can you -- I know you drew down the inventory and were able to deliver on some of that backlog. But how does that backlog look, I guess, relative to maybe historic levels, is it still elevated, and maybe can you give us a sense of your pipeline?\nMark Marron: Pipeline is within where we would think it would be for this quarter. The one thing I would tell you, Greg, that I got to highlight again. Last year, in Q3, we had a really strong tech quarter. Our net sales were up over 28%. The adjusted gross billings were up almost 30% in that quarter. So it's kind of a tough compare there. But with that said, as compared to traditional Q3 quarters pipeline, backlog, all the things that we're tracking is in play. The only caveat I'd put on that is we are seeing some deals that are taking a little bit longer as customers try to figure out what they want to spend from a priority standpoint. And they're trying to do some cost optimization across some of their cloud and security plays. And the other thing, too, some of it's ratable, too, Greg, which affects that.\nGregory Burns: Okay. And the sales cycles, is that getting longer across customer segments, or is it mainly in the large enterprise like...\nMark Marron: Mainly enterprise but higher mid-market, but it varies by customer, Greg. You'd be surprised with customers in terms of sometimes how long it takes to turn things around through their legal, through their procurement team. So it varies by customers. But normally, the enterprise, the bigger deals are normally the ones that take a little bit longer.\nGregory Burns: Okay, thank you.\nMark Marron: No problem.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes, thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on Greg's question regarding backlog. Could you tell us what the backlog levels look like now versus 60 days or a quarter ago, and versus traditional or historic levels?\nMark Marron: So sorry, Matt, I missed that. What was the question regarding backlog?\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes, I was just looking for the back -- what is the backlog? Greg had asked that question, but I'm not sure we got an answer because you've been talking for a few quarters about very elevated backlog because of the component shortage. It looks like the supply is coming nicely and you're shipping to backlog. So a potential concern would be that backlog gets worked off and what happens to growth after that. So I'm just hoping to get some color on that.\nMark Marron: Yes, I got you. Yes, open orders are down but they're still higher than traditional levels, if you will. So they did trend down. Backlog is actually up. Pipeline is actually in line with what we're expecting for the quarter. So besides the tough compare, we wouldn't see anything that would dramatically affect the numbers, if you will, whether it's related to open orders, backlog and/or pipeline just yet. With that said, the caveat is, Matt, as we mentioned previously, is the timelines are extending with some of the customers, so it gets tougher and tougher to kind of forecast.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. Fair enough. And I know you're reiterating your revenue forecast for the year. As we think about the next couple of quarters, it looks like in terms of seasonality, you typically have sequential growth in the December quarter and then down in the March quarter. I'm wondering if that's how we should think about modeling or are things different just because of the backlog and the way things are trending. So is that -- should we think about that seasonality playing out again or no?\nMark Marron: Yes, very much so, Matt. But once again, if I could just highlight, the tech quarter last year was from a compare was extreme where gross billings -- adjusted gross billings were up almost 30%. So that would be the only caveat. But I think what you said is very fair and very realistic.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. All right. Thank you. And then -- and just lastly, you talked about growth from that acquisition. How does the acquisition pipeline look like in terms of your M&A?\nMark Marron: M&A pipeline is really strong. There's a lot of opportunities out there. But like anything, Matt, we've got to continue to vet them out. Some of the pricing multiples are coming down a little bit, which is a positive. But in terms of that, there's still plenty of opportunity, both from a territory services perspective as well as what I'd call product type services, indoor solutions, but still have to work through the process on those. But the pipeline is fairly robust.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay, thank you, Mark.\nMark Marron: No problem. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Seeing no further questions. I will now turn the call back to Mark Marron for any closing remarks.\nMark Marron: Okay, thank you. Everybody, thank you for joining us for our Q2 call. And if I could, I'd like to wish everybody a Happy Thanksgiving and a healthy and happy holiday season, and we'll talk to you in the February timeframe. And have a Happy New Year as well. Take care.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode and later we will take your questions. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Kley Parkhurst. Please go ahead.\nKley Parkhurst: Thank you for joining us today. On the call is Mark Marron, CEO and President; Darren Raiguel, COO and President of ePlus Technology; Elaine Marion, CFO; and Erica Stoecker, General Counsel. I want to take a moment to remind you that the statements we make this afternoon that are not historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements and are based on management's current plans, estimates and projections. Actual and anticipated future results may vary materially due to certain risks and uncertainties detailed in the earnings release we issued this afternoon in our periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and in other documents that we may file with the SEC. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which the statement is made and the Company undertakes no responsibility to update any of these forward-looking statements in light of new information, future events or otherwise. In addition, we will be using certain non-GAAP measures during the call. We have included a GAAP financial reconciliation in our earnings release, which is posted on the Investor Information section of our website at www.eplus.com. I'd like to turn the call over to Mark Marron. Mark?\nMark Marron: Thank you, Kley. And thank you, everyone, for participating in today's call to discuss our first quarter fiscal 2024 results. I will start with some key takeaways. ePlus delivered strong results in the first quarter, marking a great start to our fiscal year. Double-digit sales growth was driven by solid execution, our land and expand strategy, supply chain improvements and contributions from acquisitions, our team performed at a high level, executing consistently across all end markets. Our net sales growth of 25%, along with our scalable operating platform and disciplined cost management drove significant operating leverage. Adjusted EBITDA rose 41% and diluted EPS improved 51% compared to the same period last year. The strength of our performance again highlighted how our strategic positioning and focus on serving faster-growing solution areas enables us to generate growth well in excess of the overall market for IT spending. In today's environment, where enterprises and organizations are prioritizing investments that optimize cost and security, we have continued to meet our customers' needs with the suite of products and services that deliver value rapidly and efficiently. During the first quarter, we continue to see an easing in supply chain constraints. With the improved product availability, we were able to complete a number of previously delayed customer projects benefiting overall sales growth. Based on our conversations with our partners, we anticipate continued improvement in product availability and lead times over the remainder of the year. As you know, acquisitions represent the fundamental component of our growth strategy, and our first quarter results benefited from the contributions of our Network Solutions Group and Future Com, who we acquired in July of 2022. On a combined basis, these acquisitions contributed approximately 1/3 of our net sales growth in the first quarter. Our technology business sales increased 26% with demand improving across all end markets and across most product categories. We continue to get operating leverage in our technology business segment as evidenced by our operating income being up almost 50% versus last year. We experienced a broadening of customer demand trends in the first quarter across all customer size segments, led by strength in the mid-market segment. The mid-market, which we define as organizations with 500 to 10,000 employees is primarily focused on adopting cost-optimized cloud-based architectures as well as enhancing cloud security to accommodate remote and hybrid work. Mid-market customers are particularly well suited to partner with ePlus as their key areas of need align with our strengths in areas such as workplace transformation, cybersecurity and technology modernization. Our customers are continuing to evaluate AI technologies, and we see it as an emerging growth driver. Many of our partners have incorporated AI into their core offerings to simplify and optimize operations as well as provide faster detection, response remediation on the security front. We empower customers with cutting-edge AI optimized infrastructure solutions through strategic partnerships with industry leaders such as NVIDIA. Our AI services are designed to help customers adopt the latest technologies while increasing their speed to market. Our customers utilize our expertise to manage the complexity of designing, deploying, supporting and managing AI. This can include building out an AI strategy plan, identifying priority projects, providing resources to help structure and implement AI projects and then ensure proper governance and policies are applied and monitored. We believe with the expansion of data overall and the benefits of AI being embedded in hardware and networking platforms will continue to provide modernization opportunities for infrastructure related to networking, security, cloud and collaboration. Networking was the standout performer this quarter as gross billings increased 67%. The growth drivers included solid organic growth, reflecting demand for networking solutions that facilitate collaboration and enable workplace transformation as well as improved product availability that allowed us to complete certain customer projects and the contribution from recent acquisitions. Security product gross billings increased 24% year-over-year on a trailing 12-month basis and is approximately 21% of total gross billings. We believe that cybersecurity remains an IT priority for organizations of all sizes, and we remain focused on providing the products and services that enable our customers to mitigate risk. Our services revenues improved by 7% as a slight decline in professional services was more than offset by robust revenue growth in Managed Services. We saw a particularly strong demand for our enhanced maintenance support and SOC services. These and other managed services offer significant value to customers who face complex challenges in terms of managing cybersecurity risk, keeping pace with technological change and recruiting and retaining IT talent. We continue to build out our annuity managed services with proprietary new offerings that expands our capabilities in our focused markets such as ePlus cloud managed services, storage-as-a-service, and ePlus life cycle services support. Several months ago, we introduced ePlus automated virtual assistant for collaboration spaces. This innovative solution utilizes robotic automation processes in conjunction with ePlus managed services to enhance the user experience in video-enabled meeting rooms and workspaces. By building out our portfolio of unique offerings, we are differentiating ePlus against our competition while strengthening our value proposition. Managed Services revenues increased 23.2% over last year and has generated a CAGR of 24.1% over the last five years. To put this in perspective, annuity quality services have almost doubled over the last three years. Moving to our finance segments. Results for the quarter were consistent with our expectation given last year's first quarter produced outsized transactional gains from specific financing deals, creating a tough compare quarter-over-quarter. As a reminder, the financing business provides flexibility for our customers and is a competitive differentiator as compared to our technology market peers. Earlier, I noted the positive contributions from our recent acquisitions. As we look forward, acquisitions will remain an important element in our growth strategy and the strength of our balance sheet affords us the flexibility to pursue additional value-accretive transactions. Our M&A pipeline remains active, and we are currently evaluating a variety of targets that can further extend our capabilities and supplement our organic growth. I'd like to thank all our ePlus teammates for their efforts this quarter to drive our strong financial results, innovation as well as numerous customer success stories. I will now turn the call over to Elaine to discuss our financial results in more detail. After Elaine's remarks, I will provide our financial outlook for fiscal 2024. Elaine?\nElaine Marion: Thank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to report on our strong start to fiscal year 2024, reflecting the success of our growth strategy as well as the contribution from our recent acquisitions. Broad-based strength across key end markets and revenue from acquisitions led to a consolidated net sales increase of 25.3% to $574.2 million -- these factors are also evident in our technology business net sales, which grew 26% to 565.7 million. Beginning with this quarter, we have introduced three operating segments, which comprise our technology business, product, professional services and managed services. Our product segment includes sales of third-party products, including software and services. Our professional service segment contains our project-related services staff augmentation, consulting engagements and project management services. Our Managed Services segment comprises various services offerings, such as our infrastructure and cloud managed services managed security and service desk. Going forward, we will reference these new business segments collectively as our technology business. In our Products segment, revenues increased by 29.2% to $498.2 million, led by sales of networking products in the Managed Services segment, revenue grew 23.2% to $32 million from sustained growth and enhanced maintenance support and security operation center services. In our Professional Services segment, revenue declined 4.3% to $35.6 million year-over-year, primarily due to reduced demand for staff augmentation services. Our strategy of focusing on faster-growing areas boosted by acquisition contribution and easing supply chains led to technology business gross billings growing by 17.6% and to $842 million year-over-year. As a reminder, gross billings denote the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services, including shipping charges during the period, net of customer returns and credit memos and sales and other taxes. Within our technology business, our two largest markets continue to be telecom, media and entertainment, and technology, representing 26% and 19%, respectively, of our technology business net sales on a trailing 12-month basis. SLED, Health care and financial services accounted for 16%, 14% and 9%, respectively, with the remaining 16% from other end markets. In our financing segment, lower post-contract earnings and transactional gains in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 led to financing segment revenue of $8.5 million, a decline from $9.6 million in the last year's first quarter, which resulted in lower gross profit of $6.4 million compared to $7.9 million. As we have mentioned, results in our financing segment can vary widely due to the transactional nature of the business. Our consolidated gross profit increased 25.3% to $142.3 million, with a consolidated gross margin of 24.8%, in line with that of the prior year. Within our Technology business, gross profit increased 28.6% to $135.9 million, and gross margin expanded by 50 basis points to 24% and driven by higher margins across all three technology segments. Due to a more profitable mix, product gross margin expanded 80 basis points to 22.4% and professional service gross margin expanded 90 basis points to 41.4%. Benefiting from our increased scale, managed services gross margin improved 210 basis points to 30.7%. SG&A expenses increased 17.6% year-over-year, reflecting the addition of team members from Network Solutions Group, organic hires and higher variable compensation expense, still lower than gross profit, which increased 25.3%. At quarter end, our head count increased to 1,853 from 1,637 in the prior year quarter mainly reflecting additions of customer-facing employees. Through continual operational discipline, operating income grew 39.6% to $46.3 million. The effective tax rate was 27.2% in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 28% in the year-ago quarter. Fiscal 2024 1st quarter consolidated net earnings were $33.8 million or $1.27 per diluted share, both up 51.5% and 51.2%, respectively, from the year ago quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.41, a 42.4% increase from the year ago period. Adjusted EBITDA was $53.9 million or 40.7% ahead of the comparable quarter in fiscal 2023. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $101.6 million compared to $103.1 million at the end of fiscal 2023. Over the past three years, operating cash flow has been impacted by the growth in inventories, which partly reflects supply chain constraints. With supply chains now improving, we expect inventory to remain flat or decrease reducing our working capital needs and enhancing operating cash flows. First quarter inventories remained flat relative to the level at the close of fiscal 2023. Inventory turns improved to 32 days versus 38 days in the preceding quarter. Our cash conversion cycle was 48 days compared to 44 days in the year ago quarter but significantly improved from the 59 days at the end of March 2023. Finally, I want to thank our ePlus team for solid execution in the first quarter and their persistent efforts to drive growth. With that, I will turn the call back over to Mark. Mark?\nMark Marron: Thank you, Elaine. ePlus is off to a strong start this year, benefiting from our diversified base of customers and our strategic focus on serving faster-growing end markets. In an environment where our customers are prioritizing more rapid payback on their IT investments, ePlus remains well positioned for continued growth. We are leveraging our extensive capabilities across the technology stack to deliver effective solutions that enable our customers to optimize costs, enhance security and focus on their core business operations. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sales growth in fiscal 2024 that exceeds the projected growth in the IT spending market. We are, therefore, initiating fiscal 2024 net sales guidance of $2.23 billion to $2.33 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to be between $200 million to $215 million, representing an adjusted EBITDA margin of to 9.2%. Our guidance assumes in part, a continued gradual leasing and supply chain constraints that enables us to complete previously delayed customer projects. In closing, ePlus remains focused on building long-term shareholder value through the execution of our growth strategy and efficient allocation of capital. I want to thank the ePlus team for their dedication, which is again evident in our strong performance. Operator, please open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And everyone, we will now take your questions. First up is Jesse Wilson, William Blair.\nJesse Wilson: This is Jesse on for Maggie. Congrats on the results and I guess, first, it's nice to see you initiate full year guidance, but just to dig in, it seems like a bit of a range in terms of the calculated growth at the upper and lower end. Can you talk about some of the assumptions you've made, what kind of gets you to upper end versus the lower end?\nMark Marron: Sure. So Jesse, it's Mark here. So a couple of different things. So let me start off with one why we're providing guidance now. So we had actually planned on providing guidance a few years back and then COVID hit. So we kind of pulled back. As we've talked to folks like yourself and other investors, they thought it would be helpful if we provide guidance. We have really good visibility into our pipeline and backlog, and we thought this would help with some of the modeling because there was some pretty big differences between the different analysts in terms of our growth, both top line and bottom line. So we're just trying to provide a little more granularity. As it relates to the numbers, both from a, I'll call it, net sales and adjusted EBITDA. What we saw in Q1, we actually had a really nice quarter, but there are a few things that happened in the quarter. One, we saw some supply chain easing. So we source some deals specifically in the networking space that were pulled forward. We also had about 1/3 of our net sales was from acquisitions. I will point out in subsequent quarters. One of the acquisitions will fall off and are in your projections already. We also had some large land and expand deals that affected the quarter. So, there was some pull forward. There were some acquisition related, which is about 1/3 of the net sales and then supply chain easing. As we looked at the metrics, it was about seven to rough numbers. This is approximate 7% to 11% growth over last year on the top line. And we were very comfortable looking at our pipeline and backlog on where that put us, especially after the first quarter. I will point out Q2 is a tough compare for us for a lot of different reasons. Mainly in our finance segment, we had a really solid quarter last year, especially in the operating income space. So I think that will be tough to for us to match as we go into this quarter. And it's normally -- Q2 is normally a solid quarter, but with that tough compare and some of the pull forward, we thought it might be a little bit tighter in Q2. But that's the high level on the thought process as it relates. And we thought the margin percentage 9% to 9.2% on the adjusted EBITDA was in line with expectations based on some investments we plan on making as we continue forward throughout the year.\nJesse Wilson: Got it. That's all really helpful. And then a couple of follow-up questions just because you hit on both in your first answer. So you are seeing some of those land and expand deals ramp up. Are you thinking about that on a multiyear basis? Or kind of over a few quarters, which seems like that might be the case. And then my second follow-up…\nMark Marron: Go ahead, Jesse. Sorry.\nJesse Wilson: Yes. My second follow-up was on the acquisition. So did you just acquire some very talented sales persons that are winning new business? Or were some recently acquired customers spending more? That's it for me.\nMark Marron: Okay. So good question. So on the land and expand, it's a strategy we've had for a while, and it's where we work with the -- I'll say more on the enterprise side, but it's also on the mid-market side that we'll work with customers. We'll try to get a foothold in the account. And then from there, we try to expand the sale everything that we have. So sometimes we'll get a big pop or hit in the quarter based on a big opportunity. Normally, the margin is a little bit tighter on those deals, and then we try to expand it with our value-added solutions and services. And that can go across multiple quarters or multiple years as we try to expand it. So that's not something that's just the in a quarter or two, it could be multiple years that we see the benefit on that strategy, all right? And the second question was around acquisitions. So, on the acquisitions, we like to think we acquired really good people and talented salespeople. We think it's a great -- two of them are both really good acquisitions for us. Future Com, which we acquired in July of 2022 and mainly in the security space and gave us some additional customers and access in the Texas region. And then network service systems group is in the service provider space. And they had a really nice quarter. Most acquisitions normally struggle in the first quarter, Jesse, and they actually had a nice quarter. And I think that was due to some of the network supply chain that open up as well as some things that they closed. But I would expect that to slow down a little bit as we move forward, but a nice jump to Q1.\nOperator: Next, we'll take a question from Greg Burns. Sidoti.\nGreg Burns: Can you just delve into where you're pipeline and backlog stands now because it sounds like you did deliver on some of those backlog projects this quarter, but the inventory didn't really go down too much? So how much is left there to -- that I guess would still be in process?\nMark Marron: Yes. So Greg, so what I was talking about is both in our CRM systems as well as looking at our open orders and backlog, we've got very good visibility. As it relates to our backlog/open orders, they're probably down about $60 million sequentially. So that's where we saw some of the runoff into the quarter. There was also some, what I'll say, lead times that improved on the networking side that help our networking numbers were up about 67%. So there was some pull forward in my opinion, that I don't know if we'll see as much as we move throughout the year. But that's kind of the high level on the quarter there.\nGreg Burns: Okay. And then it seems like demand is broadening -- you had broad-based demand across products and customer segments. But are you seeing any signs of caution, any indications that companies are pulling back? Or are they just reprioritizing and where your products and services are is where the money is flowing. Can you just give us a sense of maybe your outlook for the market?\nMark Marron: Yes. So it's interesting, Greg. So, a couple of different things there. One, we do believe we'll continue to pace the IT spend market, for sure. We've done that and believe we'll continue to do it. We are seeing some longer deal cycles and there's the economic uncertainty. There is some -- there's been some nice size layoffs from some of the tech vendors out there. And you see some of the projections from some of our public peers in terms of what they're projecting in terms of declining revenue. So I never want to say we're immune to it, but we are resilient, if you will, as it relates to our business. The other thing is -- we don't really play in the commodity space. We made a decision a long time ago in the PC laptop space to get out of that business. We still do it for some of our bigger customers. But we didn't see some of the headwinds, I think that some of the others are in that space. And then the other thing is on our customer size segment, every customer size segment was up. What was really nice was our mid-market was up, which I believe is -- those customers have real need for the types of solutions that we're providing. So, we feel good about our guidance. We feel good about the quarter, but not overly -- not jumping up and down yet in terms of where the economy can go in the second half.\nGreg Burns: Okay. And then lastly, why did you split out professional managed services into their own segments. Is there like an expectation for a difference in terms of growth rates or margins? Like why provide that extra granularity now?\nMark Marron: Yes. You know what, Greg, it's to help with some of the modeling. We've talked about our managed services/annuity quality revenues for years. We thought it made sense as we decided to give guidance to break out services as well. I would think what I'd call a transactional services or professional services and staffing over time, you'll start to see an uptick. Some of that is held back by supply chain overall. So that's one thing. And as it relates to or managed services, we saw that this quarter was up 23% year-over-year. And as I think I mentioned, the CAGR over the last five years is 24%. So, it's a -- it's a very visible revenue stream and it's a profitable reverse. But I would expect our transactional professional services over time to pick up as well.\nOperator: And we'll take the next question from Matthew Sheerin, Stifel.\nMatthew Sheerin: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, Mark, and everyone and I also echo others' comments about appreciating the disclosure, the outlook and guidance as well as the breakdown of some of your revenue streams. So I appreciate that. But just relative to your guidance for the year, Mark, as you said, it looks like your forward guide is it looks to be conservative because you're up 25% year-on-year, you're guiding up 10%, I mean, in the first quarter. So that would imply that the second half is going to be flat to down also in December, I know you're going to be facing tough comps because you had a very, very strong December quarter last year. So I'm just wondering, are you just -- is that just conservative because of maybe you don't have visibility into the full year or some of the comments you made earlier about reasons maybe to be more conservative? Just trying to get a feel for how you think about the rest of the year. And also, the September quarter, you're typically up sequentially. But I'm wondering if -- with all the pull-ins that you talked about, whether that's going to be more flattish or down sequentially?\nMark Marron: Yes. So that was a lot in there, Matt. So a couple of different things, one is, I think I called out, we're starting to see some of the tough comps on the finance piece. So we had a really big quarter I believe it was $12.2 million in operating income in Q2. So that's going to be really tough to replicate. So that's the first thing as it relates to Q2. You are right. Q3 is normally our strongest quarter. Q2 is normally a solid quarter, but I do believe we had some pull forward in this quarter. We saw some things that popped in that at the end of the quarter that popped into the quarter that we weren't expecting. So, I think that's part of what maybe is throwing you off a little bit because the quarter was so big. The other thing is, yes, we are a little reserved as it relates to our guidance, but we feel very good about the guidance. Based on what we're hearing in the market from our competitors and from others that are down single to double digits. So we're just trying to make sure that we put something out that's fair based on our pipeline, based on our backlog, based on everything that we're seeing. The other thing I will highlight, it is up 7% to 11% on over last year in this market, which I don't think you're seeing in most of the companies that have announced results. And quite honestly, that's ballpark $150 million to $250 million in terms of guidance above what we did last year. So I think it's a somewhat aggressive but realistic target, so not undercutting it. I don't know if that gave you everything you need there, Matt.\nMatthew Sheerin: Well, I have some follow-ups, but just regarding backlog, is it still elevated? It sounds like it was down. Was it down $60 million quarter-on-quarter? And is it still elevated, and how much relative to your normal backlog?\nMark Marron: Yes, it's still elevated to our normal backlog, Matt. It's quite honestly, it's almost pre-COVID, almost double our normal in terms of open orders, but it's down sequentially $60 million.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. And then on the EBITDA guidance, the margin guidance 9% to 9.2%, that's basically flat year-over-year, but you're going to be up significantly year-on-year in UR in Q1. So I'm wondering is that because you expect maybe some OpEx going up? Why not continue to see that leverage play through the year?\nMark Marron: Yes, I think there's two things, Matt. One, we acquired the network service group. So you only saw two months of the OpEx in this quarter. So I'd expect that to be up a little as we move forward. And yes, we believe we can continue to grow market share. So we are going to invest across our practices, adding more customer-facing headcount. For example, if you think about some of the stuff going on with artificial intelligence, it's an area that, right now, I believe, is in the early innings. I don't -- it's not a big revenue generator for us, but we believe it could be a growth driver. So, we'll look to invest in areas in that space over time by providing advisory services around helping customers understand the risk and the government and things that they have to understand, understanding how to take advantage of some of the AI embedded solutions from our partners that are out there. So yes, we do plan on making some additional investments in headcount, but it's also some additional expense that's not in there as it relates to the Network Services Group, which we acquired in May.\nMatthew Sheerin: Okay. That's super helpful. And just last question for me. Just regarding the pricing trends and I know in recent quarters, you and everyone has been -- have been able to pass along the vendor price increases. Are you starting to see that level off at all? Or any pricing pressure as the component availability becomes better.\nMark Marron: Yes. No, Matt, I haven't seen anything. We've been able to pass it on and haven't seen. There are certain deals where you'll have some pressure from competitors that will go in aggressively with discounts. But as it relates to any pricing pressures, we've been able to pass that on, we had a strong quarter related to our product sales, which I think Elaine mentioned was up 29%. So didn't see much of that change in that space.\nOperator: And everyone, at this time, there are no further questions. I'll hand things back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.\nMark Marron: Okay. Thanks, Lisa. So if I could close, it was a really nice start to our fiscal year. It was a solid quarter and I want to congratulate and thank the ePlus team for everything they did to produce the results that we did. And with that, I'd like to thank everybody for joining us for this call and look forward to our next earnings call. Take care and be safe.\nOperator: Once again, everyone that does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
