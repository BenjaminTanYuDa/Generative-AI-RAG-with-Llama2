A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. The news release detailing AngioDynamics' fiscal 2024 second quarter results crossed the wire earlier this morning and is available on the company's website. This conference call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at the Investors section of the company's website at www.angiodynamics.com, and the webcast replay of the call will be available at the same site approximately one hour after the end of today's call. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that during the course of this conference call, the company will make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events, including statements about expected revenue, adjusted earnings and gross margins for fiscal year 2024, as well as trends that may continue. Management encourages you to review the company's past and future filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, the company's Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which identify specific factors that may cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The company will also discuss certain non-GAAP and pro forma financial measures during this call. Management uses these measures to establish operational goals and review operational performance and believes that these measures may assist investors in analyzing the underlying trends in the company's business over time. Investors should consider these non-GAAP and pro forma measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A slide package offering insight into the company's financial results is also available on the Investors section of the company's website under Events & Presentations. This presentation should be read in conjunction with the press release discussing the company's operating results and financial performance during this morning's conference call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Clemmer, AngioDynamics' President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Clemmer?\nJim Clemmer: Thank you, Rob, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today for our fiscal 2024 second quarter earnings call. Joining me on today's call is Steve Trowbridge, AngioDynamics' Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a more detailed analysis of our second quarter financial performance, as well as the manufacturing and restructuring that we announced this morning. Unless otherwise noted, all financial metrics and growth rates provided during the call today with respect to our results will be on a pro-forma basis, which excludes the impact of our divested Dialysis and BioSentry businesses. Before digging into our quarterly results, we are announcing significant steps in our long-term strategic transformation. During the second quarter, we continue to actively pursue portfolio optimization opportunities and we made progress on that front. In addition, this morning, we announced a planned restructuring of our manufacturing footprint by moving to a fully outsourced model. With these moves, we will remain focused on generating continued growth across both our Med Tech and Med Device businesses, while simultaneously driving margin expansion. Importantly, when the dust settles from our initiatives at the end of our two year plan, we expect to achieve full year profitability in FY 2027. Both Steve and I will go into additional details later in the call. But now let me get back to Q2. Our second quarter of fiscal '24 saw year-over-year growth but we also faced headwinds, particularly in our thrombectomy business. We ended the second quarter with revenue of $79.1 million, representing growth of approximately 3% over year, led by growth of approximately 4% from our Med Tech segment. While growth of the Med Tech segment was a bit behind our expectations, particularly in mechanical thrombectomy, our adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.05 as we remain focused on our spending and managing operating expenses while still investing in long-term growth. Our mechanical thrombectomy business, which includes AngioVac and AlphaVac, declined 4.7% year-over-year. We are disappointed by these results as clearly the growth trajectory of this business is taking longer to inflect than we had expected. We attribute some of the softness to slightly weaker-than-anticipated procedural volumes late in our quarter, but we also believe the steps we are taking to drive this business are gaining positive traction. For example, following on the heels of receiving the breakthrough designation for the use of AngioVac to remove right heart vegetation, we continue working diligently with the FDA toward receiving final approval to begin our IDE study. While AlphaVac revenues were softer than we would have liked this quarter, what we've learned over the past 18 months is that physicians value this durability, simplicity and safety of the device, and we look forward to the introduction of two new second-generation design enhancements that will make the product even more appealing later in calendar 2024. As announced in early December, we enrolled our final patient in our APEX-AV study, which is designed to assess the performance of the AlphaVac F18 system in reducing thrombus burden and improving right ventricular function. We look forward to collecting data from this study at the 30-day follow-up stage, then submitting our data to the FDA in the early part of calendar year 2024 to support an expanded indication for AlphaVac F18 to treat pulmonary embolism. We believe the softer-than-anticipated AlphaVac sales during the quarter partially stem from a wind down at many of our sites as we approach the completion enrollment in the APEX-PE trial, and we expect some continued softness between the completion of the trial and the FDA approval of the PE indication as the device does not have a specific PE clearance and is competing against two existing products that do. We fully expect that once we receive our anticipated approval letter later this calendar year, we will have a highly competitive and differentiated product in what remains a large, underpenetrated, high-growth market. Because of the tremendous interest from the physician community, we were able to complete our study as quickly as we did in a time that outpaced the previous competitive studies, and we are excited about the path ahead. Turning to our NanoKnife business, we saw sales grow approximately 2.8% during the second quarter, with sales of probes declining 3.6%. Probe sales grew in the U.S. but declined internationally due to timing of both bringing on new distributors during the previous year's quarter and distributor orders during this year's quarter. Stronger international capital sales during the quarter offset the decline in probes and will drive additional pro-growth in future periods as those units come online. Year-to-date, NanoKnife probes were up 12.9%, and total [NanoKnife] sales are up 16.7%. We continue to expect strong growth from this business on an annual basis while anticipating quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in both probes and capital sales as historically has been the case. During the second quarter, we saw solid growth of our Auryon platform, up 12.9% year-over-year, and we're excited to tell you that in November, we reached an important milestone, having achieved $100 million in cumulative revenue since we launched this product in September of 2020. We did experience some delays in sales related to the recent increased attention around preauthorizations, but we believe that over the long term, the unique way that we deliver laser energy and safely treat disease vessels will continue to drive increased share and provide the foundation for continued strong growth. Growth of approximately 2% in our Med Device segment was primarily driven by angiographic catheter products and our ports, which grew 8% and 5.5%, respectively. In the second quarter of FY 2024, our international business grew 12.6% year-over-year, with double-digit growth from both our Med Tech and our Med Device segments. We also hosted our third international clinical life symposium, which has led to increased interest in our Med Tech products and we have generated a meaningful pipeline of global physicians who are excited to utilize our products in caring for their patients. Now turning to our strategic initiatives that I mentioned earlier. We told you over the past several quarters that we were further evaluating the products in our Med Device portfolio and we remain engaged in active discussions to do just that. We advanced this initiative during the second quarter and we look forward to providing you with additional details soon when we are able to. In addition to our continued portfolio optimization efforts, we are also increasing our focus on reducing structural costs within our manufacturing footprint and transitioning our upstate New York manufacturing operations to a fully outsourced the model over the next two years. As a reminder, roughly 80% of our Med Tech revenue is already leveraging this third-party manufacturing model. As many of you already know, we began moving some of our Med Device manufacturing capacity to Costa Rica over the past couple of years as we began to see labor shortages in our upstate New York facilities. Fully moving both Med Tech and Med Device to this model will drive an annualized savings of roughly $15 million by our FY '27, driving significant gross margin improvement, and equally as important, giving us a pathway to full year profitability by FY '27. Steve will cover this in more detail, but we believe this is a significant advancement of our long-term strategy that simplifies our operations while allowing us to invest in the long-term growth of our Med Tech portfolio and the overall business while still driving profitability. Shifting back to the near term. We're excited for what lies ahead in calendar 2024. This month, we will commence the limited market release of our Auryon radio catheter, which will provide physicians an access point at the risk, enabling faster, less invasive procedures. This release will be the first of six planned product releases for Auryon during calendar year 2024. In the second half of year - calendar year 2024, we will launch two new design enhancements for AlphaVac, designed around physician feedback we've received and we'll provide more details on those as we get closer to launch. We've also got an exciting schedule of regulatory clearances on the horizon. We are projecting EU approval of Auryon and AlphaVac-PE in the first half of calendar year 2024. Next, we also expect U.S. approval of AlphaVac-PE mid-calendar year. And then finally, in July, the PRESERVE 12-month follow-up will be complete, putting us on track for potential FDA approval in late calendar 2024 or early calendar 2025. These introductions and regulatory clearances are critical parts of the strategy that we laid out for you in our July 2021 Investor and Technology Day. These open up significantly larger, higher-growth addressable markets. We are excited about the strategic initiatives that we've shared with you this morning and about the future of our portfolio, and we hope the impacts of our strategic transformation are becoming more apparent each quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Trowbridge to review the quarter in more detail. Steve?\nSteve Trowbridge: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to direct everyone to the presentation on our Investor Relations website, summarizing the key items from our quarterly results. As Jim mentioned, unless otherwise noted, all metrics and growth rates mentioned during today's call are on a pro forma basis and exclude the results of the dialysis and BioSentry businesses that we divested in mid-June. Similar to Jim, I'll start with the second quarter before shifting to today's strategic announcements. Our revenue for the second quarter of FY '24 increased 2.7% year-over-year to $79.1 million, driven by growth in both our Med Tech and Med Device platforms. Med Tech revenue was $25.4 million, a 3.5% year-over-year increase, while Med Device revenue was $53.7 million, growing 2.3% compared to the second quarter of FY '23. Year-to-date, our overall revenue was up 4.2% year-over-year, with our Med Tech segment up 8.3%, and our Med Device segment up 2.3%. For the second fiscal quarter, our Med Tech platforms comprised 32.1% of our total revenue compared to 31.8% of total revenue a year ago. For the six months ended November 30, 2023, our Med Tech segment comprised 32.6% of our total revenue base versus 31.4% as of one year ago. Our Auryon platform contributed $11.4 million in revenue during the second quarter, growing 12.9% compared to last year. Year-to-date, our Auryon platform is up 18.9% year-over-year. Mechanical thrombectomy revenue, which includes AngioVac and AlphaVac sales, declined 4.7% over the second quarter of FY '23. AlphaVac revenue for the second quarter was $1.9 million. AngioVac revenue was $5.4 million in the quarter, representing a decline of 10.8% over the prior year. We did not see the rebound in AngioVac revenues that we had anticipated as procedure volumes came in lighter than expected, particularly late in the quarter. We remain confident that mechanical thrombectomy will be a strategic contributor to our long-term growth strategy and we are excited about the new product introductions that Jim mentioned as well as our clinical initiatives, such as the APEX pulmonary embolism study. NanoKnife disposable revenue during the quarter decreased 3.6% year-over-year. Disposable growth of 4% in the U.S. was offset by a year-over-year decline in international markets. As Jim said, the year-over-year quarterly decline in international markets was primarily driven by timing of distributor orders, although procedure volume remained very strong during the quarter. Capital sales were robust in the quarter, growing 22.8% and this is a strong driver of future disposable sales. Year-to-date, NanoKnife disposable sales are up 12.9%, and total NanoKnife sales are up 16.7%. In addition, as a reminder, earlier this year, we announced that enrollment in PRESERVE is now 100% complete. And as this data starts to be made public over the course of this year, we look forward to sharing it with you. In the second quarter, our Med Device segment grew 2.3% year-over-year, led by strength in our angiographic catheter and port products. Moving down the income statement. Our gross margin for the second quarter of FY '24 was 50.9%, a decrease of 80 basis points compared to the year ago period. For the second fiscal quarter, Med Tech gross margin was 62.4%, a decrease of 130 basis points, and Med Device gross margin was 45.5%, a decrease of 60 basis points, each when compared to the second quarter of last year. The year-to-date gross margin for FY '24 was 50.8%, a decrease of 60 basis points versus prior year, with Med Tech gross margins of 63.5% and Med Device gross margins of 44.7%. Year-over-year gross margins for both the quarter and year-to-date were positively impacted by sales volume, production volume and reduced cost for both freight expenses and direct labor retention payments but were offset by sales mix, hardware placements and continued, albeit reduced, material and labor inflation. As we've discussed, our strategic business model contemplates gross margin expansion as our higher-margin Med Tech segment continues to become a larger portion of our overall revenue base. As mentioned last quarter, the next phase of our transformation is to address the scale and structural limitations of our operating footprint in a capital-efficient manner. This morning's announcement regarding restructuring our manufacturing footprint and transitioning our upstate New York manufacturing operations to a fully outsourced model will address these structural cost limitations, meaningfully improve gross margins and lead to full year adjusted EPS profitability in FY '27. We expect that our manufacturing restructuring will result in annualized savings of roughly $15 million, with the full annualized impact being realized in FY '27. In addition, as we previously discussed, we're continuing to have productive conversations around further optimizing our portfolio and we will provide you with more details when appropriate. Turning to R&D. Our research and development expense during the second quarter of FY '24 was $8.7 million or 10.9% of sales, compared to $6.8 million or 8.8% of sales a year ago. Spending on clinical programs was 18.8% of total R&D spend during the second quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 14.1% during the second quarter of last year, and 18.6% for the full fiscal year 2023. This mixed shift within our R&D spending is well aligned with our long-term strategy to support increased physician adoption of our Med Tech platform technologies through the generation of data and clinical evidence. SG&A expense for the second quarter of FY '24 was $34.8 million, representing 44% of sales, compared to $36.8 million or 47.8% of sales a year ago. Our adjusted net loss for the second quarter of FY '24 was $2 million or adjusted loss per share of $0.05 compared to an adjusted net loss of $3.6 million or adjusted loss per share of $0.09 in the second quarter of last year. Adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of FY '24 was $1.8 million compared to adjusted EBITDA of $2.3 million in the second quarter of FY '23. In the second quarter of fiscal '24, we generated $5.3 million in operating cash, had capital expenditures of $0.6 million, in additions to Auryon placement and evaluation units of $1.2 million. At November 30, 2023, we had $60.9 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $44.6 million in cash and cash equivalents at May 31, 2023. And as a reminder, we have zero debt on the balance sheet. Turning now to guidance. We now anticipate that FY '24 revenue will be in the range of $320 million to $325 million, below our prior guidance of $328 million to $333 million. This accounts primarily for the softer thrombectomy sales during the fiscal second quarter, which we now expect will continue throughout the back half of the year as well as certain SKU rationalization and other impacts associated with the manufacturing restructuring we announced this morning. We now expect full year adjusted loss per share to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.42. We expect FY '24 gross margin to be in the range of 49% to 51% compared to pro forma FY '23 gross margin of 50.5% as a result of the mixed shift occurred due to the lower expected Med Tech. For FY '24, we now expect Med Tech revenue growth in the range of 10% to 15%, down from 20% to 25% to account for the thrombectomy weakness we saw during the second quarter persisting through the remainder of this year. We continue to expect Med Device revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3%. We now expect Med Tech gross margins in the range of 61% to 63%, and Med Device gross margins in the range of 43% to 45%. As we mentioned earlier, we expect the manufacturing restructuring to have a meaningful impact on our margin structure over the coming years and look forward to providing you with more details as that work gets underway in the coming months. Today's announcement is a significant step in our strategic transformation that gets us closer to the company we strive to be. A profitable business focused on unique medical technology platforms that improve patient outcomes in large underpenetrated high-growth markets. Finally, I would like to thank our team here at AngioDynamics for their hard work and commitment, and we're looking forward to sharing more about these initiatives with you in the coming months while executing further on our strategy and delivering a strong second half for fiscal '24. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\nJim Clemmer: Thanks, Steve, and for those joining, thank you for your time this morning. What you see is a company in transformation, looking to do the balance today of making sure our investments and costs that we spend are aligned to the outcomes that we want to see in the markets we serve and the markets we seek to grow in. Taking out significant structural costs, we don't have a lot of product, our customer benefit are important steps in that. We'll continue to do that with an eye to the bottom line, but also maintaining investments to optimize the opportunity that we've set forth in front of us. We have unique opportunities in large and fast-growing markets. We want to make sure we can maximize the opportunity to treat cardiovascular disease, primarily in venous or in arterial needs. We also know that our unique NanoKnife can treat solid tumors in areas like prostate cancer. We look forward to following our customers to where they seek to grow with our products. Thanks for joining us today. Rob, I'll turn it back to you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Yi Chen with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed with your question.\nYi Chen: Thank you for taking my question. Just want to clarify. The gross margin, will it continue to decrease until you complete the shift to serve third-party manufacturing?\nSteve Trowbridge: You'll see some back and forth, Yi. Thanks for the question. There are going to be costs that are going to be taken out through this process. You're going to see the most impactful benefit come when we are able to finally close the doors and do that full shift to the manufacturing. As we head into giving you guidance for future years, as we move into '25 and '26, we'll give you a little bit more clarity around the cadence from that. So I would expect you're going to see a little bit of movements, but with that most significant movement coming at the end of the two year period, and then certainly being there for the full year of FY '27.\nJim Clemmer: And Yi, during that two year period as well, the product mix shift as the Med Tech products that have a higher gross margin than our corporate gross margin average will become a faster-growing piece. So as long as Steve said, as we take those costs out of the back end, we also expect to see a mix shift that's positive throughout that two year cycle and far beyond. Thanks.\nYi Chen: Thank you. And regarding the sales from thrombectomy, are there any factors that you expect to drive the sales to increase the sales in the coming years?\nJim Clemmer: There are, Yi. First of all, with AngioVac, again, announcing the breakthrough designation that we received from the FDA a few months back, and then getting that IDE aligned to our expectations to graft to the right heart vegetation opportunity that we think is significant for AngioVac, but larger than that AlphaVac. Yi, we mentioned on the call earlier that we look forward to have our CE Mark in the first half of calendar year 2024, opens up a significant market for us. And it's timed almost in the same series that will get, we believe, our FDA indication for our PE for the F18 here in the U.S. So over the next six months, we'll work hard to educate and train our sales and clinical teams and get ready to go to the markets that we can serve. These are really large markets. What we've learned during the APEX study from AlphaVac, that physicians really like the novel design features in the product. The study would not have been completed as fast as it was if people didn't see the novel design elements that led to what we think are really positive patient outcomes. So, Yi, really, we've got to sit tight for a bit and make sure we're prepared for a full global launch later in calendar 2024.\nYi Chen: That's very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Young with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your questions.\nJohn Young: Hi, Jim and Steve, can you hear me okay?\nJim Clemmer: Thanks John. Good morning.\nJohn Young: Good morning. Thanks for taking our question. Just maybe on AngioVac to start, can you just go a little bit more in detail about the headwinds that you're talking about. I know in the past, you put new sales leadership and training there and you recently got the breakthrough device designation, right heart vegetation. What isn't working there? And what are you going to do to remedy this?\nJim Clemmer: John, for AngioVac, it's been a challenge. We mentioned before that we service smaller market opportunity with AngioVac than we do with AlphaVac. So opening up that right heart vegetation opportunity that we're working with the FDA on is important for us. But again, AngioVac is only going to serve a limited market. What we've done since we talked to you last summer, a brand new sales leader who's terrific built a new sales team, around some people that were here already that knew the products wanted to work in this environment when we open up these new markets, and AlphaVac-PE being the largest. We've also fully realized now a new training module and we fully staffed our sales force for the first time. So we're really ready. We're in a phase now. We're training and developing their capabilities, getting them educated, and the markets will serve both for AngioVac, as you mentioned, which is complex, as you know, and limited and their larger, less limited market that is open to us in the future when the AlphaVac-PE becomes granted. So we're doing our work in the back end, training and educating our teams, our clinical and sales teams to open up these markets.\nJohn Young: Great. Thanks, Jim. And then just on shifting to AlphaVac 2, you mentioned that the 2.0 is going to launch this calendar year. Can you talk about the improvement? And do you now see any ASP increases with that? And can you maybe just talk about today, the pricing versus the market and your pricing on par or above or below the market? Thank you.\nJim Clemmer: Good question, John. So AlphaVac is really a unique and novel device. And again, I'll let the study speak for itself. Hopefully, you'll see some data being published this calendar year with study results when they become available. But there's some design elements that are unique. For instance, physicians are so used to placing wires when you're treating this part of the anatomy and guiding catheters through the anatomy, which is torturous, which usually guide wires and so forth. We designed the AlphaVac with one of the unique design elements is that you don't need to drop a wire or place a wire. Most physicians look at it like, why wait a minute, you can't do that, and they still can do that if they choose. But over time, we found they get confident and comfortable with the design elements of the device. They don't need to do that. It allows them the steerability ops we built in to go back and forth between the different parts of the atrium and to really treat the body in a different way. It's faster and safer, we believe. So some really unique design elements that are already built in the product that we've heard great feedback on. And we've collected other feedback from some design enhancements they'd like to see. And that's what we'll offer later this calendar year, when we come out with our second-gen product, which is timed really well with what we think will be our PE indication expansion. Today, John, we talked about the pricing in the market is in the $1,000 mark. In that range, we think is uniquely priced right to be competitive with the other products out there. And the value that our customers receive, we think, has been really high. They've really shown a willingness to adapt that price point. It's a good price point for us in this market. I can't speak to the other companies. We know where they price their product. Some do it differently. But we think we're in a good spot there. The product will have a high gross margin at that range and we look to grow in that range of pricing for years to come.\nJohn Young: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Pleased to see with your questions.\nJayson Bedford: Just a few questions. On the AlphaVac improvements, just from a regulatory standpoint, do they require an additional 510(k)? Or can the - can you launch some without any new regulatory approvals?\nJim Clemmer: Hi Jayson, so the regulatory team is working with the R&D team. So I think that one of the enhancements actually requires a new F 510(k) one does not - so these are design changes that were planned in with the R&D and the regulatory teams. So that's why we're looking at that second half of this calendar year, the cycle that our regulatory teams, quality teams and R&D teams have targeted, we feel confident we'll hit those cycles.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. And then just on thrombectomy, you mentioned some procedural softness late in the quarter. I'm just wondering, what do you attribute the softness to?\nJim Clemmer: Yes, Jayson, we obviously measure this very closely with our customers. And we saw that softness occur, that November time frame. And we talk to our customers. We had two things happening. There was actually a wind down. We're getting very close to the end of the APEX study, and our study sites knew that. So some were finishing up, some are winding down. So we're kind of careful how we measure this. But we also had a lot of conversations with our customers, with \"same-store sales\" people who use a certain amount of the product. Their usage went down. We spoke to them in a couple. They all shrugged their shoulders a bit said, hey, we haven't seen the patients come through lately at the rate they normally do. A little less control they had or we had over that marketplace. It was not huge, but enough for us that it's still a small business for us, AlphaVac getting growing. So it's impactful for us. We watch it closely. So there's a couple of factors there. We don't want to put our arms around any one in particular. Again, the opportunity that we have with training and education of our team, getting them ready for the PE launch later this calendar year we think is most impactful. Whether there's a bit of softness back and forth won't really matter then because the upside opportunity, we believe, is significant for us.\nJayson Bedford: And have you seen a bit of a rebound in December?\nJim Clemmer: Yes, a little bit, step back a little bit, not a whole lot. Again, as I said, we're measuring it differently. And also, Jayson, we have the other factor where it was the first couple of days in December, where the final patients were enrolled. So we completed the study in the first couple of days of December, which really enabled us to shut down the study and then pull back, obviously, on the education of the study. We can't sell and market the product outside of the study terms until we get the PE market. So there's a couple of moving parts having at the same time. I just want to make you aware of that. So we're watching all those elements together.\nJayson Bedford: And just - what's the logistical process of moving to a fully outsourced model? Like how is this going to work?\nJim Clemmer: Yes. So we have sites here in Upstate New York that were started almost when our company was founded 35 years ago in upstate New York. We've got two manufacturing sites, distribution sites as well. So what we'll do is a two year wind down, Jayson. The announcement we made yesterday starts that two year process. So we talked to our people at the site yesterday. This has been planned for - for you can imagine, nine to 12 months, the planning phase. And you've also seen, a couple of years ago, we started moving some of the operations to Costa Rica because we needed capacity during the pandemic period. We had less availability of new employees and operators. So we started some of those moves for our Med Device products during that period. So we now have established protocols with some good supplier partners. We have quality validation metrics already set up. They're part of our supply chain, it works well. So it gave us the confidence we can move more things and do more, if we couldn't get the capacity and cost levels to where we need to be, and over time, we couldn't. So we had this plan B in our pocket. And as I said earlier, as you see, the bulk of our revenue today in our Med Tech segment comes from suppliers that are partners in our supply chain today. So back to logistics, we've got a wind down around each of those product segments that are still manufactured in our sites here and a plan around each of those, to move those to a supplier partner and make sure that the quality operations are ready, the validations and all the regulatory processes are in place. That's why we have really a two year window, Jayson, to complete that cycle.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. Just maybe last one for me for now. Cash flow, I think you have had a goal out there, $65 million, $70 million cash exiting the year. Is that still on the table?\nSteve Trowbridge: Jayson, it will be a little bit of moving parts when you think about the manufacturing transfer that we just talked about. For example, there's probably going to be some cash that's going to move from one spot on the asset of the balance sheet to another spot, right? We're going to build up a little inventory as we prepare for some of these movements. That being said, as Jim said, this is a plan that we've been working on for a very long time. There may be some shifts in the balance sheet, but it's not going to fundamentally change our expectations of where we're going to end up.\nJayson Bedford: So - sorry, still $65 million to $70 million or towards the low end?\nSteve Trowbridge: I wouldn't expect it would be a little bit below that. But like I said, I expect that there's going to be some shifting. I have cash that might move into inventory buildup as we prepare, right? So that will be a little bit less cash, but maybe not terribly different when you think about current assets.\nJayson Bedford: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nSteven Lichtman: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I guess just first, a couple of cleanup questions on the manufacturing shift. What percent of Med Device is outsourced currently? And what anticipated cash costs of the transition should we assume?\nSteve Trowbridge: So Steve, with respect to your first question, roughly 20% of the current device portfolio is already made by third-party manufacturing partners. Jim mentioned that we started this process a number of quarters ago as we were building up capacity with our Costa Rica partnership. So we're going to continue doing that. I think it's important to understand that this process that we're talking about is really a continuation of something that was started over the last 24 months or so. Jim talked about it taking the full 24 months. That's to the point where we can get there and it's fully outsourced. And the benefit that, that gives us is, as opposed to today, where we have to have a management structure that supports both this hybrid company-owned manufacturing structure as well as managing the outsourced structure. We're going to move to 1, which is really going to be one of the fundamental drivers of that $15 million annual savings that we talked about once we can finish this two year process. And then you're going to see that fully roll into FY '27. In terms of the investment, there's going to be investment. That's something, as Jim said, we've been planning for the last nine months. It's something that is well within our plans. And the payback for these types of procedures are always very good, just what you'd expect to see.\nSteven Lichtman: Okay. Got it. So shifting to Auryon. Can you provide some more color on the pre-off headwinds you mentioned? And what you're seeing on that front, sort of as we went to - as we've gone into this fiscal quarter?\nJim Clemmer: Yes. Steve, we did touch upon it in our last - our Q1 call, we touched upon it. We've seen it out there. I think one or two other companies in the meantime, I've talked about it in more detail than we have. We got a balancing thing here. We've got still really strong demand being created by Auryon and how it works and the data is generating and the excitement in the marketplace. We've got this cool tailwind of interest in Auryon. I was at our Global Symposium 1.5 months ago overseas, watching new doctors be trained and talk about the capability of Auryon. So we've got that cool tailwind of interest. But yes, there is a headwind that's been created. We've seen it in the field. So the pre-authorizations, which have always kind of been a part of the cycle, have tightened up and more players are in on it. So it has slowed down procedures. We are working with industry groups and our customers to go through that process. We haven't come out and said it stopped our procedures or slowed them down significantly, but it has made an impact. There's no doubt. You still saw growth in a strong quarter. We think the quarter would have been stronger and more procedures would have been done without this headwind. We're doing all we can to work with our customers to minimize it, but it is there.\nSteven Lichtman: Thanks Jim. And then I guess just lastly, I don't think you mentioned anything today about indication expansion for Auryon, including this small vessel the key and potentially coronary. Any update on those?\nJim Clemmer: Yes. A couple of things. So with Auryon, again, we have it in our cycle now, our regulatory cycle with MDR for European CE approval in the first half of calendar year. We're always a bit cautious as you know, our industry, the MDR process has been a challenge for all of us for the past couple of years, but a regulatory team is a good aspect of control. We think we'll have Auryon approved overseas in the first half of the calendar year. Second, here, we want to expand Auryon two ways in the U.S. Some of which is part of those six product launches I told you about earlier in the call, one of which happens almost immediately here. Our new radial catheter gets launched as we speak. That's really exciting. There's some other things happening with Auryon beyond just those two things as clinicians see what it can do. There's been a study called FARO that was completed in Europe last summer and it's being published, showing how it can be used safely and effectively for coronary applications. We look forward to understanding that study, working with the thought leaders that produced it. And looking with the FDA, working with them on a study protocol and design. We'll talk more about soon about how we can also embark on the study here in the U.S. to open up a coronary expansion. So we think that's the next natural move for Auryon, as we know it will be safe and effective in that market.\nSteven Lichtman: And nothing new on small vessel on the thrombectomy side DVT?\nJim Clemmer: No new news there, follows the schedule we put forward. We're doing the work on our process now. Our R&D teams and regulatory teams are working on that pathway we laid out before. So there's really no new news, Steve, on that front.\nSteven Lichtman: Okay. Got it. Thanks Jim. Thanks Steve.\nJim Clemmer: Thank you, Steven.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Clemmer for any closing remarks. Mr. Clemmer?\nJim Clemmer: Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate the hard work and commitment of the AngioDynamics employees. It's very difficult to work in an environment as fast paced as the Med Tech environment, especially when your company is transforming itself through our portfolio first, and second, into how we do what we do. So today's announcement of our manufacturing instruction is significant for our company. We think we can better utilize some of those stranded costs that are there, that don't drive product, customer or company benefit. We're going to reallocate those costs over the next few years. Some will go to the bottom line and some will be allocated to investments, opening up expansion opportunities that exist in these new technologies we're launching. We're a company in transformation, but we're a strong company with the direction that's clear to make our company more valuable for our customers, for our employees and our investors. Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the AngioDynamics Fiscal Year 2024 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. The news release detailing AngioDynamics' fiscal 2024 first quarter results crossed the wire earlier this morning and is available on the company's website. This conference call is also being broadcast live over the Internet at the Investors section of the company's website at www.angiodynamics.com, and the webcast replay of the call will be available at the same site approximately one hour after the end of today's call. Before we begin, I would like to caution listeners that during the course of this conference call, the company will make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events, including statements about expected revenue, adjusted earnings and gross margins for fiscal year 2024, as well as trends that may continue. Management encourages you to review the company's past and future filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, the company's Forms 10-Q and 10-K, which identify specific factors that may cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The company will also discuss certain non-GAAP and pro forma financial measures during this call. Management uses these measures to establish operational goals and review operational performance and believes that these measures may assist investors in analyzing the underlying trends in the company's business over time. Investors should consider these non-GAAP and pro forma measures in addition to, not as a substitute for or as superior to, financial reporting measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. A slide package offering insight into the company's financial results is also available on the Investors section of the company's website under Events & Presentations. This presentation should be read in conjunction with the press release discussing the company's operating results and financial performance during this morning's conference call. I'd now like to turn the call over to Jim Clemmer, AngioDynamics' President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Clemmer?\nJim Clemmer: Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for AngioDynamics’ fiscal 2024 first quarter earnings call. Joining me on today's call is Steve Trowbridge, AngioDynamics’ Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, who will provide a detailed analysis of our first quarter financial performance. Unless otherwise noted, all financial metrics and growth rates provided during the call today will be on a pro forma basis, which excludes the impact of our divested Dialysis and BioSentry businesses in both our fiscal ‘24 and fiscal ‘23 first quarters. In our first quarter of FY ‘24 was highlighted by the attainment of important milestones in our long-term strategy and is a solid start financially against our fiscal year goals. Over the last few quarters, we've outlined for you several areas, where we were focused on improving, and I'm happy to say that we are seeing improvements here during the first quarter, although there's still more to come. We ended the first quarter with revenue of $78 million, representing growth of approximately 6% year-over-year, led by growth of approximately 13% from our MedTech segments. Our adjusted pro forma EPS was a loss of $0.13 and was in-line with our expectations. This excludes approximately $700,000 in sales from the divested businesses during the six business days in June that we still own to them. Beyond our financial performance, we made important progress on key milestones related to our long-term strategy. As we have stated, it is our mission to address meaningful treatment gaps in large, high-growth markets with a focus on cardiovascular disease and cancer. During our first quarter, we enrolled and treated our final patient in our PRESERVE study, which is designed to prove that NanoKnife is a safe and effective treatment for men diagnosed with intermediate-risk prostate cancer. We look forward to collecting data from this study at the 12-month follow-up stage, then submitting our data to the FDA in Q3 of calendar 2024 to support an expanded indication for NanoKnife to treat prostate tissue. We believe that the timing of our submission is ideal. It is clear that patients with intermediate-risk prostate cancer are looking for new treatment options that better preserve their quality of life. The interest and desire for focal therapy continues to build with both patients and physicians. We believe that NanoKnife will be the best option for this patient population due to its simplicity, versatility, and ability to reduce the risk of undesirable side effects that other treatment options carry. Over the course of this fiscal year, we look forward to providing you with more details as physicians publish additional data detailing their experiences using NanoKnife to treat prostate. Our NanoKnife business performed very well and grew approximately 36% during the first quarter, with sales of probes growing 35%. NanoKnife growth was strong again internationally, as our international team continues to establish new relationships with partners who assist in supporting our procedures and our strong U.S. growth was driven by continuing interest in this technology as more physicians become aware of our direct and preserved trials. We believe that NanoKnife has the potential to be one of the most important breakthroughs for men who qualify for a focal treatment approach to their disease by driving beneficial outcomes and offering significant quality of life benefits. It has the potential to open up a roughly $700 million market in the U.S. and potentially $2 billion market globally for those intermediate-risk patients. In the first quarter of FY ’24, our international businesses grew 26% year-over-year with impressive growth from both our Med Tech and our Med Device segments. Our team is strong and we will continue to grow in international markets through a strategy that employs key partners to support our products, continued exposure through our series of scientific symposiums, and further expansion of our Med Tech portfolio, as we gain important regulatory approvals around the globe. We believe this is the right approach and it allows us to leverage our partners in both the Med Tech and Med Device segments without the significant investment that would be required to build out a fully direct global sales force. Our mechanical thrombectomy business, which includes AngioVac and AlphaVac declined roughly 6% year-over-year. We were encouraged to see that AngioVac revenues while down year-over-year, grew sequentially, and we believe that the steps we are taking to drive this business are gaining positive traction. As you saw in our press release, we recently received a breakthrough designation for the use of AngioVac to remove right heart vegetation. We have engaged in productive conversations with the FDA and we expect to finalize our study design in our second fiscal quarter. Our APEX PE study is now more than 75% enrolled. This study is designed to prove that the AlphaVac F18 can be a safe and effective interventional treatment tool for physicians to treat patients who are at risk of a pulmonary embolism. We look forward to completing enrollment soon and after the 30 day patient follow-up period, we'll collect and submit our data to the FDA. We expect the data to support a PE indication around the end of calendar Q2 2024. We have been very pleased with the clinical feedback that we've received regarding the success that physicians have had with AlphaVac. They tell us that the intuitive design allows for safe and effective clot removal and they also specifically comment about how quickly and effectively they can steer our device through an often tortuous anatomy. This gives AlphaVac an advantage over other competitive options. They feel that our product will soon be an important part of the treatment options that they can choose from to treat VTE. In addition to the expected PE indication in calendar 2024, our customers will also see the second generation of AlphaVac and a number of important product innovations that will enhance usability even further. The rapidly developing venous thrombectomy market is highly competitive and contains numerous unmet clinical gaps. We are confident that we will be one of the top three players in this large and growing market for years to come. Not only will we win market share with our unique and innovative products, we will also drive adoption to catheter-based interventions and help move care in the VTE space away from historic lytic-based therapies. During the first quarter, we saw continued strong growth of our Auryon platform, up 26% year-over-year. This solid growth is a result of the unique way, we deliver laser energy and safely treat diseased vessels. We continue to gain share because physicians are gaining confidence in our technology, while they are also getting exposure to data generated by their peers, which is evidence of how special Auryon is as a treatment tool. Last quarter, we discussed the Auryon laser Micro-CT data and its importance, which provides evidence that Auryon can effectively fracture medial arterial calcification in small vessels typically located below the knee. This data has resonated well with physicians, and we believe can be an additional reason for clinicians to choose Auryon over our competitors. In addition, there are a number of presentations and podium discussions during this quarter's trade meetings that highlighted the power, versatility, and safety of Auryon. Auryon is special. We intend to launch catheters specially designed to allow Auryon to treat small vessel DVT in 2025. We believe that Auryon will enhance our venous thrombectomy strength and allow treating physicians a new and powerful option to treat clots in small vessels. We are also pursuing plans to gain an indication for Auryon to treat coronary artery disease. We believe that Auryon can be a safe and effective option to treat CAD. And we expect that the soon to be released FARO study will support this position. We continue to do our development planning and will give you further updates in subsequent quarters. And finally, we anticipate receiving CE Mark for Auryon in the next few months. As part of our ongoing focus to generate additional clinical data, we are proud to be holding our fourth Scientific Symposium at the end of October, where we'll be hosting global key opinion leaders interested in doing research on our devices to further prove safety and efficacy. We continue to build momentum with these KOLs, and we can see how differently our company is viewed by them as our credibility has grown, as an innovator that is committed to our physician customers and their patients. In addition to the progress that our medical technology segment is making, our medical device segment posted solid results and continues to provide an earnings and cash generation foundation. Growth in our Med Device segment was primarily driven by Ports and our Solero Microwave Ablation System. Our ports, which grew over 22%, illustrate the strength and leadership of our vascular access product portfolio and our commercial team. This is a very competitive market and our team has continually shown the ability to win. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve Trowbridge, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer to review the quarter in more detail.\nSteve Trowbridge: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I'd like to direct everyone to the presentation on our Investor Relations website summarizing the key events from our quarterly results. As Jim mentioned, unless otherwise noted, all metrics and growth rates mentioned during today's call are on a pro forma basis and exclude the results of the Dialysis and BioSentry businesses that we divested in mid-June. Our revenue for the first quarter of FY '24 increased 5.7% year-over-year to $78 million, driven by continued strength in our Med Tech platforms. This is exclusive of approximately $700,000 of revenue from Dialysis and BioSentry in June. On an as-reported basis, revenue for the first quarter was $78.7 million. Med Tech revenue was $25.9 million, a 13.3% year-over-year increase, while Med Device revenue was $52.1 million, growing 2.3% compared to the first quarter of FY '23. For the first fiscal quarter, our Med Tech platforms comprised 33% of our total revenue compared to 31% of total revenue a year ago. Our Auryon platform contributed $11.1 million in revenue during the first quarter, growing 25.7% compared to last year. Mechanical thrombectomy revenue, which includes AngioVac and AlphaVac sales, declined 5.8% over the first quarter of FY '23. AlphaVac revenue for the first quarter was $1.8 million. AngioVac revenue was $6.3 million in the quarter, representing a decline of 7.7% over the prior year, but up sequentially from the fourth quarter and trending in the right direction. AngioVac continues to stabilize and rebound from the challenges we faced in Q2 and Q3 of fiscal '23, and we continue to take meaningful steps to address those challenges, including new sales leadership as well as a more robust sales training platform. Additionally, we recently received the Breakthrough Device Designation for the use of AngioVac in right heart and we believe this is an illustration of the distinct role that AngioVac can play in the VTE space. We remain confident that mechanical thrombectomy will be a significant contributor to our growth strategy, and we will continue to prioritize investments in this platform, including the new product introductions that Jim mentioned, as well as our clinical initiatives, such as the APEX PE study. NanoKnife disposable revenue during the quarter increased 34.5% year-over-year. Early in the quarter, we announced that enrollment in PRESERVE is now 100% complete. And as this data starts to be made public over the course of this year, we look forward to sharing it with you. In the first quarter, our Med Device segment grew 2.3% year-over-year, led by strength in our port products, angiographic, catheter products and microwave ablation business. At the end of our first quarter, our backlog stood at $3.3 million. Moving down to income statement. Our gross margin for the first quarter of FY '24 was 50.8%, a decrease of 20 basis points compared to the year ago period. For the first fiscal quarter, Med Tech gross margin was 64.7%, an increase of 150 basis points and Med Device gross margin was 43.9%, a decrease of 170 basis points each when compared to the first quarter of last year. Med Tech gross margins were positively impacted by sales mix, driven by our NanoKnife performance. Med Device gross margins were negatively impacted by raw material inflationary pressures and sales mix driven by growth in our international markets. As we've discussed, our strategic business model contemplates gross margin expansion as our high-margin Med Tech segment continues to become a larger portion of our overall revenue base. As mentioned last quarter, the next phase of our transformation is to address the scale and structural limitations of our operating footprint in a capital-efficient manner, which will reduce the impacts of many of the raw material and inflationary headwinds that we've seen recently. We look forward to continuing to update you on our plans and actions to drive margin enhancement in the short and medium term. Turning to R&D. Our research and development expense during the first quarter of FY '24 was $7.9 million or 10.1% of sales compared to $8.3 million or 11.2% of sales a year ago. Spending on clinical programs was 32% of total R&D spend during the first quarter of fiscal '24, compared to 26% during the first quarter of last year and 16% for the full fiscal year 2021. This mix shift within our R&D spending is well aligned with our long-term strategy to support increased physician adoption of our Med Tech platform technologies through the generation of data and clinical evidence. SG&A expense for the first quarter of FY '24 was $38.2 million, representing 49% of sales compared to $36.6 million or 49.6% of sales a year ago. Our adjusted net loss for the first quarter of FY '24 was $5.2 million or adjusted loss per share of $0.13 compared to an adjusted net loss of $6 million or adjusted loss per share of $0.15 in the first quarter of last year. During the first quarter of fiscal '24, we revised our annual equity grant practice for our non-employee directors, moving from granting shares with a one-year vesting term to granting immediately vested shares. The target grant value has not changed from the prior year. This change is reflected in adjusted loss per share for the quarter of $0.13, meaning that approximately $0.02 of the negative $0.13 was shifted into this fiscal quarter, instead of radically being included in our second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal '24. GAAP net income, as reported in our earnings release this morning included a gain on the sale of assets related to our Med Device segment in connection with the divestiture of our Dialysis and BioSentry businesses. As we mentioned last quarter, these businesses that were divested on June 8, 2023, subsequent to the company's fiscal year-end were accounted for as held for sale as of May 31, 2023. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment during the fiscal fourth quarter ended May 31, 2023. The impairment resulted in a loss of $14.5 million or $0.37 on a per share basis. Due to the timing of the transaction, the losses recorded in our fourth fiscal quarter of FY '23, with the offsetting gain on the sale of assets recorded as part of this quarter's results. The results of a large GAAP loss in the fourth quarter of FY '23 and a larger GAAP gain in the first quarter of FY '24. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of FY '24 was $0.4 million compared to negative EBITDA of $1.6 million in the first quarter of FY '23. In the first quarter of fiscal '24, we used $25.9 million in operating cash at capital expenditures of $0.8 million in addition to Auryon placement and evaluation units of $0.8 million. At August 31, 2023, we had $57.6 million in cash and cash equivalents compared to $44.6 million in cash and cash equivalents at May 31, 2023. So we continue to expect to finish the year with cash balances in the range of $65 million to $70 million, and we expect to be cash flow positive exiting FY '25, having utilized an aggregate of $10 million to $20 million of cash over a two-year period. Given the timing of Q1 payments and managing our working capital, Q1 exhibited the highest level of cash utilization we will see in FY '24. As has historically been the case, our first fiscal quarter is expected to have the highest utilization of cash during the fiscal year with cash balances building throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. We believe that we have more than sufficient cash to execute on our strategic initiatives as we move to generating positive cash flow towards the end of FY '25. Turning now to guidance. We continue to anticipate that FY '24 revenue will be in the range of $328 million to $333 million, and we expect full year adjusted loss per share to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.34. As a reminder, this compares to pro forma revenue and loss per share, excluding the recently divested assets of $306.3 million and a loss of $0.43, respectively for FY '23. We expect FY '24 gross margin to be in the range of 50% to 52% compared to pro forma FY '23 gross margin of 50.5%. We expect FY '24 Med Tech revenue growth in the range of 20% to 25% and Med Device revenue growth in the range of 1% to 3%. We expect Med Tech gross margins in the range of 63% to 65% and Med Device gross margins in the range of 43% to 45%. We're continuing to transition our company with a focus on delivering value to our global customers. We also understand that investors expect us to be a company that will grow at attractive rates, while improving profitability and cash generation. And we believe that our first quarter exhibits execution against those expectations. Finally, I'd like to thank our team here at AngioDynamics for their hard work and commitment, and we're looking forward to executing further on our strategy and delivering a strong fiscal year '24. With that, I'll turn it back to Jim.\nJim Clemmer: Thank you, Steve. And before we open up the call for questions, I'd like to say a few words. Like Steve and I, many of you have had the pleasure of knowing Matt Mishan, who sadly and unexpectedly passed away several weeks ago. Matt did an excellent job following our company for many years, and all of us here at AngioDynamics truly enjoyed working with him, both as an analyst and as a person. Matt will be missed, and we offer our condolences to his family and his key bank colleagues, particularly Brett. Now operator, could you please open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Jayson Bedford with Raymond James. Please proceed with your questions.\nJayson Bedford: Hi. Good morning, guys. Maybe just to start on the business. NanoKnife use is quite strong. I was wondering, if you could break out growth U.S. versus internationally. And internationally, are you seeing it mostly in prostate or are you seeing use in other areas?\nJim Clemmer: Hi, Jayson. Actually, we're seeing it in both. So we track different organs that we treat. There's been some -- the international team has had a head start and the U.S. team, they've done a great job of establishing relationships internationally with some really strong prostate physicians. And then, I'll refer back to the July call we had for Q4, we announced that NICE had upgraded our status in the U.K. So we think that also has a knock-on effect in other areas within Europe, Jayson. So we're going to continue to work with our clinicians and grow in Europe and U.S. Steve, do you have to break down.\nSteve Trowbridge: Yes. And then Jayson, we saw a strong growth in both geographies. So in the U.S., disposable growth was 28%. And in the international markets, our disposable growth for NanoKnife was about 44%. So we've seen really strong growth, both sides of the ocean.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. On mechanical thrombectomy, you seem to be stabilizing AngioVac. AlphaVac still seems like it's kind of stuck in first year. Can you just give us a little indication as to why growth should improve in AlphaVac? And I think you also alluded to a second-gen product and I apologize I may have missed the timing there.\nJim Clemmer: No, it's fine. Again, AngioVac, we're really confident in -- obviously, how the device works and what it does and gaining the breakthrough designation from the FDA is important because they've acknowledged an area of unmet need that we think AngioVac can fit, or work with them on the study design and get that communicated soon. Second, the AlphaVac, we love the product and the physician feedback is really strong. I was at PERT, two weeks ago talking to many, many physicians who have used it, want to try it. The trick for us, Jayson are two things: completing the APEX PE enrollment. You saw we announced today, we're 75% of the way there, which is actually a great time line being that there are two other good products already with a PE indication. And we're growing at the same pace. I think that the first one of those went out a couple of years ago, and they got their indication. We're really pleased in the -- take-up of the product. So we do -- and we did announce this morning, we have a couple of design enhancements that we'll launch next calendar year, Jayson. So you'll see those enhancements. So really, next year is really important for us. We'll have that PE indication, we believe, about mid-calendar year next year. We'll also have some design enhancements to the product. Anybody does, after you launch the first gen, just based on physician feedback to make it a little more intuitive and user-friendly, but we have full confidence that AlphaVac F18 will be a major player, not just PE, but other clot removal within the anatomy.\nJayson Bedford: And does the design enhancements require an additional filing?\nJim Clemmer: No. The simple enhancements, I think they've just done as a letter to file to our current design. Again, I'm answering it from my regulatory team, but I'm pretty sure that's the case, Jayson, we'll let you know.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. And then just lastly, and I'll let others jump in. On Auryon, strong, can you just give us an update in terms of the installed base? And I realize you don't get a lot of upfront for the capital, but is this -- the growth you're seeing, is it procedure driven or have you seen a bolus in placement or capital sale?\nSteve Trowbridge: Yeah. So in terms of placements, Jayson, the net new placements for this quarter were about 10% from where we were finished last year. But we have also, as we've talked about in the past, seen a lot of shifting of lasers from some of the lower volume users and moving into higher volume users. So as we talked last year, we were going to pair back a little bit on buying the new systems and the cash utilization that goes along with that, but we're going to focus on driving utilization, and that's what we've seen. So there's -- we finished the quarter with right around 415 total lasers in the field, that's about 10 new net from the end of the year, but then also a significant number of lasers that we've been shifting from maybe lower performing customers to finding some of those higher-performing customers.\nJayson Bedford: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Lichtman: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just wondering, if you could provide a little bit more detail on NanoKnife performance outside of the U.S. It sounds like that business has been a key performer in your international growth overall. Can you give us any visibility on what that could look like in the coming quarters and years? What are you seeing on the ground there and how sustainable is that?\nJim Clemmer: Hi, Steve. We think it's sustainable. That was a really strong number in Q1. I don't know if I expect that number throughout the course of the year. The team did a great job. But they're also training our partners network to get clinical support during cases and procedures. We're going to have our -- in Monte-Carlo at the end of this month, our fourth Clinical Symposium where our physicians presenting on their experiences and their data with NanoKnife and a lot of it is highly compelling. So we've got a lot of things happening. You also have a little knock-on effect here as well with our Solero growth. We think that Nano, as it gets more widely recognized as to how it works, the mechanism of action, we're getting doctors also utilizing our Solero at a higher rate. We've got some great competitors in the microwave (ph) space. We think our Solero is the most effective tool out there. We're seeing doctors also give that a try and adopt it, with I think, NanoKnife side by side. So a lot of good things are happening, Steve. It's going to grow stronger this year. I don't know if I expect the same growth rate during the next couple of quarters. But we're also working here in the U.S., as you know to wrap up the data collection on PRESERVE, which will be done next summer submit and then we hope to get that indication in the U.S. next year, but we just still see strong growth U.S. and internationally even prior to that.\nSteve Lichtman: Got it. Thanks. And then our Auryon small vessel DVT, you reiterated calendar year '25. You talk about some docs that are using it in the field. Can we expect any single-center data or is there anything you're getting a sense on that from your customer -- from some of those customers from in small vessel DVT?\nJim Clemmer: Steve, we're not sure if you'll see any data published by our customers prior to 2025. We hear anecdotes too where people try it in different areas are so confident in how it works. We're focused on our internal R&D process. And the research has shown, we're really, really excited about what it does. There's a good aspiration device on the market today that does a really good job in small vessel DVT. But we think the -- what Auryon does in addition to aspiration, the way our laser can disrupt and break up some of the clock, we found that our testing is really significant. So we're going to continue to focus on our internal testing, get the product ready for launch. In the meantime, doctors are always free to do their own research, but I wouldn't expect to see anything I don't believe, prior to our launch.\nSteve Lichtman: Okay. Got it. And then just lastly, as you're thinking about the Med Tech) business, how are you thinking about balancing the potential benefits of additional sales on top line gross margin versus, I think you mentioned again, Jim, some of the cash benefits that those products provide to the overall company. So should we be thinking about potential additional product line divestitures ahead, or just how are you thinking about balancing those two? Thanks.\nJim Clemmer: A couple of things, we've always talked about our role as an active portfolio manager as we grow our Med Tech businesses. But the Med Device segment does a terrific job in providing us that cash and stability to invest in the other side of the house. And we really love what the business does. We mentioned today, we highlighted our ports. Here we compete against a really great company. The number one company in that market is a strong, great company. Our ports are better. And our company is better, and our team is strong. So although, we're a small guy here, David versus Goliath, we're going to continue to win in categories like ports, our mid-line did really well as well [indiscernible] will always be a battle, and we know that. But it's a good business, Steve. We like the balance, it provides us today. Let's go back two years ago, when we first talked about our transformation into the Med Tech business that we want to be. Med Tech was only 15% of our revenue. Now you see it about a third of our revenue. So as that continues to grow, we'll be less reliant on the device cash and stability. But today, we still think it has a good mix over time that could change.\nSteve Lichtman: All right. Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of John Young with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Young: Hi, Jim, Steve. Thanks for taking our questions this morning. First for us just on Med Tech gross margin. It was a great number to see. I know you guide to 65% on the high end of the fiscal guidance for the year from Med Tech specifically, but it feels a bit conservative. Can you just talk about the puts and takes here on the gross margin for Med Tech? Thanks.\nSteve Trowbridge: Yeah. So John, as we've talked about, right, the overall gross margin kind of long-term strategy for Angio is that you're going to see gross margin accretion coming from this mix shift as we have the Med Tech products comprised a larger portion of our overall revenue base. We've seen that, but we've seen it at the corporate level be chewed up a little bit by some of those inflationary pressures that we've talked about. So on the Med Tech side specifically, increased sales in NanoKnife as we've stabilized, as Jayson talked about, the mechanical thrombectomy business, those are both going to be pretty good tailwinds for us on the gross margin. And then you've also seen, as we've talked about pulling back a little bit on brand-new lasers being put in the field and trying to increase utilization with those lasers on the Auryon business. All of those things are going to be supportive of that continued shift with the Med Tech business kind of driving that shift over overall gross margins.\nJohn Young: Great. Thanks. And then on APEX too, getting enrollment now, I saw on the slide, it's now guided for complete by early calendar '24. It feels like a bit of a push there. Have the other ongoing PE studies in the space impacted the ability to get patients enrolled?\nJim Clemmer: Hi, John. It's Jim. No, I don't think so. I think if you take a look at when we started enrollment and to when we think we finish enrollment, it's about an 18-month window, we believe, from start to finish. I think if you go back and look at the market leader, I think, is what they took a few years ago when there's nothing else in the field. So we were a little cautious coming out knowing that we'd be third in behind the other two players there. We thought it might be a little challenging. And it probably was initially, I think there's a lot of momentum building in the product and physicians, their peers that use it, talk about great outcomes and shared some great outcomes along the way. So I think the momentous building, John, we're really pleased with the schedule. It fits what we internally had projected, and we can't wait to get on label next year, but we'll do the work to finish it right now. Your question is a good one because it is a space now, we'll be third in. And it probably will be harder for others. I can't speculate for them, but we have a unique novel device we're bringing into that space with two other good products there. So we think we'll really get people in choice.\nJohn Young: Great. Thanks, Jim. And maybe just my last one I just sneak it in. Just on the strategy on capital allocation. Just thoughts on stock buyback given the strength of the balance sheet and current stock price? Thanks.\nJim Clemmer: Yeah. Steve and I talk about that a lot, and we have conversations with our Board. I think today, given that the external market kind of disruptions and where things have gone, we want our investors to say, hey, we have a strong balance sheet. They want to take a time out for a second. Steve has given you guidance as to where we think our cash utilization will be this year. And if people look back a year ago after Q1, Steve gave the same guidance, we really hit that by the end of the year. So we're really -- we think we're in a good position to utilize the cash we have. We do have a good strong balance sheet with cash. We'll always talk about the investments that we're looking at. And I'm sure at some point, it will be a good conversation around a buyback. We believe there's a disconnect in our value today, a strong disconnect. We'll take a look at that, but we also want to share with investors who want to ensure that we have a stable balance sheet for a while. We get their view as well.\nJohn Young: Thanks.\nJim Clemmer: Thanks, John.\nOperator: I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Clemmer for any closing remarks. Mr. Clemmer?\nJim Clemmer: Thank you, operator, and thanks again to all of our AngioDynamics employees. We are on a transformation here, changing our company to one that is highly differentiated by our science and technology and provides meaningful outcomes in patient wellness when our products are utilized. Thanks again, there are tremendous employees who enabled this to occur every day. I look forward to speaking with you at the end of our Q2. Thank you.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation."
