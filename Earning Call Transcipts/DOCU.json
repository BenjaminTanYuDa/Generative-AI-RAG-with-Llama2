At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Investor Relations section of the website following the call. [Operator Instructions] I will now pass the call over to Roger Martin, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead.\nRoger Martin: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to DocuSign's Q4 and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. I'm Roger Martin, DocuSign's Vice President of Finance. Joining me on today's call are DocuSign's CEO, Allan Thygesen and our CFO, Blake Grayson. The press release announcing our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 results was issued earlier today and is posted on our Investor Relations website. Before we begin, let me remind everyone that some of our statements on today's call are forward-looking. We believe our assumptions and expectations related to these forward-looking statements are reasonable, but they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different. In particular, our expectations regarding the pace of product innovation and factors affecting customer demand are based on our best estimates at this time and are therefore subject to change. Please read and consider the risk factors in our filings with the SEC, together with the content of this call. Any forward-looking statements are based on our assumptions and expectations to date, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these statements in light of future events or new information. During this call, we will present GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, we provide non-GAAP weighted average share count and information regarding free cash flows and billings. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage you to consider all measures when analyzing our performance. For information regarding our non-GAAP financial information, the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a quantitative reconciliation of these figures, please refer to today's earnings press release which can be found on our website at investor.docusign.com. I'd now like to turn the call over to Allan. Allan?\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Roger, and good afternoon, everyone. DocuSign's fourth quarter operating results reflect strong progress across the three pillars of our strategic vision, accelerating product innovation, improving the reach and effectiveness of our omnichannel go-to-market initiatives and strengthening operating and financial efficiency. Before discussing the pillars, I'll briefly highlight Q4's strong business results. Q4 revenue was $712 million, up 8% year-over-year, while full year revenue was $2.8 billion, up 10% year-over-year, both outperformed our expectations. Our continued focus on efficiency while still investing for long-term growth, drove significantly improved profitability. Q4 non-GAAP operating margin rose to 25%, up one point versus last year, while full year non-GAAP operating margin improved by more than five points to 26% from 21% in fiscal '23. In addition, free cash flow more than doubled in fiscal '24 to nearly $900 million. Similar to Q3, we're encouraged by momentum across the business. From solid retention and improving usage with existing customers to strong new customer growth, organizations, large and small, continue to invest in DocuSign's value proposition. Let's turn to our strategic pillars, starting with continued improvement in our omnichannel go-to-market initiatives. In Q4, we were encouraged by improving performance with customers managed by the direct sales force. We substantially increased the amount of business from customers signing and renewing multiyear, multimillion dollar contracts with DocuSign, including Fortune 500 global leaders in energy, industrials, consumer goods, insurance and several federal and state government agencies. Our partner channel has been instrumental in driving large customer momentum. We continue to deepen relationships with strategic, enterprise-focused organizations, including SAP, Microsoft and Deloitte. These organizations are helping to accelerate our customers' digital transformation journeys. They also represent progress in building a vibrant partner ecosystem to extend DocuSign's reach into new markets and customer segments. To that end, we recently launched global participation in Microsoft Azure's marketplace. We can now co-sell our entire suite of products to Microsoft's enterprise customers who can draw on their existing Azure commitments to purchase DocuSign licenses. We're encouraged to already have our first $1 million customer from that channel. These partners and many more help us accelerate our customers' digital transformation journeys. We also continue to deliver more efficient customer growth even as we scale. In fiscal '24, we invested to improve our digital and self-serve motions, leading to sustained new customer acquisition growth. In Q4, we surpassed 1.5 million total customers across our digital and direct channels. Our breadth, scale and customer affinity is unique in the broader SaaS landscape and speaks to the continued large opportunity in front of DocuSign. Across our digital direct and partner channels, international continues to be a strong underlying growth driver. In Q4, international revenue grew more than twice as fast as total revenue and now represents more than 27% of the business, up from 25% last year. The international opportunity remains substantial and is one of our key long-term growth drivers. CRESOL, which is a financial cooperative in Brazil, recently adopted the new WhatsApp integration, adding WhatsApp signing to existing e-signature e-mail usage has reduced delays, increased response times and help CRESOL generate more revenue and broaden its reach. Much of CRESOL's credit business is with farmers and the agricultural industry with limited rule connectivity. The DocuSign WhatsApp integration allows CRESOL to bridge that connectivity gap and accelerate its credit process from days to hours. Let's turn to product innovation. Across all aspects of go-to-market, product investment is driving customer adoption. The WhatsApp integration I just mentioned led to significant envelope usage in recent customer wins in Latin America. Over 1,000 customers in UK and Europe have used and now benefit from stronger identity verification products like AI-enabled IDV Premier and our recently launched QES-compliant Identity Wallet. The recent free launch of our premium DocuSign monitor created 1,500 new accounts just this quarter. First Financial Bank, a financial services company headquartered in Indiana is using ID verification, increase the speed of consumer lending and home equity line of credit offerings. This improved security for bank staff removes manual workflows for underwriters and creates a stronger customer experience. First Financial is expanding ID verification to other use cases like credit cards and online account openings. Looking ahead, as we exited Q4, we have several hundred customers in beta in new platform services that will transform DocuSign into a more powerful solution. We'll have much more to share, and we're excited to have you join us virtually to hear about our evolving platform at this year's Momentum Customer Conference in New York on April 11th. Product momentum is clearly creating value for our customers. In fiscal '24, that momentum was validated by third parties like IDC, who named us the e-signature industry leader versus 17 other vendors in its annual worldwide assessment. Also, Gartner named DocuSign as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for contract life cycle management for the fourth year running. To that end, DocuSign CLM customers continue to be at the front line of embracing a broader agreement management use case. In Q4, DocuSign CLM growth once again significantly outpaced overall revenue. This is a positive sign as we see CLM product demand as a precursor to the value we can create across all 1.5 million DocuSign customers. Today, DocuSign CLM helps users automate and manage complex workflows, and we see the future is taking those capabilities to a broader set of users than CLM reaches today. We're seeing strong adoption of our CLM product among enterprise customers. Just this quarter, a luxury automaker used our CLM to create an elegant sales experience to match its brand value proposition. A multibillion dollar global manufacturers sped up its legal and supply chain operations with a company-wide implementation of DocuSign CLM. And a global energy company accelerated its sales processes and streamlined procurement with CLM. Our third strategic pillar is strengthening DocuSign's operating and financial efficiency. In February, we announced further cost management initiatives, including a reduction in force. This decision streamlined our business and focused investments on initiatives that provide the strongest foundation for long-term growth. Blake will share more details on the financial impact and its impact on improving profitability. In fiscal 2025, we will continue focusing on efficiency while investing to reinvigorate long-term growth. In conclusion, fiscal '24 was critical to strengthening DocuSign's foundation. We've reaccelerated product innovation, invested in our leadership talent and rightsized our organization. These are all critical steps to realize the multiyear journey to transform agreement management. And we're just getting started. The opportunity in front of DocuSign remains massive. Today's world runs on agreements, but agreement processes haven't changed in the last 100 years. Even with the evolution to digital documents, agreements and how we use their insights remain relics of antiquated paper-based systems. Sign a document stored as a flat file preserved, but disconnected from the systems that run your operations. Our sole focus is transforming those systems for our 1.5 million existing customers to make agreements more valuable for enterprises and SMBs alike. As organizations transition to a digital world, customers turn to DocuSign as the world's most trusted agreement company. We are excited for fiscal '25 and the continued impact we will have on our customers. Thank you to our incredible team for your passion and dedication to our vision and culture. With that, let me turn it over to Blake.\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Allan, and good afternoon, everyone. Throughout fiscal 2024, we continue to build a solid foundation on the three pillars of our strategic vision, accelerating product innovation, enhancing our omnichannel go-to-market initiatives and strengthening our operating and financial efficiency. As a result, in Q4, we delivered strong operating and financial results. Q4's financial performance exceeded the high end of guidance across every metric, with material improvements in operating income, operating margin and free cash flow. Total revenue in Q4 increased 8% year-over-year to $712 million, and subscription revenue also grew 8% year-over-year to $696 million. Billings of $833 million grew 13% year-over-year, accelerating from 5% year-over-year in Q3. Q4 represented our highest year-over-year billings growth performance in over a year. With respect to billings, approximately half of the eight point acceleration versus Q3 came from solid execution around renewals, especially with large customers. This includes spillovers from the prior quarter and better early renewal strength from contracts that would have otherwise been billed in fiscal year '25. The remaining half came from a strong close to Q4 and net new growth, which will support the business in future quarters. Similar to Q3 results, we are encouraged by continuing signs of stabilization in the business. First, customer usage continues to improve. Total envelope cent increased moderately year-over-year. Similar to last quarter, we saw improving year-over-year usage trends in key verticals with technology, insurance, business services, financial services and health care, all growing faster than the total business baseline. Also, consumption with direct customers, our contract utilization measure increased slightly year-over-year. Second, customer retention is stable with positive large customer momentum. Gross retention was flat year-over-year in Q4 across the direct book of business. As expected, dollar net retention trended downward in Q4 to 98%, and we're encouraged that the pace of year-over-year decline slowed substantially in fiscal year '24 versus fiscal year '23. We anticipate the moderating trend to continue in fiscal year '25, and we expect dollar net retention to be flat to down slightly in Q1 '25. While overall net new expansion continues to be impacted by software optimization and macro-related customer purchasing cost and we are encouraged by large customer spending behavior. The number of customers spending over $300,000 annually rose to 1,060 in Q4, increasing sequentially for the second quarter in a row. Also, Q4 bookings for customers with total contract value over $1 million increased by more than 50% year-over-year. Third, new customer acquisition volume remained strong in Q4, partly due to improvement in go-to-market initiatives. DocuSign ended the year with over 1.5 million customers, up 11% year-over-year and consistent with growth in Q3. Direct customers grew 15% year-over-year also consistent with Q3, bringing total direct customers to 242,000. International revenue, a key long-term growth driver, grew at more than double the overall revenue growth rate and is now 27% of total revenue. We believe the international growth opportunity remains large. Also, the scale and breadth of our customer base is unique across the software landscape and an asset we can leverage as we expand our product offerings in the future. Turning to our financials. Operating and financial efficiency initiatives drove strong performance in fiscal year '24. Improved execution led to a significant expansion in operating margin and a more than doubling of free cash flow versus fiscal year '23. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 82.5%, in line with the prior year. Fourth quarter non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 85%, also in line with the prior year. For the full year, non-GAAP gross margin was 83%, up slightly from last year. Q4 non-GAAP operating income was $178 million, up 15% year-over-year with an operating margin of 25%, improving over 100 basis points year-over-year. We saw a more significant improvement in fiscal year '24, with a record non-GAAP operating income of $711 million, up 38% year-over-year, resulting in a 26% operating margin. This is a substantial increase of over 500 basis points versus 21% in fiscal year '23. We will continue to focus on realizing opportunities to achieve greater efficiency as we invest to drive sustainable long-term growth. Free cash flow improvement was even stronger in Q4 and fiscal year '24. In Q4, free cash flow was $249 million. And for the full year, we generated $887 million in free cash flow, with both periods more than doubling year-over-year, resulting in a 32% free cash flow margin for fiscal year '24. Greater operating efficiency led to a substantial working capital improvement that drove free cash flow yield above our operating profit margin. Going forward, we anticipate free cash flow margin to more closely approximate non-GAAP operating margin. In fiscal year '24, we used a portion of free cash flow to purchase DocuSign shares. We used $146 million towards repurchasing common stock. In addition, we used $144 million to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the dilutive impact of our equity programs. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for Q4 was $0.76, an $0.11 per share improvement from $0.65 last year. Non-GAAP diluted EPS for fiscal year '24 was $2.98 per share, a $0.95 improvement from $2.03 per share last year. Fiscal year '24 also represented DocuSign's first full year of producing positive GAAP net income. For the full year, GAAP diluted EPS was $0.36 versus negative $0.49 in the prior year. Going forward, we expect continued improvements in GAAP net income and per share profitability as we work to manage the dilution and cost of our equity programs. We currently expect stock-based compensation to be approximately flat year-over-year in fiscal year '25 and expect SBC as a percentage of revenue to decline year-over-year. We ended Q4 with 6,840 employees, a 7% decrease year-over-year from 7,336 at the end of fiscal year '23. This results from our ongoing focus on investing efficiently in the business and does not reflect the reduction in force announced on February 6th of this year. We will continue to optimize our hiring plans to align our sales organization with our digital and partner GTM motions, support long-term growth opportunities in R&D and realize efficiencies of scale and G&A. With regard to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we used approximately $690 million of cash to settle our remaining outstanding convertible debt. We currently have no debt on the balance sheet. At the end of fiscal year '24, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. This strong financial foundation, including a business model that generates significant free cash flow, supports its future investment and increases our ability to opportunistically return excess capital to shareholders. With that, let me turn to guidance. For Q1 '25 and fiscal year '25, we expect total revenue of $704 million to $708 million in Q1, or a 7% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. For fiscal year '25, we expect revenue between $2.915 billion to $2.927 billion, or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $686 million to $690 million in Q1, or an 8% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. And $2.843 billion to $2.855 billion for fiscal '25, or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. For billings, we expect $685 million to $695 million. And $2.970 to $3.024 billion for fiscal '25. As continually shown in recent quarters and years, billings are heavily impacted by the timing of customer renewals, which can create meaningful variability from period to period. This impacts year-over-year comparisons and is further amplified by the scale of our book of business. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q1 and fiscal '25. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 27% to 28% for Q1, and 26.5% to 28% for fiscal '25. Our non-GAAP operating margin guidance includes the impact from the recently announced restructuring of approximately 400 employees or around 6% of our employee base. While we intend to reinvest a small portion of the restructuring savings into the business, primarily in R&D, the vast majority of savings will drop to the bottom line as reflected in our expected operating margin expansion in fiscal year '25. We are committed to improving efficiency while still investing in the areas we believe will drive long-term growth. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 208 million to 213 million for both Q1 and fiscal '25. In closing, we're pleased to report another quarter of progress against our three strategic pillars, accelerating product innovation, enhancing our go-to-market initiatives and strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. Q4 execution was particularly strong as the team delivered accelerating billings growth, double-digit customer growth, with improving operating margins and record free cash flow generation. While we still have work ahead to reaccelerate our top line growth, I'm proud of this team for its focus on execution as we continue to be the default trusted partner for customers around agreement management. We have over 1.5 million customers, ranging from the largest enterprises in the world to wide-scale adoption by the small and medium-sized businesses that power the global economy. That scale gives us the opportunity to help customers accelerate their business growth, mitigate risk and enable delightful customer experiences. I'm excited about the opportunity ahead of us and look forward to sharing our progress along the way. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. A couple for Blake, just to kick things off. So Blake, I appreciate the comments on kind of unpacking the Q4 billings outperformance. Obviously, the nine point beat versus the guide was pretty impressive. As I think about the moving pieces on that, could you just help frame the Q1 guide relative to the full year guide on billings. I think the full year would imply you need to grow a little bit faster than you're guiding to on billings in Q1. So curious if some of that's related to the pull forward? And then secondly, how should we think about NRR trends? I think that dipped below 100% at 98%. So as you just think about the drivers between expansions and new business for next year, just help us understand the trajectory of that and how that all fits into the guide. Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. And thanks for the question. So to address the question on billings, I think it's helpful to kind of cover it in totality. So starting with Q4 and then going into 2025, because the timing does play a big role as you think about the year-over-year comps. So just to recap quickly, Q4, really pleased with the execution and the acceleration from Q3. And like you heard in the prepared remarks, half of that acceleration was from renewals timing, and that includes early renewals from fiscal year '25. In Q4, our book of renewals have the highest contribution from early renewals for any quarter that we've seen all year long, and that's okay because that's great execution by the team, like we're super happy about that. And then the other half was just from strong net new growth. We had a great close to Q4. And so that was a nice job again by the team there. Now that timing component impacts fiscal '25. So with respect to Q1, and this also applies to Q2, there's -- we've got two hard comps to deal with -- address in this first half of this year. The first is, if you recall, we had really strong on-time renewals in the first half of 2024, that came about because we made some adjustments to our sales incentive plans to improve execution there, and we did, and we did a really good job with it, when you go back and look at our billings performance in the first half of last year or 2024. And then the other hard comp is that Q4 component that I just mentioned that leads to some less spillover into Q1. And so those two hard comps apply, obviously, to the full year as well. So you've got to kind of normalize for that a bit. And so just to give some direction too, as you think about that on a quarterly basis, and you mentioned this about how the full year is a little bit higher than the midpoint guide versus Q1. I expect to see Q2 to decel a bit from Q1, but then reaccelerate into the second half of the year. And again, we got those hard comps that we're dealing with in the first half of this year and then you see that reacceleration. And then you just use your -- that fiscal '25 guide with regards to the magnitude of the quarters. Overall, I'm really pleased with the fiscal '25 billings guide. It's almost exactly $3 billion at the midpoint. But the timing of these renewals makes the year-over-year comps pretty noisy. And so one way that you might think about -- how to think about or try to normalize it is like on a two-year stack view, to normalize for some of those period-over-period components, to kind of normalize for those effects. But I hope that helps just kind of how you think about billings for Q4 and then relative to the full year. And then to your dollar net retention question, we did trend down as we expected, in line with our expectations into Q4. There's still a tough macro environment out there for us where companies are scrutinizing investments, and it just leads to smaller expansion opportunities. Now that said, however, I am quite encouraged by the pace of decline in fiscal '24. It slowed substantially versus fiscal '23. And we're now expecting that the pace of decline is going to slow even further into fiscal '25. And you heard in the prepared remarks, we're actually forecasting for Q1 dollar net retention rate to be flat to down slightly from Q4. And part of that is related to the fact that we're coming out of these COVID comps from prior quarters. And you've heard me talk about how the share of our book of business that was written during kind of the pandemic period is really de minimis now. And so I think that's also one of the things where you can see this flattening out. And again, there's a number of encouraging signs for us around renewal rates and consumption. And then we've got, hopefully, these new product launches releasing into general availability later in the year. And over the long-term, we're excited about our ability to impact that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with your question\nJake Roberge: Hey, thanks for taking the question and congrats on the great results. Blake, just a follow-up on that DNR remark. Can you help us understand how much of the downtick in that metric was driven by those remaining COVID era contracts that you just called out in your last answer. And then, Allan, it looks like you actually reaccelerated new customer adds this quarter. Do you feel like the 40,000 quarterly adds is the right way to think about the business moving forward? Or could that actually continue to ramp as the macro normalizes, and some of those new product-led growth initiatives take hold?\nBlake Grayson: I'll just take a stab at the DNR follow-up and then Allan take the other one. But we're not breaking out the level of detail and granularity in the DNR from COVID. I think it's just an obvious output where we have some pretty strong expansion in those prior quarters. But that said, we are seeing signs of stabilization in the business. And so it's, I would say, it's definitely not all related to COVID. I don't want to have anybody walk away with that kind of thought process or perspective. But I think it's one of these things that we are seeing stabilizing signs on our business. And we think we have means and mechanisms that we're going to continue to pursue, where we can work to flatten that out that curve and then hopefully improve it over time. But, Allan, on accounts?\nAllan Thygesen: On the second question related to customer acquisition. Yes, I don't know that we track and measure ourselves that directly on that. But I would just say we have a healthy customer acquisition funnel. It is -- there is still white space, particularly internationally and acquiring new customers and we're benefiting from that and I think getting our fair share, although, of course, I always like even more. But I'm not prepared to make any forward-looking statements about the exact number of acquisitions we'll have on a quarterly basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Baer: Great. Thanks for the question. I want to shift over to margins and profitability. Allan, a question for you. If you could just talk a little bit about the change in investment philosophy from the top. And Blake just wondering the comments around commitment to improving efficiency, does that translate to continued margin expansion even after FY'25 as we think about 2026 and beyond?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So first on our overall investment and expense philosophy. Look, we want to balance solid operational execution and efficiency today with being able to invest for the medium to long-term growth that we think we have in front of us. And so we're balancing that all the time, as we looked at taking the action that Blake referred to at the beginning of February, we felt we had a little more room to get just a little leaner and be ready and still not impair our ability to grow as we launch new products and so on. So that's the balance that we're taking. We will keep looking for opportunities, and it's obviously not all about headcount. We have gotten tremendous efficiency out of the organization on many fronts, that's what produced the strong results that you saw in Q4, really, throughout the year, and the operating cash flow improvements. So we'll keep looking for those opportunities. But we feel we're rightsized for our plan right now. And if we start seeing further investment opportunities, then we will invest, but we do that on a cautious and informed basis.\nBlake Grayson: And then just a follow-up on your question on just margins in the future. I just want to point out that I'm really proud of this team for the efficiencies that we've gained this year. I mean, just specifically, in fiscal '23, our sales and marketing expense was 40% of our revenue. In this year, fiscal '24, it improved to 34%. I expect next year to be in the low 30s. And that's not an easy kind of process to go through. But it's important, and I'm really proud of the focus of the team to address those gains. I think for us in the future, and the future, what I'm talking about is let's talk about long term here now without a time line on it, is that we have opportunities to be able to drive further operating leverage with scaling growth. It's that -- can we grow our revenue faster than we do our expense base? And that's partly what we're building here. And one of the things we're focusing pretty hard on as a team is you hear about PLG motions, and self-service motions and things like that. And I think over the long-term, those opportunities do provide us the opportunity to get better margins into the future, but no specific time line or anything around that.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, that's great. And maybe just as a reminder to the point that they just made about our sales marketing efficiency. The reduction force that we had last February was 95% focused in the sales marketing area. This time around, it was a little bit more balanced, but still were weighted in sales and marketing, reflecting that we felt we had efficiency opportunities throughout the company, and we wanted to make sure we capture those. I think at this point, to the extent we make incremental investments, it will probably be in R&D first. But obviously, as we launch new products, and if -- that we start seeing some leverage there, then we'll not hesitate to invest there as well. Just want to see that first.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLuv Sodha: Thank you, Blake and Allan for taking my questions. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Wanted to maybe ask first to Allan, if you could just tease out like how much -- it sounds like most of the improvement this quarter was because of better execution versus more macro normalizing. Could you just tease that out and which verticals sort of drove the improvement that you saw. And then Blake, it sounds like free cash flow was really strong this quarter. I guess just talk a little bit more about how you're planning to use that free cash flow specifically for share repurchases.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So I'll go first. We really did see strength across the board. So our cost segments, Blake highlighted that we had progress both on the enterprise side and the SMB side. From a geography perspective, yes, we grew faster internationally, but we did grow everywhere. And on the industry side, we did see a broad-based strength there as well some recovery effects, those mortgages, but we sell to customers in all industries. I highlighted during the full, new significant deals with in manufacturing, in energy and health and so on. There's hardly an industry that doesn't rely on agreements and that therefore, it doesn't represent an opportunity for us. So there really isn't much there. At an overall macro sentiment, I would say, marginally improved from my standpoint. We're not projecting anything more than that looking ahead. As always, we base our plan on current macro conditions. But I think there was a little bit of help across the breadth of our business, but we're almost an index just given the breadth of verticals, segments and countries that we have.\nBlake Grayson: And then to follow up on the second question about free cash flow and how we utilize it. We're in a great spot. We ended the quarter of the year with cash and investments of $1.2 billion. No debt now on the balance sheet. This last -- and also, obviously, we have a foundational business now that generates considerable amount of free cash flow, we use some of that deployed some of that this year for -- like you talked about stock buybacks, but we also use it to retire debt. There's obviously M&A opportunities for us. And we're likely more active than you think we are about looking around what opportunities are available for us. And then there's -- we can invest in the business or you have options for dividends, things like that down the road. I would say that with that kind of stabilizing results and the operating efficiency improvements we feel we can increase our ability to opportunistically return capital to shareholders while still investing in the business. And it's just -- we're committed to increasing the rate with which we return excess capital opportunistically to shareholders, and we'll see how that develops out over the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rishi Jaluria with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Fountain: Hi. This is Chris Fountain on for Rishi Jaluria. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to first ask about the large customer cohort strength that you saw in the quarter. Is that like better volume and consumption trends? Or is CLM capabilities kind of starting to push some customers over that $300,000 ACV cohort. And then also, I was wondering if you could just dig in a little bit more to the R&D investment priorities you mentioned for the coming year? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson: I'll take the --\nAllan Thygesen: You take the first one and I'll take the other one.\nBlake Grayson: So, yes, I would say definitely saw improvement in enterprise customers, again, the $300,000 accounts growing sequentially quarter-over-quarter. I'll say that from a renewal rate perspective, enterprise still has room to improve. But I will say that our renewal rates improved sequentially Q3 to Q4 in the enterprise space, more than any other kind of large customer segment that we had, but still room to improve there admittedly. And so we're excited about the opportunities and mostly in R&D, right, that give us those opportunities to provide additional solutions and products to customers. Then I'll let Allan.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. On the R&D investment front, I'd say we've long felt there was an opportunity to reimagine the agreement journey for companies large and small. And we've add solutions for -- at various stages of that journey in the past, obviously, most exemplified by our signature products. In about a month, we will release a broader suite of solutions there, and that there's been a significant investment in that effort during the course of the last fiscal year. And that will continue because we feel we have a multiyear road map of value creation ahead of us there. So that is the biggest investment area. In addition to that, one other area that's getting a meaningful amount of investment is we are moving our platforms to the public cloud, Microsoft Azure, it's underway, and that's a significant effort as well from an infrastructure perspective. Those are the two things I'd highlight.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nAdam Bergere: Hey, this is Adam Bergere on for Brad. I guess I'd like to start, what are some of the initiatives you are making in terms of like the product-led growth or self-serve missions? And what changes have you made so far there? And what changes do you still want to make?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Let me take that one. So I think during the course of the fiscal year that we just finished here, a lot of our effort was on making the process of buying DocuSign directly from DocuSign, and on our website and in our products much more seamless. And we made substantial improvements there. So much better flows to allow you to easily upgrade solutions to focus on -- put better use of a variety of payment solutions, et cetera. I'd say this year, that will expand beyond the core e-signature products to some of the newer products that we'll be launching and to supporting other channels. Those notably our direct sales channel, we want to offer those customers the ability to self-serve to the greatest extent possible and there will be significant capabilities added there throughout the year. And also for our partners where we have I think, opportunities for meaningful improvement and how easy it is to do business with us. And that's another area we're investing in. So this is across every pillar of our go-to-market effort that has already borne fruit, as you've seen in our digital sales growth, and it will really impact across the business, I think, this year. So very excited about that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Walravens with Citizens JMP. Please proceed with your question.\nAustin Cole: Hey, thanks for taking my question. This is Austin Cole on for Pat. So last quarter, it seemed like you mentioned that there was kind of an uptick in interest in CLM, and now you're seeing strong adoption of CLM among enterprise customers. Is there kind of an incremental improvement in tone there? Or can you just talk broadly about just the CLM opportunity and how you guys are situated? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So I do think the CLM market overall is improving. And I do think we're executing better in the CLM market. So I think CLM overall, I think more and more companies are realizing that managing your agreements better and getting more value out of them is a very strategic opportunity. It's definitely rising in the priority list. And so CLM, ours and others, is an increasingly strategic and interesting solution. So we're seeing more RFPs and so on. In terms of our competitive position, I think we're in a very strong position as illustrated in the Gartner survey and other measures of our position in the market. I think we are -- we have the largest number of accounts and are very well rated by customers for our experience. And we think there's more opportunity there to, should we say, popularize CLM to a broader audience, both within companies that are -- who are going to adopt it, as well as to smaller companies where the weight of the current solutions might not be appropriate. So it's a very positive and strategic opportunity for us. And yes, I do would summarize that to say on both fronts, some improvement.\nBlake Grayson: Yes. And just a follow-up and maybe to add on to what Allan said. You heard in our prepared remarks, CLM grew faster than the total business and also accelerated from -- on a year-over-year basis from Q3 to Q4. Obviously, it's still a smaller share of our business, but still encouraged by that acceleration for that product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Scott Berg with Needham. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Morelli: This is Rob Morelli on for Scott. Thanks for taking my question. Helping [Technical Difficulty] for margin here with non-GAAP operating margins expanding 500 basis points. However, G&A was actually up as a percentage of revenue. Two questions here. First, why were we not able to drive leverage here throughout the year? And then second, how do we think about spend in 2025 in this line of events? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Let me take a stab at that. So, yes, G&A expense, non-GAAP G&A was up 14% year-on-year. There's two unique items that are kind of contributing to that. One is, we used to have an immaterial dollar amount, so when you look at a relatively small kind of SEC split out bucket, it has a bit of an effect. So a couple of million dollars, we used to allocate out in the prior year. We're not doing that now, but it's an immaterial kind of dollar amount overall. And then also a little bit higher litigation cost for us this year versus last year. If you exclude those two, what I'll call, unique items, G&A would have grown in the low single-digits year-over-year. So what I would say is from the efforts we've taken over the past few months and recently not only do I expect that sales and marketing expense declined year-on-year as a percentage of revenue, but I also expect to see some efficiencies and improvements in G&A as well. So I think we're focused across this business to drive efficiencies where needed, and I expect to see that next year.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. Allan, maybe you could dig in a little bit deeper on the international strength you're seeing. How much of that is being partner-led? What are you seeing from your digital initiatives there? And maybe give us some color on the regional breakdown.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Our international growth is led more by our direct channel today. I think we have very substantial opportunity on the digital front and on the partner side, which is relatively mature right now. I think there's a lot of headroom. So lots of growth opportunity there, but most of the growth today is coming from our direct sales efforts, principally in the larger focused countries. So the top 10 markets outside the US that you would expect. As you know, we've been investing in Japan and Germany. But today, UK, Australia, Canada, France are a little larger than both of those. So all of those markets are priorities.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Owens: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one around your LLM training. I know there was some stuff in the media just regarding privacy. Kind of curious, from your perspective, what are internal policies? And how are you training those LLMs? Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I'll take that one. Yes, I want to be very clear. We do not use any customer data for training any of our AI models without specific contractual consent from customers. End of story. So we have a high trust position with customers. They trust us with their most sensitive documents. And we don't want to do anything to violate that trust. There are probably some companies who -- people are willing to move aggressively here, but I think we're moving responsibly and cautiously on that. We are, with all that said, we are very excited about what AI can bring, and our customers are asking us for how can we extract more value from our [indiscernible] using more modern AI technology. And so you'll hear a lot more about that in a month at momentum. But to the point about -- the trust is the starting position. Maybe one other point I'd make is, assuming you give us consent, we then anonymize and aggregate that data so that there is no opportunity for anyone to extract any confidential issues or data out of the agreements.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much and congrats on a nice finish to the year. Thinking back to last quarter, you had mentioned the introduction of some new enterprise licensing structures, and there was some comparison, I believe, to ELAs. Wondering if you can shed a bit more light on any changes made there. And when they were implemented? And Blake, did it have any effect on Q4 financial results? For instance, would it change any of the ratios between bookings and billings and recognized revenues or any type of impact to think about from those changes going forward?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, we have done a few deals like that, and I think it will continue to grow with some of our very largest clients. And as we offer a broader set of products, obviously, an enterprise license also becomes more interesting as you can mix and match across products. But it still remains a very small part of the business. We even some of our very largest customers, some of the contract renewals remain on an envelope basis.\nBlake Grayson: Yes. And just to add on top of that, it's -- while we're super excited about the opportunity in very specific cases to consider those, it's not a huge number for us today, it grows. It's continuing to grow. And again, I think, and to directly answer your question, no material impact on our results for Q4. But it's also one of these things, I think, in this business, we have a very, very broad and diverse customer base. And so there's -- we don't have single customers that, I would say, vastly impact us like there might be other companies, which, I think is a strength for us. And so -- but anyways, just to directly answer your question, no material impact.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I would make one other point. ELA has a very specific connotation of sort of unlimited consumption and being able to combine products across. We have leaned in significantly harder to make sure that we are competitive in large enterprise deals. And we did some very large and very nice renewals with some large customers. I think in part as a result of that improved motion. So we have senior people on it. We have our large deal desk. We have all the things that you would expect to make sure that we are as competitive as possible.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Berg: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Michael Berg on for Michael Turrin. I just wanted to touch on free cash flow. You had a very strong free cash flow generating quarter and year. Maybe you could just shed some light on what drove that? Was it some of the renewal timing you discussed on your -- in terms of billings on the quarter? And how can we think about the relationship between operating margin and free cash flow moving forward? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. And so yes, we did have a very strong quarter and year as it regards to free cash flow, we had a 32% free cash flow yield for fiscal '24. And the reason why it's materially higher than our operating margin is frankly, just a working capital tailwind that we had, and it's really driven by two components. One is if you recall about a year ago, we had an ERP implementation that caused a delay in our ability to do some collections. So earlier this year, we've got a tailwind from that. But on top of that, we've also improved our collections process, I would say, extremely well, reduced agings. And so kind of, I would say, just really brought some operational efficiency to our working capital that showed that improvement. Now going forward, as you all know, like being able to repeat working capital improvements on top of each other year-over-year, while we're going to strive to be able to continue to improve and gain efficiencies, it's not something you usually can just get pretty easily. And so that's why in the prepared remarks, you'll find that I would expect longer term to assume a free cash flow yield more closer to that operating margin.\nOperator: Our next question comes -- our final question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nArsenije Matovic: Hi. This is Arsenije on for Alex Zukin. Congrats on results. With the international strength you have seen this year, I think it has contributed close to 45% of total revenue growth in fiscal '24. Do you expect this to be an even greater contribution to growth in fiscal '25? Does this mix stay the same? Or as you roll through the drag from the pandemic cohorts early in fiscal '25, do you think that there is strong renewal expansion domestically if macro stays the same, that leads to more US contribution to top line growth in fiscal '25? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Yes. Thanks for the question. Well, first off, again, really happy with how our international growth has progressed to the year, growing much faster than the overall business. All of our major regions grew to the double-digits in Q4. To the question about whether we think it accelerates more or less, I'm not going to provide any guidance out to that. But what I will say is that, just to reiterate, the international opportunity for us, I think, is quite sizable. Only 27% of our revenue in Q4 came from our international business. And if you think of GDP or something as a proxy, it should be, not higher than that. And so I think I'm really excited for that longer-term opportunity, but not any place to say, oh, I think it will accelerate faster or slower than any other market.\nAllan Thygesen: Okay. With that, thank you all for joining and for your support as we continue to build a solid foundation for DocuSign. We are proud of the strong results in Q4 and of the progress that we're making to reinvigorate innovation and add value for our customers, our employees and shareholders. We look forward to what will be a very exciting fiscal 2025. Thank you. We'll see you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and will be available for replay on the Investor Relations section of the website following the call. [Operator Instructions] I will now pass the call over to Heather Harwood, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nHeather Harwood: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and welcome to DocuSign's Q3 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. I'm Heather Harwood, DocuSign's Head of Investor Relations. Joining me on today's call are DocuSign's CEO, Allan Thygesen and our CFO, Blake Grayson. The press release announcing our third quarter fiscal year 2024 results was issued earlier today and is posted on our Investor Relations website. Now let me remind everyone that some of our statements on today's call are forward-looking. We believe our assumptions and expectations related to these forward-looking statements are reasonable, but they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different. In particular, our expectations regarding the pace of digital transformation and factors affecting customer demand are based on our best estimates at this time and are therefore subject to change. Please read and consider the risk factors in our filings with the SEC, together with the content of this call. Any forward-looking statements are based on our assumptions and expectations to date, and except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these statements in light of future events or new information. During this call, we will present GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. In addition, we provide non-GAAP weighted average share count and information regarding free cash flows and billings. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results.

For information regarding our non-GAAP financial information, the most directly comparable GAAP measures and a quantitative reconciliation of those figures, please refer to today's earnings press release which can be found on our website at investor.docusign.com. I'd now like to turn the call over to Allan. Allan?\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. DocuSign's third quarter operating results reflect progress on our initiatives to expand beyond e-signature into agreement management. And our financial performance underscores our ongoing focus on driving profitability and sustaining healthy free cash flow. As I reflect on our journey over the last 12 months, the three key pillars of our strategic vision remain the same. First, to accelerate innovation towards agreement management, which we believe will further expand market opportunity; second, improving the reach and efficiency of our omnichannel go-to-market efforts; and third, strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. Now before we discuss each pillar in detail, let me first highlight this quarter's financial results. Total Q3 revenue came in at $700 million, up 9% versus prior year. We're particularly pleased with the improvement in our overall profitability this quarter against persistent macro headwinds and delayed at customer caution. Specifically, our Q3 non-GAAP operating margin came in at 27%, a 400 basis point increase versus prior year and non-GAAP operating income grew 27% year-over-year to $187 million. We also generated record free cash flow in Q3 coming in at $240 million, up significantly versus the prior year. We're focused on strengthening our profitability while making balanced investments in areas with strong long-term growth opportunities. We're also seeing encouraging signs of business stabilization. With improvement in some metrics, notably customers with annualized contract value greater than $300,000. Blake will expand on the metrics further in his remarks. With respect to our first pillar, accelerating product innovation. Our focus is twofold. First, we continue to improve our core e-signature product capability. In Q3, DocuSign became the exclusive e-signature provider for Microsoft's Power Page Integration, making it easy for website makers to incorporate signatures and forms without code, improving the client signing experience and opening the door to building pre and post signature workflows. In November, we also launched a WhatsApp integration for e-signature. In an internal comparative study, we found that agreements delivered via WhatsApp are signed nearly seven times faster than those sent via e-mail. Given the ubiquity of WhatsApp globally, it's an important update to bring e-signature to markets outside the US. In addition, IDC recognized DocuSign as a leader in its 2023 e-signature assessment. DocuSign continues to hold the leadership position of IDC for e-signature based on having a complete portfolio of solutions for customers. And we're seeing existing customers grow and expand their use cases. Hantz Group, which is a Michigan-based wealth management firm is using e-signature to deliver a fully digital experience for its clients through a proprietary mobile app and is expanding their use of DocuSign products with notary, SMS, identity verification and monitoring. Our APIs and strength and compliance made DocuSign the best choice for Hantz and they've made DocuSign the standard across their entire organization, which will approximately double their use of our products. Second, we're also investing towards broadening our value proposition beyond e-signature and into agreement management. In Q3, we shipped embedded agreements that deliver a seamless signing experience directly on our customers' websites and applications. In addition, we launched Microsoft Power Automate for the generation of personalized professional-looking documents for signing directly from Microsoft Power Automate flows. We also launched foundational features and functionality that help us expand beyond e-signature into wide-scale agreement management. These features deliver customer delight and remove friction from all aspects of the agreement process. We see the success of CLM as a proof point that there are broader agreement management use cases to address the customers of all sizes. CLM continues to grow well, particularly with North American enterprise customers. And for the fourth year in a row, our CLM solution was recognized as a leader by Gartner in contract life cycle management. Noting our strong market understanding, product strategy and road map vision, including upcoming Generative AI enhancements. This quarter, we expanded a relationship that began more than five years ago with Veeco USA, who's the leader in workplace innovation. Veeco began using DocuSign e-signature and has added CLM as part of this transformation into a digital services company. Our AI solution will help Veeco streamline and enhance search and review of executed customer contracts with actionable insights to better serve its customers. Thank you to our partners at Spaulding Ridge, who are helping to strengthen our commitment and partnership with Veeco. As we look ahead, we envision serving similar customer needs not addressed by CLM via a broader agreement management platform designed for all of our customers in all segments. We are previewing with slide customer now and will have much more to share on our product road map and strategic vision at our Momentum User Conference in April 2024. Across both our e-signature core and future agreement management products, we believe our investment will lead to even further differentiation in a competitive market. We're encouraged by steady win rates and excited for the impact we can create for customers. This past quarter also demonstrated execution against our second pillar, improved omnichannel go-to-market where we gained traction across our direct sales, digital and partner engagement. Our international business spans all channels as an important part of our addressable market. It's really an untapped opportunity for DocuSign expansion. In Q3, our international revenue grew approximately three times faster than our North American business. We also saw traction in the adoption of our Identity education solutions, which meet stringent regulatory standards in the EU and elsewhere. And in Q3, we launched a Japanese localized version of our CLM product. The recently launched WhatsApp integration also highlights our international ambitions. Our digital channel once again grew at a faster rate than our direct business during the quarter, a strong sign that our product-led growth initiative continues to drive new customer acquisition and top of funnel activity. We continue to optimize our site and remove friction from the try-and-buy journey while creating a more personalized experience with improved localization. We're seeing particular strength in new customer acquisition in our international markets as well as improved conversion rates in the trial to pay license purchase conversion rates. Our trusted brand and product strength continue to be assets for our direct sales team. Mountain America Credit Union, one of the biggest credit unions in the US has reduced the time it takes to close a credit card application by 30% by integrating DocuSign with its proprietary loan origination system. Mountain America switched to DocuSign from a different electronic signature provider in part because our strong brand reputation inspires confidence from its members, but also because our rich catalog of best-in-class APIs give its developers the flexibility to create solutions that are customized to its exact needs. That is enabling Mountain America to deliver a seamless, minimal click experience that aligns with the standards as members expect in their financial institutions. An important pillar of our go-to-market plan is strengthening our partner ecosystem. In October, we hosted our first ever partner day. It was fantastic to meet with our system integrators, resellers and software vendors from around the world, sharing our commitment to growing our business together. As an example, the ISV Embed pay-as-you-go initiative we announced in Q2 is accelerating and driving new customer wins. Before I pass it to Blake, I want to address some progress on our third strategic pillar. Our company's focus on financial and operational efficiency. In the quarter, we delivered record operating margin and free cash flow. While we continue to invest for long-term growth, we will also continue to be strong financial stewards of the business. We still have a lot of work to do, but I am pleased with our progress over the past 12 months. I am more confident than ever in the value we can create for our customers in our business and the scale and strength of our customer base. We're in the early stages of our journey to expand beyond e-signature into agreement management. But there is very concrete customer validation of the market opportunity and meaningful progress towards our goals. Thank you to the DocuSign team who's inspired me with their commitment to this transformation. With that, let me turn it over to Blake.\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Allan, and good afternoon, everyone. As I approach my six-month anniversary at DocuSign, I remain excited about the long-term opportunity and our team's execution against the three key pillars we've outlined previously. Accelerating product innovation, enhancing our omnichannel go-to-market strategy and strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. We delivered solid results in Q3, demonstrating the stability of our business model. In the third quarter, total revenue increased 9% year-over-year to $700 million, and subscription revenue grew 9% year-over-year to $682 million. We continue to drive solid new customer growth during the quarter, despite the challenging macro and software buying environment, which is evidence of DocuSign's durable value proposition. In addition, I'm proud of our operational execution highlighted by strong profitability and free cash flow generation. While we have much work still to do, we are making progress. Third quarter billings rose 5% year-over-year to $692 million. As expected, expansion headwinds continued to impact year-over-year billings growth. These dynamics are also visible in our dollar net retention, which was 100% in Q3. Expansion rates continue to be tempered by spending optimization and IT budget scrutiny. We expect dollar net retention to trend downward in Q4. That said, we are encouraged by a few early data points evident in our results this quarter. First, we saw year-over-year consumption stabilization or improvement in a number of verticals, including business services, technology and insurance. Financial services by contrast, continue to be more impacted. Although real estate also continued to be pressured by the interest rate environment, it improved on a year-over-year basis for the third quarter in a row with significant opportunity for further improvement. We're increasingly operating in a post-COVID environment and I'm pleased that our weighted average contract duration continues to remain consistent at 18 months. Also, by the end of this fiscal year, we expect only around 10% of our book of business to be from contracts signed during calendar years 2020 and 2021. DocuSign's value proposition is broad-based, and we benefit long-term by doing business with customers across a diverse set of sectors and segments. Second, we are pleased with the early progress we are seeing from our investments in the omnichannel go-to-market efforts. Driven by our direct sales efforts, the enterprise segment showed some early potential relative to performance in previous quarters. The number of customers with annualized contract values greater than $300,000 rose slightly to 1,051 from 1,047 in the prior quarter and was approximately flat year-over-year. This increase is an improvement after two quarters of sequential declines. Also, our CLM business grew double digits year-over-year. As enterprise customers continue to optimize their e-signature spend, we are seeing some customers taking advantage of our CLM product. Enterprise customer adoption is encouraging because CLM is the early proving ground for investment in a broader agreement management use case for our entire customer base. In addition, within our omnichannel pillar, international revenue grew 18% year-over-year, reaching 185 million in the third quarter, representing 26% of our total revenue. This was a slight acceleration in year-over-year growth from the previous quarter. Most international markets remain at an early adoption stage due to regulatory history and cultural habits. At the same time, however, international represents the largest portion of our TAM, and I'm pleased to see continued success of our hybrid go-to-market strategy. Related to the investments we're making in our PLG and self-serve motions, digital revenue growth outperformed direct. Digital remains the primary source for new customer acquisition, and we added approximately 36,000 new customers in Q3 and bringing the total customer base to 1.47 million, up 11% year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 7,000 direct customers bringing the total number of direct customers to 233,000, a 15% year-over-year increase. Turning to our third strategic pillar. We delivered strong margin expansion and healthy cash flow during Q3, highlighting our focus on operating and financial efficiency. Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 83% in line with the prior year. Third quarter non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 86% also in line with the prior year. Q3 non-GAAP operating income reached a record $187 million, representing a 27% margin, up nearly 400 basis points from 23% and $147 million in the prior year. During the quarter, we increased focus on investment prioritization, hiring plans and operating expenses. There will be continuing opportunities for greater efficiency even as we invest to drive long-term growth. Q3 non-GAAP EPS was $0.79, a $0.22 per share improvement from $0.57 last year. We ended Q3 with 6,945 employees compared to 7,522 the year prior and up from 6,748 in Q2. We will remain disciplined with our head count investment. Hiring will continue to focus on opportunities to drive sustainable long-term growth like those in R&D. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $264 million compared with $53 million in the same quarter last year. While an ERP transition impacted last year's cash flow results, I'm proud of the significant free cash flow we generated this quarter. Third quarter free cash flow was a record $240 million representing a 34% margin compared with $36 million or 6% a year ago. Over the last 12 months, we've generated over $750 million in free cash flow, underscoring the strong fundamentals of this business. With regards to the balance sheet, we exited Q3 with $1.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. This includes the repayment of $37 million of convertible debt that matured during the quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we have ample liquidity to address the remaining convertible debt of $690 million that matures next month. Turning to our share repurchase program. We redeployed excess capital during the quarter and repurchased 1.8 million shares for approximately $75 million. In addition to our share repurchase program, during the quarter, we used $36 million to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the diluted impact of our equity programs. We remain committed to opportunistically returning capital to our shareholders. With that, let me turn to guidance. For the fourth quarter and fiscal year '24, we expect total revenue of $696 million to $700 million in Q4 or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint and $2.746 billion to $2.750 billion for fiscal '24 or a 9% year-over-year increase. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $679 million to $683 million in Q4 or a 6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint and $2.670 billion to $2.674 billion for fiscal '24 or a 9% year-over-year increase. For billings, we expect $758 million to $768 million in Q4 or a 3% growth rate year-over-year at the midpoint and $2.835 billion to $2.845 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 7% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for Q4 and 81.5% to 82.5% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 22.5% to 23.5% for Q4 and 24% to 25% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of $207 million to $212 million for both Q4 and fiscal '24. In closing, we're pleased to report a quarter of consistent execution against our three strategic pillars accelerating product innovation, enhancing our omnichannel go-to-market strategy and strengthening our financial and operational efficiency. We have a strong foundation with well over 1 million customer relationships and improving product momentum. We remain focused on creating shareholder value by investing in durable long-term growth, delivering on our profitability goals and generating sustainable free cash flow. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we focus on helping our customers accelerate their business growth, mitigate risk and enable customer experiences that are easier and more delightful. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJake Roberge: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. I understand NRR is a trailing metric and I appreciate the color that Q4 will see another decline. But are we starting to get visibility in the trough for that metric now that you're putting those headwinds from the multiyear COVID contract behind you and maybe the new product investments start layering in more meaningfully next year?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. I'll take a stab at this and Allan, if you want to jump in, feel free. So just a quick reminder, dollar net retention or DNR is our direct business only in greater than one year. Like you said, the trend downwards in line with our previous communications. And as covered in our prepared remarks, for me, we have -- we expect to see continued pressure in Q4. It's a tough macro environment still where companies continue to scrutinize investments and leading to smaller expansion opportunities for us. It's a bit of a lagging indicator. So the thing that I'm focused on mostly and the company is focused on is what are the efforts we're making to stabilize and improve it over the longer term. And so -- like you said, things like the intelligent agreement management and the new product innovation, including CLM and pricing and packaging enhancements and stronger PLG motions that we're working on in self-serve, which can help us improve those win or renewal weights, if you will, over time is what we're focused on. And as you heard in the prepared remarks, we are seeing some very early signs of potential, I would call it, cost of optimism, right? Like consumption up across a number of verticals. We saw sticky future adoption improve from last quarter on a year-over-year basis. And that's the percentage of our direct customers using five or more kind of incremental features that was at 58% in Q3, up from Q2, and it was up about 12 points year-over-year. So they're just -- the early signs of potential optimism, but I think it's too early for us to put any type of a target or a specific time line out there. But focusing on those product management efforts and those go-to-market efforts, I think, is how we get excited about the future.\nJake Roberge: Okay. Helpful. And then just a follow-up on those products you were talking about. When do you think CLM becomes a more meaningful part of the business where it actually starts impacting expansion rates instead of NRR just being really driven by e-signature consumption. It seems like you've been talking about the potential for that product suite for a few years. But what do you need to do to get that product the more main stage with customers?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I'll take a crack at that. So first, I'd say that if you look -- if you think about our broader vision, CLM is really a leading indicator or early instantiation of our broader vision for intelligent agreement management. It is very heavily focused on the enterprise. And I think we and everyone else providing CLM solutions have been held back by the required significant services and customization investment that the current generation of CLM products mandate. And so our opportunity is to make that significantly more lightweight and delightful, lowering the bar for companies of all sizes really to take advantage of that platform. That is a huge part of our focus right now. We're in early access on some important pieces of that. And so over the next few quarters, you will see that going to roll out to a much broader set of customers than CLM and DocuSign or any other vendor can address today. And we think that unlocks opportunity, as I said, everywhere.\nJake Roberge: Helpful. Thanks for taking the questions and well done on the nice execution.\nAllan Thygesen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thanks for the question. Wanted to dig in on margins and the margin outperformance. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more context on the source of upside in the quarter? And then how to think about the trajectory of investments going forward? Like the full year guide was raised. Just wondering if there's been sort of any changes in the investment philosophy pulling back in any areas or just letting more of the upside flow through to the bottom line? Thanks.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. I appreciate the question. So with regards to the outperformance on the operating margin, we made a concerted effort, I would say, starting kind of like late September to inspect and rationalize investments across the business. It's really just about increasing focus on, what I would call, disciplined spending while we continue to invest in the areas that where we have longer-term growth aspirations. During Q3, we prioritize investments. And so that includes the rate of hiring, the value opportunities for organizational efficiency, but then also overall operating expenses with focus on leveraging existing resources where possible, but still being able to invest for longer-term growth. With regard to your question on the trajectory and the investment philosophy, we're all big believers here in a balanced outlook, which is we need to be able to invest to get the long-term growth and achieve those aspirations that we have. But at the same point in time, we need to be efficient and productive with the assets that we have. And so I really am proud of the team for embracing that. And so I don't think no investment, I would say, philosophy changes from our part. But I would just say a little bit maybe kind of more executed focus on that for us and we were able to show some pretty good performance, I think, this quarter and I'm really proud of the team for that level of execution.\nJosh Baer: Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I would just echo, if I can just echo Blake's point that the entire management team, not just like is very focused on this balance that he referenced. We absolutely want to free up capital and that is a team effort to look everywhere in the company to free up resources where we can then invest more particularly on the product side. We did some of that earlier this year, as you know, but it's an ongoing continuous effort, not just a onetime thing, and I think that's reflected in the results.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLuv Sodha: Hi. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Thank you, Allan and Blake for taking my questions. Maybe first, just wanted to ask, obviously, you're guiding to 7% year-over-year billings growth for fiscal '24. I guess I know you're not guiding to fiscal '25 just yet, but how should we think of the growth trajectory for next year, especially as you come through some kind of trough on the NRR side?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. So I'll take a stab at that. I'm really proud of the progress we've made in a short period of time. When I say that, I mean across our business, both in just operational efficiency but also accelerating product evolution and innovation. In Q3, particularly, we improved operating margins, we generated significant free cash flow. And I think we're evolving our mind-set across the company. As I mentioned earlier on the question that was just asked before this, in terms of our long-term approach, we're going to balance driving durable long-term growth with operating efficiency. Top of our priority is to make the right strategic investments to drive business momentum and, frankly, to billings, which is, I think, what you're referring to in the coming years. And it doesn't happen overnight, especially at the business of the scale. But we believe we have the right product and go-to-market focus and we've got a good leadership team in place to make that happen. And you alluded to this, but given that we're still working through our planning and forecasting process for next year. We'll provide our standard formal fiscal year '25 outlook in our Q4 earnings call three months from now. But as you think about next year, I imagine you want to consider the Q4 exit rate trends as you think about next year and at the same time, we believe there's further opportunity to drive improved efficiency. In our existing business and our operating expenses and then also taking into account historical seasonality changes as we go from Q4 to Q1 with fewer days in the quarter and things like that, just all kind of the basics that you would want to pay attention to. But other than that, we'll provide our full year -- our fiscal '25 formal guidance in our next quarter's call.\nLuv Sodha: Got it. And one quick follow-up, if I may. Just wanted to ask about your philosophy around stock-based compensation? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. So I mean I think the philosophy on stock-based comp is generally you want to be able to provide the incentive and the ability to attract and retain the best talent possible to allow us to reach the aspirations for growth that we want to get to. I know that I think our stock-based comp as a percentage of revenue in the current quarter I think was 23%. I think that was up slightly year-over-year from '22. I would say that the driver of the increase is really most about the new management team. So it's driven by the executive comp that drove that year-over-year increase, not necessarily the other part of the company. I think that, for us, it's something we're slightly above our peer average, and so it's something that we are paying attention to. But it's a balanced approach, again, right? We want to be able to attract and retain the right people for the job that -- so we can get into this next chapter of growth for DocuSign. But it is something we pay attention to and are looking at.\nLuv Sodha: Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I would just add, we have that. We discussed that topic with the Board and the Compensation Committee and we will share our longer-term plans, but our goal, as Blake said is to manage it down over time without fundamentally disrupting our ability to execute. It was necessary to attract a new management team and to rebalance our employees following the stock decline, but I think we think we're in a more normalized set now, and we should be able to manage to something more towards the benchmarks.\nLuv Sodha: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBradley Sills: Great. Thank you so much. I wanted to ask about a comment Allan you made earlier in the call that I think you're seeing increased conversion in the top of funnel business. Would love to get some more color on there. Do you feel like there's some learning there? I know this has been a priority for you since joining the company and building that top of funnel. So any color on that end of the business and the conversion uptick that you mentioned?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Well, so I think you all know, we acquire a tremendous number of new customers every quarter. And most of those, vast majority of those come in via our website and onboard themselves. And then over time, we grow them. And as they show potential and opportunity, then we engage them with our sales teams and our support to customer success teams. I would say that our digital motion has made significant improvements during the course of this year. So for customers that are in essence natively digital, we have improved that part of the funnel, not only you can buy more things, you can upgrade your existing plans. All of that stuff is working much better now. We're adding more international currencies every quarter. So all of those things are helping improve the performance of our digital business. In addition to that, we are in the process of building out ability for customers who are currently serviced through our sales teams to handle a number of activities themselves without human assistance. And that is very -- has very high leverage both in terms of providing a better offering to our customers and in terms of freeing up our sales teams to work on higher-value work. But I think we still have some quarters to go on implementing that and seeing the full benefit of that. So the benefits of this self-serve PLG project continue to accrue and will accrue into next year. But we're seeing really good progress in that business is growing faster than our direct business. And it's improving on most performance metrics. So that's, yes, very happy with the progress there.\nBradley Sills: Great to hear. Thanks, Allan. And then one, if I may, the net revenue retention, dollar-based net revenue retention coming down next quarter, could you just help unpack that for us a little bit on gross versus expansion? Is gross kind of holding and this is mostly expansion related? I know it's a backward-looking metric. But if you could just help us unpack that a little bit on the growth side? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, there's not much more, I would say, a level of detail that we're going to disclose publicly about it. I think it's just for us that it's a metric that we know if we can deliver on the product innovation and the road map and the self-service and the PLG motions that we have in front of us, we really believe we've got a chance to stabilize that metric and then reverse that trend. Now for us, that's top of mind. Obviously, it is a lagging metric, so there's time that you're going to -- it's going to take to see that occur. But I would say there was nothing that spoke out about Q3 that stood out that I would call it different than the prior quarter or two.\nBradley Sills: All right. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the questions. Blake, I wanted to spend some more time on the consumption commentary that you provided. Certainly helpful. I'm just wondering if there's anything else you can tell us in terms of the shape of those improvements. How that compares to prior periods? And when you're talking about consumption for DocuSign, is that mainly signature volumes or Are there other attributes of customer profiles we should be considering as part of that commentary?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. And it's a good question. Thanks for asking. So when we talk about consumption today, it's primarily around the e-signature space, primarily around, if you will, the envelopes that are used. So what is the usage by our customers on a year-over-year basis. So those verticals that I highlighted at some of the stronger year-over-year growth in consumption that we've seen over the past quarter or two. So I think we're, again, cautiously optimistic about it. And just to be clear, too, there's still verticals that are more challenged, right? I highlighted financial services is one, and I also highlight real estate as the other one, which probably comes as no surprise to folks who are living in this interest rate environment. I think the thing that makes me -- I don't want to say happier, but you can see a little bit of light there is that real estate has improved on a year-over-year basis over the past three quarters. So that's good, but it's not anywhere back to near where it was I would say prior to the whole interest rate challenges that we've kind of entered into the past year or so. But so excited about that, but again, that's also, I think, in the prepared remarks, I made a comment about the significant remaining opportunity. And so a lot of it, I think, you're probably seeing is that as the macro environment returns to more normalcy in certain verticals, then we believe we're a beneficiary of that. And I think that's relevant because we have such a broad-based set of verticals in such a diverse customer base as well. So it's something that when things improve, we think we're a beneficiary of that. And your guess is probably as good or better than mine on when that happens.\nAllan Thygesen: I don't know if any of us --\nBlake Grayson: Go ahead.\nAllan Thygesen: No, that one maybe not. And I'll just add to what Blake said, I think consumption -- we think of consumption as an imperfect but important leading and predictive indicator of renewal. And so that's why we track it closely and we're talking about it. And we're seeing modestly encouraging signs there in consumption trends relative to the commitments customers have made. Maybe one other comment on that is we are also coming to the end of the COVID. We have a few quarters left of COVID renewals, but it is already significantly down and weight in our business and so that's coming to an end, which is positive.\nMichael Turrin: That's all super helpful. And then maybe one more on just the leading indicator side. Appreciating it's noisy, but if we look at billings this quarter, it's down sequentially. Last quarter you talked about -- it wasn't early renewals. It was just kind of the timing of renewals, having some improvements. So did that maybe help Q2 relative to Q3 or just help us kind of square the seasonal trends and what can drive the volatility from quarter-to-quarter on that metric? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Yes, you bet. So, right, Q3 billings growth of 5% relative to Q2 of 10% year-over-year. Still really pleased with the Q3. We came in above our expectations on that. But the detail like you're asking about from Q2 to Q3, it's really driven, I would say, by three primary areas. The first is we have a hard comp in Q3. If you look back at our historical results, I think our Q3 billings growth in fiscal '23 was up 17% -- around 17% year-over-year. And that was the highest in fiscal '23. And that was driven by a year ago, we had a pretty strong early renewals kind of momentum that grew that billings number in Q2 the prior year. Now we're still doing well this year with regard to our renewals, it's just a hard comp that we're having to deal with. The second thing item is what you talked about, which is that on-time renewal impact. And as I discussed in the last call and my predecessor discussed on the call before that, the benefit that we've had in the higher on-time renewals in the first half of '24. It just -- you have a smaller impact as you go through the year in the second half. And so it's really primarily a timing issue. And so we're still doing actually really quite well on on-time renewal execution. The team is doing a great job with it. It's just a smaller impact on year-over-year growth as we progress through the year. And then the final -- the third thing that impacts that billings number, frankly, is just lower expansion rates, right? I mean IT budget scrutiny and people that are sitting in my seat are asking the right questions, which is how do I do more with less, where are the places that I can manage costs well, it's -- I mean, I'm doing it here, frankly, in my role as an operational CFO. And that, along with macro impacts overall billings growth, and it's evident in those DNR rates. But as Allan mentioned and I have mentioned already, like we are seeing those consumption trends that we saw some marginal improvement quarter-over-quarter. And it's still early for us. We got to see that hopefully hold here for the next few quarters. But things are also improving, but that's just really the dynamics of the decel and year-over-year growth between Q2 and Q3.\nMichael Turrin: Appreciate the details. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'm not sure if this is who this is for, but I guess as we think about the product set for next year, Obviously, there's a lot of organic investments you're making on the Gen AI side. Can you just talk about how you expect that the product set available products and upsells to evolve next year? And with the launch of some of these generative AI services, how does that kind of change the philosophy around still kind of offering an envelope base signature product rather than something more subscription base that's not tight to envelope? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, there's several points in there. First, I'd just say, look, our CLM business is growing faster than our signature business, and I expect as we launch this broader intelligent agreement management platform to a broader set of customers that pattern of that broader category growing faster will continue. The second point you made about the envelope versus subscription basis. We are, in fact, already experimenting with should we say, unlimited envelope billing models for a variety of customers. So for very large customers, we have entered into some enterprise license agreements. And those have been, I think, quite helpful at one very large bank that we did one with as they, after they signed that agreement, they proceeded to remove a competing solution from some of their workflows. And I think we have that opportunity across some of our very large customers. And then in the Commercial segment, the mid-market and SMB segment, we're now competing more directly with some of our lower-priced competitors who have offered unlimited envelope packages. And not surprisingly, if you give people a competitive unlimited envelope from DocuSign versus a lesser branded, less well featured product then they choose DocuSign. And so we're seeing really, really positive results and to the point where I expect that we will continue to broaden that rollout. So overall, I'm feeling quite good about our evolution and our response to competition on multiple fronts as well as the broadening of our product road map that you alluded to in the first part of your question.\nTyler Radke: Okay. Great. And Blake maybe a question for you on free cash flow. So very, very strong here in the quarter relative to consensus expectations. How should we be thinking about just free cash flow for the full year, was there any onetime items in that number? And as you think about next year, what seems to be kind of an increased operational discipline, should we be thinking about free cash flow margins expanding kind of consistently with operating margin expansion. Just anyway to think about that medium-term framework. Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. So, yes, really happy with the $240 million cash flow that was generated this quarter. It's a combination of just ongoing strong operating results. But we also did have some working capital improvements that impacted that number. When you look at the cash flow statement, you're going to see there the changes in operating assets and liabilities, and we've really had a strong improvement on the collection side on an AR. And so that's great. And so that it drives it. And then I said this in the prepared remarks, comparing to prior year can be a little tricky because of the ERP transition that happened prior year. So we had a more muted free cash flow generation number. But regardless of that, really excited about the free cash flow we got. Now to your question on the yield, it was really strong. It was 34%. And while I'm a big fan of the working capital tailwind and I'm really proud of the team for the discipline and the improvements there, that can be something that's challenging, right, to pile onto every year going forward. There's always some good working capital improvements you can make. But I think that if you think about this business in the long-term, it's probably fair to assume that your free cash flow yield trends a lot closer to your operating margin yield. So as long as you make operating margin improvements, you should be able to capture most of that right down to the free cash flow line. But then also in this business, the beauty of this business from a free cash flow perspective is that if you can drive operating margin improvement and you can drive reaccelerated billings growth because of the way our working capital works, your free cash flow generation can really accelerate. And so like this is a much longer-term period that I'm talking about, but it is the power of this model, which is super exciting. And so I do think, though, like, I mean I think in the span of time, you would think free cash flow yield should trend closer to your operating margin deal that we've been. We've done better than that and free cash flow pretty significantly better than that in free cash flow this quarter, but it's mostly on the back of those working capital improvements or not mostly, but a large chunk of it. And so you have to be cautious about assuming that you're going to expand on those every quarter.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Karl Keirstead from UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. I'd love to go back to the comment when you were describing the puts and takes on the vertical side when you mentioned that FINS felt a little bit more pressured or impacted. Just curious, was that a comment about the more rate sensitive mortgage-related transactions or was that a broader comment on FINS. And I'm wondering if your fourth quarter guidance reflects any anticipation of the FINS vertical stabilizing? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I'll just start, and Blake, you can add. Look, I think in terms of the mix impact of financial services, I think, that's mostly behind us, but we have experienced that over the last several years, both on the mortgage side and financial services industry. And we saw some in the smaller banks, for example, that IT spend froze with all the turmoil in the spring, some of the very largest banks have also had particularly aggressive cost management efforts. I'd say, overall, we've seen some modest recovery. It's still growing a little slower than the business overall, but trending better. And we'll see what happens with interest rates. Our current forecast assumes that macro conditions continue as they are. I recognize there's optimism they may get better. We'd love that, but we don't want to move that in our guidance.\nBlake Grayson: Yes. Just to follow up. My general philosophy is I don't make macro forecast as a team because just like I think we joked about it earlier on the call, it's a hard business to get into. And so we forecast what we see. And so if things were to change one way or the other, we would then have to -- we'd speak to that variance.\nKarl Keirstead: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nPatrick Walravens: Great and thank you. Congratulations on the business turning here. It's great to see. So Allan how is DocuSign's relationship these days with Salesforce? Historically, I know it's been really strong. The reason I ask is during Dreamforce. This year, they had a session on Salesforce contracts, and they sort of laid out the road map for Salesforce contracts where they have AI functionality coming in the spring and then obligation management in the summer and then red lining the year after that. So I'm just wondering how are things with Salesforce?\nAllan Thygesen: I think our relationship with Salesforce is as strong as ever. We renewed our strategic partnership this summer. I was just over there meeting with one of the senior executives yesterday. It's a very healthy relationship at every level. And we have probably more -- we have certainly a more Salesforce-enabled business than with any other software partner and that includes other very large software companies. So Salesforce has been a trading partner, and they remain that. On the CLM side, yes, they certainly have a contract offering covering out. They previously offered that in their vertical products, and now they're generalizing it somewhat. I think that the challenge is that the market is moving to a horizontal model by which I mean 2/3 almost of all the CLM RFPs that we see are for cross-functional contract management. In other words, a single centralized contract management system across, let's say, procurement front of the house, HR, et cetera. And that will be hard for Salesforce or other even very large companies that are focused on one particular workflow or another. And so I expect that we will continue to collaborate very closely with Salesforce on both the signature side and the CLM side. And I'm not too worried about the sales force contracts piece, but never under estimate Salesforce. They're a fantastic company and partner.\nPatrick Walravens: That's super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Kirk Materne with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nKirk Materne: Yeah, thanks very much. Allan, I was wondering, if you could just double-click a little bit on the international opportunity. You called it out in the prepared remarks. Is that largely sort of PLG-led right now or are you thinking about sort of bringing more direct sales into play over in certain geographies. Can you just give us some sense of how you view that opportunity, given you're obviously less penetrated outside the US? Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. It's actually a full omnichannel thing and it's very market context specific. So first of all, we have a substantial amount of direct sales teams deployed in some of the major international markets UK, France, Germany, Australia, and we service Canada, obviously, Brazil, a meaningful size team there as well and a spattering of folks in other markets. So historically that was our principal go-to-market model. We're now really balancing that across direct investment where we can put enough wood behind the arrow and there's enough return on that investment. And then a combination of a digital motion which we can obviously serve 180 countries that way. And then a partner motion in countries where we -- where it makes sense to leave with that. So you took a smaller developing market, let's say, it wouldn't make sense for us to put a direct sales team on the ground, but we wouldn't be able to fully exploit the opportunity strictly through a digital-only motion. And so I think we have tremendous opportunity on both of those fronts. And we are seeing growth both in our digital channels, where international is growing faster than domestic and in our direct channels where it's growing faster than domestic. So we'll continue on that. Just to return to a theme from prior calls, as we looked at prioritization and where we're really going to put additional investment, both from a direct sales standpoint, but also in all the various supporting functions that are necessary to really have an effective go-to-market motion. We prioritized investing in Germany and Japan, which were markets that where we had some level of direct sales investment but we hadn't invested as aggressively in marketing and back-office functions like legal and finance or in product. And so that has been a priority since the spring. And we're making really good progress in both of those markets. I mentioned last time, we opened our office in Munich. We have an office in Tokyo. We have launched localized products for several of those markets mentioned the Japanese CLM product that we shipped here a couple of months ago, a lot of the identity verification stuff, and more stuff coming here shortly in that realm, very targeted at the EU in general, in Germany, in particular. And so we are investing aggressively I would say in a direct sales motion maybe our top 10 markets globally and then a combination of partner and digital throughout other markets where we can. There'll be some very long tail countries where we can only serve with a digital motion, but that's how we approach it.\nKirk Materne: Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSonak Kolar: Great. This is Sonak Kolar on for Mark Murphy. Thank you taking the question. Allan, can you provide an update on any changes you may be seeing in the competitive dynamics for the e-signature market, particularly towards the lower end market that you called out in the past? Just curious if there's a sense that DocuSign e-signature efforts are helping with the retention and competitive wins, particularly within those users of basic e-signature use cases?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I think the dynamic is as I've described in the previous quarters, I don't see a material change. So with larger clients, we may see local competitors in certain international markets, Adobe and some of them and then the smaller clients, it's just mattering of a variety of names that are maybe less familiar. And I think we are -- I'm not seeing any change in our win rates in competitive deals. And I'm cautiously optimistic with some of the initiatives I referenced earlier in terms of our new pricing and packaging that we are responding pretty effectively at both ends of the market. And then lastly, I just mentioned at the very low end, if you will, where it's really being embedded in workflows. We've dramatically upgraded our solutions for ISVs to embed DocuSign, and we've adopted a more flexible billing model that we refer to as pay-as-you-go and that saw some very nice accelerated growth here since the launch in Q2. So, on multiple fronts, I'm feeling that we're doing pretty well, and I'm not seeing a material change in the competitive dynamic.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the floor back over to Allan Thygesen for closing comments.\nAllan Thygesen: Thank you. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for joining today's call. So this quarter, DocuSign was especially effective at making progress on our product initiatives while balancing those investments with operational efficiency. So we are continuing to build on our considerable scale as we expand beyond e-signature into intelligent agreement management. Thanks for your time. Look forward to seeing all of you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Alan. Alan?\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. We closed out the first half of the year strong by delivering solid second quarter financial results. We continue to drive momentum in our business by making progress against our key initiatives and delivering enhancements to our product portfolio. Exiting the quarter, I feel energized, having recently come off our momentum events where we visited eight cities spanning five continents. We met with thousands of partners and customers who are excited to hear about our dual track plans to improve agreement workflows. In the near-term, we're focused on the agreement management layer. We're taking something that's quite complex for our customers and making it easier and more delightful. And over-time, we're building the intelligence layer that will unlock agreement data. We presented our future vision, publicly shared our product roadmap and received tremendous validation after showcasing product demonstrations aligned to these two priorities over the quarter. Let me share some highlights from this quarter's financial results. Q2 total revenue came in at $688 million, up 11% versus prior year and Q2 non-GAAP operating margin came in at 25%. While we are pleased with our results, like many others, we are seeing continued macro pressures tempering expansion rates. However, we remain focused on what we can control, executing against our initiatives to drive innovation and operational efficiency, further setting the foundation for growth while navigating an uncertain environment. Now I want to highlight our pace of innovation driven by our delivery of new features and products. The progress we're making demonstrates how we are expanding upon our leadership in eSignature. As I said, we're thinking about our roadmap on two horizons. In the short-term, we're looking to ship new features and functionality that differentiate DocuSign and streamline agreement workflows, bringing in new customers and continuing to deliver value to existing customers. To that end, we continue to expand our identity verification portfolio announcing the global launch of Liveness Detection for ID Verification. Liveness Detection technology leverages AI-powered biometric checks to prevent identity spoofing which results in more accurate verification without the signee being present. ID Verification is already helping our customers. Our data shows that it has reduced time to sign by about 60%. Later this year, we expect to expand our functionality with a wallet feature that will enable frequent users to save their profile, driving improved efficiency and convenience. These add-ons will be available for all of our plans, including our standard plan representing an important differentiator for DocuSign's product offering for all customer types. As I've stated in the past, the value of an agreement is in the data and every step of the workflow will benefit when it's automated, intelligent and seamlessly integrated into core businesses. Web Forms is delivering on that vision. During the quarter, we shipped and announced more and increasingly sophisticated capabilities to our Web Forms offering. In July, Web Forms became available on DocuSign FedRAMP moderate environment, which unlocks new possibilities for our federal state and local government customers to digitize their forms. We also soon ship advanced reporting capabilities, enabling users to unlock data from their agreements to uncover actionable insights and drive data-driven decisions. This quarter we also announced that DocuSign Monitor is now available to our CLM customers. Monitor provides a comprehensive and holistic multiproduct view of user activity on one dashboard for both CLM and eSignature ensuring organizations can quickly and easily detect, investigate and respond to suspicious activity before incidents occur. For our customers, it's powerful reassurance. Losing even one high-value agreement can have a significant business impact. We are seeing large marquee organizations across industries, including tech and finance, like DocuSign CLM to transform how they automate their end-to-end agreement processes across their entire enterprise. As an example, we closed one of our largest CLM deals ever. This customer is a leading residential solar company turn to our CLM solutions to help automate over 1,200 of their agreement templates, leveraging our document generation and workflow management capabilities. CLM helps them automate their agreement process across teams, adding simplicity and security. Our CLM today represents a small contribution to our overall business. We saw solid year-on-year growth, which is a reflection of our leading market position. We are encouraged by the wins and we have just begun to tap into the potential for this market. More broadly, we continue to make meaningful progress towards our vision of smart agreements. Before we discuss our final update, it's worth grounding this portion with a reminder of what's generally true in the market. Individual solutions work but customers suffer when putting together solutions combining different product categories like CLM, eSignature, workflow management, document storage and so on. Today only the largest enterprises with resources and IT sophistication can link these solutions together and only a significant expense. This depresses the overall consumption and size of market. We are on a multi-quarter path to evolve our offerings towards a platform capable of coordinating broader processes at a fraction of current complexity. Our goal is to unlock the market for intelligent agreement management from millions of businesses, automating billions of hours of manual work and improving business outcomes. Today, we are already monetizing AI directly through our CLM plus products and indirectly through its use in our products such as search. Our next step on that journey is with AI labs. With AI labs, we are co-innovating with our customers. We provide a sandbox where customers can share a select subset of agreements find new features we're testing. Our customers get early access to developing technology and we receive early feedback that we will incorporate into our products. By working with our customers in the development phase, we're further reinforcing the trusted position we've earned over the last 20 years. Next, let me provide an update on the progress we're making with our go-to-market capabilities, balancing scale with efficiency. As we evolve how DocuSign goes to market, integrating our digital direct and partner selling motions to leverage an omnichannel approach. I'd like to provide an update on the progress we're making in our self-serve product like growth channel. The PLG and self-serve capabilities are one of our most important areas of investment. In addition to our continued focus on delivering against our product road map, we're improving our customer experience by making DocuSign products much easier to try and buy. With such a diversified customer base, it's critical that we deliver delightful self-service experiences, not just for growth, but also for scale and efficiency. We made good traction over the quarter, noting higher traffic conversion rates of new customers on our website. We've also unlocked expansion opportunities for customers directly within their product experience, resulting in relative strength through our digital channel. We expanded relationships with our partner ecosystem, which is an important part of our omnichannel approach to drive reach and scale. In Q2, we launched pay-as-you-go offering for our ISV partners, enables ISVs to embed DocuSign eSignature in their agreement workflows on a consumption basis. Over the course of the next few months, we will have been featured partners in some of the most important technical conferences, most notably at Google Next, Dreamforce, Deutsche Telekom's Digital X and Microsoft Ignite. One of the key pillars of our omnichannel is strengthening our direct sales productivity. This was the second consecutive quarter of a higher-than-anticipated rate of on-time renewals, which is a positive sign of increasing go-to-market execution. It's contributed favorably to our billings outperformance for the quarter, which Blake will touch on in the financial update. In our international business, expansion remains the largest part of our addressable market, and we are making progress. This past quarter, one of Australia's largest banks expanded their relationship with us. Customers since 2020, they use our solutions to streamline both internal and customer-facing business processes in an effort to remove friction, reduce cost and deliver better experiences. The upside potential in our international business is large. And as I had commented on previously, we met with hundreds of our international customers through DocuSign's Momentum Events. The excitement about our product road map was contagious, and we look forward to growing our presence globally. We are shaping the future of the agreement category and building on our global scale and trusted market position. The future of agreements is not about attaching yourself to a legacy document format. As we continue our product evolution by adding intelligence and unlocking the data trapped in agreements, we're increasing productivity, reducing friction and saving our customers' time. This is a fundamental shift in the agreement space. I'm confident in our competitive advantage as DocuSign is the largest player, focused solely on improving the agreement process. Moreover, there's no other company focused on the full end-to-end agreement process for companies of every size from SMBs up to the world's largest enterprises. In closing, I want to thank DocuSign's employees worldwide for their collective power in driving our success. I'm proud of the tremendous job the team has done navigating the dynamic environment. I'd now like to welcome Blake Grayson, who, as you know, joined us in mid-June as our CFO. Blake has proven to be a valuable addition to our team, and I look forward to our continued partnership. Let me turn it over to Blake to review our financial performance.\nBlake Grayson: Thanks, Allan, for the kind words, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm really excited to join my first earnings call as DocuSign's CFO. Over the last few months, I've gained considerable exposure into the workings of our business and value proposition as we look to transform agreement workflows. First, I'd like to share what led me to join DocuSign. DocuSign has a powerful brand and a scale in our customer base that is rare in the enterprise software space. We deliver high ROI products that enable our customers to complete agreements faster, easier and more securely. The opportunity for our business is quite large. And while I am optimistic about our future, we still have work to do to achieve our goals, particularly in a demand environment where companies are appropriately scrutinizing their investments. With that, let me turn to our Q2 results. For the second quarter, total revenue increased 11% year-over-year to $688 million, and subscription revenue also grew 11% year-over-year to $669 million. Our international revenue growth outpaced our domestic business with 17% year-over-year growth to reach $180 million in the second quarter, representing 26% of our total revenue. When I think about the market opportunity ahead, I'm excited by the greenfield space that exists internationally. It is a largely untapped market and a key pillar of future growth. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we work to increase our footprint globally. Second quarter billings rose 10% year-over-year to $711 million. Similar to last quarter, our Q2 billings outperformance was driven by a higher rate of on-time renewals. It is encouraging to see us maintain the higher level of sales execution we saw in Q1 through the first half of the year. However, given the macro environment and headwinds and some expansion metrics, we continue to expect billings growth deceleration in the back half of the year, which is in line with our previously communicated expectations. We added approximately 37,000 new customers during the quarter, which brings our total customer base to 1.44 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 6,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 226,000, an 18% year-over-year increase. We also saw a 6% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value exceeding $300,000 with a total of 1,047 customers. Similar to last quarter, the quarter-on-quarter decline in this customer segment was primarily related to customer buying patterns, lower expansion rates and partial churn. However, as we ship innovative features to deepen our product line-up and differentiate our offerings, more customers are recognizing the value of adopting our features and frictionless functionality. This increases product stickiness and we are pleased that over 50% of our direct customers have now adopted five or more features, an increase of nearly 10 points year-over-year. Dollar net retention was 102% for the quarter. We're seeing continued macro pressures resulting in moderated expansion rates. And as we expect customers to continue scrutinizing budgets and optimizing spend, we anticipate the Q3 dollar net retention rate to trend downward. From a vertical perspective, we saw pockets of relative strength within health care, insurance and business services. One of the most significant strengths I've gained insight into is DocuSign's broad and diverse customer base, which enables us to help offset pressures from verticals that are more sensitive to the interest rate environment, such as real estate. Given the large breadth and depth of our installed base and the investments we're making in product innovation, we believe that as the macro environment stabilizes or improves, DocuSign will be well positioned to capture expansion opportunities. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter was 82%, in line with the prior year. Second quarter non-GAAP subscription gross margin was 85%, also in line with the prior year. Q2 non-GAAP operating income reached $170 million, up 51% from the prior year. Non-GAAP operating margin of 25% was up nearly 700 basis points compared to 18% last year. As discussed on last quarter's call, we are executing against our investment plan. Our philosophy on vesting is consistent. We'll maintain continued disciplined investments to drive growth in our top line over time. Although we expect to ramp investment in the back half of this year, we still expect to exit the year with operating margins better than they were prior to our restructuring efforts. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $0.72, an improvement of $0.28 from last year of $0.44. We ended Q2 with 6,748 employees compared to 8,061 the year prior. Second quarter operating cash flow was $211 million, representing a 31% margin and an increase of 75% versus the same quarter a year ago. Free cash flow for the quarter was also up 74% year-over-year coming in at $184 million, representing a 27% margin. As I'm learning more about the business, I am impressed with our ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow. With regards to the balance sheet, we exited Q2 with more than $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We currently have approximately $725 million in convertible debt that will be maturing over the next few months. Our strong cash position is a reflection of the operating leverage in our business model that provides a strong level of flexibility. And as we think about utilizing this cash, we will do so thoughtfully ensuring our capital is strategically deployed. Related to this, we redeployed excess capital during the quarter and repurchased 583,000 shares for approximately $30 million. We also announced today that we are increasing the size of our share repurchase program to $500 million, up from $200 million as we continue to focus on being opportunistic, reducing dilution and returning excess capital to shareholders as appropriate. In addition to our share repurchase program, during the quarter, we used $40 million to pay taxes due on RSU settlements, reducing the dilutive impact of our equity programs. With that, let me turn to our Q3 and fiscal '24 guidance. To reiterate, while we're pleased with our Q2 financial results, we're also cautious in light of an uncertain macro environment and competitive dynamics. For the third quarter and fiscal year '24, we expect total revenue of $687 million to $691 million in Q3 or a 6% to 7% year-over-year increase and $2.725 billion to $2.737 billion for fiscal '24 or an 8% to 9% year-over-year increase. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $669 million to $673 million in Q3 or a 7% to 8% year-over-year increase and $2.649 billion to $2.661 billion for fiscal '24 or an 8% to 9% year-over-year increase. For billings, we expect $668 million to $678 million in Q3 or a 1% to 3% growth rate year-over-year and $2.804 billion to $2.824 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 5% to 6% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q3 and fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 22% to 23% for Q3 and 23% to 24% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 207 million to 212 million for both Q3 and fiscal '24. In closing, I want to thank our team for their warm welcome and their commitment to work with our customers in a challenging environment and I look forward to connecting with many of you in the near future. We are focused on executing against the key initiatives that we believe will drive future long-term growth and expansion as well as being mindful of efficiency opportunities that will set us up for profitable, sustainable growth. As Allan mentioned, we are the only company at scale that is solely focused on helping customers improve the agreement process. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we continue to evolve the agreement workflow category and help our customers become more productive and more efficient. That concludes our prepared remarks. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSonak Kolar: Great. This is Sonak Kolar on for Mark Murphy. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the healthy execution this quarter. Allan just so quickly on the AI front. You discussed a number of the exciting AI product launches you had at the recent Momentum Conference. Are there any specific products you would call out in which you see the greatest incremental monetization or upsell potential longer term, whether that's around ID Verification, agreement summarization or some of the other areas, for example?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Look, I think we think AI will impact practically all of our products at every step with the agreement workflow. So I don't know that there's a -- just a one call out. But maybe to rattle off a couple that I'm most interested in. I certainly think that the broader, should we say, agreement analytics category is poised to be completely revamped with Generative AI. We were an early investor in that category. We saw that coming together with CLM four or five years ago and made a couple of strategic investments and been a leader in that space, but have been held back by fundamental technology. And I think now with Generative AI, we can do a substantially better job more seamlessly, lighter weight with less professional services. And so I'm very excited to think about how it transformed the CLM category and enables us to deliver more intelligent agreements. I think you mentioned IDV. I agree 100%. Fundamentally, that entire category is AI-enabled. The upload and ingestion of your ID recognition of it and then that Liveness Detection where we're detecting who you are and that you are present and matching that to ID, that would simply not be possible without today's AI technology and really takes just dramatically reshapes the ability to trade off risk and convenience. So I think that's a good one. And but I really do think that it works across the entire flow. We use it today. And when you use DocuSign eSignature today, we automatically recognize your field. That's the AI working detecting what's going on in the agreement. So I've got to put them in that order, though.\nSonak Kolar: Great. Thank you. And then a quick follow-up for Blake. Any context that you can provide in terms of how the macro environment might have trended for Q2 relative to Q1? Were there any signs of improvement in underlying demand trends or maybe pockets of relative stability? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Thanks for the question. I think that from a macro perspective, overall, it seemed pretty similar, I think, from Q1 into Q2. You've got certain verticals and certain areas that show relative strength, and we talked about those on a couple in the prepared remarks. And you have other verticals that are obviously still under some stress. And so we have to deal with that. I think that on the macro side, the biggest pressure point that I think we deal with is how CFOs people in my position are generally scrutinizing investments across the board. And so for us, it's trying to work with them and provide the best value that we can. But nothing I would say, nothing stands out from Q2, I think, from into Q1, but we're still in, obviously, a bit of an uncertain environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nLuv Sodha: Hi. This is Luv Sodha on for Brent Thill. Thank you for taking my question and welcome to Blake. I wanted to ask one to Allan. Maybe, Allan, could you talk a little bit about the go-to-market execution? I know you mentioned the focus on product-led growth. But just talk about how it has been with the focus on product-led growth, what has been the approach to attract larger customers? And has it been more challenging? Or is it in line with your expectations?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I'd say, first, we remain primarily dependent on our direct sales channel. That is our primary go-to-market. That will be the case for the foreseeable future. And so the execution that you're seeing in the numbers is a result of that. I'm particularly happy with the customers and renewal management team we delivered, as we mentioned, another quarter of strong on-time renewals. Also, a huge emphasis all throughout the pre-sales, sales and post-sales process on adoption of features that make our products more sticky and more valuable to customers. And as Blake alluded to, we saw nice progress there. As we look ahead, it will be critical to continue that transformation of the sales organization, given the expanding breadth of our product offering and they need to pitch at an even higher level. But I'm very bullish on the progress that our direct team is making. I'd be remiss if I didn't also mention I think we made a significant adjustment, as you will recall, in February, with restructuring effort. 95% of that effort was in the field organization. And yet, we, I think, are continuing to be able to execute. So that speaks highly, I think, of the management team's effort there. I'd just add beyond the direct sales execution, as I mentioned, is primary, there are two other points, the digital part, where we are seeing really good progress, and that business is growing a little bit faster, and I'm very pleased with the progress there. And then the third leg of the stool is our partner channel and we are starting to ship features that will enable us to grow that channel so that we can have a really nice omnichannel direct self-serve and partner. Good luck.\nLuv Sodha: Perfect. Yes, just had a quick follow-up for Blake. Just on the net dollar retention, Blake, just -- I know you said it would trend down a little bit further from the 1% or 2%. But any indication as to when we could potentially see some stabilization in that metric?\nBlake Grayson: Yes, sure. So just a reminder and then it's also for me as I'm learning the business. The DNR, the dollar net retention, is only for our direct customers and only for those with a tenure of at least a year. Our kind of communications on this figure is in line with our previous communications regarding the trends. And as covered in the prepared remarks you heard me say we do expect continued pressure into Q3. In a tough macro environment where companies are scrutinizing investments, it can lead to smaller expansion opportunities. And this is really why the product development focus for us and the road map is so important because that's how we can try to provide chances to impact that trend and that's exclusive of macro forecast. So for us to impact that number, that's kind of that longer-term product road map that we can drive to essentially be able to provide customers the chance and opportunity to do more with us to provide them better ROIs and better productivity opportunities. And we've got a lot of initiatives underway to try and make progress there. But with regards to trying to call any time further out beyond Q3, we're not prepared to talk about that at this time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Radke with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTyler Radke: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just get your perspective, Blake, and congrats on the role here. On the international opportunity, you highlighted that as a big opportunity that you saw coming on board. But how are you thinking about the size of that business potentially over time? And any thoughts on potential investments that you can make to better go after that? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. I think from just my history, one of the experiences that I bring and just the perspective is the international business and in a previous role at Amazon, I led finance for the international group there. And the TAM outside of North America is huge and yet it only flex 25%, 26% of our total revenue. So I think the opportunity for us over the long term there, there's no reason why that shouldn't grow as a percent of the total. I think that you've heard Allan talk about the expansion opportunities. We just opened an office in Munich in Germany. And so we are making investments there, and we are seeing those green shoots opportunity. So it's a process for us, right? And when we talk about product development, we talk about product development globally. It's not like a North America only kind of endeavor. And so when we do that and we keep a focus on the global nature of this business, I'm cautiously optimistic that we have an opportunity to really expand our footprint there.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Maybe I can add a little bit more color there. So on the product side, let's take Germany as an example. We launched the ID Verification for EU qualified last quarter. We are qualified for trust provider in the EU. And it puts us in a very unique and strong market position. And the German market is particularly sensitive to those regulatory issues. One of the things we're launching and we previewed it at Momentum Conference is a wallet capability or essentially, once you locked in once with this IT system, you can auto log-in in the future, further reducing the friction added by having more security. And that's been the traditional risk trade-off that companies have faced. So we're, I think, very optimistic about our position in the German market. And as Blake mentioned, we just booked an office there, and I'm going there again next Sunday. In Japan, we're at an even earlier stage of market development. And just at the end of August, we launched a fully localized CLM, which I believe is the first Western-style CLM introduced in Japan, and there's a lot of interest and appetite for that. I was in Tokyo a few weeks ago. We're very bullish on the opportunity in the Japanese market as well. So beyond the markets where we can invest at that level, we will use our self-serve and partner channels to ensure that we're available essentially everywhere where agreements are signed.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thanks for the color and a follow-up question just on underlying growth. And certainly, there was some interesting slides in the presentation. But if I look at four quarter trailing billings quarter, sorry, rolling four-quarter billings growth. It seems like billings growth over the last four quarters has been stabilizing in the low double-digits. You saw subscription growth only decel about one point this quarter. Do you feel like the business is kind of stabilizing here? How should we just think about the normalized growth environment as you kind of process the puts and takes in the quarter? Thank you.\nBlake Grayson: Sure. And I'll take a stab and Allan will jump in, I'm sure if he wants to add any color. So yes, generally, really pleased with how Q2 performed. But like you heard in the prepared remarks, we still have work to do ahead of us. We did double-digit billings and revenue growth year-over-year in Q2. Customers are adopting five or more features -- direct customers are adopting five or more features at an increasing pace year-over-year. Our total customer count grew double-digits year-over-year. International grew well. And we also produced really strong free cash flow for the quarter. We generated $187 million free cash flow of a pretty large foundational base of customers. And obviously, we need to work on retention rates and drive growth, but a decent quarter for us. I think with regard to the future, there are puts and takes every quarter with that billings number. And I appreciate that you're using the four-quarter trailing number. I think that's a good way to look at it. Over Q1 and Q2, we have that strength in on-time renewals, right? And it's forecasted to continue, but there is pressure, as we've previously mentioned, around lower expansion rates and some macro uncertainty. And so that billings number can be a little volatile. I would say that the full year guide that we just announced for billings is actually a bit stronger than it was our last quarter. So for me, as I think about the business and what I'm most focused on is how do we turn the chapter to a new period of growth, we have to be focused on the long-term on continuous product innovation that can drive that future expansion. And that takes some time. But again, this is -- we have a very large kind of core fundamental base book of business, that's the free cash flow generator. But for us, going forward, we're excited to deliver on a product road map that we believe over the long term can deliver growth opportunities.\nAllan Thygesen: I think that's well said, Blake. I would just add. I think this is a transformational year for DocuSign where we're making the investments to enable the next phase of growth. We're happy that we're able to sustain the business nicely. But we're not satisfied with that, and we are planning and executing towards further acceleration in the years to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJake Roberge: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Has the macro started to impact the top of funnel at all or most of the headwinds still related to just that expansion motion? And then how is linear demand throughout the quarter. Have there been noticeable changes on the macro front, especially as we've gone through July and August?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. And I'll take a stab. Let me try to address your last question first. I think on the linearity, it's generally in line with our historical trends. Monthly results can be volatile in this business just due to our sales cycle. What I would say is that the linearity trends, if you will, they're already reflected in our guide. So nothing material to call out from a linearity perspective. I think on the macro component for us, the expansion, I think, is the biggest part. And you -- as I referred to before, we have a very large base of business, over 1.4 million customer accounts. And so that, I think, is on the expansion side is what is probably the more impactful component and you can see that in the DNR rate.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I think I spot on that. I would simply add that the relative strength in our digital business, I think, reflects that the SMB segment is doing well. And that is new customer acquisition. I think it reinforces the themes that Blake was talking about.\nJake Roberge: Helpful. And then Allan, you made quite a bit of organizational changes over the past year with two riffs, a new CFO, Head of Sales and President. Do you feel like the structural changes are behind us at this point? And then when do you think those changes start bearing more fruit for DocuSign just as a broader or just given those changes likely take a few quarters, if not years to play out?\nAllan Thygesen: So you're absolutely correct. We've made a substantial effort over the last 15 to 18 months to attract a world-class leadership team that has deep experience, but it's also hungry for the excitement and the challenge of DocuSign's next chapter. I'm really happy with who we've been able to attract. I think it speaks to the opportunity into DocuSign's brand and the quality of the company. The kinds of folks that we've been able to attract not just after I arrived, but also prior. I do think we have a relatively full team now, both directly reporting to me and in fact, in the next couple of layers. I don't have any open positions, the top two layers for me, and that's not been the case for a long time. So I think we're really making good progress also in filling in some of the key leadership roles at the next level. So I feel like the organization is now more ready and poised to fully capitalize on the opportunity ahead of us. In terms of how that plays into that's -- that is the enabler for and the requirement for both the product road map, the GTM transformation and then the growth in the outer years. So we didn't do that first. We couldn't make progress on the other things.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: Great. Thank you so much and I wanted to ask a question around the international strength you're seeing. Any countries you'd call out there? And as you've been investing in international, are there any regions that we should expect to see perhaps some incremental traction from here?\nBlake Grayson: I'll just comment. Regionally, I wouldn't say there's necessarily one standout versus the rest. But I just think we had general strength outside of North America, which I actually appreciate because it just goes to the kind of notion about the product and the value offering that we have. And so how do we expand that larger going further. And I think also that as far as like new plans and new regions, we'll take that on a case-by-case basis. I think it's the one nice thing for us, I think, in this business is the marginal cost to expand is not terribly large, right, with us. And so for us, it's opening a sales office and the kind of thing, and you want to have the situation laid out appropriately in order to have the right leadership and scale and things like that. But I don't have anything with that individual countries to reference other than the anecdotes that Allan already provided around Asia and Europe.\nAllan Thygesen: But in general, I'd say I think all the international regions, Europe, APAC, LatAm, all grew double-digits.\nBlake Grayson: Yes. It was strong across the world is what I would say for us. Internationally, we're pleased with our international progress regardless of the region.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes.\nBrad Sills: Great to hear. And then just with regard to the restructuring effort and the direct sales organization, do you feel like -- Allan, I think your comments are that you feel like you got the right team in place. But are the efforts to restructure the existing organization? Is that largely in the past, do you feel like you're kind of set up now such that you're kind of in a place where the plan -- the organization in place from here can execute? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: We don't have any plans for any major restructurings of our sales organizations. I mean, obviously, you're always tuning things and I think we're continuing to evolve that, but nothing major and nothing that would -- we could be on the scale or considered like a risk or anything like that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, great. Thanks. Maybe a couple for Blake. Blake, if you don't mind unpacking the 3Q billings guide, it obviously implies down $33 million. I know we had that phenomenon two years ago, but it's typically up sequentially. Is this a function of the greater on-time renewals? Anything else that you might flag around that?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. Yes, the guide reflects continued the trends that we're seeing in the on-time renewals. The function of the on-time renewals for us is that every customer situation is different, right? Deals can renew on time, they can be renewed early or they can be pushed out. So every quarter puts and takes on that. The first half of the year has been strong due to sales execution. There are deals that may normally have slipped out to Q3 and they -- that closed in Q2. And so that's a positive. But renewal is, obviously, well, super important for us and really drive that foundational free cash flow generation, it's more of a timing thing than it is for on the growth side. And I think the positive to note for us on the on-time renewals is that we're not relying on discounts or incentives to drive that improvement in that on-time renewals. It's better sales execution. And so the teams were really hard just to stay on top of those things when they come up for renewals because an on-time renewal is just a deal that renews on schedule. And so that's super strong. And with regards to the guide as far as other pressures, that's just the macro pressures we discussed earlier with the DNR like essentially the net retention components and now the pressures that we're seeing there.\nKarl Keirstead: Yes. Okay. Makes sense. And one more, Blake. Your predecessor, it was never a formal guidance, obviously, around operating cash flow. But the kind of the soft color was that it might land for this fiscal year, a couple of points below operating margins. Is that still roughly your framework as to where cash flow margins might shake out this year?\nBlake Grayson: Yes. I'm not in a place where I want to kind of guide to a specific cash flow margin, so to speak. I think for me, what I'm looking for to the business is a long-term cash generation company that drives profitable sustainable growth. I think that the fact that we've delivered 100 -- I think $211 million of cash flow of operations, $184 million of free cash flow, those were pretty healthy yields. And you'll see those fluctuate in the quarter based on timing and such. But it's a cash generation -- generating business and model that, as a CFO, I'm selfishly super excited about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Baer: Great. Thank you for the question. I had one more just to clarify on the topic of on-time renewals. So that was part of what drove billings upside this quarter, but now you're saying that the guidance now reflects sort of the same level of on-time renewals. So is that right that there's kind of been a change in how you're incorporating the idea of on-time renewals into guidance? And now if things stay the same in Q3, you wouldn't see upside to billings?\nBlake Grayson: Right. So I'll try to clarify this a bit more, I'm learning this as we go. The thing with on-time renewals is that essentially doing an on-time renewal that maybe in the prior year was pushed out affects your ability to continue that momentum. So it's a timing situation. And so with that strength in the first half, even though you have execution that continues, it's just you kind of run out of room a little bit on it. So it's really more of a timing situation than a growth opportunity. So that's why you see that. And the guidance -- and again, that was in the previously communicated guidance last quarter, and we actually increased the full year guide for this year. So it's all been in there in the guidance, but it's just that nuance of how on time flows through.\nJosh Baer: Okay. Got it. And then one more just on sort of the big picture agreement process and workflows. I was just wondering, are there certain departments or workflows where DocuSign should own that full agreement process versus others where maybe like the basic DocuSign eSignature is integrated into like in HR onboarding or some other departmental or workflow? How to think about the two different possibilities there? Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I would say people use DocuSign for all kinds of workflows. But it was going to pick areas where we had a particularly strong early start. From a vertical perspective, obviously, in the finance and real estate area that was very strong. Then, I'd say, moved on to all forms of B2B sales were very enabled by DocuSign, and we see that a lot. And now we're seeing quite a few HR applications, as you alluded to. So we have strong partnerships there with Workday, with SuccessFactors and a lot of deployments in that. And in procurement. Particularly these days, enterprises are very focused on procurement management and automating that process and making it more efficient and more transparent. We see more adoption there as well. So as an example, a lot of our strength in the pharma space comes from procurement use cases. We have a fantastic relationship to pick a different one with NVIDIA, who uses DocuSign both for eSignature and for CLM. And it's really focused on their supply chain efforts. So really, at this point, it's very broad across all the major enterprise workflows and many industries, practically all industries. But we started in different -- we had some industries that were fixed starters for the eSignature movement, if you will. But at this point, it's pretty broad. Does that help?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jackson Ader with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nJackson Ader: Great. Thanks for taking our questions, guys. First one on the product set or the feature set. It's much broader and deeper than it was even just a couple of years ago. And I understand, given the macro environment, probably hard to pass or to expect to get all the value you've been putting in the products back from your customers. But I'm curious, how are you making sure that once the macro headwinds subside that you don't put $10 of value into the product and only get $5 back, right, just to make up numbers?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. It's certainly a fair push. What I would say what we've done here over the last nine months or so is really pick up the pace of innovation and product release adding half to our core products. I think the big transformation of DocuSign into this broader agreement platform and the intelligence layer is still ahead of us. We previewed some of that at both the vision and some early releases at Momentum. If you haven't already watched the Momentum keynotes, it's found on our website, it gives a really good overview of where we're heading. So just as an example of things that I think are to come that make this really a more at-scale holistic platform things like orchestration, where we are enabling customers to dynamically assemble workflows related to agreements. Components of every part of the DocuSign every one of our interfaces to third-party ISV applications, I think, is going to be incredibly powerful and re-architecting how agreements get done. That's an example. I think Enterprise Search was something that we will begin to. We will begin to roll out in Q4, and that is being able to do that semantically across your entire agreement base. So to use an example, let's imagine that you're looking for force majeure in your contracts. Today, that would be a large team of lawyers spending months going through all your agreements. We can deliver that and have the AI dynamically interpret all the symptoms and ways in which that might be expressed and give you all the agreements that are relevant to that query. That's really transformational capability that we do not provide today. So I just want to say that, to-date, many of these releases have been complementary to our -- to the products that we've been shipping for a while. And they're great. And I think we're -- it's giving us even more of a market leadership position. But the broader repositioning of DocuSign as the enabler of creator of this agreement workflow and agreement intelligence model is still to come. And we will begin, I think, delivering against that later this year and then all throughout next year. And so I think we have so much runway ahead of us from a product perspective.\nJackson Ader: Okay. Great. And then a quick follow-up. Blake, what should like what's the plan or what should we expect for stock-based comp? I'm surprised to see it up year-over-year just given the trend in headcount?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. So stock-based comp as a percentage of revenue in Q2 is about 22%. And that's held relatively steady for us. We review that number with our outside compensation, consultants were slightly higher than our average peer group. The driver on the year-over-year increase has a lot to do with the new leadership folks that we've brought on to the team. And so you'll see -- me being one of those people, and you'll see that. And so it is something we're definitely paying attention to and mindful of, but that's the gap when you're asking about between headcount and cost. And so that will take time, obviously, but we'll work through that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a solid quarter. I guess, two for me. The first one, I want to go back to the question around net retention because, I think, it's really, really important. To some extent, how much of the net retention dynamic is under your control, meaning how much of it is a macro pressure versus competition and consolidation or repair loss effectively? And I ask that because to some extent, your -- you've already released a number of really interesting new products in market, CLM+, CLM, the Identity product that you talked about. So is there any way to kind of just give us some confidence around like what level to the question earlier, it shouldn't dip below or like when -- how many quarters after the cohorts that you're comping kind of normalize that we should start seeing it at least be stable?\nBlake Grayson: Sure. It's awfully challenging for me to try to look into that crystal ball and tell you on the cohort side. What I would say is I think you've nailed it in your question that it's a combination, right? We have a combination of macro kind of effects that essentially as customers scrutinize their investments and they're trying to save every dollar they can what do they do. But then it's also combined with that, we have it under our control that if we can execute and provide products that customers want and over time we expand, it gives us that opportunity for expansion. So I think it's a double kind of a component that affects that rate. And so it's -- part of its under our control and part of it's also is the macro environment. But at the end of the day, I feel like if we can execute on that product road map over time, it kind of destinies in our hands. Allan will probably maybe add more to that.\nAllan Thygesen: No, I agree. I set with that. And look, we've said that it was going to be a few quarters of downward trend, and then we will see how we do with the product release system, but we certainly want to get it to a healthier level. And it's our expectation that we'll be able to do that. So that's much as we can say at this point.\nAlex Zukin: Okay. That makes sense. And I guess the other question is, again, it feels like a bit of a tale of kind of two cities, right? To some extent, you've got the double-digit growth, both in billings and in CRPO and subscription revenue. But then to the question Karl asked, like your guidance implies billings in the very low single-digit range in the second half. It implies that even subscription revenue growth kind of goes down into the 6% range exiting the year. And I appreciate the conservatism we do love it. But if you think about the business itself and that's why that NRR question comes back. The Street has you accelerating in Q1, right, and to some extent, accelerating next year. So just help us level set like that exit rate that you're looking at for Q4, what would be the factors that you would be expecting to kind of have to see for it to kind of get better from there?\nBlake Grayson: Right. So again, I mean, our full year guide is in line or better than it was in the previous quarter. So we're staying in line or better in that guidance. I think that like we've talked about and referenced a couple of times on the call that the strength in the on-time renewals is what has driven that outperformance in the first half of the year. And so -- and then the pressure like you noted on DNR expansion rates and macro uncertain, it creates volatility for us. And frankly, over the long term, and I'm not putting a time line on that, but it's how do we reaccelerate growth and particularly around the product innovation that we have in front of us. And so as a company, I would tell you that 70-plus percent of our time as a leadership team is on how do we evolve this product road map in a way that customers like appreciate and provides us the opportunities for expansion. And so that's what we're solely focused on. We believe that if we can deliver on that road map, the results will show themselves.\nAllan Thygesen: I agree with that. And I would just say, in my mind, the best thing that happened this quarter, yes, I'm proud of the solid execution, kudos to the team. But the fact that we were able to present our vision and road map to customers and partners, and that they validated -- enthusiastically validated that everywhere I went. I was incredibly gratifying and tells us I think we're on the right path. So I think we're very bullish on the long-term future for DocuSign. And I think that bullishness just became more pronounced as a result of the sharing of the road map and the feedback that we got. So that is our goal is to deliver against that. And I think if we do that, all will be very -- all will be well.\nAllan Thygesen: Maybe to close. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. We're pleased with the results and feedback and we're driving transformation here at DocuSign. We want to balance our product investments with operational efficiency and drive shareholder value. Thank you for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day."

I'd now like to turn the call over to Allan. Allan?\nAllan Thygesen: Thanks, Heather, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to have delivered a solid start to the fiscal year, reporting financial metrics that exceeded our guidance. We announced new product innovations to enable smarter, easier, trusted agreement workflows. First, some highlights from this quarter's financial results. Q1 total revenue came in at $661 million, up 12% versus prior year. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin came in at a healthy 27%, driven by our continued focus on profitability and efficiency. We're pleased with the early traction we're making against our objectives. However, we do continue to operate in a challenging macro environment with cautious customer sentiment, evident in moderating expansion rates. Last quarter, I shared our plans to accelerate our product release cycles in fiscal 2024. What you'll see is that our roadmap builds on DocuSign's strength as the world's leading e-signature company while also moving us towards enabling the entire agreement journey with intelligent workflows. We're deepening these capabilities to deliver more strategic value to our customers. With that, let me touch on three new releases that shipped this quarter. First, as mentioned on the Q4 call, DocuSign Web Forms launched in April. In the first few weeks since launch, we're seeing strong traction for Web Forms across verticals, including financial services, real estate, healthcare and life sciences, leveraging our differentiated approach to streamlining how agreements are generated. Web Forms are simple and powerful for both senders and signers. They're easy to use and customers benefit from the ability to more easily capture and leverage data from their agreements. Next, we made strong progress penetrating and innovating in highly regulated markets. One example is our work in the healthcare vertical, which is undergoing dramatic digital transformation. We're proud that our e-signature product can now seamlessly connect to electronic health records in the U.S. market, including from Epic and Cerner in accordance with industry standards. This will modernize the patient experience and improve efficiency for healthcare companies, while also deepening DocuSign's presence within the vertical. And finally, we introduced DocuSign ID Verification Premier, our tier of ID solutions which meet the highest levels of trust, security and compliance. Our first offering within this tier is ID verification for EU Qualified e-signature. By combining verification of an ID with confirmation of the presence of the person on the ID, it fully replaces face-to-face verifications and a handwritten signature under EU law. We look forward to leveraging this powerful offering as we expand our business in Europe. More broadly, our strategy is to partner closely with leading identity services companies to leverage -- to integrate the best breed solutions into our platform. Looking ahead, I'd like to share our vision and thinking on generative AI. In brief, we believe AI unlocks the true potential of the intelligent agreement category. We already have a strong track record, leveraging sophisticated AI models, having built and shipped solutions based on earlier generations of AI. Generative AI can transform all aspects of agreement workflow, and we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on this opportunity. As an early example, we recently introduced a new limited availability feature Agreement Summarization. This new feature, which is enabled by our integration with Microsoft's Azure OpenAI service and tuned with our own proprietary agreement model, uses AI to summarize and documents critical components, giving signers a clear grasp of the most relevant information within their agreement while respecting data security and privacy. Future launches will include search across customer agreement libraries, extractions from agreements and proposed language and edits based on customer, industry and universal best practices. DocuSign is a trusted partner to leading companies across many industries. As the leader in agreement workflows, we can use AI to deliver important value to customers by leveraging the world's largest set of agreement data, our proprietary agreement models and deep integrations with best-in-class third-party models. We're excited to showcase new products and enhancements at our -- on our intelligent agreement roadmap, including significant AI-powered innovations at our user conference Momentum. The event will kick off next week in Santa Clara with virtual and in-person events in eight cities around the globe over the next few months. Turning to our initiatives around our omnichannel go-to-market. We are continuing to drive deep relationships within our partner ecosystem and enhancing our AI capabilities. We were honored to be showcased in the main keynote of Microsoft's Build Conference as one of the first companies using Microsoft Azure OpenAI. This further underscores our growing relationship with Microsoft and the opportunities we're seeing to enhance our AI capabilities. During the quarter, we also joined the SAP Endorsed Apps program. E-signature has been rigorously tested and validated by SAP to ensure that it seamlessly integrates with SAP solutions and meets their high standards for quality and performance. We're pleased with the progress we're seeing across our partner ecosystem, which will continue to drive further adoption of our products globally. Last quarter, I shared how we are investing in product-led growth and self-serve capabilities in order to drive more go-to-market efficiency and deliver a better experience for our customers. This is one of our most important areas of investment as we evolve how DocuSign goes to market and further integrate our digital, direct and partner selling motions. Our digital business had stronger relative performance in Q1 as we launched a number of improvements on our website and within our product experience. These changes were designed to grow traffic, improve conversion rates and drive monetization, and it's just the beginning. Whether it's a small business or a large enterprise, our vision is to make it easy for every type of customer to buy and consume our products in any way they prefer, self-serve, through our direct sales teams or through a partner. Turning to our go-to-market execution in the first quarter. We're pleased with how our field team navigated the distractions in Q1 as we rebalanced our approach. However, we are seeing more moderate pipeline and cautious customer behavior, coupled with smaller deal sizes and lower volumes. We recognize it's a dynamic competitive environment across multiple categories. We're confident in our premium positioning, especially in complex and high-value use cases. As we've stated, international expansion remains a largely untapped opportunity for us. We're making investments not only with market-specific product innovation like identity verification, but also in stronger local market presence to strengthen our footprint. We recently released funding to further invest in Germany and Japan. And in Japan, note, we just went live with our first CLM customer this past quarter. Further supporting our focus on the international expansion, I'm pleased to share that Anna Marrs, Group President of Global Commercial Services and Credit & Fraud Risk at American Express, has joined our Board of Directors and as a member of the Audit Committee. She is a fantastic operating executive with deep global experience and will be a great asset to the Board and the leadership team. Finally, I am thrilled with the key hires we've announced to round out our leadership team. Most notably, Blake Grayson will be joining as DocuSign's new CFO next week. Blake's considerable track record and experience in finance leadership roles in category-leading public companies, including Amazon and The Trade Desk, make him a very strong addition to the DocuSign leadership team. I'd also like to take this opportunity to once again thank, you, Cynthia, for her tremendous contributions to DocuSign as both a Board member and as our CFO for the last four-and-a-half years. I'm grateful for her partnership and strategic leadership as the company navigated immense change. In closing, we had a solid start to the year with strong financial results, continued traction on the key pillars of our strategic vision to transform agreement workflows and intelligence and in rounding out our leadership team with high-caliber talent. We look forward to continuing to share progress as we execute against our initiatives this year. Now, let me turn the call over to Cynthia to walk through our financial results and outlook.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you, Allan, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We had a solid start to the year, exceeding our top-line and operating margin guidance. We made progress during the quarter against our priority initiatives and demonstrated leverage in our operating model. We remain focused on delivering value for our customers with easy-to-use high ROI products, which in today's macro environment continues to be increasingly important as customers look for ways to drive more efficiency in their businesses. With that, let me turn to our Q1 fiscal '24 results. For the first quarter, total revenue increased 12% year-over-year to $661 million, and subscription revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $639 million. Our international revenue grew 17% year-over-year and reached $168 million for the first quarter, representing 25% of revenue. First quarter billings rose 10% year-over-year to $675 million. As a reminder, billings can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter due to the timing of deals and complexion of renewals. The macro environment continues to create uncertainty for our customers, and we're seeing the impact of smaller deal sizes and lower expansion rates across the business as customers scrutinize budgets. Q1 billings outperformance was driven by a higher rate of on-time renewals. We are encouraged by initial signs of improved sales execution across our installed base. We added approximately 45,000 new customers during the quarter, bringing our total customer base to 1.4 million, a 13% increase year-over-year. This includes the addition of approximately 9,000 direct customers to reach a total direct customer base of 220,000, a 21% year-on-year increase. We also saw a 20% year-over-year increase in customers with an annualized contract value greater than $300,000, reaching a total of 1,063 customers. The slight decline quarter-on-quarter was primarily driven by customer buying patterns, lower expansion rates and partial churn. Dollar net retention was 105% for the quarter. We continue to see headwinds impacting our expansion rates coupled with muted customer buying patterns in a tough macro environment as budgets remain under scrutiny and customers optimize existing spend. Looking ahead, we expect the Q2 dollar net retention rate to continue to experience downward pressure. From a vertical perspective, we saw pockets of relative strength within insurance and business services, highlighting the importance of our diverse customer base and durability of our model, while we continue to see headwinds across financial services and real estate. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 83% compared with 81% a year ago. First quarter subscription gross margin was 85% compared with 84% a year ago. Q1 non-GAAP operating income reached $176 million compared with $102 million last year. We delivered a record non-GAAP operating margin of 27% compared to 17% last year. This year-on-year improvement demonstrates our focus on profitability and the leverage in our business model. We remain committed to investing in a disciplined way to transform broader agreement workflows that will drive our top-line over time. As we move through the year and execute against our operating plan, we expect a quarterly decrease in operating margin. Non-GAAP net income for Q1 was $150 million compared with $77 million in the first quarter of 2023. The fiscal 2024 non-GAAP tax rate remains at 20%. Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $0.72. We ended Q1 with 6,586 employees compared to 7,642 the year prior. Operating cash flow in the first quarter grew 19% year-over-year to a record high of $234 million or a 35% margin. This compares with $196 million or 33% in the same quarter a year ago. Q1 collections were at an all-time high, benefiting from seasonality and enhanced automation and operational efficiency. Operating cash flow includes one-time cash expenses of $20 million in Q1 related to the 2024 restructuring plan we announced in February. Free cash flow for the quarter was $215 million or a 32% margin compared to $175 million or 30% in the prior year, a 23% year-on-year increase. We exited Q1 with more than $1.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investments. Turning to our share repurchase program. We repurchased over 700,000 shares during the quarter for approximately $40 million, which demonstrates our confidence in the durability of our business. As a reminder, we have strong cash flow and an attractive balance sheet that gives us flexibility to optimize our capital structure with a focus on opportunistically returning capital to our shareholders. With that, let me turn to our Q2 and fiscal '24 guidance. While we are pleased with our Q1 financial results, it is still early in the year, and we remain cautious in our outlook, given moderating expansion rates and slowing customer demand, driven by the uncertainty in the current macro environment and continued competition, particularly in more basic e-signature use cases. For the second quarter and fiscal year '24, we anticipate total revenue of $675 million to $679 million in Q2 or growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year, and $2.713 billion to $2.725 billion for fiscal '24 or a growth of 8% year-on-year. Of this, we expect subscription revenue of $658 million to $662 million in Q2 or growth of 9% year-on-year and $2.64 billion to $2.652 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 8% to 9% year-over-year. For billings, we expect $646 million to $656 million in Q2 or flat to 1% growth year-over-year, and $2.737 billion to $2.757 billion for fiscal '24 or growth of 3% to 4% year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be 81% to 82% for both Q2 and fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP operating margin to reach 24% to 25% for Q2 and 22% to 24% for fiscal '24. We expect non-GAAP fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding of 207 million to 212 million for both Q2 and fiscal '24. We're pleased with the financial results in Q1, along with the resilience and focus the team has demonstrated as we continue to evolve the business. We maintain a disciplined and focused approach to delivering profitability at scale as we invest for the long term. In closing, I want to thank our amazing team for their commitment to delivering for our customers and partners and driving forward the vision for smarter, easier and trusted agreements. On a personal note, the last four-and-a-half years has been an incredible adventure, helping the company operationalize tremendous growth at scale, while providing a stabilizing force through unprecedented change. I'm looking forward to what comes next and to seeing DocuSign continue to be the innovator of defining how the world agrees. With that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Tyler Radke with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.\nKylie Towbin: Hi. This is Kylie Towbin on for Tyler Radke. First off, Cynthia, just wanted to say congratulations, and thank you for your time, and you'll be missed. And on that note too with Blake starting next week and the additions of Dmitri and Kurt too, would love to hear about sort of all of their biggest areas of initial focus. Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Well, so, Blake will, obviously, step into Cynthia's shoes and take on the CFO responsibilities. So, this will be about executing our operating plan, helping us uncover both top-line and bottom-line opportunities and, in general, executing our strategic roadmap. I think Dmitri will lead our product teams, so reporting to Inhi Cho Suh, President of Product & Technology. He has very deep strong background from a number of different enterprise software companies and he's been a real category creator and innovator. We're thrilled to have attracted him. Obviously, product vision and leadership is incredibly important to our future. So, this is a key hire for us and we're delighted to have Dmitri on board. And Kurt is leading our security organization, which has enormous implications both from a risk and compliance perspective. We have a particular given the nature of our business of managing highly sensitive documents and processes, it's essential that we maintain the trust of our customers. I think we've done a good job of that so far, but I think Kurt will -- it's a critical role with, obviously, responsibility to maintain and further grow that as we delve deeper into agreement workflows.\nKylie Towbin: Great. Thanks. And just one more of maybe for Cynthia. With the 8 point beat on billings this quarter, how did the early renewals trend relative to your expectations? And with the full year raised a little bit less than the beat, is it fair to say that the amount you raised guidance was operational beat and the rest was potentially pull forward? Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, thanks, Kylie, and thanks for the kind words. So, I think we were really pleased with the performance in Q1 and particularly on billings. The beat on billings was mainly due to strengths we saw in on-time renewals, which means the team did a great job executing across our installed base. And so, we saw less on the early renewal front. And so that is factored into the guide. So, I would say that's probably the driving force of what we're seeing. When you think about kind of the push through on the guide, I would say that's really colored by the dynamics we're currently seeing in the business and some of the softness that I talked about in the prepared remarks around expansion rates and some of the other metrics. So, we think the guide is reasonable for what we're seeing, but the Q1 beat was mainly driven by on-time renewals in the installed base.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBrad Sills: Sorry, I think I was on mute. My apologies.\nCynthia Gaylor: No worries.\nBrad Sills: Sorry. The question is on...\nCynthia Gaylor: Hey, Brad. How you doing?\nBrad Sills: Good. Great. And good luck, Cynthia. It's been great working with you. I wanted to ask a question around Agreement Cloud. I know it's still early here. But where is the focus there? There are some components that I believe are already -- you're already well positioned for upsell on to the base like eNotary and Analyzer. So, just curious if that's an area of focus increasingly from here. Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. So, we are focused on delivering a full suite of workflow tools across the agreement journey, and then an intelligence layer that for -- that can assist really at every stage. I think we've shipped components of that in the past, but I think we're really looking to bring all of that together and fully fill out that suite, if you will. We'll do a lot of that work this year. Some of the releases that you saw in Q1, very much emblematic of that. I'd add to that I think the biggest change in our roadmap beyond that clear focus and articulation on agreement workflow is really the advent of generative AI. We've been working on AI for several years. As you know, we have products like Insights that leverage earlier generations of AI models. But given the enormous change there, that's a fantastic opportunity to really unlock the category. And so, we're investing very heavily there. We released some new products, and we'll release more next week at Momentum, but I'm sure we'll talk more about AI during the call. So, I'll stop there.\nBrad Sills: Sounds exciting. Thank you, Allan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. Cynthia, could you just remind us what is it mechanically that causes subscription revenue to decline a little sequentially in Q1 and then returning to some amount of sequential growth in Q2? I know there was an element of -- similar to that last year, but I'm just wondering if there is anything anomalous in Q1, or is that a pattern that would recur seasonally as we get into Q1 of next year?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So, Q1, a good observation, it's mainly due to the number of days. There's fewer days in the quarter in Q1. So, this Q1 had a few less days than other quarters. And so, that's the main factor there. I think the revenue per day is up, but the function of days in the quarter impacts that for this particular Q1.\nMark Murphy: Okay. And just as a quick follow-up, how is the behavior if you drill down into the real estate verticals? And if you think about it across residential -- both residential and commercial, is there any sign there that might cause you to think there could be some firming up as -- perhaps as interest rates stabilize or just having better performance in the equity markets? Is there any signaling there that is creating a sense of stability or optimism maybe as you get closer to the second half?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. I mean, it's a good question and we're certainly not economists. But I would say in general, in our prepared remarks, we covered this, but they are macro. We are seeing kind of customer sentiment across the base. I think, for DocuSign, we have a diversified customer base, which really helps us in up and down markets. I would say, real estate and pockets of financial services continue to be softer than some of the other verticals like manufacturing or business services, which were stronger. So, I would just say, I don't know that we can prognosticate like what the future holds there, but we do have a diversified customer base that does help insulate our business given the long tail there. But real estate definitely is continuing to show softness along with other sectors or sub-sectors that have interest rates or mortgage exposure in this environment.\nMark Murphy: Okay. Thank you. And congrats on the nice execution in Q1.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Allan, just following up on the overall environment, I mean, would you characterize what you're seeing now is pretty consistent with what you saw last quarter? Or if things stabilized, maybe improved a little bit? Just trying to understand the shape of what you've seen quarter-over-quarter.\nAllan Thygesen: I think the macro environment is relatively consistent. And, yes, we, I would say, digging in a little deeper. If you look at it, let's start with segments, maybe slightly better performance in the SMB segment than in the enterprise segment. I think part of that is larger companies just tend to be more immediately sensitive to the business cycle. They also have centralized purchasing departments and other ways of, I should say, tightening spending in a very directed way. So that subtle change, let's say, maybe slightly more pronounced this quarter than previous quarter. We continue to grow faster internationally than domestically, but I don't think that that's a material change. And from a vertical perspective, as Cynthia mentioned, some strength, but I think those are much the same sectors that we're doing a little better last time and parts of financial services, obviously, a little bit more challenged. But by no means all, by the way. So it's localized, let's say, a real estate and a few other things. So overall, it's a pretty balanced picture. I wouldn't say there were major changes in our environment. We are, of course, hoping to induce more change in the environment for our product roadmap. And we're excited with the new releases that we had and you'll see a very rapid pace of new releases over the next few quarters. And so, you have to disrupt that beyond the macro.\nBrent Thill: Great. And just a quick follow-up for Cynthia. 27% margin in the quarter, yet you're guiding 23% for the year. Why such a big step down throughout the year?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So, I mean, we outperformed margins by quite a bit in Q1. And I think it really does demonstrate what we've been talking about for a while now, which is leveraging our business model. It's amazing when you don't spend money, you can make a lot of money. But that being said, we're focused on profitability, but also executing on the investments in a disciplined way and I think you kind of saw that in Q1. However, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our expectation is to continue to invest as we move through the year. We got a little bit slower start as we kind of evaluated coming into the year to that spend, but we expect to kind of catch up, and so when you get to the end of the year, by quarter, the margin should go down by quarter, which is implied in our guide. But then also the run rate and [bow wave] (ph) going into next year, like, we'll be fully invested against that. So that's the -- that's our process. But we'll be disciplined. We're still in the long-term target range, and we're raising the year by 1 point relative to where we were 90 days ago. So, we're really pleased with that, but we will invest for the long-term opportunity.\nBrent Thill: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on good execution in the quarter. Maybe just the first one, Allan, you kind of teased on wanting to talk a little bit more about AI. So, I'll kind of zoom out a little bit and just ask, if you think about the priority list for the company to reinvigorate the growth engine, stack rank in your mind, like is it new products? Is it AI monetization? Is it the PLV opening up kind of the umbrella? Like, stack rank, if you would, your strategic thought process on how to kind of reaccelerate growth for the business? And then, I've just got a quick follow-up.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, it's a good question. I mean, I think these things all impact us in different timeframes, right? So, I think we -- overall, I would say, product innovation is going to be the biggest driver and unlocker of our medium- to long-term growth. We do believe that we have very credible low-hanging fruit from better execution on our self-serve and product-led growth motion, and so that's a top priority to drive greater efficiency in the near to medium term. I think the AI impact is perhaps the biggest in the long term. And we are starting to ship products, as I alluded to, and we'll announce more next week. But in terms of its overall impact on the business, I think it's still behind the other two in the near to medium term. But in terms of the long-term potential of our category of agreement workflow, I think it's a massive unlock and a fantastic opportunity for DocuSign. I think we're exceptionally well positioned. So, maybe one other comment about that, if you think about the -- lots of companies talk about AI. And there are commercial AI models available at the consumer level and so really any enterprise will pay the fee. We believe that our opportunity is both category specifically just lends itself to AI, and we -- at every stage. But then if you look at DocuSign, we have deep experience built over multiple years of building agreement-specific models. It's not the same as drafting a high school essay. And we have a deep expertise and the level of accuracy that's required there. We also have the largest data set of agreements of any company, I think, on earth, which puts us in a position to help our clients extract more value out of AI models. And then, lastly, we are, of course, executing very deliberately and intentionally on partnerships with the leading cloud vendors and taking full advantage of the innovation that they're powering. So -- to our work with Microsoft, and we are, of course, talking to the others as well. So...\nAlex Zukin: Super clear answer and very interesting. Maybe just as a follow-up. Cynthia, it's a bit unusual to hear about outperformance on billings driven by in-line renewal trends. We've heard it before on early renewals, but it implies that a year ago, your renewal trends were either below seasonal average or that your guidance was kind of [intenting] (ph) on below plan renewal. So maybe can you just help us understand how do you set that plan? And for the rest of the year, are you assuming that renewals come in at the rate they came in, in Q1, or are you assuming a bit worse? Just help us kind of understand that dynamic for the rest of the year.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, thanks for the question. It is a good one, and I agree with you, it is a bit unusual. But I think the dynamic is for software companies, with subscription models, you have a certain level of on-time renewals, early renewals, late renewals, there're spill in and spill over every quarter, and we model it out pretty granularly. And so, I think what we saw in Q1 is the dynamic of two things with on-time renewals, which means renewals that don't fall into the grace period and spill over to the following quarter. So, our rate of renewal is consistent, and so it's really a timing of deals. And those deals for on-time renewals more landed in Q1, which means in Q2, the implication is there's less spill over into Q2. So that is now baked into the guide. We think it's attributable to two things. One is execution by the team that focuses on the installed base, better execution and kind of closing what's in front of them, which is great. And we're really pleased with that. And then, I think the other is, there is a macro dynamic of less early renewals. So, customers are really scrutinizing their budgets. And when you look at kind of things like expansion rates and deal sizes and volumes, those are coming down. And so again, that's all baked into the guidance, but I would look at the outperformance on billings in Q1 at the timing piece. And again, it's baked into our full year guide, and that's why you're seeing kind of partial push through relative to other options there.\nAlex Zukin: Understood. Thank you, guys. Congrats.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, I would just add to that, that we were very intentional, obviously, about encouraging our teams to focus on renewals and on consumption within our existing contracts. And so, I just want to echo what Cynthia said that we made some adjustments there in terms of our -- with our organization and our incentive models, and I think that was helpful as well. So, kudos to Steve and his team.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes, thank you very much. Allan, can you talk about the potential for the company to become a double-digit revenue growth company again? I note that the guidance for billings this year embeds around 3% to 4% growth, which is less than half of your revenue growth expected this year. So, I think in response to Alex's question, you talked about product innovation, self-service, like near-term growth drivers and AI longer term, it could be the biggest. So, I'm just wondering if things gel with AI in, I don't know, a few years from now, just talk about the potential for the revenue growth to be double digits again.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. Well, so just to go back in time, I think '23 was a year of change for DocuSign -- fiscal '23 last year was a lot of change. As I said on previous earnings call, this year is really about setting the foundation for growth. And that is still true, and we're starting to really make good progress, I think, on that foundation. We are very excited about the long-term potential, and we are reshaping the company to deliver on that. But that kind of transformation is not achieved overnight. So, we're not changing our guidance beyond what we're providing guidance for next year at this time. But I'd say all the early signs in terms of our initiatives in product innovation, self-serve, as you mentioned, the growth of the partner channel and operational efficiency, I think all of those will contribute to that. But we believe we have a very strong opportunity and that AI could be an incremental unlock beyond the core momentum in the business. So, more to come when we're ready to share next year targets later in the year.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. As a follow-up, the product revenue or innovation that you alluded to, is that referring to the three new releases, the Web Forms, highly regulated markets and ID? Or -- and add some additional products perhaps later this year? Just elaborate on what you mean by the product innovation.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I think overall, my goal has been to dramatically improve our pace of innovation and pace of product releases. And so, I think we did a good job of that in Q1, and there's more to come here in Q2. In fact, we'll share some parts of our Q2 releases next week at our user conference. So, I look at that at every quarter, you'll see pretty meaningful new functionality across our vision of delivering agreement workflow. Some of the things that I'm most excited about that we intend to deliver this fiscal year, but a little further out, include things like searching across your repository of agreements. As you can imagine, an incredibly important functionality. No one really delivers that today. I think we're planning to do that before the end of the year. Another example of something more evocative and enabling future growth of the categories, we call orchestration, which basically enables you to pick components of the DocuSign suite and any third-party app that we interface with and combine them in ways that are custom for your organization and workflow. We've had a lot of increase for that over the years. No one has ever delivered that in the agreement space, and we intend to do that. So those are examples of things that are more evocative and could unlock the full potential of the category.\nShebly Seyrafi: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Owens with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Owens: Great, and thanks for taking my question. I think building on Brent's question a little earlier, I just wanted to better understand the pace of spend as we move throughout the year, because I guess 90 days ago, you had an operating margin that was at the low end, ramping throughout the year, and now, the inverse is happening where you have the high watermark in Q1 and incremental spend. So, just trying to understand, was there a change relative to spend trying to accelerate incremental products or what's going on from that perspective?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. I think in Q1, I mean, again, it's a good observation. I think in Q1, we saw lower spend across categories. So, we just got a slower start to the year. So part of it was across the investment areas and the key priorities and higher net new hiring kind of got off to a slower start. However, we expect that to kind of ramp as we move through the year. So we'd expect Q1 to be the high watermark, Q2 to come down slightly, and then Q3 and Q4 to moderate in the low 20s would be what we would expect. And so the year will come up 1 point, but the overall spend, again, in the run rate and the bow wave will be in line with our expectation coming into the year across the AOP.\nRob Owens: And I guess, secondarily, could you talk about pricing and what you're seeing in the more tradition e-signature market throughout the various lenses, I guess, of where you're at in SMB and what enterprise looks like? Thanks.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I mean what I would say overall is -- I mean there's no question that compared to three, four years ago, category is more competitive, especially in basic use cases. And so the overall market softens. That said, our win rates are relatively stable. We are -- remained a clear market leader. I think everybody else prices off us. We have, I think, a very strong value proposition in the resulting premium. I mean, customers value the convenience and trust that we have, the higher signed rates, the higher -- the faster time to sign as well as a variety of enterprise-grade capabilities, integrations, security, privacy, et cetera. So, I'd say the price environment continues to be highly competitive, and we think we're the market leader, and we try to make sure we're paid for that, but we also don't want to lose business unnecessarily. So, we're trying to be more agile in that regard in larger enterprise deals where there may be a blend of both. Over time, as we layer in a lot of the functionality I've talked about, we're hopeful that we can bring greater value to our clients. And that will allow us to overall increase our dollar footprint within -- with our enterprise and mid-market customers.\nRob Owens: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Baer with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Baer: Thanks for the question and congrats on a good quarter. One for Allan, one for Cynthia. On CLM and Agreement Cloud, it's clear you're in a strong position to really leverage AI, and you talked about some of the ways that you're going to do that to improve your solutions and add more value. I guess I'm wondering how would you gauge customer interest and timing of that interest? Like, does the opportunity get pushed out at all? Are customers needing to reevaluate CLM in the context of AI and take time? Are there enterprise customers that are thinking about doing it in-house? If you could talk about some of that, like the time to realize the value unlock, or are you seeing near-term momentum?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes, that was a lot of questions. I think first thing I'd say is there's definitely strong customer interest in the category and the features and functionality, we see lots of inbound inquiries, we have some of our large SI partners who are making significant investments in their CLM practices. So the overall demand environment, I think, is robust. And I don't think we've really seen any slowdown or hesitation because of AI. If anything, people's expectations have just been raised on what's possible. At the same time, CLM definitely skews more enterprise. It does have longer time to value. It's therefore, more impacted by macro and cautious customer behavior, fuel cycles get longer and so on. So those two things are pulling in opposite direction. Overall, I would say CLM, we believe it has great potential, but it also hasn't quite fulfilled its promise yet, right? It's been too custom, too services heavy, too long time to value. We really want to reimagine the category to be software-first with quick time to value, delightful workflow across all the functions that use it and exceptional out-of-the-box analytics and insights driven by AI. And we are engaging with leading companies across a number of industries. So, we're seeing people reimagine how their legal departments operate, whether it's for risk assessment or compliance or extracting business value. One that I particularly like is we work with a lot of pharma and biotech clients. They use CLM to quickly analyze and assess their corpus of agreements, that allows them to respond to market events, create efficiencies, mitigate risk. They use Insights -- our Insights product to understand the rebate opportunities in their supplier agreements. That's a great example of really extracting business value beyond just being more efficient in how you manage your agreements. So overall, we're very bullish on the category long term. We think it does need to be reimagined and we intend to lead that.\nJosh Baer: Great. Just a real quick one for Cynthia. Professional services revenue, I think, was a record this quarter. Anything to call out for the strength and upside there?\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. So, in that professional services and other category, we do still have some on-prem software that's part of the legacy product suite. And so, there was a Q2 deal that fell into Q1. So again, it's really the timing of deals. And so that was an on-prem deal that led to that upside in the PS and another line.\nJosh Baer: Okay. Thank you, Cynthia. Congrats and good luck.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jake Roberge with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.\nJake Roberge: Hey, thanks for taking my questions. You talked a lot about the product-led growth initiatives that you started to put in place. But just thinking about the other end of the spectrum with your direct sales motion, now that Steve has been in the seat for a little over a year, are there any new opportunities that he's looking into for that direct motion? I know you talked a little bit about partners international, but you're still kind of in those eight direct field territories internationally. So just curious if there's any updates on the direct side.\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I mean that continues to be the vast majority of our business, and I don't see that changing in a very long time. I think Steve has now the team fully in place. They've all ramped, and just a new level of professionalism and maturity there. And we are working to augment their capabilities in every area. So, whether it's our marketing, our training efforts, our bundling, I think we have opportunities in every area to become a better enterprise sales software company, and Steve is helping us move in that direction. So that is -- continues to be critically important for the company. I think we're making good progress there. And as we ship more product, we have, I think, a sales channel that's very ready and able to capitalize on that.\nJake Roberge: Great. And then just digging a little deeper into generative AI. Opportunity seems pretty interesting with your agreement models and then just the ability to better utilize all the data within your contracts. I'm curious how you're thinking about maybe your monetization plans for the tech. And then, I know it's still early days, but is that something that could start showing up early next year or is that still too early there?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. As I alluded to earlier, I do think relative to just execution on our agreement workflow roadmap and PLG, it's a little further out in terms of impact. In terms of monetization, I expect AI features to be both bundled as part of our baseline products, strengthening their functionality and value, as I suggested earlier. And in some cases, packaged as a separately charged add-on. We do both today. So if you take our Insights product, which is really our AI-driven analytics product for CLM, we both have a stand-alone SKU. It's sold separately as well as a premium bundle. I think we're going to need to learn a little bit more about how customers want to use this and what the key value drivers are before we finalize how we price the different features, but certainly mindful of wanting to capture the -- deliver the most value and capture the most value for DocuSign as we price it.\nJake Roberge: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, thanks. Appreciate you fitting me in. Just one for me, maybe on expansion rates. We're hearing some software companies started to comment around when they'll hit a 12-month period and start to lap some of those impacts. Is there any sense you have at this point in time around where or when the expansion headwinds start to settle, assuming we remain in a similar environment? And our gross retention rates, I know you had a comment last quarter on those, are those still holding consistent here? Just any additional context is helpful. Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes, for sure. Thanks for the question, Michael. So I think expansion rates -- our dollar net retention rate came in at 105%. And for Q2, we'd expect that to continue to come down. Overall across the business, when you look at the different metrics, pressure on expansion rates is the largest contributor to the pressure we're seeing on the top line metrics. And so, we would expect that to continue just based on what we're seeing and what we're expecting in Q2 on dollar net retention. And again, that has been really attributable, if you think about why is it compressing things around customer buying behaviors, scrutinizing budgets more generally, some of the tea leaves around the macro factors. You have to remember, we're a land-and-expand model. And so, within that, as companies land, the rate of them expanding is coming down, and you see that even this quarter in some of the customer metrics. So I think those few -- those handful of things are really driving kind of that expansion rate. And you see it more backward looking in dollar net retention, but you see it in some of the other metrics on a real-time basis as we move through the quarters.\nMichael Turrin: And then, gross retention rates, I know you mentioned partial churn. Are gross retention rates consistent still?\nCynthia Gaylor: We don't disclose gross retention, but I think when we look at various things like the expansion rates -- and we do internally look at churn rates, expansion rate is really driving kind of the compression that we're seeing more than -- and then some of the other pieces.\nMichael Turrin: Thanks, Cynthia. Best of luck to you. Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. Allan, maybe can you expand a little bit on what you're seeing in international markets and how you're leveraging partners and ecosystem expansion there?\nAllan Thygesen: Yes. I mean, overall, I think we're seeing some softness, right, across the business. International is not an exception, but on a relative basis, I think it's a less meaningful factor. It is growing faster than our domestic business. It is the largest part of our addressable market, and we're still only 25% of our revenue. So, we have a huge untapped opportunity. Most of the international markets are at an earlier adoption phase. I think a lot of that is due to regulatory history and cultural habits, but we see that really starting to change now. And so, it's one of the reasons that give us confidence to invest. As I mentioned, we're particularly beyond the major English-speaking markets and a few existing large European markets like France. We're really investing in Japan and Germany to fully capture the opportunity there. Beyond the investment in our direct sales and back-office functions in those markets. Self-service and partners, as you alluded to, are key levers. So that includes partnerships with SIs, met several in my international travels, distributors, et cetera, and of course, our self-service capabilities are particularly suitable for reaching a lot of markets where we can't put a lot of resources on the ground. And then, we're investing heavily on the product side. I mentioned the ID verification. We're qualified, trust, service provider in the EU. And we have a dedicated team and a pretty strong in-market customer relations on that front. So, overall, I'm very bullish on international opportunity. And I think the entire company is excited that we're aligned and investing. We are being quite disciplined with which markets we're adding, should we say, direct sales efforts into and the rest will be partner and self-service enabled.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Okay. And just a follow-up on, you mentioned the EHR Interoperability in your opening remarks. What are you seeing in healthcare right now?\nAllan Thygesen: So, it's one of -- I think it's one of our bigger opportunities from a vertical perspective. We're seeing everything from insurers to hospital chains to chains of doctors' offices adopting signature and forms-based solutions to a patient log-in and registration disclosure. And so, I think really low-hanging fruit is still early days in the digitalization of healthcare system and I think we can play a really meaningful role in that. We're seeing a lot of inbound interest in that. But it's a highly regulated area. So the bar is higher to participate. I think the good news is I think we're in the front of the market there, and that will be -- it's a positive competitive dynamic for us as well.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Jackson Ader with SVB MoffettNathanson. Please proceed with your question.\nKyle Diehl: Great. Thanks for sneaking us in. This is Kyle Diehl on for Jackson. Just a quick one. I think, Cynthia, you might have alluded to it, but as we're thinking about investment in the back half of the year, are those -- is that kind of higher velocity that can be adjusted as you go, or are those investments -- talking about [what's flowing] (ph) down on the operating margins, is that longer-term strategic more so in the year? Thanks.\nCynthia Gaylor: Yes. I would say, I mean, we evaluate as we move through the year, but the intention right now is to invest into the plan that we had coming into the year. It just got off to a slower start. So I'd expect the expense to be higher in the back half of the year. Again, we're really pleased to be able to increase the margin for the year by 1 point, but the bow wave and the run rate, we would expect to be about the same. But I'm sure the team will evaluate it as we move that pace. There are pieces around headcount as we hire people that will naturally bring down the margin, because that's by far our biggest expense category. But things like T&E and third-party vendor spend, we're always looking at those areas as well.\nAllan Thygesen: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you.\nAllan Thygesen: That was last question?\nOperator: Yes. I would like to turn the floor back over to Allan for closing comments.\nAllan Thygesen: Thank you, operator. Thank you all for joining today's call. We appreciate your support as we continue to make progress towards our long-term vision for the business. In closing, I think we delivered a solid start to the year, and we remain focused on our execution to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders. I do want to reiterate my enthusiasm for our product roadmap as we are confident that our investment in innovation and talent will be key moving forward. If you want to continue to see some of the progress we're making, I encourage you to watch our one-hour keynote at Momentum Wednesday next week as we share more updates on our visions and our products. I also look forward to sharing more with you throughout the year. Thank you very much.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."
