[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kaleb Johannes, Vice President, Investor Relations and Business Transformation. Please go ahead.\nKaleb Johannes: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Cracker Barrel's second quarter fiscal 2024 conference call and webcast. This morning, we issued a press release announcing our second quarter results. In the press release and on the call, we'll refer to non-GAAP financial measures for the second quarter ended January 26, 2024. The non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude the non-cash amortization of the asset recognized from the gains on the sale and leaseback transactions, expenses related to the company's CEO transition, expenses associated with the strategic transformation initiative, a corporate restructuring charge and an employee benefits policy change and related tax impact. The company believes that including these items from the financial results provides investors with an enhanced understanding of the company's financial performance. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or earnings per share information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The last page of the press release include reconciliations from the non-GAAP information to the GAAP financials. On the call with me this morning are Cracker Barrel's President and CEO, Julie Masino; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Craig Pommells. Julie and Craig will provide a review of the business, financials and outlook. We will then open up the call for questions. On this call, statements may be made by management of their beliefs and expectations regarding the company's future operating results or expected future events. These are known as forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties that, in many cases, are beyond management's control and may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We caution our listeners and readers in considering forward-looking statements and information. Many of the factors that could affect the results summarized in the cautionary description of risks and uncertainties found at the end of the press release and are described in detail in our reports that we file with or furnished to the SEC. Finally, the information shared on this call is valid as of today's date, and the company undertakes no obligation to update it, except as may be required under applicable law. I'll now turn the call over to Cracker Barrel's President and CEO, Julie Masino. Julie?\nJulie Masino: Good morning and thank you. In the second quarter, we delivered solid sales, which included a meaningful improvement in our traffic trend of 300 basis points in Q2 compared to Q1. Our traffic driving tactics, particularly our efforts to improve the guest experience and the effectiveness of our marketing are working and supported this improvement. While we were pleased with our sales results, our margins remained pressured. As I will touch on later, improving profitability is a top priority. We are confident we will see improvements as our initiatives gain traction, but we anticipate continued margin pressure in the near-term, particularly in Q3 and improved margins in Q4. I'm going to start by covering some highlights from Q2, and then Craig will review our financials and give an update on our outlook. Then I'll come back and wrap up by providing an update on our strategic transformation and some of our plans to drive continued performance improvements. Our second quarter is an especially important quarter for us due to, first, our seasonally higher volume; and second, because of the emotional connection our brand has with guests over the holidays. We have the privilege of still many of them inviting us into their homes or coming into our stores to celebrate the holidays. This is truly special. As I noted on our last call, we had an excellent Thanksgiving from a sales perspective, and the teams carried this momentum through the remainder of the quarter. I want to thank our 70,000-plus employees for their tireless efforts and extraordinary hard work during the quarter to help our guests celebrate this special holiday season. From a culinary and marketing perspective, we leaned into our seasonal guest favorites such as Country Fried Turkey and Cinnamon Roll Pie as well as our off-premise offerings. We continue to see positive results from our marketing investments in refined tactics. In addition to promoting our seasonal offerings, a key focus of our marketing efforts during the quarter was highlighting Cracker Barrel Rewards. For this campaign, we partnered with Dolly Parton to promote Cracker Barrel Rewards and her collaborative album, Rockstar. This campaign was a resounding success and delivered a large number of impressions and high engagement rates and drove additional gains to our already strong levels of enrollment. We remain pleased with the early results of Cracker Barrel Rewards, which, as a reminder, launched in September. In addition to the strong enrollment levels, we are encouraged by the engagement, feedback and response rates we are seeing. One of the many benefits of the program is how it enhances our ability to directly engage with guests. We continue to test various campaigns and activations and measure their efficacy, and we're excited about learning more about what drives engagement with our members. For example, loyalty members accounted for nearly 50% of our Thanksgiving heat and serve sales which we believe was partially driven by our direct engagement with them around this offering. We continue to believe the program with its easy-to-use and engaging design and rewarding value will be a meaningful brand differentiator and traffic driver over the long-term. Our retail business remains challenged. We believe this is due in large part to the pressures the broader retail industry is facing, particularly in more discretionary categories, which is resulting in a highly promotional environment. While guests responded well to our value-focused holiday assortments, overall sales performance was softer than anticipated. However, the team has done a good job managing inventories and markdowns. Despite the sales softness, we grew margin rate over the prior year, and our inventories, which are below prior year, are well positioned. I will now turn the call over to Craig for a more detailed look at the quarter from a financial perspective and to discuss our financial outlook for the rest of the year. After he finishes, I will then provide an update on our strategic transformation. Craig?\nCraig Pommells: Thank you, Julie. And good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, we reported total revenue of $935.4 million. Restaurant revenues increased 1.8% to $730.7 million, and retail revenues decreased 5.2% to $204.7 million versus the prior year quarter. Comparable store restaurant sales increased by 1.2% over the prior year. Pricing was approximately 4.8%. Our quarterly pricing consisted of approximately 3.4%, carryforward pricing from fiscal 2023 and 1.4% new pricing from fiscal 2024. Off-premise sales were approximately 23.7% of restaurant sales. As a reminder, off-premise mix elevated during the second quarter due to the seasonally higher sales for our Heat n' Serve offerings and catering business. Although we were pleased with the sales for these offerings, they have the lowest margins of all of our channels, which pressured our overall margins this quarter. Moving forward, we are focused on improving the profitability of this channel. Comparable store retail sales decreased 5.3% compared to the second quarter of the prior year. We saw declines across most categories with toys, food and decor, seeing the largest decreases. Although retail sales remain soft, we were pleased with how the team has effectively managed inventory levels, which remain below prior year. Moving on to our second quarter expenses, total cost of goods sold in the quarter was 33.7% of total revenue versus 35% in the prior year quarter. Restaurant cost of goods sold in the second quarter was 28.2% of restaurant sales versus 29.3% in the prior quarter. This 110 basis point decrease was primarily driven by menu pricing partially offset by higher mix of off-premise as our Heat nâ€™ Serve and catering offerings have a higher cost of sales than other channels. Commodity inflation was approximately 1.4%, driven principally by higher beef and turkey prices. Second quarter retail cost of goods sold was 53.2% of retail sales versus 54% in the prior year quarter. This 80 basis point decrease was primarily driven by higher initial margin. Our inventories at quarter end were $172.7 million compared to $187.3 million in the prior year. With regard to labor costs, our adjusted second quarter labor and related expenses were 35.1% of revenue, which excludes approximately $5.3 million of favorability related to a change in an employee benefits policy. This compares to labor and related expenses of 33.6% in the prior quarter. This 150 basis point increase was primarily driven by our investments in additional labor hours to support the guest experience and hourly wage inflation of approximately 5.4%, partially offset by pricing. Adjusted other operating expenses were 22.5% of revenue versus 22% in the prior quarter. This 50 basis point increase was primarily driven by our investments in advertising. Adjusted general and administrative expenses in the second quarter were 4.8% of revenue, which was flat to the prior year quarter and excludes the following items: approximately $3.5 million in expenses related to the CEO transition; and approximately $3.8 million in professional fees related to our strategic transformation initiative. All of this culminated in GAAP operating income of $30.8 million. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $35.9 million or 3.8% of revenue. Net interest expense for the quarter was $5.1 million compared to net interest expense of $4.4 million in the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily the result of higher weighted average interest rates. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was negative 3.3%, which reflects favorable state income tax settlements. On an adjusted basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 1.2%. Second quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share were $1.19, and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $1.37. In the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $63.7 million, or 6.8% of total revenue. Now turning to capital allocation and our balance sheet, the Board remains committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation. Our first priority remains invested in the profitable growth of Cracker Barrel and Maple Street. Beyond that, we plan to return capital to our shareholders while maintaining appropriate flexibility and a conservative balance sheet. In the second quarter, we invested $26.4 million in capital expenditures and we returned $29 million to shareholders in dividends. We ended the quarter with $452.3 million in total debt. Lastly, as we announced in our press release, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $1.30 payable on May 7, 2024, to shareholders of record on April 12, 2024. With respect to our fiscal 2024 outlook, I would like to provide some additional color on the guidance in this morning's release. Looking ahead, we continue to operate in an uncertain environment. We've been encouraged by the resiliency of the consumer and by the improvement in guest sentiment in recent months. However, the industry continues to face headwinds and we expect industry traffic to remain pressured for the remainder of the fiscal year. Turning to the guidance, we now expect total fiscal 2024 revenue of $3.5 billion to $3.6 billion. The increase in our sales guidance reflects higher sales from increased advertising and our investments in other areas of the business. We now anticipate pricing of approximately 5% for the full year. We continue to anticipate the opening of our two new Cracker Barrel stores, both of which have already opened, and nine to 11 new Maple Street units during the year. We now expect commodity inflation of approximately 0% to 2% and hourly restaurant wage inflation of approximately 5%. As a reminder, and as noted in the reconciliation tables in our press release, our full year outlook contemplates certain excluded expenses in addition to the non-cash amortization of gains from our sale leaseback. These include approximately $10 million in consulting fees related to our strategic transformation, approximately $10 million of one-time CEO transition costs and approximately $2 million in corporate restructuring charges, partially offset by approximately $5 million of favorability from the change to our benefits policy. Our full year outlook also includes the benefit of a 53rd week this fiscal year. Taking all of this into account, we now anticipate full year adjusted operating income of $125 million to $135 million. In addition to our second quarter operating income results, which were below our expectations, our updated range reflects a higher level of advertising investment and the movement of some cost reduction benefits from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 to ensure we are fully focused on retaining and further strengthening our guest experience gains. From a quarterly cadence perspective, we expect our Q3 adjusted operating income to be meaningfully below prior year, driven by the stated investments in labor and advertising as well as timing of other expenses. However, we expect Q4 adjusted operating income to be above prior year, primarily due to improved traffic, pricing, menu mix and the benefit of the 53rd week. We now expect a full year GAAP effective tax rate of 1% to 4% and an adjusted effective tax rate of 5% to 8% and capital expenditures of $120 million to $135 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Julie, so she may share additional details on our business plans and areas of focus.\nJulie Masino: Thanks Craig. I now want to provide an update on our strategic transformation. As a reminder, this program kicked off in late September and the early months included a diagnostic phase in which we conducted significant guest research both with Cracker Barrel users and non-users. Our research confirms my own observations that I shared with you last quarter. The Cracker Barrel brand is beloved by guests and employees and we are working with a strong foundation. But it is also clear to me that we have a lot of work to do in some key areas to take the brand to the next level and improve our performance. This work revolves around three critical imperatives that have come out of our research which are informing our strategy and key work streams. One, driving relevancy; two, delivering food and an experience that guests love; and three, growing profitability. While I'm going to talk about each today, I want to announce we will be holding a standalone investor presentation in May, prior to our Q3 earnings call at which time we will provide a more detailed strategy update. I look forward to sharing more with you then, details will be forthcoming. Turning to the three imperatives, the first is driving relevancy, which means evolving the brand to meet changing consumer tastes and needs. In my view, while weâ€™ve taken some steps in this direction over the past few years, we need to do more. Cracker Barrel is a timeless brand, but even timeless brands must evolve as consumer preferences change, which means evolving our brand positioning, our stores, our menu and our messaging. Weâ€™ve already started this work. In the coming weeks, we will be commencing a brand repositioning initiative, which entails a full review of our brand strategy and identity. Our refined positioning will inform all aspects of the brand from menu and marketing to digital and store experience. We have also begun testing changes to decor, lighting, paint, and fixtures, and our initial work suggests that we can update and brighten our interiors in a way that appeals to both core guests and people newer to the brand. Future changes will be informed by the learnings from this test and others, as well as our brand strategy work, and we are committed to being disciplined and thoughtful before deploying capital and expanding design changes to our stores. With respect to our food and guest experience, it goes without saying that we must provide delicious, craveable food and unique retail product, and we must deliver an improved experience that keeps guests coming back time and time again. Delicious incredible food is an important part of what we do at Cracker Barrel and Iâ€™m excited to announce today that we are launching Golden Carolina BBQ Chicken Tenders and a Fresh Berry French Toast Bake. Innovation will continue to fuel relevancy in our menu for our guests. We recently launched a core menu revamp test and while it is only in a few stores, it is a significant test because of the scale of the changes. This test includes approximately 20 new items, several modified items and over 20 deletions, as we seek to balance our innovation with simplification. We recognize that not all of the menu changes from this test will work and make it to the next phase. But I believe itâ€™s important that we become more agile and innovative and Iâ€™m pleased with how the teams responded to my challenge to move quickly, to develop and implement these initiatives, and to test and learn in a more agile way. In addition to innovating with menu items, we are also innovating through day parted offers. Today, we are also debuting an early dinner deals menu. This dine-in only menu includes seven smaller portioned entrees starting at $8.99 that will only be available Monday through Friday from 4:00 to 06:00 p.m. We believe this menu will resonate with our more price conscious guests and that it will drive incremental traffic during a non-peak period to our most challenged day part. Importantly, we believe it will do this without adding additional operational complexity. Operational excellence and consistent execution are a top priority. After considering over two dozen different key metrics as part of our research, we have honed in on the metrics that are most highly correlated with comp store sales growth and are focusing against these to drive meaningful improvements to the overall guest experience and create sustainable traffic growth. As part of our focus on what matters most, we are in the process of rolling out enhanced reporting of these metrics to our field leadership and we believe the improved level of focus will empower our teams to quickly diagnose where they can most impactfully react in real time. The guest experience is not limited to the in-store experience. It is equally important to engage and delight our guests outside of our four walls and to win in digital. As I mentioned, we are proud of the initial success of our Cracker Barrel Rewards, but it is still early. The power of loyalty in digital is realized through the scaled collection of guest data, capitalizing on the behavioral insights through robust test and learn campaigns, and delivering individualized experiences that drive engagement, incremental sales and increased visitation. With our recent success, I believe we can do more to faster realize these goals. Finally, we must improve profitability. Our margins have compressed in recent years. This is due to a number of reasons, including historically high inflation, particularly on the labor side. But we believe thereâ€™s significant margin recapture opportunity if we drive top line growth and reengineer some aspects of our business model to reduce the amount of fixed labor currently required and simplify our menu and processes. Ultimately, our goal is to deliver compelling shareholder returns, and improving profitability is the biggest lever for achieving this. One of the areas where we are doubling down is building our strategic pricing capabilities, as our research shows that this is one of our biggest near-term opportunities. We have shared with you on previous calls that Cracker Barrel has taken pricing in a thoughtful and careful manner so as to preserve our value. This is true and the teams have done a good job as far as theyâ€™ve been able. What we need to improve and what we are working hard on now is dramatically improving our pricing sophistication. And by that I mean our capabilities to really measure and understand price elasticity at various levels to allow us to move to a more barbell pricing structure, utilizing the menu and messaging to more efficiently drive desired behaviors and getting more granular with our pricing at the market, store and item level. To be clear, this does not mean simply taking more pricing. Rather, it means improving our internal capabilities to be even more surgical and thoughtful with our pricing across the entire menu and across all stores. In the coming weeks, we will be launching the first of many tests using our significantly refined approach and these learnings will inform our future pricing actions, tests and strategy. In closing, we're encouraged by our progress, but we have much work to do. Although, we anticipate continued margin pressures in the near-term, we firmly believe that our focus on the three imperatives, one, driving relevancy, two, delivering food and an experience that guests love, and three, growing profitability, will build on our momentum and deliver long-term value creation. Obviously, there is a lot of work to do and it will not be quick or easy, but I am excited and optimistic about the path we are on. I look forward to providing additional details on our strategy and initiatives in May and to keeping you informed as we move ahead. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: We will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Katherine Griffin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKatherine Griffin: Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I was interested in the figure you provided about the loyalty customer sales mix at Thanksgiving and was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how you are integrating promotions or value messaging into the loyalty program, just especially as you're starting to get it off the ground and driving enrollment.\nJulie Masino: Great. Our ahead of plan, we continue to test and learn our way through this. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, over 50% of our heat and serve business came from people in the loyalty program, and we believe this is due to our direct engagement with them. We're continuing to test other different engagements with them and offers, and we'll be able to share more of that as we continue down the journey. But we continue to be optimistic about what we're seeing with this program.\nKatherine Griffin: Okay, thank you. And then just in the second quarter, the year-on-year rate of growth in labor costs per store was the lowest it's been in a couple of years. And I'm wondering how sustainable that level of growth is. And then maybe how that reflects the investments you're making in labor, assuming that the slower rate of growth isn't just a function of moderating wage inflation more generally.\nCraig Pommells: Hi, Katherine, it's Craig. I'll take that one. There is a bit of both of those in there. We clearly invested significantly in labor in the second quarter, and that has worked out well in a lot of ways, we're seeing the benefits in the guest experience and we saw the benefits in sales. At the same time, wage inflation is moderating nationally and it's moderating for us. So we have two â€“ you have a couple of moving pieces there. The wage rate moderation is a bit of a good guy, so to speak, but we also invested â€“ we invested a lot. So as we kind of go forward and we kind of think about fiscal 2025 and beyond, as Julie talked about, improving profitability is one of the three key imperatives and the labor component of the business model and continuing to get that right will be a big part of that.\nKatherine Griffin: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jeff Farmer with Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead.\nJeff Farmer: Thanks. I believe you guys noted that the upward revision in that 2024 revenue guidance number was at least partially driven by increased advertising. Assuming I heard that right, what is the advertising increase relative to what you guys were thinking last quarter? And when the dust settles, where would you expect advertising spend as a percent of sales in FY2024 to land? \nCraig Pommells: Hi, Jeff, it's Craig. Traditionally, Cracker Barrelâ€™s advertising as a percent of sales or marketing as a percent of sales was somewhere mid to high 2% range. And now we are expecting to be in the kind of mid to low 3% range through this fiscal year. The approach that we've taken is really a test and learn kind of data driven approach. If we go back to, let's say, Q4 and Q4, we were disappointed â€“ Q4 fiscal 2023, we were disappointed in our top line performance. And what we saw at that time is while we had pulled back a bit on advertising, others had increased and our share of voice was quite low. And as a result of that, we've done a lot of testing. And what we're seeing is, on the margin, it is profitable for us to invest more in advertising. Now, clearly it compresses our overall margins as a company, but the total dollars delivered is favorable. So weâ€™re going to continue to use a test and learn approach as we look at our marketing mix. But for the near-term, we do expect it to be higher than what we saw in prior years.\nJeff Farmer: Okay. And then just one more unrelated. I think you said you had done some work on analyzing the fundamental metrics that are most correlated with same-store sales growth. Can you share some of the findings from that? What were some of those metrics?\nCraig Pommells: So itâ€™s interesting there, weâ€™ve looked at a lot of metrics and I think coming out of that, I donâ€™t think there is a big, aha, no one knew this X was correlated with Y. A lot of what weâ€™re trying to do with this change is focus because we were really reporting on a wide array of metrics, each of which individually are correlated with good traffic performance. But we believe that was too much. And what we want the team to do is to focus on the critical few things that make the biggest difference. So that was the approach that we took. Itâ€™s really about intense focus on the critical few important things. So weâ€™re not going to go into the exact metrics because I think everyone would agree with them. Itâ€™s more important that we have kind of backed away from some other metrics that we think were maybe distracting and instead focus on the ones that matter the most.\nJeff Farmer: And I apologize, just to sneak one more in. What was traffic in the quarter? I might have missed that.\nCraig Pommells: Traffic was negative 4% for the quarter.\nJeff Farmer: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thanks for taking the question. My first, Craig, just to make sure I understand that the benefits adjustment, I think $5.3 million in the second quarter in labor. Is that correct? Did I hear that right? And is that something thatâ€™s going to continue? So is this a benefits change thatâ€™s going to have a full quarter benefit, then we just kind of go from there or is this kind of a one-time thing?\nCraig Pommells: Itâ€™s a non-recurring benefit. So it was a good guy, so to speak, to the P&L that related to a benefit change that we made at the beginning of the calendar year. So in the spirit of there are a number of costs that are non-recurring that we are backing out this year. This is a non-recurring item. Itâ€™s a permanent change in our benefits program that created a non-recurring benefit, and as a result of that, we removed it. We removed that benefit from the second quarter adjusted results.\nJake Bartlett: Okay. So it is backed out of the adjusted results that you published.\nCraig Pommells: Correct, already backed out of the adjusted published results, yes and also out of the annual guidance.\nJake Bartlett: Okay. And then just building on Jeffâ€™s question about advertising and maybe others, like the investments in hours, Iâ€™m wondering at the midpoint of guidance thereâ€™s about 70 basis points of margin compression in 2024. What of those â€“ the factors that are compressing margins? What are not recurring going forward? I guess, do you expect for advertising to remain in the kind of the 3% plus range long-term? Is there any kind of outsized investment hours that might not recur next year? How should we think about the margins in 2024 and how reflective they are of the margins going forward?\nCraig Pommells: Yes. As Julie shared, improvement in profitability is one of our three key imperatives. And refining the business model inclusive of the labor model will be a big part of that. Now, having said that weâ€™ve just spent all of this time and all this money investing in labor to improve the guest experience, so weâ€™re not going to unwind that in a risky way, what weâ€™re doing is structurally trying to change, working on removing the amount of fixed labor that we have in the business. So that we can flex up and down more appropriately with labor, so that work is underway. Thatâ€™s probably a mid-term solve. From an advertising perspective, weâ€™re going to continue to look at that using a test and learn approach, using a medium mix analysis type of approach. And if itâ€™s meaningfully more profitable for us to have somewhat higher than we have traditionally advertising level, then weâ€™ll make that decision then. And if at some point itâ€™s not, then weâ€™re going to make whatever decision is most profitable for the company over time. One bit of a big positive there as we think about the loyalty program and how that benefits us over time. Today, weâ€™re spending a lot in kind of mass market. We are doing some targeting in digital and so on, but itâ€™s still a version of mass marketing. And as the loyalty program continues to scale, weâ€™ll be able to talk to guests in a much more targeted, much more one to one way. And there are some efficiencies that come with that as that program scales over the long-term.\nJake Bartlett: Okay. And last question. Julie, on the last call, you mentioned a focus on value that value had been â€“ competitors were getting a little more intense with value, youâ€™re focusing on your 20 under $12, your breakfast $8.99 price point. My question is how that went. Was that a contributor to the results in the second quarter? And then going forward, you havenâ€™t mentioned value in this call very much. Is that still something that you think you need to lean in on? Are you still seeing some competitive pressures from competitors getting very focused on value? Any kind of commentary around that aspect would be helpful.\nJulie Masino: Sure. Thanks. Look, value is important, and it has been important at a Cracker Barrel brand for probably forever. And value is something that guests are constantly calculating, right? Its how much food did I get? What do I pay for it? How is my experience? What was the whole thing like? So value is this really complicated guest equation that people are really applying a lot of judgment to. So we are constantly looking at both value scores, which we perform very well on, by the way. And value is something that we have protected historically here at Cracker Barrel. When I talked about pricing in my prepared remarks, value will continue to be an important part of how we evaluate our pricing architecture and strategy going forward recognizing that every time a guest interacts with us, theyâ€™re making a value judgment about the entire equation. But also importantly, some of those guests are very value price point focused. So weâ€™ll be taking both of those into account. Weâ€™re protecting some great price points. I mean I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve been into a Cracker Barrel lately, but if you come in and you get Mommaâ€™s Pancake Breakfast from us, itâ€™s $8.99. Its three pancakes. Itâ€™s two eggs, itâ€™s your choice of meat, like thatâ€™s an incredible value, one that we celebrate, one that our guests love. And then if you literally just got like our Southern Fried Chicken dinner, it has a chicken, which is an incredible amount of value. While we may not consider that a value price point, that feels like a tremendous value to another cohort of our guests. So weâ€™re taking all of those things into account as we think about value into the future and how we pair that with pricing architecture and strategy. The last thing I would mention that Iâ€™m super excited about, which is another key way to think about value, especially for our value-oriented guests is today, we launched as part of our new spring menu early dinner deals. Early dinner deals are only Monday through Friday, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. We have seven entree choices that start at $8.99, and all of them are under $10. So itâ€™s an incredible value. Again, really speaking to some of our guests who are value price point focused. But to really put a sharp point on it, Jake, value is an important part of our strategy here at Cracker Barrel. It has been. It will be, but itâ€™s a really multifaceted thing we look at across several different metrics.\nJake Bartlett: Great. I appreciated. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you. And Julie thanks for the commentary and the detail on the transformation, and some of the key learnings and those three imperatives. Looking forward to the event in May, and Iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll touch on more of the details then. But just curious at a high level, you guys could sort of talk at all about maybe the investment potential around some of those imperatives the transformation opportunity, what that might mean from a capital allocation priority perspective. Anything at a high level to share there, if anything shifts? I know you touched on some of this earlier, Craig, but any commentary there that youâ€™re able to touch on today by chance?\nJulie Masino: Thanks, Dennis. The Boardâ€™s approach to capital allocation has been very consistent and thoughtful. They look at it every quarter as something that they examine. And first and foremost, theyâ€™re prioritizing the profitable growth of both Cracker Barrel and Maple Street. And then beyond that, itâ€™s returning capital to shareholders. Primarily, that has been through this quarterly dividend of late. When I think about the strategy, itâ€™s funny, I almost didnâ€™t talk about the store refresh test that we have going on, because I was worried that people would immediately go to spending capital and capital allocation. I wanted to elude as an illustrative point, more to just share my management philosophy around agile testing and learning, and just to show you all that we are moving forward in the strategy and the key imperatives of driving relevancy, delivering a food and experience that guests love and improving profitability. So the Board is going to continue to look at capital allocation, but know that we are really focused on those three strategic imperatives as we lay out the strategy and move the brand and business forward.\nDennis Geiger: Very helpful. Appreciate that. And then maybe just one more. You kind of touched on it some, but anything else notable on sort of your customer behavior changes that you saw in the quarter, either across the restaurant or the retail business? I donâ€™t know if kind of breaking anything down by income cohort, if thereâ€™s anything notable. Any changes there? Or has it generally been largely consistent? Thank you.\nJulie Masino: I think weâ€™ll both comment on this. Iâ€™ll start by saying the one thing Iâ€™m most optimistic about is, weâ€™ve seen some nice growth in the 25 to 44 cohort as well as the 65-plus cohort. So again, traffic was in a better place for us in Q2. And so we felt like we really improved our guest experience scores, but weâ€™re optimistic about some of those cohort growth. Iâ€™ll let Craig talk a little bit more about the rest.\nCraig Pommells: Yes, Iâ€™ll build on that point, especially with the 65-plus as we go back to our 2023 Q4 and even into Q1 of 2024. The softest cohort, H cohort was 65 plus. And with our second quarter results, we saw a really significant improvement. Now, we're still down a bit, but a meaningful improvement, a very meaningful improvement versus where we were at the end of fiscal 2023 and into the early part of fiscal 2024. So that was a big positive. Thinking about the income cohort, if we just break that out into two groups, the under 60k and the over 60k, really steady, not a big story. They are pretty consistent between the two groups. The bigger story is really in the age cohorts and the improvement that we've seen with the 65 plus.\nDennis Geiger: Very helpful, guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brian Mullan with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nBrian Mullan: Thank you. Just a question on Maple Street. Julie, love to get your perspective on this business as you think about all the things you need to tackle with the core Cracker Barrel brand. Where does Maple Street fit into that? Is that a real growth opportunity, or is it potentially something you'd look to part ways with over time? Just any thoughts on your assessment?\nJulie Masino: Thanks, Brian. Myself and the management team right now are insanely focused on Cracker Barrel. We are working very, very hard on the strategic transformation and getting this business back to growth. And the three imperatives that I talked about earlier, driving relevancy, delivering food, and an experience that our guests love and improving profitability. Maple Street, we're not talking about that today, but we'll share more in the future. There's a lot to love about Maple Street. It's great food, it's got a nice weekend business. But right now we are really focused on growing Cracker Barrel and returning it to strength.\nBrian Mullan: Okay. Thank you for that. Just as a follow-up, just a good segue. The core Cracker Barrel store portfolio, as you're doing all your work, do you think store closures could be a part of something with the strategic process? Do you see any stores that you might â€“ the overall might benefit from closing, just love to get your take?\nCraig Pommells: Hi, Brian. It's Craig. We're always looking at the store portfolio. So it's a part of our regular process. And I can tell you that we don't have a lot of stores that are not cash flow positive, but it is something that we take a regular look at, and we're going to continue to do that. It's especially important as you think about a broader kind of strategy update. We'll take a deeper look as well. But as a company at a cash flow â€“ at a unit level cash flow level, there are not a lot of stores there that you kind of go, hey, these are just very cash flow negative.\nBrian Mullan: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next questioner is Todd Brooks from The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nTodd Brooks: Hey, thanks for taking a couple of questions here. The first is a bigger picture question for Julie or Craig. I know we'll hear more about this at the May event, but I think part of the challenge with Cracker Barrel is understanding what sort of margin you're looking to return to over time. So this was north 9% operating margin business in 2019. You have incremental pressures on all three of the key restaurant level lines, some inflation based, but a few hundred basis points and occupancy and other that may just be the structural growth of off premise. Is there anything that you can share with us today about where and not the when, but the where and what we think the margin potential is for the Cracker Barrel business if you're successful with the three pillars?\nCraig Pommells: As Julie shared, itâ€™s â€“ hey Todd, it's Craig. As Julie shared, improving profitability is one of the key imperatives that you kind of think about where. She talked a bit about strategic pricing. So that obviously is going to kind of get leveraged as a percent of sales across the full P&L. So that's a big one. We've also talked about labor, and clearly we're invested in labor. We're doing it to drive and improve guest experience. We're happy with the guest experience results. And at the same time, we want to make the model more variable. We want to take out some of those fixed costs. So we've covered those and we have ongoing cost save or margin optimization initiatives really across the entire P&L. So we're really working on all of it. I think the two big ones that we've highlighted so far are in this kind of strategic pricing area and then over the midterm, not necessarily the very short term, the midterm labor as well. But we are looking at really every part of the P&L.\nTodd Brooks: So do you think a recovery is possible, or is there just something structural about the business being different now, Craig, where we're trying to recover back to 7% and getting people focused on that magnitude of recovery versus back to kind of prior levels?\nCraig Pommells: Yes. We're not sure in a level in terms of the exact percent of sales right now. But we think there is meaningful upside in the overall profitability of the company, certainly from a dollar perspective, very, very significant. Now, as Julie said, it'll take some time and we're being really careful about it and we're prioritizing, ensuring that the business is relevant and we have a healthy top line. But over time, we think it's meaningful without putting an exact point on what the OI percent target is.\nTodd Brooks: Okay, great. Thanks. And then my second question, obviously better than we were looking for from a restaurant same-store sales performance in the quarter. Congrats on that. I know typically you don't like to give color, but other industry participants saw real pressures in January that is included in this quarterly results. So anything you could share about cadence of same-store sales, how they were running until maybe January and if any sense if things have normalized at all as we're moving further away from those January headwinds? Thanks.\nCraig Pommells: I think what we can â€“ as we break that apart a little bit, obviously, I know, top of mind is probably what happened with weather or what was the weather impact. And as you all know, our quarter is November, December, January. So we have a little bit of a bad guy there for weather. But we also have a little bit of a good guy for the catering and heat and serve business that was a strong benefit in November and into December. So all in all, we're pleased with the quarter, a lot of moving pieces there. We think we've been helped. We think our performance has been helped by the advertising in a profitable way on the margin. We think it's been helped by the labor investments. But we're also monitoring and we were careful to call out the industry headwinds. The industry does continue to face headwinds, and you continue to see that.\nTodd Brooks: Okay. Great. Thanks to you guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jon Tower with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks for taking the question, a few if I may. First, going back to the daypart offers the early dinner dimes. I was curious what you could tell us if you tested across the system or some of the store base, what you've seen in test in terms of consumer response?\nJulie Masino: Yes. Thanks, Jon. We actually did not test this. We â€“ and a desire to move agilely forward, we evaluated the pros and cons of it, and we think it is something that our guests are really going to love. It is very operationally easy for us and really focuses on a daypart for us that is challenged. So we felt there was low risk in moving forward with it, which is why we've launched it to the entire system today. They are some of our best loved items at a great price point available Monday through Friday from 4 to 6 p.m. So we're optimistic that our guests will respond and come on in for some of their favorites at this early dinner day part.\nJon Tower: Yes, maybe just drilling into that a little bit. Can you just provide an update on â€“ or the color on what happened in the quarter with respect to daypart performance? It sounds like dinner is still challenged, but maybe that versus the rest of day?\nJulie Masino: Sure. Breakfast remains a core strength for us. A lot of people know and love us for our breakfast offerings. And during the quarter and really throughout the last kind of trailing 12, breakfast has remained a spot of strength for us. Lunch has also been good to us, mainly, as Craig said earlier, because of that brunch kind of overlap that you see happening in lunch. Dinner is the day part for us that is the most challenged right now and where you'll see a lot of our innovation focus and a lot of the growth driving efforts that we're focused on right now are around that dinner daypart where we know we more relevant and more competitive.\nJon Tower: Okay. And then in terms of talking about the labor improvements that you're hoping to drive, it sounds like you're potentially structuring labor differently in the back of the house. Does that â€“ are you contemplating, potentially pulling some of the prep out of store going forward on food?\nCraig Pommells: Yes. I would say its early days on that one, but we're looking at all of it. Number 1 as we need great food, it needs to be relevant, it needs to be a good employee experience but we're looking at what exactly needs to be made from scratch in the store versus brought on in some version of value added, but it's early. So I can't say that we've committed to these individual items, but it's something that we're clearly looking at. One of the challenges with the model, it is very heavily scratch-made across a lot of items. And that is fine when traffic volumes are very high, and it is much more challenging to win traffic volumes moderate. So because of that, we are â€“ we're looking at all those pieces and we're going to make those decisions based on the analysis once we complete the testing.\nJon Tower: Great. Thanks. Just two more if I may. First, I was wondering if you could drill a little bit more into the loyalty platform in terms of adding any sort of specifics regarding sign-ups. And I know its early days, but perhaps any frequency. And I'm curious in aggregate to date, is the platform including, I guess, some of the elevated marketing spend profitable yet?\nJulie Masino: I'll start a little bit, and then Craig can talk to the profitability. But one way is we are pleased with the enrollment levels. We're not going to share absolute numbers right now. We are ahead of our plan, which is exciting to us. We were ahead of plan going into this quarter. And then, obviously, the partnership with Dolly Parton was extraordinary and helped drive even more incremental enrollments than we were already seeing. So that's exciting. We are seeing some incremental traffic. We continue to expect to see that in the second half. That's in our projections and the way that we're looking at the back half of the year. And we're seeing strong engagement, which is really one of the most exciting things for us. People, our guests have really responded well to this program. The program is so unique. When you look at other loyalty programs out there. The fact that you can earn on the restaurant side and on the retail side, and then weâ€™re letting you redeem on both the restaurant and retail side seems to really be resonating with our guests as well as our employees. So the early days are very positive.\nCraig Pommells: Yes. In terms of profitability, this is more of an investment year. The ramp-up costs for a program of this scale has a restaurant component, has a retail component. You can participate as you â€“ when you pay at the cash register, you can participate through the app. Itâ€™s a big program. And then there are also costs that are associated with just the scale up. There is the sign-up cost. There is the cost associated with building the point liability. So all of that means this is an investment year for the program. And as we think about FY 2025 as we start to comp over that and some of those ramp-up costs become a smaller proportion, we would anticipate the program being a more meaningful contributor to profits.\nJon Tower: Got it. Thank you. And then just last one for me. In terms of thinking about the cadence of the ad spend for the balance of the year, based upon guidance, it would sound like itâ€™s going to be more fourth quarter weighted, but maybe Iâ€™m incorrect in that assumption?\nCraig Pommells: Yes. I think we tried to talk more â€“ a little bit more holistically to say prior year, weâ€™re in a mid- to high 2% range. And this year, weâ€™re more in the kind of low to mid-3% range.\nJon Tower: Right. Sorry. But cadence for the balance of the year, third and fourth quarter is it should we expect kind of equal spend across the 2%...\nCraig Pommells: Yes, yes, I would think as a percentage, I would kind of stick with that low to mid-3% range.\nJon Tower: Okay, great. Thank you. \nCraig Pommells: Both quarters [ph], yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Andrew Wolf with CL King. Please go ahead. \nAndrew Wolf: Hi. I want to follow up on the ad spend increase, the rate â€“ and again, I might have missed this, but is that more of a response just to the market? Obviously, certain competitors gone from not doing it to being pretty aggressive and so on? Or is that â€“ do you think the business was under advertising, and thatâ€™s sort of the new run rate?\nJulie Masino: Thanks, Andrew. As Craig mentioned, when we really looked at Q4 of 2023. One of the key learnings we took away from it was that we were â€“ we did pull back on advertising, and we believe that, that hurt our top line. So as we were looking at this year and really focused on driving relevancy, driving the business, we started evaluating at advertising spending, tactics, messaging, channels, all of those things. So that test and learn approach is really fueling where we find ourselves this year, and weâ€™ll continue into the back half of the year. So weâ€™re pleased with the investments that weâ€™ve made because it is helping us with the top line. We saw that in Q2, we saw it in Q1. Things like college football, things like NASCAR, the local heavy up test that we did in Q1. Weâ€™ve expanded that into Q2 to really look at how weâ€™re able to surround some of those national buys with some of these local heavy upsto really drive traffic and be relevant to our guests and let them know whatâ€™s going on at Cracker Barrel.\nAndrew Wolf: Thank you. The other question I have is on the strategic pricing that you want to improve a lot. Is that strictly sort of processes and training issue? Or is there also some data either through loyalty or other sources to get the right output. And can you give us a sense of the timing, how quickly that can be rolled through the business?\nJulie Masino: Sure. Yes, I would say itâ€™s a combination of both, but mostly a more data-driven approach. So the team has done a great job in the past holding back stores, really trying to understand the impact of pricing and consumer response to it. But we can be even more strategic and data-driven across the way we structure the menu, the way we think about value, as I talked about earlier. And then the way that we achieve that through tiers, zones, stores, menu items, menu deletions, how we think about items on a plate and how theyâ€™re priced. So thereâ€™s a lot of opportunities to just look at it differently from a data-driven approach and test and learn our way into some of these opportunities. We want to make sure that we have a pricing road map into the future, and thatâ€™s really the goal for the team, to build that road map through a test-and-learn mentality so that we can understand how pricing can help us and really be a lever in our P&L going forward.\nAndrew Wolf: Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Julie Masino for any closing remarks.\nJulie Masino: Thank you all for joining us. Today, weâ€™ve given you a glimpse of our imperatives and initiatives, and we look forward to sharing more with you in May on our robust strategic framework and the various initiatives that ladder up to it. Lastly, I want to thank our teams both in the home office and in all of our stores for their continued dedication to the guest experience and the commitment to the brand. I greatly appreciate all of their hard work day in and day out as well as on the transformation, and Iâ€™m looking forward to continuing our journey on the strategic transformation together.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending todayâ€™s presentation. You may now disconnect."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Cracker Barrel Fiscal 2024 First Quarter Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After todayâ€™s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kaleb Johannes, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKaleb Johannes: Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Cracker Barrel's first quarter fiscal 2024 conference call and webcast. This morning, we issued a press release announcing our first quarter results. In this press release and on the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures for the first quarter ended October 27, 2023. The non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted to exclude the non-cash amortization of the asset recognized from the gains on the sale and leaseback transactions, expenses related to the company's CEO transition, expenses associated with the strategic transformation initiative, and a corporate restructuring charge and the related tax impacts. The company believes that excluding these items from the financial results, provides investors with an enhanced understanding of the company's financial performance. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or earnings per share information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The last pages of the press release include reconciliations from the non-GAAP information to the GAAP financials. On the call this morning are Cracker Barrel's President and CEO, Julie Masino, and Senior Vice President and CFO, Craig Pommells. Julie and Craig will provide a review of the business, financials and outlook. We will then open up the call for questions. On this call, statements may be made by management of their beliefs and expectations regarding the company's future operating results and expected future events. These are known as forward-looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties that, in many cases, are beyond management's control and may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations. We caution our listeners and readers considering forward-looking statements and information. Many of the factors that could affect results are summarized in the cautionary description of risks and uncertainties found at the end of the press release and are described in detail in our reports that we file with or furnish to the SEC. Finally, the information shared on this call is valid as of today's date. The company undertakes no obligation to update it, except as may be required under applicable law. I'll now turn the call over to Cracker Barrel's President and CEO, Julie Masino. Julie?\nJulie Masino: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported total Q1 revenue of $823.8 million and adjusted operating income margin of 2.3%. Our sales results were in line with our expectations, and our operating margin was at the low end of our internal expectations, reflecting certain investments we made to shore up our top line. Although we continue to face challenges, I've been impressed with the team's work to diagnose the key drivers of our traffic headwinds, and I'm encouraged by our results as we've delivered sequential monthly improvements in our comparable store traffic performance during the quarter, which I'm pleased to say has continued into our important second quarter. We have taken numerous actions to drive traffic and deliver the sequential improvement. I'll go through them now. First, as we discussed last call, we took several actions to improve the effectiveness of our marketing in the first quarter. We increased our media spend by approximately 20% and refined our messaging to focus more on our core guests. This included increased advertising in linear TV, including premium sporting events like college football. We also highlighted our compelling value proposition by featuring an $8.99 price point in our breakfast-focused messaging and we continued highlighting our over 20 under $12 in our lunch and dinner focused messaging. Second, from an operational perspective, we remain focused on the guest experience. We invested in the labor hours to deliver great hospitality, and we continue to emphasize staffing, retention, training and development. We're encouraged by the improvements we've seen in certain key guest experience metrics. We are happy with our staffing and turnover levels, and we are optimistic we can sustain our sales momentum and gain further traction in the coming quarters. Finally, we successfully launched Cracker Barrel Rewards, our new loyalty program. The launch was supported by a multichannel media campaign to drive awareness and enrollment. Our operations teams have done a terrific job as ambassadors and champions of the program and guests have embraced it. We're very pleased with the guest response and the number of enrollments, which have exceeded our expectations thus far. And we've been thrilled with the exposure we've received through our partnership with the iconic Dolly Parton. We continue to believe Cracker Barrel Rewards will be one of the best and most engaging loyalty programs in full-service dining and are confident it will be a meaningful brand differentiator and traffic driver over the long term. Turning to retail. The retail environment remains challenging. Although there were some bright spots during the quarter, such as our harvest assortment, we experienced sales declines across most of our categories. Some of this was due to lower restaurant traffic, but we also believe some price-conscious guests may have reduced their retail purchases as a way to manage their overall spend with us. However, the team has done a good job managing inventories and is focused on emphasizing value and optimizing displays to drive sales improvements during this important holiday season. Looking ahead to Q2. Our second quarter is an especially important quarter for us due to the seasonally higher volumes. Over Thanksgiving, our teams around the country worked tirelessly to deliver a great holiday experience for millions of guests and did so with extraordinary results. We hit on all cylinders in every aspect of our business, dine-in, Heat n' Serve, To-Go and catering and our planning and support systems, including IT, supply chain and guest relations and our retail teams all performed very well. In fact, we set a company record for total sales in a single week during Thanksgiving week with over $110 million in sales, and we served approximately 6 million guests. Our top five stores alone served more than 80,000 guests over Thanksgiving Week. To put that into perspective, those five stores served more people than attend most NFL games. I want to give a huge shout out to our field teams and leadership for their efforts in these results. As we begin December, we will look to continue our Thanksgiving momentum over the holidays with our off-premise offerings and catering. We are leaning into seasonal guest favorites such as our Country Fried Turkey and Cinnamon Roll Pie, which continue to resonate with guests. With regard to catering, we're leveraging our catering sales managers to drive growth, especially with large accounts. All of this is being supported by a marketing campaign that is emphasizing our strong all-day value, which we believe is a competitive advantage for us, particularly in the current environment and is something that we will continue to underscore. We are also continuing to optimize our media mix to improve our share of voice, particularly with core guests. For example, we recently tested local TV and a saw meaningful traffic lift with solid returns on this investment, and we plan to expand this to other key markets. Our marketing is also focused on promoting Cracker Barrel Rewards to continue driving awareness and enrollment. As I mentioned, we have partnered with Dolly Parton to highlight Cracker Barrel Rewards and promote her collaborative album Rockstar. We've been very pleased with this partnership with Dolly, which has helped deliver a large number of impressions and high engagement rates and has incrementally contributed to the strong levels of enrollment we have seen to date. I'll now turn the call over to Craig for a more detailed look at the first quarter from a financial perspective and to discuss our financial outlook for the rest of the year. After he finishes, I will then comment on our priorities and upcoming initiatives, including a strategic transformation initiative we have undertaken to help us invigorate the brand for long-term success. Craig?\nCraig Pommells: Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. As Julie noted, for the first quarter, we reported total revenue of $823.8 million. Restaurant revenue decreased 0.2% to $660.8 million. Retail revenue decreased 8% to $163 million versus the prior year quarter. Comparable store sales declined 0.5% over the prior year. Pricing was approximately 6.8%. As we previously shared, we're taking more moderate net new pricing given the current environment. Our quarterly pricing consisted of approximately 5.5% carryforward pricing from fiscal 2023 and 1.3% new pricing from fiscal 2024. We continue to closely monitor the impact of our pricing actions, and we have not seen a negative impact to traffic. However, given the current environment, in which promotional activities elevated and consumers are generally pressured, we will continue to take a more cautious approach with our pricing for the remainder of the fiscal year. Off-premise sales were approximately 17.5% of restaurant sales. We continue to be particularly pleased with our catering business, which grew over 50% versus the prior year. Comparable store retail sales decreased 8.1% compared to the first quarter of the prior year. Although retail sales remain soft, we were pleased with how the team has effectively managed inventory levels. Moving on to our first quarter expenses. Total cost of goods sold in the quarter was 31% of total revenue versus 33.5% in the prior year quarter. Restaurant cost of goods sold in the first quarter was 26.2% of restaurant sales versus 29.1% in the prior year quarter. This 290 basis point decrease was primarily driven by menu pricing. Commodity deflation was approximately 2.3%, driven principally by lower poultry and pork prices. First quarter retail cost of goods sold was 50.4% of retail sales versus 50.2% in the prior year quarter. Our inventories at quarter-end were $207.3 million compared to $231 million in the prior year. With regard to labor costs, our first quarter labor and related expenses were 37% of revenue versus 34.8% in the prior year quarter. This 220 basis point increase was primarily driven by our investments in additional labor hours to support the guest experience. Hourly, restaurant wage inflation was approximately 5%. Adjusted other expenses were 24.3% of revenue versus 23.1% in the prior year quarter. This 120 basis point increase was primarily driven by our investments in advertising as well as higher depreciation. Adjusted general and administrative expenses in the first quarter were 5.4% of revenue and exclude the following items. First, approximately $1.6 million related to our CEO transition. Second, approximately $1.1 million in professional fees related to our strategy transformation initiative which Julie mentioned and about which she will speak more momentarily. And third, an approximately $1.6 million corporate restructuring charge. Compared to the prior year, adjusted general and administrative expenses increased 30 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage. All of this culminated in GAAP operating income of $11.4 million. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $19 million or 2.3% of revenue. Net interest expense for the quarter was $4.9 million compared to net interest expense of $3.5 million in the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily the result of higher weighted average interest rates. Our GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.7%. On an adjusted basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.9%. First quarter GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.25 and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.51. In the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $45.7 million or 5.5% of total revenue. Now turning to capital allocation and our balance sheet. We remain committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation. Our first priority remains investing in the growth of Cracker Barrel and Maple Street. Beyond that, we plan to return capital to our shareholders while maintaining appropriate flexibility and a conservative balance sheet. In the first quarter, we invested $24.6 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $29.3 million to shareholders in dividends. We ended the quarter with $475 million in total debt. Lastly, as we announced in our press release, the Board declared a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share payable on February 13, 2024, to shareholders of record on January 19, 2024. With respect to our fiscal 2024 outlook, I would like to provide some additional color on the guidance in this morning's release and an update on recent trends. Quarter-to-date, we have sustained our momentum recovering traffic. We were particularly pleased with our performance in November, which continued our trend of sequential monthly improvements in comparable store traffic that began in August. And as Julie mentioned, we delivered strong sales during the Thanksgiving Week. However, looking ahead, we continue to operate in an uncertain environment. Although consumers have been resilient, sentiment remains relatively weak by historical standards, with many consumers feeling economically pressured and more pessimistic, which could pressure discretionary spending. With this in mind, we currently expect fiscal 2024 revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion. We anticipate pricing of approximately 4.5% to 5.0% for the full year, which includes approximately 2.8% of carryforward pricing from fiscal 2023. As a reminder, we expect our pricing to moderate sequentially each quarter during the year. We anticipate opening two new Cracker Barrel Stores and nine to 11 new Maple Street stores during the year. We expect commodity inflation in the low single digits, and hourly restaurant wage inflation in the mid-single digits. As noted in the reconciliation table in our press release, our full year outlook also contemplates certain excluded expenses in addition to the non-cash amortization of gains from our sale leaseback. These include approximately $10 million in consulting fees related to our strategy transformation initiative that Julie will cover in a moment, approximately $10 million in one-time CEO transition costs and approximately $2 million in corporate restructuring charges. Our full year outlook also includes the benefit of a 53rd week this fiscal year. Taking all of this into account, we anticipate full year adjusted operating income of $130 million to $150 million. We also expect a full year GAAP effective tax rate of 2% to 5% and an adjusted effective tax rate of 7% to 10%, and capital expenditures of $120 million to $135 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Julie, so she may share additional details on her perspective and our business plans and areas of focus.\nJulie Masino: Thanks, Craig. I now want to provide some perspective on my initial impressions, my pillars for achieving long-term success and where we will focus in the coming months. Since joining the company in August, I've been busy meeting with the field and home office teams, understanding our challenges and opportunities, particularly as it relates to the near term and doing deep dives into our initiatives and financial plans. These past few months have reinforced my conviction that Cracker Barrel is an iconic and highly differentiated brand with a large and loyal guest base who love us and talented and dedicated teams who are passionate about our mission of pleasing people. Over the past 90 days, I've traveled the country with our field leadership teams and by myself, observing and interacting with guests and with team members at all levels, retail and restaurant, front of house and back of house. Over and over again, I've been struck by the enthusiasm and genuine affinity so many of our guests have for Cracker Barrel and the love they express for our brand. Multiple times, I've had guests and employees approach me unsolicited to share stories and express adoration about our food, our hospitality and our culture. These interactions were powerful reminders to me that this brand really is special and the foundation with which we have to work, including our traffic would be the envy of most in casual and family dining. Despite traffic declines on a relative basis, we still serve approximately 200 million guests a year, which offers us an equal number of opportunities to improve and grow. I'd now like to speak to the cornerstones that we will refer back to as we take advantage of these strengths. First, we need to be a brand that our guests absolutely love. For as many guests as we serve each day, many of them only visit us once or twice a year. The best way to drive growth is by making sure that their visits are truly wonderful so that they will dine with us more often, and we can only do this if we are executing with excellence and doing the small things well, every shift, day in and day out. This means providing friendly and efficient service and making sure guests orders are correct and come out quickly, retail product is on the floor and easy to access and the store is immaculately clean. While it may sound easy, it takes relentless focus across the organization to do this consistently. Our field teams are extraordinary, and they have been focused on these very things with a renewed sense of purpose and commitment and their efforts are paying off. I believe with the focused energy and support of the rest of the company, they can continue this trajectory and build on our momentum. Second, we need to improve our relevance. While we need to be our authentic selves and lean into our competitive advantages of hospitality, value and comfort, we must actively work to evolve both the brand and our business model in a brand-appropriate manner to meet an ever-changing consumer need. Among other things, this means improving our speed of service, ensuring our menu features craveable food at all three dayparts, making our physical stores more appealing to guests and employees and reducing friction for our guests and employees through a combination of operational and technological improvements. Our Cracker Barrel Rewards program is an example of this sort of technological investment and offers us a unique platform to maintain and grow our relevance across all guest cohorts. We believe the program will help us speak to guests in a more individualized fashion and offer compelling value tailored to their particular behaviors and needs and that it will be a key part of a virtuous cycle of actionable guest data and company response that should drive visitations and grow brand affinity. As I said, the response to this program has exceeded our expectations thus far, and we will continue investing in the program to accelerate the benefits we believe are out there. Finally, we need to deliver compelling shareholder returns. Cracker Barrel is a mature brand that has faced many challenges in recent years. And like all companies in full-service dining, we'll continue to face pressure going forward. While we need to and will control costs and maintain operational discipline to drive bottom line results, I firmly believe that the only way we can sustainably grow is through the top line. For this reason, we will continue investing in marketing our everyday value to guests who love us and to do so in the places we know they are, and investing in labor, particularly on weekends and at dinner, so that our guests have an experience that will make them want to return. As Craig referenced, we kicked off a strategic transformation initiative in late September. This initiative is data-driven and multi-phased and includes a comprehensive review of our business and a wide-ranging assessment of the near-term and long-term opportunities as well as identification and execution of these strategies and tactics to go after them. We've engaged a top-tier consulting firm to give us an impartial, external and expert perspective to identify and appropriately challenge our institutional assumptions and to bolster our internal capabilities. Our Board and our teams are actively engaged and leaning into this important initiative. We recently completed the initial diagnostic phase of this project and the findings have given us confidence that the actions we've already taken to address near-term traffic challenges, more and more effective marketing that highlights our everyday value in more relevant channels like college football, investing in front of house labor, particularly during those days and dayparts where we are either busiest or most challenged and leveraging a robust loyalty program are the right ones. Initial findings are also helping us evolve and refine our thinking about key parts of our business, including a need to focus on our dinner daypart and deploy additional technology to improve the employee and guest experience. Our strategic transformation project is intended to ensure we continue to evolve the business and play to our strengths and differentiators to drive long-term value creation, improve profitability and to win market share. This involves refining our brand strategies and positioning, identifying and prioritizing the most impactful growth drivers, defining required capabilities and enablers and last but not least, executing with excellence. We are in the early stages of this project, and I anticipate sharing more details with you over the next several months as we develop and begin to implement a longer-term plan that delivers on the three pillars I outlined earlier, being a brand that our guests love, maintaining and improving our relevance and delivering compelling shareholder returns. More to follow on subsequent calls. I'll now turn it over to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dennis Geiger with UBS. Please go ahead.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. I guess the first one, could we talk a little bit more about what you're seeing from your customers, what you saw in the quarter, perhaps even into the month of November from a customer standpoint. Anything as it relates to key customer cohorts, other behaviors worth calling out any notable changes, et cetera?\nCraig Pommells: Hi, Dennis.\nJulie Masino: Hi, Dennis, it's Julie. I'll take that one. Thanks so much for the question. I would say the environment out there really continues to be uncertain and mixed. But there have been some positives. It seems that a recession is potentially less likely, inflation continues to moderate and the consumer and labor market have been resilient. Those are the positives. However, there's been some reason for caution as well. The consumer sentiment has been declining in recent months and remains at relatively low levels. Labor market is cooling and savings accumulated during the pandemic are evaporating and debt burdens from higher interest rates. So with all that behind us and sort of in the landscape out there, we are encouraged by the monthly sequential improvements in our traffic. We believe that the investments that we've made to focus on the guest experience, to emphasize our strong value proposition across our dayparts, that was an important pivot in Q1. It had been accelerating the frequency and enhancing our business model and will continue to help us drive performance and win share in this very, very mixed environment.\nDennis Geiger: Appreciate that color, Julie, very helpful. I guess, the second one, just following up on that. As you talk about sort of some of the resiliency out there, little resistance to the pricing to date. But then you and Craig kind of talking about the tough environment and maybe gets worse from here from a macro perspective. Just wondering if there's any more context you could put around expectations over the balance of the year as we think about that macro environment, do you expect the consumer deteriorates from here? Very helpful that you gave the color around pricing for the year. But just anything more on kind of what's embedded in that sales algorithm, you've got a bunch of initiatives, but what you're thinking about your consumer from here? And maybe related to that, is there any context you can give thinking about last year's trends in recent months relative to this year? And is it sort of our underlying traffic trends improving over these last several months? Is there any kind of year-over-year dynamic to be thinking about? Thank you very much.\nCraig Pommells: Hi, Dennis, this is Craig. I'll dig into that one. The -- as we finished up our quarter four last year, we talked about an unexpected decline in our traffic. And then we talked about the things that we were going to be doing to bolster that. And I think we're on a really good path with the actions that we've taken. So at the time we talked about, we believe the environment was more promotional, we believe the consumer was a bit more pressured. And at the time, we also didn't have a whole lot of messaging. And now we have adjusted, we think, to the current environment appropriately, and that seems to be working for us. The environment is more promotional. That's what we're seeing in our results. The consumer is pressured but they haven't shut down. They're still dining out, they're making choices. And what was important to us was that we are top of mind. And in order to be top of mind, you have to communicate to folks and we've ramped up our communication, and we've also focused our communication around what we're calling kind of the core plus group, a lot of our traditional core plus elements of our growth segments that are closer to that core. You reach those folks in college football, NASCAR, things like that. And that is working for us. We're pleased with that outcome. So while the consumer environment may get a little bit better, may get a little bit worse, we don't know, but we do think we're well positioned, given the environment that we're in. Now towards the end of the year, we're going to be comping over Q4 that was particularly soft for us. I don't think we're prepared to say anything else more about that specifically, at this time, but we think we learned from that and we adapted and adjusted for it. The other point with that is Cracker Barrel is a particularly experiential brand. We serve a lot of guests, 200 million, three dayparts, breakfast, lunch and dinner. And we're known for a lot of things. But one of them is hospitality. And because of that, we have been investing more in labor to ensure that, one, we can deliver that hospitality and we are, and two, that we can really serve that kind of peak demand. So that's an investment that we're making in the short term for sure. Now one of the other benefits that you get from that is, that's also a better experience for the employees, and we're seeing turnover comes down. So as we think about, hey, how do all of these investments play out over time, one of the ways that it plays out is your turnover comes down and you actually get more efficient over time. So we're investing for the future. We're investing to grow our traffic in the short term. We think our investments are well timed for the environment. And we think over a period of time, that will also help our profitability.\nDennis Geiger: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Katherine Griffin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKatherine Griffin: Hi, thanks so much for the questions. First, I wanted to dive a little deeper into the promotional intensity that you mentioned. Is there any kind of differences in geographies or in specific subsegments you can speak to that you're seeing?\nJulie Masino: Hi, Katherine, it's Julie. I'll take that one. Yes. As we discussed in September on our last call, it's been really promotional out there from the competitors. So that really caused us, one, to take a look at what they were doing and what we were doing. As Craig just talked about, we really adjusted our messaging to ensure we were playing to our strength and our differentiators at Cracker Barrel because we are an all three daypart brand. So we wanted to make sure that our messaging really resonated with that core and the core plus guests across those three dayparts. Value messaging of our daypart messaging, value messaging around breakfast starting at $8.99, all of those things are really resonating well with our guests. The other thing that I spoke about in my prepared remarks that we're very heartened by is that, we made additional investments in testing some different marketing strategies throughout the quarter, one of which was college football, Craig talked about NASCAR. Those additional investments have returned quite well for us, both from a traffic and investment perspective. Additionally, we've invested in some local television advertising in some key markets. That has also provided a really strong return on investment and return on traffic that we've been pleased with. And we'll be constantly evaluating our marketing mix. The team has done a great job of digging in and looking at that to really drive efficiency as well as effectiveness with that core and core plus segment. So we remain optimistic about our ability to continue to evaluate and ramp effectiveness in that space as we move through the year.\nKatherine Griffin: Okay. Thank you. And then just following up on an earlier question, can you just help us frame sort of what the comps were by month in your fiscal second quarter of last year?\nCraig Pommells: Well, actually, I don't have -- we will follow up with you on that one. Weâ€™ll provide whatever detail we -- any details we can as it relates to what the comp is for last year.\nKatherine Griffin: Okay. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alton Stump with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAlton Stump: Iâ€™d ask first off, on the commodity inflation guidance, obviously, Craig, you mentioned that you were down 2.3% in the first quarter, but you are looking for a low single-digit increase for the full year. I guess, one, what are the key drivers behind that increase as far as inputs? And then any sort of color on kind of what the pace may be over the next few quarters of the year?\nCraig Pommells: Hi, Alton. The -- so Q1, we had deflation. We're kind of confident on peak inflation from the prior year. So that was good news. We do expect the commodity environment to be pretty good for the rest of the year. We don't expect it to be deflationary, though. I believe we've got some expectations out there for bacon as an example, to start to move back up. So we expect a much more modest commodity inflation through the rest of the year. You all know about beef. Beef has been high. We are -- beef's in our -- relatively high in our mix, but not towards the top. So as a result of that, we do expect mild commodity inflation for the rest of the year, but not deflation, in part because of the changes to bacon.\nAlton Stump: Understood. Thanks for that color. And then, I guess just one quick additional question. Just on the retail side of your business, obviously, a disappointing comp performance, I'm sure for you here in the first quarter. You're heading now into, of course, whatâ€™s the huge time of the year for that business. I guess, how are you feeling heading into the holiday season on the retail side of things?\nCraig Pommells: It's Craig again. We feel -- so -- let's give a little bit of background on retail. If we think about retail -- our retail business over the longer term since 2019, the retail business has outperformed pretty consistently, both in terms of sales and profit. So we're really proud of that business. We're proud of the work that the team has done. Now more recently, it's been softer. Now keep in mind that there is the retail -- it's completely discretionary. We are not selling essentials and the retail environment has kind of shifted from -- to the things that are more everyday essentials. And that's not really an area that's core to us. I think considering the environment, the retail business is holding up well. And so the team has made adjustments in terms of inventory. We've made those adjustments early. We've continued to make them to ensure that we have an appropriate level of profitability in the retail business as we move forward. So we think we're managing what we can manage there, given that consumers are shifting a bit more to what appears to be essentials. And largely, what we have are the things that people kind of want to have, but you don't necessarily need them on a day-to-day basis.\nAlton Stump: Sure. Thanks for that color. I appreciate it. Iâ€™ll hop back in the queue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jake Bartlett with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.\nJake Bartlett: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. My first one is also on the kind of near-term trends. And I think Craig and Julie, you both mentioned improving traffic throughout the quarter and into November. Can you share what the traffic was in the first quarter? I know it comes out with the Q, but if you could provide your traffic and mix and just so we can see what the trajectory is there.\nCraig Pommells: Absolutely, Jake. I'll take the numbers and then, we can go from there. Overall, traffic for Q1 was -- restaurant traffic negative 7.1%. Check overall, plus 6.6%, including price of 6.8% and mix of negative 0.2%.\nJake Bartlett: Okay. Got it. And just reading into the commentary on improving traffic by month and into November, it feels pretty safe to say that same-store sales moved to decently positive quarter-to-date. And this goes back to -- I'm going to ask it one more time about last year's trends. But at ICR last year, you gave preliminary second quarter revenue growth guidance of 6% and then you reported 8.3%. So I believe that, that implies that January was much stronger than expected, so very difficult compared to this year. So just -- we're trying to kind of judge how much we should read the current trends, which seem to be pretty decently positive on same-store sales for the restaurants for the whole quarter. So any help there would be helpful. And then I had a longer-term question.\nCraig Pommells: Yeah. This is Craig again, Jake. The [kind of dig] (ph) -- kind of reflecting on Q2 from last year, there are really two parts to that. If I remember correctly, December closed out a little bit softer. I believe there was some weather at the end of December. And then January had two kind of benefit components. One was a robust kind of wrap on Omicron. So some of the January beat is -- was Omicron related. It was also, I believe, a warmer than normal January. So there were some weather tailwind. It's always risky to try to forecast the weather. But I think to the degree that weather was a little bit of a tailwind last year in January, I do recall that December -- towards the second part of December was a bit challenged by weather as well.\nJake Bartlett: Okay. Okay. And then my other question is on margins. In the quarter itself, as you mentioned, your sales were in line with expectations internally. But you're at the lower end of guidance for margins. My question is, what drove that? What surprised you to the downside there on the margins. And as we look forward, you didn't explicitly give restaurant level margins or G&A guidance. But can you help us in terms of what is driving the expected kind of margin compression that's implied in guidance in '24. Is it the margin sign? Or is it G&A deleverage that you think is going to drive that?\nCraig Pommells: For this quarter, for quarter one, the -- as we were -- we had some hypothesis. It was data driven as we went into the quarter. But we weren't certain. So we were -- we started out with some additional advertising. We had largely committed to that, and we added some labor as well. We were seeing really good results from the advertising. We're seeing good results from the labor. And it also gave us more confidence in -- gave us more confidence in November. So as a result, we invested a bit more in labor than we had originally expected. We knew we had that out there as an option, but we went ahead and we did some more. And that, we think, played out well. Now things that we're unexpected or kind of came in on the -- on unfavorable side of our internal expectations, there were a couple of them. Wage rates came in a little bit higher, maintenance expenses came in a little bit higher, public liability -- general liability came in a little bit higher. So we had a couple of things that kind of didn't -- that were on a high end of the cost range. But the primary driver was, we were making a bet. It was working. And we just continued down that path because we were seeing a lot of good impacts from that. So what does that mean then for the rest of the year? I won't go into a whole lot of detail there. I will say just directionally, we -- the things that we've been doing that are working, probably to continue to do those. So where advertising has been working to a greater degree. So I would expect that we're going to continue to do more advertising. Now we try to measure all of that best we can. We do some test and learn. And as long as the ROI and that remains compelling, I would expect that we're going to continue to do that. The labor investment is also -- has also been working out well, not only in terms of the short-term traffic and our ability to really execute at peak periods, but you see a benefit to guest satisfaction, you see a benefit to turnover, which pays a dividend in the future. So we'll continue to invest in those things as we go throughout the year.\nJake Bartlett: Okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf with CL King. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Wolf: Good morning. My question is also guidance related. Actually two. First, on earnings, the implication of your guidance is better margins going forward for the next three quarters. So you called out that the advertising increase is going to continue as well as labor because it's driving traffic. But I might have missed this, but could you go through the -- if you're still expecting $30 million cost -- net cost savings -- gross cost savings this year to help defray some of that cost? And if that's the case, what the cadence of those cost savings would be against the increased spend that's helping with the traffic?\nCraig Pommells: Hi, Andrew, it's Craig. The -- I'll start with the cost saves. We talked about $30 million of the cost saves last fiscal. And we delivered on that. I think we started with $25 million in that, we increased it to $30 million over the course of the year. We actually have an internal target for cost saves in fiscal '24. That's consistent. It's not higher than that. However, we also realized that we're making a lot of investments. So it felt a little odd for us to be talking about a cost save. At the same time, we're spending a lot of money in labor, spending a lot of money in marketing. So the way that we are thinking about it internally is we're saving costs significantly more than we did last year. We're reinvesting those cost saves as a way to support these guest drive-in initiatives and overall long-term business strengthening initiatives.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay. That's good. Can you speak to the cadence? I mean, have you realized in first quarter like a pro rata amount? Or is it going to build more proportionately later in the year, the amount of cost savings?\nCraig Pommells: The cost savings, I don't have the exact quarterly breakdown in front of me, but because we have a program that is a sustained program, a number of the cost savings that we started in fiscal '23, we didn't get 12 months of those cost saves in '23. So there's quite a bit that was carried through into fiscal '24. And then we have additional cost savings queued up in '24 as well.\nAndrew Wolf: Okay. And on the sales guidance, I just want to test the way my numbers sort of back into what I think your scenarios could be. It's a pretty broad sales guidance for the year from here. So I think you're anywhere from things could continue to get better as I assume as you hopefully, you're -- well, one of your plans at least. But then there's a scenario where it looks like things would actually get worse and perhaps even worse than the quarter you just announced. Is that because you have to bake in the -- even though -- I think Julie mentioned the recessionary odds are lower that given consumer behavior, and we're not out of the woods in the economy that you just have to put in a pessimistic scenario and you decided to also include that in your sales guidance range.\nCraig Pommells: I think that's a reasonable point of view. The economy is uncertain. So who knows what's going to happen. And I think to the extent that things continue to play out the way that we're seeing them, we would be towards the high end of the range. But to the degree that they don't, either from an external perspective or something happens internally would be on the low end of the range. The macro environment, it's still volatile and the overall economy has been doing well. But if you can dig below that, there are some concerning elements there. So we'll just need to kind of see how it goes and as a result, we're still pretty early in the year. As a result of that, we think that leads to that type of a range.\nAndrew Wolf: Thank you. And maybe just more for Julie, on the loyalty program, it's good to hear the launch is well -- going well. And I think you've got to tie into Dolly Parton through early December with the rocking chair giveaway. But is there any way to continue to -- or is that sort of when the relationship with Dolly kind of repeat or ends? And do you have more things to keep the -- or are you going to keep it going with her? Like to keep these -- getting the sign-ups at a pretty good clip above your plan. And I guess, longer term, based on your experience and what you're hearing from your -- people who are helping you with the program. When do you really expect to really see increased traffic through promotion, really targeted promotions and the other things that can come out of loyalty program?\nJulie Masino: Hi, Andrew, it's Julie. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are really pleased with the launch of the program. We launched the program actually without Dolly, right? And so even when we launched it, guests embraced the program, signed up, really told us that this is something they're excited about seeing from Cracker Barrel. So then when we added on Dolly that, as I said in my comments, it's been incremental. And of course, we're very pleased with the partnership there. She's an icon, and it's great to have an icon -- pair up with an icon of Cracker Barrel. So the program is off to a great start. It's exceeding our expectations, but we've been modeling in the benefit of that program into this year and into the future. And we -- the team continues to do a great job to actually bring benefits of the program forward given the fact that we are ahead of our plan. So we continue to be excited about it. It's the early days of it, but we know it's going to be a differentiator for us going forward and an exciting part of the brand, as we move forward.\nAndrew Wolf: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Brooks with The Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.\nTodd Brooks: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First question, if I may. You were talking in regards to the retail segment, well-managed inventories and really trying to operate as much for protection of gross profit dollars than you are to drive top line. Can you spend a minute talking about the inventory positioning and how we should think about if that's a potential constraint on retail same-store sales as we're going into the holiday quarter here? And just trying to get some color around how to model retail same-store sales performance given where the inventories lie?\nCraig Pommells: Hi, Todd, it's Craig. I think we're really well positioned there. We have -- we carry a very wide assortment. So to the degree that demand is higher than we projected that would impact our kind of discount cadence, and we'd be able to think make more margin through that approach. And to the degree that demand stays a bit softer, we would also be managing margins as well. And keep in mind, we also have a lot of different offers. We go through quite a few themes throughout the year. So if one of them is selling at a higher rate than we projected, we can bring in another one earlier. There are different things that we can do to fill in just given the breadth of the assortment that we have. I think the macro picture on this part of retail really gives us confidence that we're making the right decision to manage the inventory and not end up very long and then having to do a significant amount of -- a significant amount of markdowns. But that would be a problem, candidly, that we would love to have that problem because to the degree that we have the demand, I think we can redirect folks to other items.\nTodd Brooks: Okay, great. Thanks, Craig. And then two others, if I can. On the occupancy and other costs, you pointed out on a year-over-year basis, the incremental advertising and some incremental D&A and you pointed to the advertising, working, driving a return, layering in some local TV. What's the right way to think about that line item going forward? Is the spend that we saw in the first quarter kind of that just above mid 24% of sales level. Is that the right way to model this line and what we could call an investment year or maybe some more offensive spending around marketing?\nCraig Pommells: I think it's fair to say that the advertising line item is going to be a bit higher. I'm not going to assure an exact number, candidly, in part because we're going to continue to flex that based on our findings, but I would expect it to be higher. There is also a part of the loyalty program. It's not dramatic, but there is a part of the loyalty expense for the loyalty program that goes through marketing. So that will cause that line item to be a bit higher. And then we're going to continue to optimize our profitability of our normal media to the degree that, that's working really well as we're getting a compelling return. We'll do more to the degree that we are not seen as compelling of a return, not as profitable, then we may do less. But in general, I would expect marketing to be higher than it's been traditionally for the coming quarters.\nTodd Brooks: So to just clarify on that, if we're looking year-over-year, up 130 basis points, are you saying, Craig, that because of the success you've seen, you expect marketing to actually be higher as we progress through the year as far as -- okay.\nCraig Pommells: No, Iâ€™ll just -- so of the 130 basis points in Q1, I believe marketing was something like 80 basis points, something like that of the Q1. So I'm not suggesting that we're going to be investing incrementally more than that. Maybe we do, but it would be modest. So it could be a little bit more than that, it could be a little bit less. But I don't think our marketing spend will be as a percent of sales at the levels it were -- it was at in 2023. It's going to be higher as a percent of sales, moving into 2024 than it was in 2023.\nTodd Brooks: Okay. Perfect. And then it looks like ex the one-time expenditures in the quarter, the G&A came in a little bit more efficiently than I expected. Would you encourage us to budget that type of mid-5s percentage of sales? And then what's the cadence of the CEO transition cost and the strategic initiative costs, how do those come in over the balance of the year? Thanks.\nCraig Pommells: I don't expect anything dramatic as it relates to G&A. And I probably wouldn't get into a lot of detail there. In terms of the cadence of the one-time costs, I do expect that there will be more of that expense related to the CEO transition in Q2 because of the accounting for really, Sandy, prior CEO has earned retirement benefits. She officially retired as a CEO early in Q2, and as a result of that, I think that will drive some more expense in Q2. I expect the consultant cost to be fairly flat going forward from Q2 through Q4. We didn't -- we started at midpoint -- at about the midpoint in Q1. So would expect Q3 and Q4 to be relatively flat for that line item.\nTodd Brooks: Okay, great. Thanks, Craig.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Aisling Grueninger with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nAisling Grueninger: Hi, good morning. My question is on Maple Street. On the last earnings call, it was mentioned that Maple Street weekdays were still challenged. We're just wondering you've seen any improvements in that and how you're thinking about the growth of Maple Street over the course of the year?\nCraig Pommells: Hi, Aisling, this is Craig. The Maple Street, interestingly, over the course of the quarter, we have seen really solid traffic improvements at Maple Street. The weekdays do continue to be -- do continue to be softer. But instead, we've actually doubled down on the weekends. We've extended our operating hours on the weekends because the demand is so high, and we're seeing really good progress there, particularly for weekend lunch. As we think about the long term, we're really excited about the business. It's a differentiated business. We like the location strategy. It's complementary to Cracker Barrel. And at the same time, and we're continuing to grow it. We were a bit behind it opening this quarter. That was more a function of construction delays than anything else. And we're continuing to grow the business at a moderate pace, but we also realize that there is more work to do on the business model, in particular on the weekdays. So we've seen some improvement on the weekdays, but we've actually seen more improvement over the weekend, so which is a positive, but we still need to do some more on the weekdays.\nAisling Grueninger: Thatâ€™s great to hear. Thanks, Iâ€™ll pass it back.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Julie Masino for any closing remarks.\nJulie Masino: Thank you all for joining us today. We're encouraged by our improved traffic trend and our start to Q2. And while we are mindful of the competitive and uncertain environment in which we continue to operate, we are cautiously optimistic that we will sustain this momentum and drive improved performance over the balance of the year. We have a lot of work ahead of us to achieve our objectives, but we have a strong foundation in place, and I'm confident that our talented teams are up for the challenge. Before we sign off, I'd like to wish you all a happy holiday season and express my sincere appreciation to our more than 70,000 employees not only for their hard work over Thanksgiving last week, but for the warm welcome they have extended to me, since joining the Cracker Barrel family and for all they do every day, every shift to delight our guests and to bring this great brand to life. Thank you all and happy holidays.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."
